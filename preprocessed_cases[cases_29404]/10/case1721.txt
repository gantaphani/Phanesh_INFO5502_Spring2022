this toxic tort lawsuit by plaintiffs went to a jury trial against defendants the state of california the state,southern pacific transportation company union pacific,and optical coating laboratory,ocli.the trial was marked by repeated objections,sustained by the court,that plaintiffs attorneys were violating its in limine orders.ultimately,after warning the attorneys that they were risking a mistrial and exposing themselves to substantial sanctions,the court declared a mistrial based on their cumulative misconduct.
following the mistrial,the trial court took the following actions from which these consolidated appeals were taken awarded all defendants a combined total of in attorney fees and costs as sanctions against plaintiffs attorneys reconsidered and granted dispositive motions by ocli and the state that had been denied before trial commenced and made a separate award to the state of in attorney fees and in expert witness fees jointly and severally against all plaintiffs.
finding no legal basis for the attorney fees,costs,and expert witness fees awarded as sanctions against plaintiffs and their attorneys,we reverse those awards.we also reverse the judgment in favor of ocli.we affirm the judgment in favor of the state,and the expert fee award made to the state under code of civil procedure section.
factual and procedural background 
overview of plaintiffs allegations 
plaintiffs are individuals who have all lived or worked in the west college avenue neighborhood of santa rosa.in,plaintiffs learned that the private water wells they used for drinking water had been contaminated with trichlorethylene tce and perchlorethylene pce.they eventually retained the law firm of gonzalez robinson to investigate the cause of the contamination and pursue compensation from those responsible.plaintiffs claimed that the contamination caused them to suffer both economic losses and a wide range of adverse health effects.
in,plaintiffs sued the city of santa rosa,the county of sonoma,the state,union pacific,ocli,and several entities that formerly owned or operated dry cleaning businesses near the west college avenue neighborhood.the trial was bifurcated into liability and damages phases.just prior to jury selection in the liability phase,all of the solvent the state,union pacific,and with plaintiffs.
the relevant facts and allegations pertaining to these three defendants may be summarized as follows 
union pacific owned a nine and acre parcel of land,known as frances street,located approximately mile northeast of the west college avenue neighborhood.beginning in,the frances street property and a smaller adjacent property,briggs avenue,had been leased for use by a succession of scrap metal recyclers and auto wreckers.in,the north coast regional water quality control board water board discovered that the frances street site was contaminated with leaking drums,old batteries,large quantities of shredded metal,and aboveground and underground storage tanks.ultimately,both sites were found to be highly contaminated with tce,pce,and other toxic chemicals.plaintiffs alleged that those contaminants seeped into the groundwater beneath the sites and ultimately migrated into plaintiffs wells,contributing to their contamination.
ocli has maintained a facility in santa rosa since the.ocli developed thin film coating processes for government and industry,and created products at its santa rosa facility that use high performance optical thin films to manage light,such as solar cell covers on satellites,camera lenses,and mirrors used in copiers and scanners.in the process of creating certain of its products,ocli used various industrial solvents,including acetone,pce,tce,trichorethane tca,and freon.plaintiffs allege that ocli disposed of over drums containing toxic wastes,including pce and tce,at the frances street site.they allege that these contaminants migrated from that site onto their properties and into their well water.
plaintiffs allegations linking ocli to the site were based in part on three internal water board memoranda.two of the memos,written in,purported to summarize conversations with an anonymous tipster who claimed that as an employee of donald kessler,the owner of an auto wrecking yard leasing the briggs avenue site,he had transported a truckload of drums from ocli to be dumped at the site in approximately.according to the memo,the tipster reported that,at kessler instruction,he had emptied the drums liquid contents on the ground before dumping them.he had seen a total of approximately drums at ocli ready for disposal on that occasion.the third memo,written two years later,purported to summarize a telephone conversation between a water board staffer and kessler according to that handwritten memo,kessler stated that drums were in fact either picked up or delivered to his site from ocli and that,although the drums were supposed to be empty because they were to be used by him for storage of metal waste,some of the drums probably had liquid in them and employees were always paying attention to the matter.
according to plaintiffs,the state liability arises vicariously from the failure of certain water board employees to immediately notify local officials in july,after the water board issued a cleanup and abatement order for the frances street site,that the contamination of that site was likely to cause substantial injury to the public health or safety within the meaning of health and safety code section,subdivision b 
pretrial motions 
the state summary judgment motion and motion for judgment on the pleadings 
the state moved for summary judgment in january,asserting that health and safety code section imposed a mandatory duty on certain state employees but not on the state itself,section could not create tort liability because the injuries claimed by plaintiffs were not actionable under the california tort claims act and the undisputed evidence showed that no water board employee violated a mandatory duty to disclose under health and safety code section.the trial court denied the state motion,finding that p laintiffs raise triable material issues of fact,specifically showing that the moving party possessed information requiring it to provide warnings earlier,and to more people,than it did.this court denied the state ensuing petition for a writ of mandate overturning the trial court decision,without issuing a written opinion.
in july,the state reiterated the purely legal arguments raised in its summary judgment motion by means of a motion for judgment on the pleadings.in addition,the state asserted one new legal it was immune from liability under health and safety code section,subdivision b the court,with a different judge presiding,denied that motion as well.
ocli summary judgment motion 
ocli also moved for summary judgment,arguing among other things that there was no evidence it had ever sent hazardous wastes to the frances street or briggs avenue sites.ocli relied on the declaration of ken pietrelli,a company,acknowledging that ocli had sold empty scrap drums and drums containing scrap metal to west coast of the scrap metal dealers leasing the sites in and but denied that ocli had ever sent or disposed of any drums containing chemicals to west coast metals.in opposition,plaintiffs sought judicial notice of the and water board staff memos recounting information provided by the anonymous tipster and by david kessler.over ocli hearsay objection,the trial court took judicial notice of the existence of the documents,and denied ocli motion for summary judgment.
ocli in limine motions 
as the trial date approached,ocli made a number of in limine motions.ocli moved to exclude as double hearsay all mention of the and water board internal memoranda.in opposition to these motions,plaintiffs merely asserted in one sentence that the challenged documents have been admitted by court.in support of that proposition,plaintiffs attached the order made in connection with ocli summary judgment motion,in which a different trial judge had granted plaintiffs request that it take judicial notice of the memoranda existence.notwithstanding the earlier ruling,the court granted ocli motions in limine as to these memos on april.
ocli also moved before trial to exclude evidence that the groundwater beneath its own facility was contaminated,on the ground that such evidence was irrelevant to whether it improperly disposed of hazardous waste,and was unduly prejudicial under evidence code section.plaintiffs argued that the evidence was relevant to proving that ocli was the source of the contamination found at frances street since the chemicals found at the two locations were assertedly identical.the trial court found the evidence to be inadmissible under evidence code section.
ocli first motion to dismiss 
after the court granted ocli in limine motions,ocli moved to dismiss the case against it,arguing that the court rulings had excluded the only evidence of its liability.in response,plaintiffs argued that the following evidence,to be adduced at trial,would be sufficient to support an inference that chemicals originating at ocli had found their way into the groundwater underneath the frances street and briggs avenue sites ken pietrelli admission in his declaration in support of ocli summary judgment motion that ocli had delivered used drums to west coast metals during the and the opinion of plaintiffs expert,lorne everett,based on an april ocli environmental report,that the chemical solvents ocli had formerly used were consistent with those discovered at the briggs avenue and frances street tce,freon,and acetone everett anticipated testimony that this mixture of chemicals is rare and somewhat unique to the industrial activity that occurred at ocli a water board report stating that drums containing hazardous chemicals had been found at the sites and the asserted fact that ocli could not identify any other possible source for the contamination found at the sites.
the trial court reluctantly denied ocli motion to dismiss without prejudice to ocli raising the same issues by way of a motion for nonsuit at the appropriate time.the court explained that it would feel more comfortable deciding the issues after plaintiffs had a chance to put in all of their admissible evidence concerning ocli.
c.the mistrial 
before trial commenced,union pacific had filed a motion in limine precluding any party in the liability phase of the trial from referring to plaintiffs alleged damages,including their chemical exposure level,medical conditions,or the extent or nature of their personal injuries or property damage hereafter mil.union pacific proposed order on mil included a provision that if plaintiffs violated the order and a mistrial resulted,the court shall impose a monetary sanction upon plaintiffs counsel in an amount equaling the cost of union pacific attorneys fees incurred from the date the trial commences to the date of any mistrial.
plaintiffs opposed both the substantive and sanctions provisions of the proposed order.the trial court granted mil,subject to the qualification that plaintiffs would be allowed to introduce evidence during the liability phase that their wells were contaminated.this ruling came in response to plaintiffs argument that some evidence of harm had to be allowed because harm was an element of their negligence liability causes of action against defendants.the court accordingly modified the written order submitted by union pacific to allow evidence that plaintiffs wells had been contaminated.at the hearing on the motions,the state requested that it also be awarded attorney fees as sanctions if plaintiffs violated the proposed order.without being more specific,the court responded that the order on mil hereafter in limine order would apply to everybody in the case.however,the court made no change in the wording of the submitted order to broaden its application in any respect.
after the trial began,plaintiffs counsel and witnesses violated a series of in limine and other pretrial court orders,culminating in the declaration of a mistrial before plaintiffs were able to complete their.plaintiffs counsel first clashed with the court during jury selection on may,by bringing a visibly disabled minor plaintiff to the courthouse and positioning him in front of the jury panel as they entered the courtroom.this violated an in limine order generally excluding minors from the courtroom.on may and,while under questioning by plaintiffs counsel,everett offered testimony on three occasions that violated in limine orders and drew objections.
on may,plaintiffs counsel,keith robinson,who was already on notice of the court heightened concern about violations of its orders,began asking one of the plaintiffs about the fact that she had to begin paying for water from the city after her well was found to be contaminated.union pacific counsel objected based on in limine order and the parties held an unreported sidebar conversation.as soon as the parties went back on the record in the presence of the jury,robinson asked the witness whether she had suffered harm or loss from having to buy the city water.this further violation of in limine order drew an immediate objection from union pacific counsel.the trial court sustained the objection,excused the jury for the day,and informed robinson in strong terms that the court was out of patience with his violation of its orders,and that he seemed to be deliberately inviting a mistrial as well as a citation for contempt.robinson apologized for his question and the court accepted his apology.at the same time,the court warned robinson to be very,very careful because the cumulative prejudice from violating the court orders was starting to reach the level where a mistrial might be required,at which point counsel would owe the opposing parties a large amount of money because that the order of the court.
on may,the court warned robinson during a colloquy that the next time he asked a question that invited a witness into an area covered by a motion in limine he would be risking a mistrial,contempt citation,and an attorney fee sanctions award under in limine order.the last straw for the court occurred the next day during the examination of kenneth pietrelli by robinson cocounsel,charles cochran.cochran asked pietrelli about the water board investigation of ocli disposal practices,an area that the court had specifically declared off limits in an oral ruling made on may.at that point,the court invited the defense to bring an oral motion for a mistrial,which they did.all of the defendants also joined in an oral motion for an award of fees against plaintiffs counsel pursuant to in limine order.the court granted both motions and set a date for a hearing on the amount of defendants fees and costs.in making these rulings,the court observed that it had never seen a case where the court orders were so blatantly disobeyed.
before the date set for the hearing,defendants submitted a letter to the court calling its attention to issues regarding a trial court authority to award attorney fees as sanctions in connection with a mistrial.the letter proposed that the parties be given an opportunity to brief the issue of attorney fees as sanctions,and further advised that defendants would be asking the court to reconsider its rulings on their prior dispositive motions.at the hearing,the trial court informed robinson and cochran that it was going to cite them for contempt,invited defendants to bring their own motions for sanctions under section and in limine order,advised that on its own motion it was going to reconsider its rulings on the state motion for summary judgment and ocli motion to dismiss,and set a briefing schedule and combined hearing date for the order to show cause re contempt and other motions.union pacific and ocli filed separate motions for sanctions,and ocli and the state also joined in union pacific motion based on in limine order.ocli filed a renewed motion to dismiss and the state filed a renewed motion for summary judgment.
d.the court rulings 
following a hearing held on august,the trial court made the following rulings sanctions for attorney fees and costs were appropriate as to all defendants under in limine order fees and costs were recoverable jointly and severally from cochran,robinson and gonzalez robinson in the amounts of for union pacific,for ocli,and for the state ocli award also included sanctions under section because the case against it lacked evidentiary support ocli was entitled to the dismissal of plaintiffs claims against it the state was entitled to summary judgment and cochran and robinson were found to be in contempt of court 
after its summary judgment motion was granted,the state moved for a further award of its defense costs from the plaintiffs,including expert witness fees,under sections and.the trial court granted the state motion for defense costs,awarding the state in attorney fees under section,and in expert witness and severally against all both sections and.
robinson,gonzalez robinson,and cochran timely appealed from the sanctions awards case nos.and.plaintiffs filed separate appeals from the granting of ocli motion to dismiss case no.the state motion for summary judgment case no.and the state motion for defense costs case no.we consolidated the five appeals.
ii.discussion 
fee awards based on in limine order 
the court found that it had the power to award fees as sanctions under in limine order on three grounds its inherent powers under section,judicial estoppel in that plaintiffs counsel did not object to the order after it was made applicable to all parties,and because all of the parties agreed to permit attorney fees as a sanction for causing a mistrial as long as it was applicable to both sides.plaintiffs counsel take issue with each stated basis for the court award.
court inherent authority 
the trial court believed it had the statutory authority to enforce the attorney fee provision of in limine order under sections and,subdivision a the court reasoned that section gives courts broad inherent powers in complex cases to fashion new procedures to manage and control the litigation.see cottle superior court th,d.in particular,because this case involved complex scientific issues,many parties,and a lengthy phased trial,the court believed it had the inherent power to make orders ensuring that relevant evidence was introduced at the appropriate time and in a nonprejudicial manner.by virtue of section,subdivision a,the court believed it had the power to back up its orders by imposing monetary sanctions,including attorney fees,for their violation.
plaintiffs counsel rely primarily on bauguess paine cal d,bauguess,which reversed an award of attorney fees imposed as a sanction on an attorney for causing a mistrial.id.at.the bauguess court in fact held specifically that a court inherent power to exercise supervisory control over judicial proceedings does not include the power to award attorney fees as a sanction for attorney misconduct absent specific legislative authorization or agreement of the parties.id.at,see also,olmstead arthur gallagher cal th,d,olmstead bauguess held that trial courts may not award attorney fees as a sanction for misconduct unless they do so pursuant to statutory authority or an agreement of the parties commercial investors,firmaterr,th,d in partial reliance on bauguess,invalidating rule of court that permitted courts to impose attorney fees in situations not specifically authorized by statute.
the rationale for the supreme court holding in bauguess was that allowing the trial courts to impose attorney fees as sanctions for attorney misconduct without statutory protections would undermine due process and threaten the independence of the bar it would be both unnecessary and unwise to permit trial courts to use fee awards as sanctions apart from those situations authorized by statute.if an attorney conduct is disruptive of court processes or disrespectful of the court itself,there is ample power to punish the misconduct as contempt.moreover,unlike the power advocated by respondent,a court inherent power to punish contempt has been tempered by legislative enactment to provide procedural safeguards.citations.among these safeguards is the opportunity,in cases where the contempt occurs out of the immediate view and presence of the court,to disqualify the judge additionally,the legislature has limited the penalty for civil contempt to five days in jail and a fine.citations.absent such safeguards,serious due process problems would result were trial courts to use their inherent power,in lieu of the contempt power,to punish misconduct by awarding attorney fees to an opposing party or counsel.the use of courts inherent power to punish misconduct by awarding attorney fees may also imperil the independence of the bar and thereby undermine the adversary system.bauguess,supra,cal d at.
as an initial matter,we note that the trial court in this case held that bauguess had been superseded by the enactment of section and was no longer controlling.we do not agree with the court analysis.section,which authorizes the imposition of monetary expense sanctions,including attorney fees,for bad faith actions or tactics,was superseded for actions filed on or after january,by section.the latter statute provides a more limited authorization for the imposition of fees as sanctions for the filing of improper signed pleadings,subd.a.although it is true that the legislature enacted section to broaden the power of trial courts to award monetary sanctions in response to bauguess see olmstead,supra,cal th at,d,the statute only superseded bauguess and supplied legislative authorization for the type of fee award invalidated in the bauguess case for cases filed within the limited time window during which it was in effect,between and.rather than undermining bauguess,the adoption of section shows the legislature acceptance of its core holding that trial courts may not award attorney fees as a sanction for misconduct absent statutory authority or an agreement of the parties.bauguess continued viability is shown by its application after the adoption of section.see sheller superior court th,d reversing fee award against attorney for misleading communication with prospective class members,supra,th at,d.
sections and plainly do not authorize the fee awards made in this case to the extent they are based on counsel asserted violation of in limine order.section has no application to cases filed on or after january,while section applies solely to attorney misconduct in the filing or advocacy of groundless claims made in signed pleadings and other papers,subd.b.equally,sections,subdivision a and,relied upon by the court,can not supply the type of statutory authorization required under bauguess.these generic statements of the court powers to formulate suitable procedures and command obedience to its orders do not by their own terms authorize any specific form of attorney sanction,much less impose the type of procedural safeguards that the bauguess court found essential.
defendants rely on stephen slesinger,walt disney th,d slesinger,a case that distinguished bauguess and in upholding the trial court inherent authority to impose terminating sanctions for egregious discovery abuses.slesinger,at,fn,d.defendants argue that if a court has the inherent authority to dismiss a case in appropriate circumstances,it must also have the authority to include provisions in its pretrial orders to encourage compliance with those orders.but slesinger involved extreme discovery abuse by a party,including the theft of confidential and privileged documents.id.at,d.under those circumstances,where any sanction short of dismissal would have deprived the opposing party of a fair trial,the slesinger panel found that the trial court did have the inherent power to dismiss.id.at,d.in support of its position,the panel cited statutory language in which the legislature had expressly acknowledged the inherent power of courts to dismiss.id.at,d,citing,subd.m.in contrast,citing bauguess and,the slesinger court was careful to point out that the inherent authority to sanction for egregious misconduct does not include the power to award attorney fees to punish that misconduct.id.at,fn,d,italics added.thus,slesinger directly refutes defendants argument that the court had the inherent power to impose attorney fees as a sanction for violating in limine order.
defendants also argue that bauguess is inapplicable because,unlike that case,the fees here were imposed for violation of a pretrial court order.according to defendants,the issue of whether the court had the authority to enter an in limine order with a provision prior to trial,and to enforce such pretrial order,was not addressed in bauguess and related cases.here,unlike bauguess,the issuance of the pretrial order gave counsel ample notice that fees could be awarded for causing a mistrial.
defendants narrow reading of bauguess makes little sense.if a court could grant itself the power to award fees as sanctions merely by issuing a pretrial order,much of bauguess reasoning would have to be cast aside.the bauguess court began its analysis of the court inherent powers to award fees as sanctions from the premise that our courts normally follow the traditional american rule that each side bears its own attorney fees,and that nonstatutory departures from that practice have been recognized only infrequently after careful analysis and a finding that compelling reasons of public policy warranted such an award.bauguess,supra,cal d at.allowing courts to freely suspend or displace the traditional rule by pretrial no comparable analysis or seem to clash directly with that premise.further,the bauguess court was concerned that sanctions would lack the appropriate safeguards and guidelines developed following a thorough investigation that only the legislative process could provide.id.at,quoting young redman d.again,holding that a court may give itself the ad hoc authority to impose as a sanction without safeguards or guidelines seems flatly inconsistent with bauguess reasoning.
for these reasons,we hold that the trial court award of attorney fees against plaintiffs counsel for their asserted violation of in limine order was neither within the court inherent powers nor authorized by statute.
judicial estoppel and agreement of the parties 
the trial court also believed it could impose the sanctions award based on judicial estoppel and agreement of the parties because plaintiffs counsel assertedly requested and the court agreed that the order would be made applicable to all parties.we do not believe that the record in this case supports either theory.
plaintiffs counsel submitted written opposition to mil,including its sanctions provision.plaintiffs position was understandable.union pacific had made no secret of the fact that the motion and sanctions provision were aimed exclusively at plaintiffs.the motion stated objective was to restrain plaintiffs from introducing evidence that union pacific considered to be highly prejudicial,although the proposed order itself precluded such evidence from being admitted without regard to the party offering it.for its part,the proposed sanctions provision addressed only one possible pacific recovery of its fees from plaintiffs counsel in the event the latter violated the order and a mistrial was declared.
it is true that the issue of the order in favor of union pacific did come up at the hearing on the parties in limine motions.however,this issue was only raised several minutes after the trial court had in fact already granted union pacific motion,and it was raised by the state,not by plaintiffs at that time,the following colloquy occurred 
counsel for the state also,again,not to retrace steps,but we joined in mil.and in union pacific motion one of the remedies they asked for was their attorneys fees and a mistrial if plaintiffs violated that motion.i just want to make clear that when the court issues its ruling,that we included in that,too.and if a mistrial occurs because of misconduct by plaintiffs in bringing in damages issues or other second phase issues we would like to recover our attorneys fees as well.
the court well,just to clarify,in terms of the orders that the court going to impose,it going to be plaintiffs shall be precluded,or defense shall be precluded from bringing up this evidence.because it happens to be your motion or ocli motion or union pacific motion or the plaintiffs concern,that going to apply to everybody in the case.
plaintiffs counsel well,should the preclusion orders not just be plaintiffs,but also be defendants are precluded from 
the court oh,absolutely.italics added.
despite the court comments during this colloquy,the only written modification the court made to union pacific proposed order was to add some handwritten language allowing plaintiffs to introduce evidence of well contamination.
a number of conclusions may be drawn from this record.first,contrary to defendants contention,plaintiffs never requested that in limine order be modified to provide that plaintiffs could obtain their fees if a defendant violated the order and caused a mistrial.the state was the only party to request that the sanctions provision be broadened to cover parties other than union pacific.its request was not that the sanctions clause be reciprocal between plaintiffs and defendants,but only that it operate in favor of the state as well as union pacific.plaintiffs counsel offered one comment during this colloquy.that comment did not refer to the sanctions provision of in limine order nor was it even directed to that order in particular.plaintiffs simply requested that all of the preclusion orders being entered that day preclude defendants as well as plaintiffs from introducing prohibited evidence.the court readily agreed to that but,as to in limine order at least,no change was necessary to the proposed order because union pacific had already drafted it to bar any party from introducing damages evidence during the liability phase of the trial.
second,plaintiffs never agreed that the order would be acceptable if it allowed them to recover their fees in the event one of the defendants caused a mistrial.nothing in the record shows that such a proposal was ever initiated by or put to plaintiffs counsel,or that counsel ever accepted it.
third,the trial court never in fact indicated on the record that it was modifying union pacific proposed in limine order to reflect the type of reciprocal sanctions clause that defendants claim plaintiffs sought or accepted.the court never responded on the record to the substance of the state request that the sanctions clause cover the state attorney fees,never stated that it intended to widen the scope of the sanctions clause to apply in favor of all parties,and never changed the written order to reflect any such modification even though it did modify that order in another respect agreed to by the parties.
fourth,even assuming contrary to the record that plaintiffs counsel italicized comment ante may plausibly be taken as an implied request that the sanctions clause be made reciprocal,that would still not establish plaintiffs acquiescence in the remedy.faced with an objectionable order,a party may act defensively to lessen the impact of the error without waiving it for purposes of appellate review.electronic equipment express,donald seiler d.see also park city services,ford motor,th,d attorney who properly objects to an erroneous ruling does not waive the error by endeavoring to make the best of a bad situation for which he was not responsible.in this regard,plaintiffs counsel cite the somewhat analogous case of levine pollack th,d.there,the trial court advised the plaintiff that it would grant her request for a continuance of the trial only on the improper condition that she agree to pay the defendants attorney fees for trial preparation.id.at,d.the plaintiff reluctantly agreed,believing she had no choice in the matter.ibid.upon the plaintiff appeal from a later order awarding fees against her,the court of appeal rejected the defendants argument that the plaintiff was estopped by her agreement from objecting to the fees.the plaintiff comments did not operate as an estoppel,according to the appellate court,because her agreement was made reluctantly and in the mistaken belief that the court had the authority to order the fees as condition for a continuance.id.at,d.
since the sanctions provision of in limine order was unauthorized by statute and not within the court inherent authority,and because there is no plausible evidence in the record that plaintiffs counsel ever agreed to the provision or forfeited objection to it by estoppel,we will reverse the three attorney fee awards defendants obtained based on that order 
ocli dismissal 
plaintiffs contend that the trial court committed the following prejudicial errors in granting ocli renewed motion to dismiss excluding the anonymous tipster and kessler memos written by water board staff,excluding evidence of the contamination found at ocli own facility,and failing to recognize that even without the excluded material plaintiffs had sufficient evidence to support a jury verdict against ocli although the issue is a close one,we agree with plaintiffs on the latter point as discussed post,and will reverse the judgment in ocli favor.for the guidance of the trial court on remand,we begin with the evidentiary issues plaintiffs have raised.
the tipster and kessler memos 
plaintiffs argue on appeal that the two water board memos recounting staff contacts with an anonymous tipster and david kessler telephone call were admissible under evidence code sections and,notwithstanding their character plaintiffs maintain that the outer layer of written statements made by the water board staffers when they created the admissible as official records under section,while the inner layer of oral statements made by the tipster and kessler as reported in the admissible as declarations against interest under section.
based on the record,it appears that plaintiffs would have been able to establish the foundational elements for the official records exceptions to apply had they been given an opportunity to do so.the authors of the memos,christine and susan warner,both testified at trial.ocli trial counsel never disputed that the preparation of these memos was part of warner and official duties,that the documents were prepared close in time to the events described,or that warner and were reliable.thus,the primary issue on appeal concerned the inner layer of the statements by the tipster and kessler as recorded in the memos could be offered for their truth.
a.the tipster memos 
as an initial matter,plaintiffs waived their evidence code section argument concerning the tipster memos by failing to raise it in the trial court.in response to ocli motion in limine to exclude the memos,plaintiffs argued that the documents had already been admitted because the trial court had taken judicial notice of their existence.later,plaintiffs filed a second opposition in which they argued the memos were admissible as business records under evidence code section.at no time did plaintiffs claim that the tipster memos should be admitted under evidence code section.plaintiffs may not pursue a new theory of admissibility on appeal unless the factual record surrounding it has been fully developed.american continental ins.c z timber d.the facts pertaining to the possible applicability of this hearsay exception were never fully developed in the trial court because plaintiffs did not invoke it and did not attempt to did ocli have an opportunity to fully preliminary fact showing required.see,people chapman d.
even assuming for the sake of analysis that plaintiffs timely raised the issue and the trial court decided it adversely to them,we would find no abuse of discretion based on the record before us.see hernandez paicius th,d in limine rulings reviewed for abuse of discretion.
the proponent of a declaration against interest must show that the declarant is unavailable,the declaration was against the declarant penal interest when made,and the declaration was sufficiently reliable to warrant admission despite its hearsay character.people lucas cal th,d.the reliability determination may take into account the circumstances under which the statement was made and the possible motivations of the speaker.ibid.moreover,evidence code section is inapplicable to evidence of any statement or portion of a statement not itself specifically disserving to the interests of the declarant.people duarte cal th,d.thus,the hearsay exception does not apply to collateral assertions within declarations against penal interest.ibid.
first,the trial court would not have abused its discretion in finding that statements by an anonymous tipster fail to satisfy the fundamental requirement of a declaration against the declarant actually believes himself to be at some significant risk of civil or criminal liability when he makes the statement sought to be admitted.many cases have rejected declaration against interest claims on this ground.see singh woodford,no.c crb.lexis,exception does not apply to anonymous and unidentifiable caller confessing to crime state kiser,no,wl.lexis,anonymous caller statements were inadmissible because the caller,thinking he would not be discovered,did not believe he was subjecting himself to any criminal liability united states burks,fn.a confession by one who speaks from the shadows and remains unidentifiable hardly measures up to the rationale that a statement made against the declarant own interests is,therefore,reliable state tucker,anonymous letter does not actually subject the declarant to criminal liability because a declarant who conceals his identity does not tend to expose himself to criminal liability com.watson,anonymous informant statement that he purchased drugs from the defendant does not gain credibility as a statement against his penal interest since there is no reason to believe he would realistically have feared prosecution for the offense commonwealth lewis,anonymous calls confessing to murder not admissible as declarations against penal interest.
it is true,as plaintiffs point out,that the tipster in this case took a greater risk by meeting with water board staff than by simply by calling in his information.and,according to the staff memos,he did express concern about his potential criminal liability.but the declarant did insist on and succeed in maintaining his anonymity.we can not say that it would have been an abuse of discretion to give decisive weight to this factor in determining whether the tipster reasonably believed his statement would lead to actual legal detriment when he made it 
second,even if the tipster identity had been known,the trial court would not have abused its discretion in excluding as collateral those portions of his statement that identified ocli as the source of the barrels.while those statements were arguably against ocli interest,they were not against the declarant.the only part of his statement that would have exposed him to liability was his admission that he put a pick through the barrels and dumped their contents on the ground.his identification of ocli was arguably merely collateral to that admission,and not specifically disserving to the interests of the declarant.people duarte,supra,cal th at,d.thus,even if the tipster memos had been admissible,the trial court would have acted within its discretion in redacting those portions that referred to ocli as the source of the barrels.
for these reasons,the trial court properly excluded the tipster memos.
kessler memo 
plaintiffs claim that the trial court further erred in failing to admit the handwritten water board memo containing notes of a telephone conversation between a water board staff member and donald kessler,the deceased former owner of an auto wrecking yard that had leased the briggs avenue site.the notes state in relevant part he said that drums were either picked up or delivered to the site from ocli.he said the drums were supposed to be empty because they were used for storage of metal waste onsite.he said chances are there was liquid at times in the drums.he said he had employees that were always paying attention to the matter.plaintiffs argued in the trial court that kessler statements to the employee during the call,as recorded by the employee,were admissible for their truth as declarations against kessler interest under evidence code section 
kessler statements as reported do not qualify as declarations against interest because they are,if anything,intended to be exculpatory rather than inculpatory as to kessler himself.kessler stated that the drums were supposed to be empty when he got them from ocli.in other words,kessler agreement with ocli was that ocli was to dispose of any contents the drums had once held before the drums arrived at kessler site.despite this agreement,chances are there was liquid in them at times,according to kessler.this was apparently due to the fact that some of kessler employees did not always pay attention,implying that he had instructed the employees to make sure the drums were empty.kessler does not say whether the liquid had any relationship to the contamination found at the site or was something harmless,such as rainwater.his statements suggest that the quantity of liquid involved was small.
kessler statements are those of a person who is trying to avoid rather than assume liability for any contamination that ocli drums might have caused.according to kessler,there was no deliberate dumping.any spillage that did occur was infrequent,inadvertent,and came about only through the combined fault of leaving liquid in the drums contrary to its agreement with him and his employees neglecting to follow the directions he had given them to make sure the drums were empty.rather than disserving his own interests,kessler statements appear,if anything,to be an attempt to shift the blame to ocli.at the time of this telephone conversation,kessler had already been named as a responsible party by the water board in a cleanup and abatement order so he had every reason to implicate others in order to reduce his share of the remediation costs.in that context,nothing about the statements provided any guarantee of their reliability,which is the basis for the declaration against interest exception.see people duarte,supra,cal th at,d,even a hearsay statement that is facially inculpatory of the declarant may,when considered in context,also be exculpatory or have a net exculpatory effect.
accordingly,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the water board memo.people lawley cal th,d.
contamination found at ocli facility 
ocli moved successfully before trial under evidence code section to exclude mention of any groundwater contamination at its own santa rosa facility as tending to create a danger of undue prejudice,or of misleading or confusing the jury ocli further sought to preclude plaintiffs from making any argument that ocli had a propensity to improperly dispose of chemicals.plaintiffs filed no written opposition,but argued at the hearing that the evidence was relevant to show that ocli took such poor care of the chemicals it used that it had contaminated the groundwater under its own site.the trial court ruled that the proposed evidence was inadmissible under section.
on appeal,plaintiffs argue that the evidence should have been admitted as habit or custom evidence under evidence code section or as evidence of identity or a common scheme or plan under section these claims are unavailing.first,plaintiffs waived these theories of admissibility by failing to raise them in the trial court.american continental ins.c z timber,supra,d at.the only theory plaintiffs did offer at the evidence showed ocli took poor care of on precisely the type of suspect inference that evidence code section is intended to foreclose,namely,that a person bad conduct in one circumstance shows a propensity to act badly in others.
second,although plaintiffs argue at some length that evidence code section,subdivision a does not apply to corporations,they fail to cite a single case or authority so holding.in fact,subdivision a has been applied to exclude evidence offered against corporations in circumstances completely analogous to those presented here.see marocco ford motor d.marocco evidence that car manufacturer negligently failed to discover a defect in one automobile part inadmissible to prove negligence pertaining to an unrelated part brokopp ford motor d.brokopp same.
third,plaintiffs had no evidence of habit or custom to offer,even by their own definition of these terms.plaintiffs point out that a person habit is his regular response to a repeated specific situation,while the term custom refers to the routine practice of a group or organization that is equivalent to the habit of an individual.people memro cal d,fn.plaintiffs had no evidence whatsoever of ocli chemical waste disposal practices at its santa rosa facility.they sought to use evidence of contamination as evidence that ocli practices,whatever they were,must have been careless.from this plaintiffs wanted the jury to infer that ocli must have also been careless in the manner in which it disposed of its drums containing hazardous wastes at the frances street site.this is not habit or custom evidence,but propensity evidence of just the type condemned in marocco and brokopp.
fourth,absent any evidence about ocli practices with regard to chemical waste disposal either at its own site or at union pacific property,the exceptions for proof of identity or common scheme or plan would be inapplicable even if they had not been waived.these exceptions require a showing of distinctive similarities or common features between the two instances of conduct.see people diaz cal th,d,people ewoldt cal th,d.plaintiffs had no such evidence.
the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in excluding plaintiffs proffered evidence of groundwater contamination at ocli site.
sufficiency of admitted evidence 
plaintiffs and their trial counsel argue in the alternative that even if the foregoing evidence was properly excluded,the following admitted evidence would have been sufficient to support a jury verdict in plaintiffs favor ocli facility was two to three miles from the union pacific site ocli admittedly sent large metal drums to that site on a regular basis in the and ocli stored its waste chemicals in drums before sending them out for disposal numerous such drums were found at the union pacific site,some of which were leaking hazardous chemicals the same six chemicals that ocli used at its facility were also found at the union pacific site or in its groundwater ocli retained no disposal records pertaining to these chemicals for a period in the and there is no evidence in the record of any single source other than ocli for the particular mix of chemicals contaminating the union pacific site 
we apply the same standard of review to ocli renewed motion to dismiss as we would to an appeal from a successful motion for a nonsuit.ocli brought its dismissal motions under clemens american warranty d,which permits a defendant to move for dismissal after the court grants in limine motions that,in the defendant view,prevent the plaintiff from proving its case.such a motion is tantamount to a nonsuit.see r b auto center,farmers group,th,d edwards centex real estate th,d edwards.a trial court may grant a nonsuit only when,disregarding conflicting evidence,viewing the record in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and indulging in every legitimate inference which may be drawn from the evidence,it determines there is no substantial evidence to support a judgment in the plaintiff favor.edwards,at,d,italics omitted.the same rules apply on appeal from the granting of a nonsuit.ibid.thus,we must resolve all doubts and draw all legitimate inferences in plaintiffs favor,and may uphold the judgment for ocli only if it was required as a matter of law.ibid.
although not particularly strong,plaintiffs case against ocli based on the above evidence is the highly favorable standard of appellate review we apply to compel a reversal of the judgment in favor of ocli.indulging every legitimate inference that may be drawn from the evidence,a rational jury could conclude that it was not mere coincidence that ocli used six of the same chemicals that were found to be contaminating the union pacific site while one or two chemicals in common might suggest a coincidence,six in common supports a legitimate inference of a possible causal relationship,especially in the absence of evidence that other nearby sources could account for the same six chemicals the inference that ocli played a causal role in the contamination also requires that there be a plausible mechanism by which its waste chemicals could have migrated or been transported to the union pacific site.other evidence established that mechanism.ocli stored its waste chemicals in drums for disposal.it admittedly transported drums supposedly empty or containing only scrap metal to the union pacific site on a regular basis during the and,and could not account for where it disposed of its wastes for a period in the the water board ultimately found drums like those used by ocli for storing wastes in large quantities at the site,some observed to be leaking hazardous chemicals.one possible inference from this set of facts is that drums containing hazardous waste were in fact transported from ocli to the site during at least part of the relevant time period.
resolving all doubts and indulging all legitimate inferences in plaintiffs favor,we can not say that the judgment in favor of ocli was required as a matter of law.we will therefore reverse it.
section sanctions award to ocli 
the trial court awarded sanctions to ocli based both on in limine order and section regarding the latter,the court explained its decision in relevant part as follows on april,the court granted ocli two motions in limine which,according to ocli,eliminated all evidence supporting plaintiffs case against ocli and the defendant immediately sent letters to the plaintiffs counsel requesting to be dismissed with prejudice.ccp ensures that the claims,defenses,and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support ocli argues that it should have been dismissed from the suit at the beginning of the trial.ocli claims that there was not the required evidentiary support which would have demonstrated to the court that ocli was responsible for contamination of the site.because the plaintiffs failed to have the evidentiary support and the pleadings were brought primarily for an improper purpose sanctions should be assessed against the plaintiffs pursuant to section.the court grants the motion for fees and costs in the total amount of including ccp damages to ocli the fees and costs are owed,jointly and severally,by plaintiffs attorneys.
as an initial matter,it is important to clarify the conduct for which the court imposed section sanctions.ocli sanctions motion emphasized that section covered not only the filing of a pleading or similar paper without evidentiary support but also the later advocacy of positions taken in such document.the motion went on to cite as grounds alleged instances of sanctionable conduct occurring after the granting on april,of ocli motions in limine.these included written and oral representations made in support of a pretrial motion in limine by plaintiffs,plaintiffs opposition to ocli original motion to dismiss,and a may request for judicial notice.ocli also cited plaintiffs opening statement to the jury and various representations to the court concerning the anticipated testimony of certain former ocli employees who had not been on plaintiffs pretrial witness list.in addition,ocli alleged that the totality of plaintiffs counsel pleadings and advocacy since the rulings on ocli motions in limine,all in an effort to keep ocli in the case,justified an award of all of the fees and costs incurred from april,forward.
section,subdivision e provides that w hen imposing sanctions,the court shall describe the conduct determined to constitute a violation of this section and explain the basis for the sanction imposed.based on the wording of the trial court order,and its omission to mention any of the other more specific instances of misconduct cited in the motion,we must assume that the court intent was to sanction plaintiffs counsel for the totality of its written and oral advocacy pertaining to ocli from april,until the mistrial.thus,in the language of section,plaintiffs counsel were being sanctioned for falsely certifying through their oral and written presentations to the court after april that there was still evidentiary support for the complaint factual allegations against ocli and that such allegations were not being maintained primarily for an improper purpose after that point.
it is thus apparent that the trial court award of sanctions against ocli under section depended exclusively on its belief that plaintiffs lacked sufficient evidentiary support for their case to survive a nonsuit.because we have reached a different judgment on that point,the court sanctions award against plaintiffs counsel under section must be reversed.we will not hold that a case supported by enough evidence to sustain a favorable jury verdict either lacked evidentiary support or was prosecuted primarily for an improper purpose for purposes of that section.ocli ventures no argument that such a holding would be defensible.
state motion for summary judgment 
upon reconsidering the state motion for summary judgment on its own motion,the trial court held the state had established as a matter of law that no designated water board employee was under a duty in to give the notice to public officials required by health and safety code section,subdivision b,that the discharge or threatened discharge was likely to cause substantial injury to the public health or safety and the state was immune from liability under section in any event,because any failure to give prompt notice after issuance of the cleanup and abatement order would constitute an act or omission taken to abate or attempt to abate hazards reasonably believed to be an imminent peril to public health and safety caused by the discharge,spill,or presence of a hazardous substance for purposes of health and safety code section.
on appeal after a motion for summary judgment has been granted,we review the record de novo,considering all the evidence set forth in the moving and opposition papers except that to which objections have been made and sustained.guz bechtel national,cal th,d.
plaintiffs contended that the cleanup and abatement order the water board issued for the frances street site in july suggested that the contamination of that site was likely to cause substantial injury to the public health or safety.however,in alleged violation of health and safety code section,subdivision b,no designated water board employees,including its then executive officer,susan warner,gave notice of the danger to local public officials until january,when the board learned that groundwater beneath the frances street site was contaminated with industrial solvents.
the water board july cleanup and abatement order reported that water board staff had found numerous soil contamination problems at the frances street site.italics added.it noted m any areas of hydrocarbon contamination in soil at the site italics added,and reported that drums leaking hazardous materials,old batteries,and quantities of shredded metals were piled and scattered around the site.regarding the threat of water contamination,the order noted that t he site overlies shallow groundwaters and is located near tributaries to the russian river.it further stated that the groundwater supported,among other things,domestic and agricultural water supplies.after describing the soil contamination,the proximity of groundwater supplies,and the beneficial uses being made of those supplies,the order drew the following conclusions the groundwater contamination threatens the beneficial uses of state waters,including domestic supplies served by areal groundwaters the discharge and threatened discharge of said wastes could unreasonably affect water quality and the above described beneficial uses.threaten ed discharges of contaminant were observed in the inspection which could affect public health and resources 
plaintiffs contend that the text of the cleanup and abatement order,by itself,is sufficient to create a triable issue of material fact as to whether susan warner or other designated water board employees had a duty to give the notices required by health and safety code section,subdivision b,at the time the order was issued.according to plaintiffs,based only on the water board declaration that the waste threatened domestic water supplies and could affect public health and safety,a jury could infer that susan warner believed the pollution was likely to cause substantial injury to the public health or safety.italics added.we disagree.
to be subject to the disclosure duty specified in health and safety code section,a designated government employee must have information that an illegal discharge of a hazardous waste has occurred or is threatened,and must know that it is likely to cause substantial injury to the public health or safety.it is not sufficient that the employee should have known or had a reasonable suspicion of such likelihood,at.in support of summary judgment,warner averred that until she received a report of solvent contamination in groundwater beneath the frances street site in january,she did not know there was any threat of substantial injury to public health or safety.she gave timely notice under health and safety code section at that time.
although the cleanup and abatement order had reported that some drums at the site were leaking hazardous materials,the order made no explicit finding that there had been a discharge or threatened discharge of a hazardous waste.neither did the order make or report any finding that the conditions it described were likely to cause substantial injury to the public health or safety.the order stated only that the conditions could affect public health and resources.by law,cleanup and abatement orders can be issued due to possible effects that do not involve public health.see water code,subds.l,m,subd.a.
plaintiffs argument based on the cleanup and abatement order is tantamount to a claim that because a person has a serious illness,it is reasonable to infer that the person is likely to die.while death is one possible outcome of a serious illness,without more information there is no reason to believe that it is the most likely outcome.such an inference could be based on no more than guesswork or speculation.inferences based on guesswork or speculation are not sufficient to demonstrate the existence of a material fact issue.annod hamilton samuels th,d.
besides the language of the order itself,plaintiffs cite three tangentially relevant excerpts from the trial testimony of two expert,everett,and a water board senior engineering geologist,christine however,this evidence was not offered in any form as part of plaintiffs opposition to the state original summary judgment motion in,nor was it called to the trial court attention upon the court reconsideration of the state summary judgment motion in.we do not disagree that plaintiffs were entitled to use testimony they had elicited at trial in an attempt to defeat the state summary judgment motion.however,having failed to call that evidence to the attention of the trial court when it reconsidered the state motion,plaintiffs may not raise it for the first time on this appeal see jacobs retail clerks union,local d.north coast business park nielsen construction th,d.
based on the evidence before it,the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the state 
fee award based on section 
after granting the state summary judgment motion,the trial court awarded the state in attorney fees and in expert witness fees under section 
plaintiffs first contend that the present action was not brought under the california tort claims act,but under proposition.this contention is without merit.the tort claims act governs all liability against public entities in california.see county of los angeles superior court th,d.plaintiffs theory of liability against the state was based solely on the state asserted vicarious liability for the alleged omissions of designated water board employees.the doctrine of vicarious liability based on respondeat superior is made applicable to public employers by government code section.mary city of los angeles cal d.in fact,plaintiffs expressly rely on government code sections,subdivision a and in making their vicarious liability argument.they are thus in no position to argue that section is inapplicable to their claims against the state.
the applicable standard of review under section was set forth in knight city of capitola th,d knight at page,d good faith,or its absence,involves a factual inquiry into the plaintiff subjective state of mind citations a subjective state of mind will rarely be susceptible of direct proof usually the trial court will be required to infer it from circumstantial evidence.because the good faith issue is factual,the question on appeal will be whether the evidence of record was sufficient to sustain the trial court finding.reasonable cause is to be determined objectively,as a matter of law,on the basis of the facts known to the plaintiff when he or she filed or maintained the action.once what the plaintiff or his or her attorney knew has been determined,or found to be undisputed,it is for the court to decide whether any reasonable attorney would have thought the claim tenable citations.because the opinion of the hypothetical reasonable attorney is to be determined as a matter of law,reasonable cause is subject to de novo review on appeal.
other than the asserted groundlessness of plaintiffs claims against it,the state offered no factual basis or argument in the trial court for an inference that plaintiffs lacked a good faith belief that there was a justifiable controversy under the facts and law.the trial court for its part made no factual findings in support of its order under section.accordingly,the section fee award must stand or fall in this case on whether,under de novo review,plaintiffs had reasonable cause to bring or maintain the proceedings against the state.see knight,supra,th at,d section applies not only to commencement of action but also to maintaining it without reasonable cause after it has been filed kobzoff los angeles county medical center cal th,d,kobzoff a defendant may recover defense costs if trial court finds the plaintiff lacked either reasonable cause or a good faith belief the case was justified.
section provides a way for public entities,who are barred from bringing malicious prosecution suits,to recover the cost of defending frivolous suits.kobzoff,supra,cal th at,d,knight,supra,th at,d section provides a judicially approved alternative to a constitutionally proscribed action for malicious prosecution.the case law on the tort of malicious prosecution provides analogous,instructive,and persuasive authority in construing the concept of reasonable cause under section.carroll state of california d.in particular,the term reasonable cause in section,and as defined in knight,is synonymous with the term probable cause in malicious prosecution law.knight,at,d see sheldon appel albert oliker cal d.
in roberts sentry life insurance th,d roberts,the court of appeal held that i n an action alleging malicious prosecution of an earlier suit,evidence that the trial court in the earlier suit denied a defense summary judgment motion establishes that there was probable cause to bring the earlier suit.id.at,d.the roberts court reasoned as follows california courts have held that victory at trial,though reversed on appeal,conclusively establishes probable cause.citations.the rationale is that approval by the trier of fact,after a full adversary hearing,sufficiently demonstrates that an action was legally tenable.citation.s uccess at trial shows that the suit was not among the least meritorious of meritless suits,those which are totally meritless and thus lack probable cause.denial of a defendant summary judgment motion provides similarly persuasive evidence that a suit does not totally lack merit.a federal judge denies summary judgment if there are genuine issues of material fact for trial,and the moving party is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.citation.a california judge must reach similar conclusions to deny summary judgment.citation.these conclusions necessarily imply that the judge finds at least some merit in the claim.the claimant may win,if certain material facts are decided favorably.this finding unless disregarded compels conclusion that there is probable cause,because probable cause is lacking only in the total absence of merit.id.at,d,italics omitted.
the same principle was recognized by our supreme court in wilson parker,covert chidester cal th,d,wilson o ur decision in sheldon appel albert oliker clarified that probable cause to bring an action does not depend upon it being meritorious,as such,but upon it being arguably tenable,not so completely lacking in apparent merit that no reasonable attorney would have thought the claim tenable.citation.denial of a defense summary judgment motion on grounds that a triable issue exists,or of a nonsuit,while falling short of a determination of the merits,establishes that the plaintiff has substantiated,or can substantiate,the elements of his or her cause of action with evidence that,if believed,would justify a favorable verdict a claimant or attorney who is in possession of such evidence has the right to bring the claim,even where it is very doubtful the claim will ultimately prevail.citation.id.at,d,italics omitted.
in this case,the court denied the state original summary judgment motion and,with a different judge presiding,denied a substantially similar motion for judgment on the pleadings.plaintiffs were allowed to try their case to a jury although not to a verdict.it is true that the court ultimately reversed the earlier summary judgment ruling but,as stated in wilson it would be a hard law,indeed,that would render a plaintiff liable in damages for instituting an action in the event that,notwithstanding a judge of the superior court was satisfied that upon those facts the plaintiff had a meritorious case,a ruling to that effect should afterwards be set aside.wilson,supra,cal th at,d,quoting cowles carter d.
in our view,based on the principles applied in roberts and wilson,the trial court award to the state under section must be reversed.although we have found that the state was ultimately entitled to summary judgment,we can not say that no reasonable attorney would have thought plaintiffs claim against the state tenable.
section award to the state 
in may,the state made a settlement offer to plaintiffs under section,which plaintiffs declined to accept the offer was to pay each plaintiff.after granting the state summary judgment motion,the court awarded the state in expert witness fees based on section.on appeal,plaintiffs contend the award must fail because the state offer was not made in good faith,and the court failed to consider the financial impact of its award on plaintiffs.
a section offer must be made in good faith to be valid.wear calderon d.good faith requires that the offer of settlement be realistically reasonable under the circumstances of the particular case citation.jones dumrichob th,d.a token or nominal offer made with no reasonable prospect of acceptance will not pass the good faith test.ibid.
whether a section offer was reasonable and made in good faith is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.nelson anderson th,d.in reviewing an award of costs and fees under code of civil procedure section,the appellate court will examine the circumstances of the case to determine if the trial court abused its discretion in evaluating the reasonableness of the offer or its refusal.carver chevron,th,d.the burden is on the party complaining to establish an abuse of discretion,and unless a clear case of abuse is shown and unless there has been a miscarriage of justice a reviewing court will not substitute its opinion and thereby divest the trial court of its discretionary power.citations.nelson anderson,at,d.
plaintiffs failed to satisfy their burden of demonstrating a clear abuse of discretion in this case.to prevail against the state at trial,plaintiffs had the burden of proving that a designated state employee had violated proposition.despite time to investigate the facts before filing,and four years after filing suit in which to depose water board employees and review all of the water board files on this subject,the plaintiffs opposition to the state summary judgment motion showed that plaintiffs had little more to support their proposition claim than a shaky circumstantial argument based on the text of the cleanup and abatement order.from the state viewpoint,given the weakness of the plaintiffs case,the fact that the state summary judgment motion had been denied did not mean that plaintiffs were likely to prevail at trial.this was particularly the case since the trial court had decided the motion without considering the principal declaration the state had offered in support of it.
plaintiffs also maintain that before setting the amount of the award under section,the trial court should have first considered the award severe financial impact on them.see seever copley press,th,d when opposing parties possess vastly disparate economic resources,court may be required to scale the award to their respective resources to avoid placing undue pressure on the less affluent party to accept unreasonable offers.plaintiffs did not raise this issue in the trial court nor have they created a factual record sufficient to resolve it in their favor.for example,there is no evidence in the record regarding the assets owned by plaintiffs,including the disposition of the settlement proceeds obtained in this lawsuit.although we nonetheless have discretion to consider the issue,we decline to do so because no important question of public policy is involved.see in re cal th,d.in any event,we find no indication that the legislature intended to require courts to conduct a means test as part of determining the amounts to award under section.such a rule,which would alter the settlement incentives provided by section in a wide range of cases,should not be mandated by placing a judicial gloss on the statute text.
we find no abuse of discretion in the fact or amount of the trial court section award to the state.
iii.disposition 
the orders awarding sanctions pursuant to in limine order,and sections and,are reversed as is the judgment dismissing plaintiffs claims against ocli.the summary judgment and order awarding expert witness fees under section in favor of the state are affirmed.the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.

the pertinent provision,which was enacted as part of proposition,reads as follows any designated government employee who obtains information in the course of his or her official duties revealing the illegal discharge or threatened illegal discharge of a hazardous waste within the geographical area of his or her jurisdiction and who knows that the discharge or threatened discharge is likely to cause substantial injury to the public health or safety must,within hours,disclose that information to the local board of supervisors and to the local health officer.health,subd.b.
government code section et.
the trial court decided the motion without considering the state principal declaration in support of it.the trial court excluded in its entirety the declaration of water board executive officer,susan warner,upon the sole ground that she failed to include a recitation that she had personal knowledge of the matters stated therein.it was evident from the declaration that warner did have personal knowledge of the matters discussed in it.
health and safety code section,subdivision b states in relevant part a public entity shall not be liable for any injury or property damage caused by an act or omission taken by a person authorized by a public entity acting within the scope of employment to abate or attempt to abate hazards reasonably believed to be an imminent peril to public health and safety caused by the discharge,spill,or presence of a hazardous substance,unless the act taken or omission was performed in bad faith or in a grossly negligent manner.
