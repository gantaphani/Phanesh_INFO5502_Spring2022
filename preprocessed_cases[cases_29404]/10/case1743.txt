the parties to a statewide class action involving claims that stores,et denied meal and rest breaks to thousands of employees filed volumes of records conditionally under seal without complying with the constitutionally mandated procedures embodied in california rules of court rules and.after a local newspaper entered the proceedings with a motion to unseal,and after publicly filed papers and exhibits in two writ proceedings in this court that had been conditionally sealed below,the trial court entertained belated motion to seal records under rule,granting and denying the motion in part.we conclude that waived its right to file that motion and in any event the trial court lacked discretion to entertain it.we further hold that the trial court did not err in denying the newspaper organization request for attorney fees under code of civil procedure section.accordingly,in these consolidated appeals we reverse the order in no.to the extent it granted motion to seal records,and affirm the order in no.denying attorney fees to the newspaper organization.
background 
protective order substantive proceedings 
plaintiffs filed a class action against in february,alleging that the giant retailer had not properly compensated some hourly employees for rest breaks,meal periods,and time worked but not recorded in the timekeeping system.at the commencement of discovery,the parties negotiated and the trial court entered a confidentiality and protective order dated february,protective order.paragraph of the protective order provided that any motion to seal documents lodged or filed with the court shall be heard prior to or on the same day as the related substantive motion.paragraph.governed submission of confidential information to the court,other than for use at trial,and provided that such confidential information shall be lodged conditionally under seal in the manner set forth in the california rules of court conditionally sealed records shall remain so sealed pending the determination of a motion for an order permanently sealing the record within thirty days after the last written submission bearing upon the motion or other proceeding in question has been filed or lodged with the court,any party requesting that a conditionally sealed record remain permanently sealed shall serve and file a noticed motion for an order permanently sealing the record in accordance with the procedures set forth in the rules of court.
in august the court heard a contested motion to compel production of documents.has submitted a declaration in the present appeal indicating that at that hearing there was an informal discussion off the record in which the court indicated that it would not be necessary to actually make a separate motion every time a document was filed under seal pursuant to the protective order signed by the court.thereafter,the court permitted the parties to file documents conditionally under seal pursuant to the protective order and,unless an objection was made,the documents were deemed filed under seal.the parties have proceeded accordingly.the trial court did not recall the discussion and noted in a later proceeding that such process is contrary to the rules of court,which expressly observe that the parties ca simply stipulate to sealing effectively,permanently sealing the court records nonetheless,the court later found that and plaintiffs have consistently filed documents conditionally under seal and have operated under the apparent common understanding correct or not that the documents would remain under seal until further order of the court.
meanwhile,plaintiffs motion for class certification and motion for summary adjudication proceeded,presumably under the above informal arrangement.sought writ review of the rulings on both motions.no.class certification and no.summary adjudication.
in the summer of,rumors were afloat that summary adjudication motion was based partially on emergency regulations being developed by the department of industrial relations,concerning the additional pay remedy for the violation of statutory meal and rest break requirements detailed in state labor laws and regulations.the additional pay remedy,and how it was characterized,apparently was central to motion.
enter the berkeley daily planet 
when appellant the berkeley daily planet daily planet and its counsel from the law firm of weinberg,roger rosenfeld learned of these matters,counsel undertook a review of the register of actions on the alameda county superior court public web site,hoping to ascertain the arguments asserted by in its summary adjudication motion.the firm attempted to inspect and copy the papers filed in connection with its motion,only to learn that virtually all the pleadings,motions,points and authorities,declarations,exhibits,had been filed conditionally under seal pursuant to the protective order.only the caption page of each document was available for public inspection,and the clerk of the court denied the daily planet request to inspect the unredacted originals.
in august the daily planet moved to unseal all records filed by in opposition to plaintiffs motion for class certification and in support of its summary adjudication motion.the parties went through a process but nothing was resolved.in november counsel for the daily planet requested access to the writ petition in no.a deputy clerk of this court informed counsel that all the exhibits and papers were available for inspection and copying and there were no records under seal.counsel inspected the records and determined that they had been filed without any motion,findings,order,or notation to indicate they had been filed under seal in the trial court,and without any indication that the court of appeal had sealed them upon receipt.the deputy clerk also advised counsel that the writ petition and exhibits in no.had been sent to storage,were not under seal,and were available for public inspection upon request.counsel requested retrieval of the files and,during the hearing on the motion to unseal,advised the trial court of the situation at the court of appeal.
interceded immediately,writing to the clerk of this court that large parts of the appendices to the writ petitions had been filed under seal in the trial court and were marked as such on the face of the documents.further,understood that those parts of the appendix which were sealed by order of the trial court were also filed under seal with the court of appeal pursuant to california rule of court c.requested that the appendices be sealed immediately.despite letters from counsel for plaintiffs and the daily planet explaining that never moved to seal any record included in the appendices,and the trial court never sealed a single document,this court concluded there was a question as to whether the records had been filed under seal in the trial court.accordingly,pending resolution of the question,we deemed the records conditionally lodged under seal until further order from this court.
the trial court denied the daily planet motion to unseal,reasoning that it was premature and noting that any party desiring an order for permanent sealing must make a motion meeting the requirements of the rules of court.thereafter,moved to permanently seal documents concerning labor guidelines pay and incentive guidelines star reviews audit information and the smart timekeeping system.again,the process was not fruitful.
granting in part and denying in part motion to seal,the trial court rejected the daily planet assertion that by the filing of documents in the public files of this court,waived its right to seek a sealing order.the court found that had demonstrated an overriding interest in placing documents under seal that concerned labor guidelines and staffing formula pay and incentive guidelines star reviews and documents describing the review process internal audit procedures the smart timekeeping system and private information concerning its employees.however,had not demonstrated an overriding interest in protecting generalized factual descriptions of evidence in briefs and memoranda.in the end,the court ordered only a small portion of documents sealed.it directed to serve plaintiffs and the daily planet with copies of the documents initially filed conditionally under seal that were to remain unsealed per the court pages of documents in all.the cost of this effort was in the nature of a sanction for failure to file timely motions to seal and therefore causing a delay in public access to these documents.
thereafter the daily planet moved unsuccessfully for attorney fees pursuant to section.the trial court ruled that the daily planet was not a party to the case and never formally moved to intervene.moreover,its involvement in the case did not pertain to the underlying legal merits or overarching strategic purpose of the litigation.alternatively,because the daily planet theoretically could have filed a separate lawsuit to unseal the documents,in which case the issues relating to unsealing records would have constituted the heart of the matter,the court evaluated the statutory criteria for a section fee award,and found the daily planet request wanting.
these timely consolidated appeals followed.

the procedures for filing records under seal are set forth in rule court approval is explicit a record must not be filed under seal without a court order.the court must not permit a record to be filed under seal based solely on the agreement or stipulation of the parties.rule a.the party requesting a sealing order must notice a motion or application,supported by a memorandum and a declaration of facts sufficient to justify sealing.rule b.the pertinent documents must be lodged with the court in a sealed envelope labeled conditionally under seal.if the motion is granted,the clerk must affix a label prominently saying sealed by order of the court on date.rule d,e.records remain sealed except by further order of the court.rule h.where the motion is denied,the clerk must return the lodged documents unless the moving party notifies the clerk within days after the denial that the documents are to be filed.rule b.

waived its right to a sealing order 
the daily planet insists that waived any right to belatedly seek an order sealing records that it had filed publicly in this court without a sealing order and without proper findings after a noticed motion.reiterates that it inadvertently failed to segregate the conditionally sealed documents filed in the writ proceedings.further,in characterizing this court response to the parties correspondence on the sealing question,hints that we decided against the daily planet on the waiver issue.
although courts frequently define waiver as the intentional relinquishment of a known right,waiver may also stem from conduct which,according to its natural import,is so inconsistent with an intent to enforce the right as to induce a reasonable belief that such right has been relinquished.rheem united states cal d,rubin los angeles fed.sav.loan d.whether a waiver has occurred is a factual question,tested on appeal under the substantial evidence rule.bickel city of piedmont cal th,d,abrogated on another point as stated in deberard properties,lim cal th,d.
the only finding made by the trial court on the waiver issue was this the record suggests that thought that its filings at the court of appeal would be under seal because its filings in the trial court were conditionally under seal.
relying on state comp.ins.fund wps,th,d state fund,the trial court went on to determine that filing of documents in the public files of this court was not a waiver of its right to obtain an order sealing the files in the trial court.state fund concerned waiver of the privilege,as set forth in evidence code section the reviewing court indicated that evidence code section instructs us to look to the words and conduct of the holder of the privilege to ascertain whether a waiver has occurred.it was not state fund,the holder of the privilege,that disclosed privileged documents rather,through the discovery process outside counsel for state fund effected an inadvertent disclosure.state fund,supra,at,d.there was no intent on the part of the insurer counsel to disclose the documents,and the documents themselves were designed to alert the casual observer that they were subject to the privilege.further,counsel for state fund moved promptly to secure return of the documents.based on these facts,the reviewing court concluded state fund had no intention to voluntarily relinquish the privilege.it further held that a waiver,within the meaning of evidence code section,does not include accidental,inadvertent disclosure of privileged information by the attorney.state fund,supra,at,d.the court declined to endorse a gotcha theory of waiver,in which an underling in a document production becomes the equivalent of actual consent.ibid.
first,we clarify any insinuation on part that this court decided the waiver issue by responding to inquiries concerning sealing of the writ appendices.we received correspondence from,plaintiffs and the daily planet,correspondence with conflicting conclusions about what happened in the trial court.rather than decide who was right or wrong,we deemed the appendices lodged conditionally under seal pending resolution of the question whether the supporting papers had been filed under seal in the trial court.what we expected the trial court to decide was whether the writ appendices had been properly sealed in the trial court.our order was not an invitation for the trial court,in the first instance,to hear belated motion to seal.
second,whereas it is the holder of the privilege who may waive statutory confidentiality protection,waiver by conduct in nonstatutory cases can stem from the conduct of a duly authorized agent.knarston manhattan life ins.cal.
third,claim of inadvertence is belied by its correspondence to this court wherein it claimed that large parts of the appendices had been filed under seal in the trial court and were sealed by order of that court.the letter suggests inadvertence in the appellate court proceedings,but that claim is based on the patently incorrect assertion that sealing procedures had been properly adhered to below.could not reasonably think that the trial court had
