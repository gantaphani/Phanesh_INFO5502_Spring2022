plaintiff robert rodriguez filed a putative class action in state court,which defendant removed to federal district court.defendant contended that there was federal jurisdiction over the action under the class action fairness act of cafa,stat,and in particular d.rodriguez alleged that the amount in controversy did not exceed million,as required for federal jurisdiction,and purported to waive any claim by the class in excess of that amount.based on that waiver,the district court granted rodriguez motion to remand the case to state court.the supreme court later held that such a waiver was ineffective,however.standard fire ins.knowles,d.as a result,we vacate the district court order and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
in its remand order,the district court held that to establish federal jurisdiction over a putative class action,defendant must demonstrate to a legal certainty that the amount in controversy exceeded the million threshold amount,based upon our decision to that effect in lowdermilk bank national association,cir.our reasoning there for imposing on defendants the burden to prove the amount in controversy to a legal certainty,rather than the ordinary preponderance of the evidence standard,is clearly irreconcilable with the supreme court reasoning in standard fire.as a result,we hold that lowdermilk has been effectively overruled,and that the proper burden of proof imposed upon a defendant to establish the amount in controversy is the preponderance of the evidence standard.
background 
plaintiff robert rodriguez brought a putative class action against at t mobility services,llc,on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated retail sales managers of at t wireless stores in los angeles and ventura counties.rodriguez asserted various claims under california law related to alleged unpaid wages,overtime compensation,and damages for statutory violations.rodriguez filed his original complaint in los angeles county superior court.at t removed the case to federal court under u.d.
rodriguez moved to remand the case to california state court,arguing that at t could not establish jurisdiction in federal court.specifically,rodriguez argued that the total amount in controversy in this putative class action did not exceed million,the minimum amount for federal jurisdiction as required by d.rodriguez pointed to his first amended complaint,in which he alleged as much,that the aggregate amount in controversy is less than five million dollars.to bolster his position,in that pleading,rodriguez also waive d seeking more than five million dollars regarding the aggregate amount in controversy for the class claims alleged.
at t attempted to establish that the amount in controversy did in fact exceed million by submitting several sworn declarations from at t representatives regarding the potential number of class members and size of their claims.at t argued that rodriguez allegations,coupled with the sworn declarations,established that the amount in controversy could not be less than roughly million and was likely double that amount.
the district court rejected at t argument and ordered remand to state court.the court noted that the amount in controversy was the only jurisdictional requirement at issue in this case and that a defendant seeking removal of an action to federal court bears the burden of establishing the grounds for federal jurisdiction,propositions that the parties did not dispute.citing our decision in lowdermilk,the district court held that at t must demonstrate to a legal certainty that more than is at issue in this case.at t could not do so,the court held,because rodriguez disclaimer of any recovery exceeding effectively foreclosed the jurisdictional issue.because the waiver was controlling,the court reasoned that it need not address the issues surrounding the parties respective calculations of the amount in controversy as if there were no waiver or disclaimer of any amount exceeding.
at t filed a petition to appeal under c,which we granted on july.
ii.discussion 
a defendant may remove to federal district court an action first brought in state court when the district court would have original jurisdiction.federal district courts have original subject matter jurisdiction over class actions in which a member of the plaintiff class is a citizen of a state different from any defendant and the aggregate amount of the class members claims exceeds million.d.the party seeking the federal forum bears the burden of establishing that the statutory requirements of federal jurisdiction have been met.lewis verizon commc ns,cir.we review de novo a district court remand order.abrego abrego dow chem,cir.
as in the district court,the million requirement of d is the only jurisdictional requirement disputed in this appeal.
plaintiff waiver of claim amount 
the remand ordered by the district court was explicitly based upon rodriguez waiver of any claim in excess of million.recently,however,and after the district court entered its order,the supreme court held that such a waiver was ineffective.in standard fire insurance company knowles,d,the court held that a lead plaintiff of a putative class could not foreclose a defendant ability to establish the million amount in controversy by stipulating prior to class certification that the amount in controversy is less than million.id.at.
the court reversed the district court remand order because plaintiff stipulation was not binding on the class and therefore could not resolve the question.id.at.the court explained,a plaintiff who files a proposed class action can not legally bind members of the proposed class before the class is certified.id.at.thus,a plaintiff precertification stipulation does not bind anyone but himself.id.requiring courts to ignore a nonbinding stipulation,the court held,does no more than require the federal judge to do what the statute requires,namely aggregat e the claims of the individual class members.id.at quoting d alteration in original.
in our case,rodriguez acknowledges that the district court remand order must be vacated in light of standard fire.his waiver no longer has legal effect.because the order to remand the case to state court relied solely on that waiver,it must be vacated and the matter remanded to district court for further consideration.
burden of proof 
that brings us to the question of the standard to be applied on remand.the district court held that a heightened burden of proof applied to at t in establishing the requisite jurisdictional minimum.under lowdermilk bank national association,cir,when a class action complaint alleges damages below the jurisdictional minimum,the removing defendant must establish to a legal certainty that the amount in controversy in fact exceeds the jurisdictional requirement.id.at.based on lowdermilk,the district court decision in our case was correct at the time.
at t contends,however,that standard fire fatally undermines lowdermilk legal certainty standard such that it has been effectively overruled and should not apply on remand.rather,at t argues that it need only establish that the amount in controversy exceeds million by a preponderance of the evidence,the standard that ordinarily applies where a plaintiff fails to plead a specific amount of damages.id.at.rodriguez disputes at t reading of standard fire.
the binding nature of prior precedent 
as a panel of this circuit,we are bound by prior panel decisions such as lowdermilk and can only reexamine them when their reasoning or theory of that authority is clearly irreconcilable with the reasoning or theory of intervening higher authority.miller gammie,cir en banc.this is a high standard.lair bullock,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the test requires us to look at more than the surface conclusions of the competing authority.the issues presented in the two cases need not be identical in order for the intervening higher authority to be controlling.miller,at.rather,the relevant court of last resort must have undercut the theory or reasoning underlying the prior circuit precedent in such a way that the cases are clearly irreconcilable.id.but i t is not enough
