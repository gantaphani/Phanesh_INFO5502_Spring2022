this appeal requires us to consider a novel situation involving the registration of a federal judgment.in short,the judgment was rendered in the united states district court for the district of hawaii and registered in the united states district court for the northern district of texas,where the prevailing plaintiff sought to enforce it against a,texas defendant.the defendant in the texas enforcement action moved to dismiss on the ground that the judgment was not timely registered because,under texas borrowing statute,the statute of limitations for enforcing judgments applies and under it,the judgment had expired.this prompted the plaintiff to ask the rendering court to declare that the judgment was live and,in any event,to extend it,which the district court did.meanwhile,the collection defendant moved to intervene in the extension proceeding,which the district court did not allow,and then to appeal the extension,which the court also did not allow.we conclude that the party against whom enforcement was sought had a significant protectable interest at stake that gave it the right to be heard in the extension proceeding,and to appeal.having considered the intervenor arguments on the merits,we also conclude that the district court erred in purporting to extend the judgment.accordingly,we reverse the orders denying intervention,and vacate the order granting extension.
in march,a class of human rights victims whose lead plaintiff was celsa hilao brought suit in the district of hawaii against ferdinand marcos and his estate.this action became part of a multidistrict proceeding,estate of ferdinand marcos human rights litigation,mdl,over which the transferee judge,honorable manuel real,presided.a judgment was entered in hilao favor on february,the mdl judgment.in it,the court retained jurisdiction.the mdl judgment was appealed and affirmed,hilao estate of marcos,cir our mandate issued january.before commencing the proceedings at issue here,hilao registered the mdl judgment in the northern district of illinois in january,the republic of the philippines in may,and singapore in february.hilao then registered the mdl judgment in the northern district of texas pursuant to and filed a class action complaint april,against revelstoke investment corporation,and six other corporations collectively,revelstoke,alleging that real properties to which revelstoke holds title in texas are beneficially owned by the marcos estate,and seeking to execute and foreclose on those properties in partial satisfaction of the mdl judgment.
on may,revelstoke notified hilao of its belief that the mdl judgment had expired pursuant to revised statute as applied through the texas statute of limitations,texas civil practice remedies code a,which is a borrowing statute hrs provides that a judgment is presumed paid and discharged ten years after it is rendered,unless the judgment is extended within that period.
on june,hilao filed a motion pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure in the mdl action for a extension of the judgment.hilao memorandum in support explains that the issue had been raised in the texas collection litigation and that,while hilao believed hrs was not applicable to her federal judgment,she sought an extension out of an abundance of caution.
revelstoke filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings in the texas litigation on june,contending that the enforcement action was barred by the statute of limitations borrowed in the forum state by.civ.prac.a.on june,hilao asked the northern district of texas to stay proceedings on revelstoke motion until after the district of hawaii ruled on hilao request to extend the judgment.a stay was subsequently entered.
on june,revelstoke moved to intervene in mdl for the limited purpose of contesting hilao motion to extend.hilao did not oppose intervention.
at a hearing held on june,judge real first granted hilao motion to extend the judgment.after ruling on that motion,the court considered,and denied,revelstoke request to intervene for the purpose of opposing the motion.its reasons,stated from the bench,were that the court had no jurisdiction over the matters in texas that the texas litigation had not been sent to the district of hawaii under the multidistrict case and that nothing that happens in the district of hawaii can affect the judgment in texas.
the same day the court signed a written order,in the form proposed by hilao,granting the extension.the order was entered june,and finds that the mdl judgment was not final until issuance of the ninth circuit mandate on january,hrs only applies to domestic judgments and federal court judgments have no expiration date application of hrs to federal court judgments on federal causes of action would be barred by the supremacy clause and alternatively,even if hrs were applicable,good cause exists to grant an extension to january,given marcos pattern and practice of secreting assets.
revelstoke then moved to intervene for the limited purpose of appealing the district court extension order.the court denied this motion in a written order that states this matter rests in the jurisdiction of the texas litigation.
revelstoke filed a timely notice of appeal from the district court orders denying intervention and granting the extension.
intervention is governed by fed.civ.proc.a and b.to intervene as of right pursuant to rule a,an applicant must show that it has a significant protectable interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action the disposition of the action may,as a practical matter,impair or impede the applicant ability to protect its interest the application is timely and the existing parties may not adequately represent the applicant interest.cal.edison lynch,cir quoting united states city of los angeles,cir quoting donnelly glickman,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
only the first requirement is seriously disputed.for this requirement,we set out an analytical framework in city of los angeles,at.as summarized in southern california edison 
an applicant has a significant protectable interest in an action if it asserts an interest that is protected under some law,and there is a relationship between its legally protected interest and the plaintiff claims.the relationship requirement is met if the resolution of the plaintiff claims actually will affect the applicant.the interest test is not a or rule,because no specific legal or equitable interest need be established.instead,the interest test directs courts to make a practical,threshold inquiry,and is primarily a practical guide to disposing of lawsuits by involving as many apparently concerned persons as is compatible with efficiency and due process.
at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
revelstoke argues that it has an the loss of its real property in the texas is protected under hrs,which shields persons such as revelstoke from efforts to enforce judgments that have expired.further,in revelstoke view,the relational element is met because its motion in the northern district of texas seeks to vindicate this interest,while hilao motion for an extension in the district of hawaii seeks to thwart it.hilao counters that revelstoke interest is solely concerned with property in texas that is the subject of a separate lawsuit unrelated to the subject matter of mdl torture,summary execution and disappearance of thousands of filipinos at the hands of ferdinand marcos.
we review de novo the district court denial of intervention as of right,southern california edison,at,and are guided by the maxim that the requirements for intervention are broadly interpreted in favor of intervention.see,city of los angeles,at.
we conclude that revelstoke had the right to intervene on the record adduced.hilao interposed no objection to intervention,which implicitly conceded the significance of a protectable interest related to her motion to extend the district court ruled without reference to rule a or the factors that frame the significant interest analysis.of the reasons jurisdiction over the matters in texas,the texas litigation had not been sent to the district of hawaii,and nothing that happens in the district of hawaii can affect the mdl judgment in first two have no relevance to intervention and the third can not be right.whether the mdl judgment is alive or dead is directly at issue in the texas litigation.as hilao acknowledges,it was this question that precipitated her request in mdl for an extension,and,in turn,a request in the enforcement action for a stay.her papers in the northern district of texas point out that a decision on this issue by the district of hawaii will effectively pretermit the outcome of revelstoke motion to dismiss.in these circumstances,we are satisfied that revelstoke has a significant interest that is protected by law,and that is actually affected as a practical matter by the resolution of hilao request for relief.
we are not persuaded otherwise by hilao position on appeal.she puts a good deal of weight on united states alisal water,cir,where a judgment creditor tried to intervene in an environmental enforcement action in which he had no interest except for the prospect that an award of penalties in the remedial phase might impair his ability to collect the debt.we thought this too remote from the core issues involved in the litigation,and in any event,believed the creditor interest would not be impaired because a separate process for approving claims was in place.however,the alisal scenario is quite different from the situation here.no doubt revelstoke interest like the alisal creditor interest would have been too distant for intervention before hilao invoked the district of hawaii jurisdiction over the mdl judgment in response to revelstoke position in the northern district of texas but once hilao sought relief with respect to the life of the judgment in mdl,and a stay with respect to the same issue in the northern district of texas where it initially surfaced,revelstoke conjectural interest became concrete.
by the same token,we see no compelling reason why revelstoke can not have a sufficient interest in the life of the judgment to intervene in a discrete proceeding as to that particular issue,even though it lacks an interest in the litigation as a whole.alisal recognized this precise possibility.at observing that prior cases suggest that a party interest in a specific phase of a proceeding may support intervention at that particular stage of the lawsuit see also city of los angeles,at noting that an intervenor protectable interest might shift if the scope of the litigation is restructured.revelstoke interest in participating in an mdl proceeding did not arise until hilao motion to extend effectively transferred the forum for determining the life of the mdl judgment from the northern district of texas to the district of hawaii.absent that preemptive strike,the issue was before the northern district of texas for decision.the registering court could have resolved the issue which event revelstoke would have had a place at the elected to defer to the district of hawaii by staying its hand until the parties had it out before the court that had rendered the which case revelstoke would also have had a say.it follows that if revelstoke interest in having a judgment lien removed from its property enables it to contest enforceability of the judgment in the collection action itself,revelstoke is entitled to do so wherever that issue turns out to be joined.as it turned out here,this was in mdl.
finally,hilao suggests that revelstoke interest is not entirely impaired or impeded because the district court extension order has no direct effect on the eventual ruling of the northern district of texas.while this is so with respect to the merits of the enforcement action,her own papers suggest the opposite with respect to the threshold issue of whether the mdl judgment was alive at the time of registration.of course we can not say for sure what the northern district of texas will do once its stay is lifted,but hilao representation to that court manifests her belief that the registering court will defer to the rendering court on the issue of extending its own judgment.hilao relies on cases where courts have rejected intervention founded on concerns about the stare decisis or collateral estoppel effect of a decision,such as bethune plaza,lumpkin,cir,and purcell bankatlantic financial,cir.but there is an important difference between a interest in avoiding bad precedent or obtaining a favorable opinion the situation in bethune or in influencing the outcome of another proceeding in which one has only a collateral interest the situation in purcell and the interest that a real party in interest has in adjudicating an issue it has raised in one proceeding that lands in another proceeding for disposition.in the former case,the interest is abstract and indirect in the latter case,the party interest is particularized and direct.
consequently,we conclude that revelstoke asserts an interest in not having its property executed upon pursuant to a judgment that has expired this interest is significant,and protected by law hrs as applied through the texas statute of limitations.civ.prac.a and there is a direct relationship between its legally protected interest and hilao claim in the ancillary proceeding that the mdl judgment has not expired.this means that revelstoke had a right to intervene and be heard on the merits we could remand,but see no point in doing so.revelstoke seeks to protect its own interests,the merits are fully briefed,and no other party in mdl has any interest in the controversy between hilao and revelstoke.therefore,we turn to the order extending the mdl judgment.
revelstoke argues that hrs means what it says a judgment expires within ten years unless extended before expiration that the hawaii supreme court said so in international savings loan ass wiig,and that the district court clearly erred in resurrecting the mdl judgment in after it expired in february.we agree.on its face,hrs plainly states that all judgments are extinguished after ten years unless timely renewed.the supreme court has authoritatively declared that the burden is on the judgment creditor to seek judicial extension of the judgment prior to expiration of the period,and that if she fails to secure an extension within the ten years,the judgment and all the rights and remedies appurtenant to that judgment terminate.wiig,at.
hilao does not argue to the contrary.instead,she defends the order on other grounds,namely,the mdl judgment did not expire until january,when the ninth circuit mandate issued the mdl judgment was renewed,and thus extended,every time it was registered in another court partial collection tolled or renewed the judgment the mdl judgment is not governed by an statute state statutes that would impede the ability of federal courts to ensure collectability of federal judgments based on federal causes of action can not be enforced because of the supremacy clause the judgment would not have lapsed in any event as it was not rendered until january,and good cause existed for extending the mdl judgment.in effect,hilao position is that a federal judgment is free of state limitations and can be enforced forever.for this she cites no authority,and nothing she argues persuades us to accept her view.
section,the federal statute under which hilao registered the mdl judgment in the northern district of texas for supplemental enforcement proceedings,has no limitations period.however,it does provide that a registered judgment shall have the same effect as a judgment of the district court of the district where registered and may be enforced in like manner.rule a is to the same effect,providing that the procedure on execution is to be in accordance with the procedure of the state in which the district court is located at the time the remedy is sought.likewise,the rules of decision act,requires application of state statutes of limitations unless a timeliness rule drawn from elsewhere in federal law should be applied.see agency holding,d so holding.this is the understanding upon which we,and other courts,have proceeded in similar circumstances,looking to the law of the registration forum for its statute of limitations on enforcement of judgments.see,duchek jacob
