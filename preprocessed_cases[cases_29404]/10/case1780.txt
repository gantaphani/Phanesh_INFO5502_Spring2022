this fourth appeal in a complex class action is confined to a single postjudgment order denying the defendant motion to modify the calculation of prejudgment interest in the judgment.we affirm.
procedural background 
the plaintiffs are former or current claims representatives working for farmers insurance exchange hereafter fie,who filed this action october,seeking unpaid overtime compensation under labor code section.they alleged that fie had wrongfully refused to pay overtime compensation for a period beginning on october.in a ruling on a motion for summary adjudication,the trial court upheld the plaintiffs contention that their employee class was subject to the overtime regulations of the industrial welfare commission.we affirmed the trial court ruling in our decision in bell farmers ins.exchange th,d.
following the adjudication of the plaintiffs nonexempt status,the trial court conducted a series of hearings on management of the damages phase of the trial and referred certain matters to a special master.the proceedings led to a brief jury trial in which expert witnesses presented testimony regarding the statistical determination of damages.on july,the jury returned a special verdict finding that unpaid overtime compensation owed to the class was and unpaid compensation was.the trial court entered a judgment on the verdict,which incorporated by reference a plan of distribution of the damages submitted by the plaintiffs and an order re plan of distribution that modified the plan in certain respects.pursuant to provisions in the plan of distribution,the judgment awarded prejudgment interest in the maximum amount of based on a percent interest rate provided in civil code section for the recovery of damages for breach of contract.
in a subsequent appeal,we affirmed the judgment in most respects,reversing only the judgment for unpaid compensation and directing that the plan of distribution be modified to give the claims administrator more power to investigate possibly excessive claims.bell farmers ins.exchange th,d.following remand of the case,fie filed a motion for a nunc pro tunc order to determine the amount of prejudgment interest or,in the alternative,to correct clerical error in the judgment.the motion claimed that prejudgment interest should be calculated by using the percent interest rate specified by california constitution,article xv,section.the trial court denied the motion in an order entered january,that did not reach the merits of fie legal argument but instead ruled that the motion was barred on procedural grounds.
discussion 
fie based its motion to amend the prejudgment interest provisions of the judgment on the contention that a percent prejudgment interest rate was first authorized by the enactment of labor code section,effective january,which incorporated the interest rate provided by civil code section for breach of contract actions.prior to this date,fie maintains that the applicable prejudgment interest rate was the percent rate provided by california constitution,article xv,section,for forbearance in the payment of money,which,the parties agree,would apply in the absence of a legislative act specifying another rate.michelson hamada th,d.fie relies on the canon of statutory interpretation that statutes are not to be given a retrospective operation unless it is clearly made to appear that such was the legislative intent.aetna cas.surety.acc.com.cal d.applying the percent rate to the period after accrual of the plaintiffs right to unpaid wages to december,and the percent rate following the enactment of labor code section,fie calculates the judgment overstated the amount of prejudgment interest by approximately million.
plaintiffs opposed the motion on three separate procedural grounds.first,the trial court lacked jurisdiction to amend the judgment second,the proposed amendment did not correct a clerical error and,third,fie waived its claim of error.furthermore,plaintiffs argue that the prejudgment interest was properly calculated by using the percent rate applying to breach of contract actions.they argue that the inclusive language of labor code section would support a retroactive application of the statute,but the language actually reflects a legislative intent to clarify the law.before section expressly required the use of the rate for prejudgment interest,this rate was still the appropriate rate for unpaid wage claims because of the contractual nature of the employment relationship.
we will briefly discuss the procedural issues and then address on its merits the question of the appropriate prejudgment interest rate.
jurisdiction following remand 
fie argues that the court retained jurisdiction to reconsider the prejudgment interest rate under the terms of the judgment in the case.it acknowledges the applicable rule when there has been a decision upon appeal,the trial court is reinvested with jurisdiction of the cause,but only such jurisdiction as is defined by the terms of the remittitur.the trial court is empowered to act only in accordance with the direction of the reviewing court action which does not conform to those directions is void.hampton superior court cal d,butler superior court th,d.nevertheless,fie contends that the judgment set only the maximum amount of interest and thus preserved trial court jurisdiction to adopt a lower interest rate.
the record does not support this contention.the judgment filed september,adopted the plaintiffs plan of distribution except as modified in a separate order re plan of distribution.the plan of distribution provided that the claims administrator would separately calculate the prejudgment interest of each claimant,employing a percent interest rate once the class members backpay claims shares are calculated for each class member who submits a claim form,the claims administrator will add periodic prejudgment interest through the date of judgment for each class member,to determine the prejudgment interest claim share for that class member.the order re plan of distribution provided that the judgment shall include prejudgment interest in the maximum amount of,plus daily interest.reflecting a recognition that the amount of interest would be contingent on the nature of the claims presented to the claims administrator,the order further provided if the total amount of prejudgment interest determined by the claims administrator as payable to all claiming class members under the plan of distribution is less than the total prejudgment interest awarded by the court as set out in the preceding sentence,however,farmers may seek to amend the judgment to allow it to recover the difference if any between the total amount awarded by the court as prejudgment interest and the total lesser amount payable to claiming class members as determined by the claims administrator under the plan of distribution.the judgment itself incorporated verbatim these provisions in the order re plan of distribution.
we see no ambiguity in this record.the trial court retained jurisdiction to amend the judgment only if the individual calculations of the claims administrator should fall short of the award of prejudgment interest in the maximum amount of.on appeal,we affirmed the judgment except for the portion awarding damages for unpaid hours and remanded the order re plan of distribution for consideration of matters having no connection with the calculation of prejudgment interest.our decision provided that i n all other respects,the postjudgment orders subject to appeal are affirmed.bell farmers ins.exchange,supra,th,d,fn.omitted.we therefore conclude that the trial court properly ruled that it had no jurisdiction to modify the prejudgment interest rate.
clerical error 
we see no merit in fie claim that the trial court possessed power to amend the prejudgment interest rate provided in the judgment as a clerical error.it is elementary that a court can always correct a clerical,as distinguished from a judicial error which appears on the face of a decree by a nunc pro tunc order.citation.it can not,however,change an order which has become final even though made in error,if in fact the order made was that intended t
