plaintiffs,an uncertified class of individuals whose financial assets escheated to the controller office pursuant to california unclaimed property law upl,cal.civ.proc.code,et,sued alleging insufficient notice and mishandling of their property.defendants are kathleen connell,richard chivaro,steve westly,and george deleon collectively,the controller for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the district court denial without prejudice of plaintiffs motion for a permanent injunction requiring the state to pay interest on unclaimed property at california alternative borrowing rate and partial summary judgment determining that the eleventh amendment bars plaintiffs restitution claims and dismissing former controller westly as a defendant in his individual capacity.however,we reverse the district court rulings that the state is constitutionally required to pay interest when it returns property to owners under the upl and that the eleventh amendment does not bar plaintiffs from being awarded such interest retroactively.
background 
statutory framework 
title of the california code of civil procedure governs unclaimed property located within california.see cal.civ.proc.code,et.its purpose is to provide for the receipt,custody,investment,management,disposal,escheat and permanent escheat of various classes of unclaimed property id.escheat means the vesting in the state of title to property the whereabouts of whose owner is unknown or whose owner is unknown subject to the right of claimants to appear and claim the escheated property id.
c.permanent escheat means the absolute vesting in the state of title to property pursuant to judicial determination,pursuant to a proceeding of escheat as provided by chapter of title,or pursuant to operation of law and the barring of all claims to the property by the former owner thereof or his successors.id.d.
during the time in which plaintiffs submitted their claims to the controller office for return of their escheated assets,california code of civil procedure c stated 
the controller shall add interest at the rate of percent or the bond equivalent rate of united states treasury bills,whichever is lower,to the amount of any claim paid the owner under this section for the period the property was on deposit in the unclaimed property fund.no interest shall be payable for any period prior to january.any interest required to be paid by the state pursuant to this section shall be computed as simple interest,not compound interest.for purposes of this section,the bond equivalent rate of united states treasury bills shall be defined in accordance with the following criteria 
the bond equivalent rate of united states treasury bills established at the first auction held during the month of january shall apply for the following july to december,inclusive.
the bond equivalent rate of united states treasury bills established at the first auction held during the month of july shall apply for the following january to june,inclusive.
since august,however,c has stated no interest shall be payable on any claim paid under this chapter.
the controller office must deposit proceeds from the sale of escheated property in the unclaimed property fund in an abandoned property account.id.a.at least monthly,the controller office must also transfer to california general fund all money in the abandoned property account in excess of.id.c.
b.the class 
plaintiffs allege that the controller wrongfully appropriated,misused,sold,and refused to relinquish their financial assets.in their first amended complaint,they claim that the controller unlawfully employed auditors to pressure certain financial institutions into paying or turning over assets that were not properly subject to escheat.for example,these financial institutions purportedly had knowledge of some of plaintiffs addresses when the transfers occurred.moreover,the controller allegedly failed to provide the requisite notice to plaintiffs,thereby preventing them from reclaiming their property before its liquidation.after,plaintiffs assert,the controller implemented a policy of publishing only block advertisements rather than listing the specific names and addresses of putative owners,in violation of california code of civil procedure.the controller also allegedly stopped mailing direct notices to owners last known addresses.
the first amended complaint further alleges that the controller misused the property it unlawfully seized.for instance,plaintiffs assert that the controller unconstitutionally applied legislation retroactively,thereby appropriating compound interest that had accrued on escheated property.meanwhile,the controller purportedly refused to pay any interest at all on escheated cashier checks and dividends.nor,according to plaintiffs,did the controller properly register or notify owners of escheated cashier checks,or properly segregate the money in the unclaimed property fund from the money in the general fund.the controller also allegedly destroyed documents pertaining to proof of ownership as well as the contents of safety deposit boxes,again without notice.
plaintiffs claim that these unlawful acts amount to a conspiracy on the controller part to obtain funds with which to mitigate california longstanding budget crisis.through this conspiracy,the controller allegedly permitted several companies,regulated entities,and financial institutions to unlawfully withhold over billion in personal property.rather than promulgating any formal rules to authorize these actions,the controller switched internal policies repeatedly,failed to provide any notice,and insulated itself from public accountability.in doing so,plaintiffs allege,the controller violated not only the federal due process,takings,and contracts clauses,but also federal and state securities statutes and the upl itself.
plaintiffs cite the violations as supporting their claim for declaratory relief,which in turn,they assert,would require the controller to disgorge or return either their property or the reasonable value thereof.in addition,plaintiffs allege two claims based on procedural due process and the takings clause.specifically,plaintiffs assert that the controller violated procedural due process by appropriating and liquidating assets without adequate notice,and that these same actions also constitute a taking that requires the state to pay just compensation.plaintiffs also allege that they deserve the proper value of their property,which should be valued according to the applicable principles of law for reimbursement purposes,and that they are entitled to an accounting of their appropriated property attorneys fees creation of a common fund for return of their property with proper interest and injunctive relief to require the return of their property and to prevent the controller continued violation of federal constitutional or statutory law.
finally,plaintiffs allege several state law actions negligence,fraud,a taxpayer claim,breach of fiduciary duty,and violation of the upl.these violations purportedly warrant payment of restitution in the amount of the difference between the proceeds of the sale of their unclaimed property and the current market value,as well as punitive damages.plaintiffs also assert that the state claims warrant injunctive relief to require the controller prospective compliance with the upl.
status of individual plaintiffs claims for escheated property 
in,plaintiff agnes suever now deceased and represented in this lawsuit by her daughter,plaintiff madonna suever,who held general and financial power of attorney over her purchased a cashier check from world savings and loan bank in the amount of.she then forgot about the check,which fell under a piece of heavy furniture for quite some time.the check escheated to the state in october.according to the declaration of the chief of the division of collections at the controller office,t he fact that the controller reimbursed world savings for the full amount of the cashier check that had previously escheated to the state indicates that agnes suever reclaimed her property from world savings rather than the controller.if suever reclaimed her property from the state,the state would have paid her the statutory rate of interest then in effect.
in november,shares of plaintiff steve tucker intel stock escheated to the state.he alleges that his stock was seized by the controller without notice,his knowledge or consent,and while he was living in england as an english citizen.in,the state returned to tucker,including in interest.he claims that he is entitled to roughly double the interest he actually received because the state was able to avoid borrowing costs while it held his property.
plaintiff alexander vondjidis purchased stock from hewlett packard hp when he worked in hp office in athens,greece,in the.he stopped working for hp in,and the athens office closed in the early.his stock escheated in.in,he filed a claim for it,and the controller returned to him,including in interest.
general electric transferred stock owned by plaintiffs richard and seitzinger to the state in.the seitzingers submitted a claim for the shares in september,and the controller returned to them,including in interest.
plaintiff johnstone daughter,plaintiff lynn keith,holds power of attorney over that the controller destroyed documentary evidence transferred to the state by a trust company that would have established their family interest in railroad rights of way.the controller records show that the trust company sold the railroad rights of way in and could not locate certain beneficiaries of the trust,including whitley father and grandfather,to pay them their share of the sale proceeds.in,the controller paid whitley and a relative each,plus an additional each,which although not specifically designated as such appears to be interest.
plaintiff richard valdes was an individual shareholder,taxpayer,and former president of columbia yacht corporation who claims that the controller seized shares of stock he owned in columbia yacht.he alleges that,when he sought return of these shares,t he controller office informed him that all their records pertaining to his stock w ere deliberately destroyed pursuant to the controller unwritten document destruction policy.the controller asserts that valdes admits that all of the shares he now claims are identified as belonging to other people,not him,and he admits that he knows of no documents that could prove his claim.however,valdez maintains that because of either poor record keeping or deliberate wrongdoing,when the shares were seized,they were listed under the name columbia yacht shareholders instead of the individual names.it is true,though,as the controller points out,that valdes has admitted in a related case that it is possible,but not probable that his memory regarding his ownership of the shares is inaccurate.
prior relevant proceedings 
in,counsel for plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the case of taylor connell seeking on behalf of different plaintiffs in the eastern district of california the return of stock or refund of proceeds held by the controller,alleging violations of,inter alia,the due process clause,federal securities acts,and state law.see no.civ.fcd ggh,wl,at.june.after the district court dismissed the action on eleventh amendment grounds,id.at,we vacated the judgment and remanded,concluding 
because the plaintiffs seek genuinely prospective relief,and because the funds they seek are held by the state as custodian in trust for them rather than as the state own funds,much as a municipality holds a car towed from an expired parking meter,the complaint should not have been dismissed under the eleventh amendment for lack of jurisdiction.
taylor westly taylor i,cir.the taylor i panel further stated,however,that the eleventh amendment did bar the plaintiffs retroactive requests for money,and also noted we need not decide the issue of sovereign immunity in the context of a takings claim,since we have already decided that plaintiffs property has not been taken at all,but has merely been held in trust for them by the controller.id.at.
meanwhile,in november,prior to our decision in taylor i,the district court in the present case granted the controller motion to dismiss this action,without leave to amend,on the ground that the eleventh amendment barred the claims alleged.on appeal,we issued our decision in suever i,which,based on the ruling in taylor i,likewise vacated the district court eleventh amendment ruling because the class request that the controller return the members property is not barred by the state sovereign immunity.suever i,at.while the suever i panel gave examples of some claims that could go forward and others that were clearly barred,it elected not to parse all of the averments of the first amended complaint or to opine on every potential claim.id.at.
on remand,the controller moved for judgment on the pleadings,asking the district court to answer the questions left open by the suever i panel regarding which claims could proceed and which could not,and the district court granted the motion in part in november.plaintiffs subsequently moved for partial summary judgment on several issues,largely based on the argument that it is beyond factual dispute that the state engaged in conduct that we had previously declared unlawful.see taylor i,at stating that the plaintiffs allege d actions that would fall outside the scope of the controller statutory authority to such an extent as to be ultra vires suever i,at noting that the first amended complaint alleges both that the controller acted ultra vires by improperly seizing property ineligible for escheat and that the controller acted unconstitutionally by providing inadequate notice to property owners whose property was to be escheated taylor westly taylor ii,cir granting plaintiffs a preliminary injunction in part because the likelihood of success on the merits wa s high regarding their unconstitutional notice claim 
the district court october,order granted partial summary judgment to plaintiffs on their claim that the state may not constitutionally withhold interest when it returns property to owners under the upl.the district court otherwise denied plaintiffs claims for a declaration on the merits that the notice provisions of the upl and the controller practices thereunder are unconstitutional a declaration on the merits that the controller has taken possession of property outside the scope of the upl and an order that the controller begin the process of promulgating regulations that will govern how persons may present and perfect a claim under the upl.
on october,the district court issued an order denying plaintiffs motion for class certification,which had been heard at the same time as the motion for partial summary judgment.the district court also denied in november a request by the controller for leave to seek reconsideration of the ruling that interest is constitutionally required.
in its april,order,the district court granted the controller motion to certify for interlocutory appeal its earlier ruling that the state is constitutionally required to pay interest when it returns property to owners under the upl granted plaintiffs motion to amend the class definition but denied without prejudice their motion to certify the class and denied plaintiffs request for a permanent injunction requiring the state to pay interest at california alterative borrowing rate.the district court also granted in part and denied in part the controller motion for partial summary judgment.specifically,the district court granted the controller motion regarding plaintiffs claim for retroactive restitution in the amount of the difference between the proceeds of the sale of their unclaimed property and the current market value dismissal of former controller westly as a defendant in his individual capacity plaintiffs taxpayer and state law claims and plaintiffs motion to compel further discovery responses.however,the district court denied without prejudice the controller request for a determination that the upl,as amended,is now rejected the controller statute of limitations argument and denied the controller requests for a protective order and for sanctions arising from its contention that plaintiffs have improperly obtained and used privileged documents.
e.the consolidated appeals 
on appeal,plaintiffs challenge the district court denial without prejudice of their motion for a permanent injunction requiring the state to pay interest on unclaimed property at california alternative borrowing rate and partial summary judgment determining that the eleventh amendment bars plaintiffs restitution claims and dismissing former controller westly as a defendant in his individual capacity.the controller,meanwhile,challenges the district court partial summary judgment rulings that the state is constitutionally required to pay interest when it returns property to owners under the upl and that the eleventh amendment does not bar plaintiffs from being awarded such interest retroactively.

iii.discussion 
prospective interest under the upl 
the controller challenges the district court october,ruling that the state is constitutionally required to pay interest when it returns property to owners under the upl.plaintiffs,on the other hand,challenge the district court april,denial of their motion for a permanent injunction requiring the state to pay interest on unclaimed property at california alternative borrowing rate.because,as discussed below,intervening ninth circuit precedent has held that the state is not constitutionally required to pay any interest under the upl,we need not reach the issue regarding the appropriate rate of such interest.
after the district court october,order,and after the filing of the opening briefs in this case,we squarely rejected the proposition that property owners have a compensable fifth amendment right to interest earned on unclaimed property that escheats to the state of california.turnacliff westly,cir.in turnacliff,the plaintiff,in his capacity as administrator of an estate,alleged that the controller improperly calculated the interest due to the estate for the time that the state of california held the estate unclaimed property.id.at.in the alternative,he also argued that 
if the controller construction of california code of civil procedure c was correct,then the controller violated the takings clause of the fifth amendment by failing to pay just compensation for taking the estate property.turnacliff contends that,under the traditional common law rule that interest follows the principal,any and all interest that the unclaimed property earned while held by california belongs to the estate.turnacliff further maintains that,to the extent that the property did not earn actual interest,the estate is entitled to constructive interest.
the turnacliff panel first held that the controller had properly calculated interest under california code of civil procedure c.id.next,the panel rejected the plaintiff fifth amendment argument because a ssuming,arguendo,that the estate had a cognizable property right to interest earned by its escheated property,and that this property was taken by california,no further compensation is due to the estate because when the estate abandoned its property,it forfeited any right to interest earned by that property.id.at footnote omitted.in support of this conclusion,the panel reasoned 
in texaco,short,d,the court explained that f rom an early time,th e court has recognized that states have the power to permit unused or abandoned interests in property to revert to another after the passage of time.the court further explained that owners of abandoned property were not owed compensation 
in ruling that private property may be deemed to be abandoned and to lapse upon the failure of its owner to take reasonable actions imposed by law,this court has never required the state to compensate the owner for the consequences of his own neglect it is the owner failure to make any use of the not the action of the causes the lapse of the property right.
though short concerned abandoned mineral interests,the principle articulated in that case applies with equal force to this case involving commercial paper.to the extent that it was even entitled to it,the estate has received just compensation,because california returned the estate abandoned property,with interest of.the estate has no fifth amendment right to actual or constructive interest earned by its property while held by the state california need not further compensate the estate for the consequences of the estate neglect.
turnacliff,at emphasis added.
apparently in light of the intervening turnacliff decision,plaintiffs concede that w hether the upl requires the payment of interest on genuinely abandoned property under a constitutional upl is not before the court in this appeal,and is irrelevant.as previously noted,we have declared that the current version of the upl is facially constitutional.taylor iii,at.thus,insofar as the district court october,order requires prospective payment of interest,or payment of interest on any claims for unclaimed property that escheated under the current version of the upl,both parties now appear to agree that turnacliff requires reversal,as do we.
retroactive interest 
plaintiffs standing to seek retroactive interest 
in its appeal,the controller contends that plaintiffs lack standing to seek retroactive interest under the version of the upl because none of them who made a valid claim for unclaimed property has been denied interest.we disagree.
the irreducible constitutional minimum of article iii standing has three elements 
first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical,second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and conduct complained injury has to be fairly trace able to the challenged action of the defendant,and not th e result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
lujan defenders of wildlife,d alterations in original.here,as the district court explained in its november order denying the controller motion for leave to seek reconsideration,the controller concedes that plaintiff agnes suever did not receive interest when she reclaimed the amount of her cashier check.the controller asserts that she would have received interest if she had made her claim to the controller rather than to world savings and loan bank.however,plaintiffs dispute this assertion,arguing that the controller has never paid interest on cashier checks,and that the controller argument is belied by not only the assignment agreement,which clearly contemplates the payment of interest,but by the upl itself,which does not differentiate between payment of a claim to the owner or an assignee.
in addition,as noted in the district court november order,plaintiff richard valdes alleges that the controller has failed even to acknowledge that it holds his property,let alone to return either principal or interest.although the controller argues that valdes claim lacks merit,citing his deposition testimony to the effect that it is possible,but not probable that his memory is inaccurate,the question of whether valdes is likely to prevail is a separate issue from standing.further,there is no apparent dispute that if valdes were able to
