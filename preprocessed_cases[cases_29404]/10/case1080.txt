plaintiff john loos appeals the district court dismissal of his securities fraud class action for failure to state a claim.plaintiff argues that the district court erred by analyzing his allegations of scienter in isolation rather than collectively as mandated by tellabs,makor issues rights.plaintiff further challenges the district court conclusion that he failed to establish loss causation by alleging a precipitous decline in immersion stock price on the heels of a july,press release announcing an internal investigation into the company revenue accounting practices.
we hold that the announcement of an investigation,standing alone,is insufficient to establish loss causation.we further conclude that plaintiff can not establish loss causation on the facts alleged in the amended complaint because he has not attempted to correlate his losses to anything other than the announcement of an internal investigation.we therefore affirm the district court on this loss causation issue.we do not reach plaintiff arguments regarding scienter.

we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.we review the dismissal of a securities fraud claim under federal rule of civil procedure b de novo.zucco partners,llc digimarc,cir.the scope of our review is generally limited to the face of the complaint,materials incorporated into the complaint by reference,and matters of which we may take judicial notice.id.dismissal without leave to amend is reviewed for abuse of discretion.id.
section b of the securities exchange act of makes it unlawful to use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.b.sec rule,which implements b,prohibits the following practices in connection with the purchase or sale of any security

b to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading,or 
c to engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person.
violations of b and rule give rise to a cause of action in favor of any purchaser or seller of securities who has been injured by a company fraudulent practices.tellabs,makor issues rights.there are six elements to a securities fraud claim under b and rule a material misrepresentation or omission scienter,a wrongful state of mind a connection between the misrepresentation and the purchase or sale of a security reliance upon the misrepresentation often established in cases via a presumption that the price of securities reflects all information in the public domain economic loss and loss causation.dura pharmaceuticals,broudo.
at issue here is the element of loss causation.broadly speaking,loss causation refers to the causal relationship between a material misrepresentation and the economic loss suffered by an investor.id.at.ultimately,a securities fraud plaintiff must prove that the defendant misrepresentation was a substantial cause of his or her financial loss.in re daou,cir.at the pleading stage,however,the plaintiff need only allege that the decline in the defendant stock price was proximately caused by a revelation of fraudulent activity rather than by changing market conditions,changing investor expectations,or other unrelated factors.metzler inv.gmbh corinthian,cir.in other words,the plaintiff must plausibly allege that the defendant fraud was revealed to the market and caused the resulting losses.id.at emphasis added.
plaintiff overarching theory of liability is that immersion cooked the books in response to mounting pressure from investors to become profitable.specifically,plaintiff alleges that immersion systematically recognized medical sales revenue earlier than permitted under gaap in order to mislead investors into believing that the company was on the cusp of finally achieving sustained profitability.as a result of this practice,plaintiff contends,immersion stock price remained artificially inflated throughout the class period.
with regard to loss causation,plaintiff alleges that immersion fraudulent accounting was revealed to the market through a series of partial disclosures consisting of disappointing earnings results for,and and the subsequent announcement of an internal investigation into prior revenue transactions.the gravamen of plaintiff loss causation theory is that immersion disappointing financial results signaled that the company lacked the growth drivers and profitability that it had previously claimed,and that the subsequent announcement of an investigation into prior revenue transactions confirmed that immersion had fraudulently overstated its historical revenues.most notably for purposes of the instant case,plaintiff alleges that immersion july,announcement of an internal investigation completed the revelation of fraud to the market and removed all inflation from the company stock price

our decision in daou does not dictate a different result.like plaintiff,the investors in daou alleged that their losses were caused,at least in part,by the defendant announcement of dismal financial results.at.according to the investors,these disappointing results were the direct result of the defendant systematically recognizing revenue prematurely in violation of gaap.id.at.the district court dismissed the complaint,ruling that the investors had not adequately linked the disappointing earnings and the ensuing drop in the defendant share price to the alleged accounting fraud.id.
