opinion of the court 
this appeal raises important questions concerning the use of sealed bids in auctions conducted to select lead counsel in class action lawsuits.the genesis of the appeal lies in the district court selection of lead counsel in the cendant prides securities litigation based on the results of a competitive bidding process.the core of the dispute involves a confidentiality order in which the district court decided to seal the bids until resolution of the case.the order was issued in connection with an in camera hearing where plaintiffs attorneys,but not the general public,had access to the bids.after learning that one of the unsuccessful bidding attorneys,howard sirota,had spoken to a reporter from the new york times about the bidding process,the district court fined sirota.sirota appeals the sanction.because we conclude that the district court failed to articulate the necessary findings for the issuance of the confidentiality order,and because we find that,in any case,sirota did not violate the order,we will vacate the sanction 
some explanation of the underlying securities litigation provides a helpful background for the proceeding resulting in the sanction against sirota.because a full procedural and factual background of the cendant litigation is set forth in numerous published opinions we will only discuss the facts most relevant to the resolution of the issues presented in this appeal.briefly,on april,cendant corporation announced that it had uncovered substantial accounting irregularities and would have to restate reported annual and quarterly earnings for and possibly earlier as a result,cendant stock plummeted.some lawsuits mostly class actions were filed against cendant,its officers and directors all but one were consolidated.
on may,a preliminary case management scheduling order established a schedule for motions to address the appointment of lead counsel for the class.among the fifteen motions filed was one submitted by sirota,together with john barry and charles carella,to have their clients,the joanne aboff family trust aboff and douglass wilson,appointed as lead plaintiffs and to have themselves appointed lead counsel.
after considering the motions,the district court outlined a process for selecting lead plaintiff and lead counsel.first,the district court applied a statutory presumption that the plaintiff with the largest financial interest in the litigation should be appointed lead plaintiff.see in re cendant,citing a b.because of a possible conflict of interest,the district court determined that a separate lead plaintiff would be appointed to pursue claims involving income and growth prides prides,derivative securities based on cendant common stock see id.at.neither aboff nor wilson was selected as a lead plaintiff.
second,in selecting lead counsel,the district court adopted a competitive bidding system,reasoning that the most effective way to establish reasonable attorney fees is through marketplace competition.id.at.the district court therefore ordered an auction to determine the lowest qualified bidder to represent the class as counsel.id.at.to be considered,plaintiffs attorneys were required to submit bids under seal,stating,among other things,their professional qualifications and the fee arrangement that would be acceptable to them should they be selected as lead counsel.the record as of this date reveals that all bids remain under seal.
on october,the district court selected separate lead counsel for the claims and for the prides claims sirota and his were not selected.in choosing lead counsel,the district court stressed the need for confidentiality.following an in camera hearing,attended only by applicants for the two lead counsel positions,plaintiffs attorneys,the court distributed an opinion containing a confidentiality order.the court ordered the identities of the bidders and the nature of their proposals sealed until the conclusion of the case,referring to the proposals only by number and explaining 
it is of utmost concern to the court that this opinion,the bidders identities and the contents of their bids be sealed until resolution of this matter.this is done to maintain adversarial integrity,that of strategy and tactics,which is the prerogative of all parties,plaintiffs and defendants.
in re cendant,opinion selecting lead counsel.as a result of the in camera hearing and the confidentiality order,plaintiffs attorneys,but not the general public,had access to each others bids.
thereafter,on november,the district court separated the prides claims from the rest of the cendant case.in an order entered on march,the district court preliminarily approved a proposed settlement of the prides case presented by lead counsel and cendant.the proposed settlement provided that,in return for dismissal and release of all claims,cendant would confer upon each class member who opted in,one right worth for each prides held at the close of business on april,giving the settlement an aggregate theoretical value of million.the march,order also approved the form and content of notice to be distributed to class members regarding the settlement.that notice stated that lead counsel would apply for attorneys fees,to be paid in rights,in an amount not to exceed of the million theoretical value of the settlement.to this effect,the notice contained the following assurance 
you also should know that the lead counsel appointment process included a bidding process.this was intended to assure that the largest possible portion of any recovery remained with participating class members,or conversely that qualified lead counsel took the least possible sums from the benefits to be obtained by participating class members.in lead counsel view,under the fee mechanism proposed by lead counsel and described herein,there is a substantial likelihood that a substantial part,if not all,of the fees sought will be obtained from unclaimed rights and opt out rights.as a consequence,in lead counsel view,those class members who become authorized claimants will not have to pay any of lead counsel fees,or if they do,there is a substantial likelihood that it will be less than the amount otherwise payable under the bids approved by the court in the process of appointing lead counsel.
in re cendant.prides,slip op.at,emphasis added order regarding proposed class action settlement,settlement hearing and notice of proposed settlement.
besides preliminary approval and notice,the order of march,also provided that any class member wishing to object to the settlement or to the lead counsel fee application should file written objections with the district court.on may,sirota,along with,filed objections on behalf of aboff to the proposed settlement and to lead counsel application for fees.in particular,the brief submitted by sirota argued that the million fee lead counsel seeks far exceeds the fee lead counsel agreed to accept in the bidding auction.
on may,the new york times published an article stating,sirota calculates that the value of lead counsel proposed fee would be million,and argues that it would thus be about percent of the total settlement fund a percentage he contends greatly exceeds the confidential bid that lead counsel submitted to the court last year.diana henriques,lawyers handling litigation against cendant propose an innovative way to pay their fees,times,may,at.seeing this article,the district court issued an order to show cause why sirota should not be held in contempt and sanctioned for violations of this court confidentiality order of october.
on may,the district court held a hearing on the order to show cause,focusing on whether sirota apparent statement to the new york times concerning lead counsel bid violated the october,confidentiality order.defending himself,sirota explained that he had no intention to violate the confidentiality order he had simply told a reporter from the new york times that he had filed an objection with the district court he did not make any substantive comments to the reporter the newspaper article merely referred to arguments made in his written objection of may,and sirota believed that the relative comparisons made in the written objection had been authorized by the district court march,order.as to the last point,sirota noted that the march,order which preliminarily approved the settlement of the prides case,also approved a form of notice stating lead counsel belief that the attorneys fees would be less than provided for by the bidding process.thus,sirota argued that it was reasonable for him to believe that the confidentiality order did not prohibit him from responding to lead counsel contention that the proposed fee was less than the bid by arguing that it was actually more than the bid 
because of the notice,the defendants and everyone else knew the relative magnitude of the fee sought and that according to lead counsel it was not more than the bid.the rationale of keeping the defendants from knowing the amount of the compensation of their adversary,i thought,was over as reflected in the court authorized notice and reflected in lead counsel understanding that one could make claims.lead counsel made the claim in the notice the court invited objections in the notice and we came and said truthfully he is asking for more than his bid.
thereafter,the district court stated that it had no problem with sirota making this argument in court,but that speaking to the press was different.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the district court determined that finding sirota in contempt was unwarranted.nevertheless,relying on local civil rule and on its inherent power to discipline attorneys,the district court imposed sanctions on sirota for violating the confidentiality order.the district court explained 
why am i doing that because having you yourself admitted to twenty years before a bar if not the new jersey bar,i hold you to that of a reasonable attorney who,when confronted with a specific order of confidentiality,a specific order of confidentiality before he would broach the subject to a third party such as the press,whether generally or specifically,he should have,in good conscience or in good professionalism at least made contact with the court to insure that whatever he said did not violate the order.to come to court now and say that because there is a,the reference is made by lead counsel in the notice to claimants that one feels free to do what you did is not good enough as far as i concerned 
you have a professional obligation to,as counsel for the objector,to point out to the court your objection.i do understand it.maybe i never practiced in new york,but,i did think you had a professional obligation to point out your objection with regard to this matter to a newspaper.
the next day,may,the district court entered an order,fining sirota.
on june,sirota filed a notice of appeal from the order imposing sanctions.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to the final order doctrine of.this includes final decisions in attorney disciplinary proceedings.see in re ashton,cir in re abrams,cir 
the nominal issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in sanctioning sirota for violating the october,confidentiality order by speaking to the new york times.that issue,however,is predicated upon the more basic question of whether the confidentiality order underlying the sanction was properly issued.because of this dependent relationship,we feel compelled,before even considering the district court sanction of sirota,to first address the propriety of the confidentiality order.what constitutes the proper legal standard for granting a confidentiality order sealing bids is an issue of law,over which we exercise plenary review.see pansy borough of stroudsburg,cir.
in addition to this dependent relationship,we also have an inherent supervisory power,arising out of,to fashion and clarify rules for district courts governing the district courts power to enter confidentiality orders at the discovery stage or any other stage of litigation.see pansy,at.accordingly,there exists a sufficient basis for us to evaluate the district court efforts to preserve the secrecy of bids.in doing so,we conclude that,in deciding to seal the bids,the district court failed to recognize that the bids were judicial records,subject to the common law presumption of public access.as a result,the district court failed to articulate the necessary findings to override the presumption of access when issuing the confidentiality order.
it is that there exists,in both criminal and civil cases,a common law public right of access to judicial proceedings and records.littlejohn bic corporation,cir.the public right of access extends beyond simply the ability to attend open court proceedings.rather,it envisions a pervasive common law right to inspect and copy public records and documents,including judicial records and documents.leucadia,applied extrusion,cir.as we explained in littlejohn,the right of access strengthens confidence in the courts 
the public exercise of its common law access right in civil cases promotes public confidence in the judicial system by enhancing testimonial trustworthiness and the quality of justice dispensed by the court.as with other branches of government,the bright light cast upon the judicial process by public observation diminishes possibilities for injustice,incompetence,perjury,and fraud.furthermore,the very openness of the process should provide the public with a more complete understanding of the judicial system and a better perception of its fairness.
at citations omitted.in addition,a ccess to civil proceedings and records promotes public respect for the judicial process and helps assure that judges perform their duties in an honest and informed manner.leucadia,at citations and internal quotations omitted.
the public right of access clearly applies to the in camera hearing conducted by the district court,as that hearing was a judicial proceeding.we also believe that the right applies to the bids.whether or not a document or record is subject to the right of access turns on whether that item is considered to be a judicial record.pansy,at.the status of a document as a judicial record,in turn,depends on whether a document has been filed with the court,or otherwise somehow incorporated or integrated into a district court adjudicatory proceedings.id.at.while filing clearly establishes such status,a document may still be construed as a judicial record,absent filing,if a court interprets or enforces the terms of that document,or requires that it be submitted to the court under seal.see enprotech renda,cir but pansy,at especially relevant here is the case of leucadia,in which we held that there is a presumptive right of public access to pretrial motions of a nondiscovery nature,whether preliminary or dispositive,and the material filed in connection therewith.at.
in the present case,the district court auction procedure transformed the bids into judicial records.the district court relied on the private securities litigation reform act pslra as authority for the selection by lead plaintiffs of lead counsel.the pslra provides the most adequate plaintiff shall,subject to the approval of the court,select and retain counsel to represent the class.a b v emphasis added.viewing its approval under the pslra as a discretionary judgment,the district court ordered plaintiffs attorneys to submit bids,in re cendant,at,and the attorneys did so in direct response to the court command.while not explicitly denominated as such,the bids were essentially submitted in the form of motions to be appointed lead counsel.see id.at ordering bidders to describe why they are professionally qualified to be lead counsel.following the in camera hearing,the district court ruled,and issued an order appointing counsel.in re cendant,at.that order,a public document itself,summarized the content of the bids in an encoded chart.id.in these circumstances,we believe that,at the time of the district court confidentiality order,the bids were judicial documents subject to the common law right to access.
the practical effect of the right to access doctrine is to create an independent right for the public to view proceedings and to inspect judicial records.see pansy,at.the right of public access is particularly compelling here,because many members of the public are also plaintiffs in the class action.accordingly,all the reasons we discussed in littlejohn for the right of access to public records apply with even greater force here.see,supra.protecting the access right in class actions promotes class members confidence in the administration of the case.littlejohn,at.additionally,the right of access diminishes the possibility that injustice,incompetence,perjury,or fraud will be perpetrated against those class members who have some stake in the case but are not at the forefront of the litigation.id.finally,openness of class actions provides class members with a more complete understanding of the class action process and a better perception of its fairness.id.
indeed,the information sealed in this case and kept secret from most of the parties was of the utmost importance in the administration of the case it was directly relevant to the selection of lead counsel.this point is crucial.in class actions,the lead attorneys have an unusual amount of control over information concerning the litigation.by contrast,class members often have little input into the conduct of the class action and accompanying settlement negotiations,because of the large scale of litigation and the disconnect between defendants possibly enormous liability and the relatively small recovery available to the individual plaintiffs.the only stage at which class members can exercise effective control is in the selection of class counsel.throwing a veil of secrecy over the selection process deprives class members of that opportunity.
thus,there should have been,in the present case,a strong presumption that the bids and the in camera proceeding would be part of an open process,accessible to the public.see littlejohn,at.that presumption disallows the routine and perfunctory closing of judicial records.miller indiana,cir.our discussion,however,does not end here.
although the common law right to public access is a recognized and venerated principle,courts have also recognized the accompanying principle that the right is not absolute.littlejohn,at leucadia,at same publicker,cohen,cir same.the presumption of public access may be rebutted.see republic of philippines westinghouse,cir.every court has supervisory power over its own records and files,and access has been denied where court files might have become a vehicle for improper purposes.littlejohn,at quoting nixon warner communications,d.thus,the question becomes,under what circumstances may a district court seal judicial proceedings or documents,such as bids,by means of a confidentiality order.for this question,there are settled standards.
in order to override the common law right of access,the party seeking the closure of a hearing or the sealing of part of the judicial record bears the burden of showing that the material is the kind of information that courts will protect and that disclosure will work a clearly defined and serious injury to the party seeking closure.miller,at citing publicker,at.in delineating the injury to be prevented,specificity is essential.see publicker,at.broad allegations of harm,bereft of specific examples or articulated reasoning,are insufficient.as is often the case when there are conflicting interests,a balancing process is contemplated.t he strong common law presumption of access must be balanced against the factors militating against access.the burden is on the party who seeks to overcome the presumption of access to show that the interest in secrecy outweighs the presumption.leucadia,at quoting bank of am.trust and sav.ass hotel rittenhouse,cir.
additionally,because of the peculiar posture of class actions whereby some members of the public are also parties to the class action,and because of the importance of selection of lead counsel to class action plaintiffs,the test for overriding the right of access should be applied in this case with particular strictness.we are guided in the formation of a stricter standard by miller,where the sealing order warranted exceptional scrutiny because the district court had sealed the entire record.in that case,we held 
in a case such as this,involving ordinary civil litigation,the district court,before taking such an unusual step,should have articulated the compelling countervailing interests to be protected,made specific findings on the record concerning the effects of disclosure,and provided an opportunity for interested third parties to be heard.
miller,at citations omitted emphasis added.thus,we hold that a compelling countervailing interests standard is most appropriate here,with the additional requirement of specific findings.this may or may not require a hearing.
therefore,our emphasis here is on the district court denial of public access to the bids and proceedings in connection with the sealed bid auction employed to select lead counsel in this case,and we do not focus here nor decide on the propriety of bid auctions generally.
in re oracle sec,the district court case relied upon by the district court in the present case,admittedly is one of the earliest cases in which competitive bids for lead counsel and the propriety of sealing such bids was considered oracle opted for competitive selection of class counsel for a number of reasons which we decline to explore inasmuch as the issue of competitive selection is not presented on this appeal.suffice it to say,the reasons listed in oracle for use of competitive bidding provoke serious reservations and concerns here but we leave the decision as to whether competitive bidding is appropriate,justifiable,or desirable to the future case where that issue is directly raised.
regardless of whether bidding for lead counsel would be deemed appropriate,however,we can neither subscribe to nor affirm the district court ruling that the bidding auction the court conducted should have been closed,sealed and kept from the very parties to whom our precedents and logic advocate disclosure.indeed,this very principle was recognized in oracle,where the court refused to seal or hold secret the bids for class counsel.
the oracle court did this in part by rejecting claims that an open bidding process would allow the defendants to obtain information about lead counsel evaluation of the case and might permit them to economically squeeze lead counsel by protracting proceedings.the oracle court opined,as we do,that disclosure of class counsel bids and compensation arrangements benefits the class because,u nlike the usual situation,class members do not participate in the negotiations by which a part of their claim is bargained away.at.moreover,class members are not in a position to monitor the faithfulness of their champion.see,in re general motors.truck fuel tank prods.liab,cir where the original settlement called for lead counsel to receive attorneys fees in the amount of million,and class plaintiffs received no more than a certificate towards a gm truck.
thus,we generally believe that opening the bidding process if such a process is to be authorized,while not a panacea for the agency problems in class actions,should facilitate the monitoring of lead counsel by class members and others.the disclosure of bids also comports with the spirit of the model rules of professional conduct.see model rules of prof l conduct b requiring communication to the client of the basis or rate of the fee before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation.
we find implicit recognition of these principles in the third circuit task force report on attorneys fees.in analogous circumstances,the task force expressed concern that,when lead counsel seeks fees after a settlement has been reached,the plaintiffs attorney role changes from one of a fiduciary for the clients to that of a claimant against the fund created for the clients benefit.court awarded attorney fees,report of the third circuit task force,hereinafter task force report.the task force report accordingly recommended that district courts force the negotiation of class counsel fee,asserting the critical importance in assuring that the compensation plan is negotiated in an open and appropriately arm length manner.id.at emphasis added.
the strong presumption of public access forces district courts to be cognizant of when the reasons supporting sealing in a specific case if any are found have either passed or weakened,and to be prepared at that time to unseal bids and allow public access.even if a sealing order was proper at the time when it was initially imposed,the sealing order must be lifted at the earliest possible moment when the reasons for sealing no longer obtain.as we observed in leucadia,continued sealing must be based on current evidence to show how public dissemination of the pertinent materials now would cause the competitive harm they claim,cir emphasis added.by establishing a strong presumption in favor of an open process,we intend to instill a measure of consistency into an important area where district courts have varied widely in their practice 
the heightened standard which we have held must be applied to sealing class action bids is also supported by the language and legislative history of the pslra the pslra sets forth a detailed procedure for class members to apply to become lead plaintiffs.additionally,the pslra provides that t he most adequate plaintiff shall,subject to the approval of the court,select and retain counsel to represent the class.a b iv.
the legislative history of the pslra explains that the act purpose is 
to encourage the voluntary disclosure of information by corporate issuers to empower investors so that their primary control over private securities litigation and to encourage plaintiffs lawyers to pursue valid claims and defendants to fight abusive claims.
at,reprinted in,emphasis added.
the legislative history also points out that i nvestors in the class usually have great difficulty exercising any meaningful direction over the case brought on their behalf.the lawyers can decide when to sue and when to settle,based largely on their own financial interests,not the interests of their purported clients,at.additionally 
a securities subcommittee staff report found evidence that plaintiffs counsel in many instances litigate with a view toward ensuring payment for their services without sufficient regard to whether their clients are receiving adequate compensation in light of evidence of wrongdoing.the comment by one plaintiffs lawyer i have the greatest practice of law in the world.i have no clients.aptly summarizes this flaw in the current system.
to regulate this practice of lawyers,instead of lead plaintiffs,driving securities class actions,congress enacted the pslra,through which,s ubject to court approval,the most adequate plaintiff retains class counsel.conf,at,reprinted in.the senate committee explained this provision is intended to permit the plaintiff to choose counsel rather than have counsel choose the plaintiff,at,reprinted in,emphasis added.
congress clear intent in enacting the pslra was to transfer control of securities class actions from the attorneys to the class members through a properly selected lead plaintiff.the sealing of the bids in the lead counsel auction in this case contravenes this purpose.instead of allowing the class plaintiffs in this action to choose lead counsel,the district court selected class counsel through a sealed bidding process which has yet to be unsealed.it also prevented many class plaintiffs and defendants from accessing the bids for lead counsel.sealing the bids in this case enabled counsel to litigate with a view toward ensuring payment for their services without sufficient regard to whether their clients are receiving adequate compensation in light of evidence of wrongdoing,at 
of course,notwithstanding the limitations on sealing created by the common law public right to access,t he balancing of the factors for and against access is a decision committed to the discretion of the district court,although it is not generally accorded the narrow review reserved for discretionary decisions based on observations.bank of am.trust and sav.ass hotel rittenhouse,cir.the discretion that exists,however,must be exercised properly because the issuance of a confidentiality order overriding the common law right of public access contemplates an analytical process.
in this respect,we hold that the district court abused its discretion in sealing the bids.apart from one general and ambiguous reference to adversarial integrity and strategy and tactics,the district court did not provide any clear reason for why it sealed the bids.the court did not recognize the presumption of access,nor did it engage in balancing process to determine whether the bids were the type of information normally protected or whether there was a clearly defined injury to be prevented.see publicker,at noting similar procedural deficiencies in the context of the first amendment right to access accord criden,at stating that district courts must provide a firm base for an appellate judgment that discretion was soundly exercised.here,before sealing the entire bid record,the district court should have articulated the compelling countervailing interests it found which would authorize the closure through sealing of the matters it sought to protect.miller,at.no such factfinding or identification of compelling countervailing interests can be found in the district court order.we therefore conclude that the district court confidentiality order of october,was improperly issued,and therefore,invalid 
in addition to concluding that the october,confidentiality order was improperly issued,we conclude that the district court erred in finding that sirota violated the terms of the order.this point is important because,among other reasons,the fine was widely reported in the newspapers and legal journals,and because attorney disciplinary authorities in new york have initiated an inquiry,which is still pending,to determine whether sirota should be sanctioned in new york based on the same facts that led the district court to impose the fine.
sirota principal argument is that the district court abused its discretion in sanctioning him for speaking to a newspaper reporter.we review a district court imposition of sanctions under its inherent power for abuse of discretion.republic of philippines westinghouse,cir quoting chambers nasco,d.a district court abuse s its discretion if it base s its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.garr healthcare,cir citation and internal quotations omitted.
at the sanction hearing,the district court informed sirota that it was proceeding pursuant to,which gives the court broad authority to discipline attorneys.clearly,the court had authority to proceed under this rule and under its inherent disciplinary jurisdiction.
