on july,the plaintiff filed his original complaint in this matter.on september,the defendant filed its first motion to dismiss or,in the alternative,to compel arbitration and stay litigation pending arbitration.the defendant pointed to its terms and conditions of sale,which contain a provision that all disputes or claims against dell are subject to binding arbitration,to be administered by the national arbitration forum.the arbitration clause further provides that arbitration will be limited solely to the dispute or controversy between customer and dell.the terms and conditions also include a provision making disputes subject to texas law.
on march,with the defendant motion still pending,the plaintiff filed a first amended complaint,adding his law firm as a plaintiff.on may,the defendant filed a new motion to dismiss the amended complaint or,in the alternative,to compel arbitration and stay litigation pending arbitration.
on december,the court held a hearing in the matter.prior to that time,both parties had submitted briefs in support of their positions.although the plaintiff initially argued that the arbitration clause was unconscionable in its entirety,before the hearing he conceded that the dispute was subject to arbitration,but he argued that the prohibition on class arbitration was unconscionable.on january,the trial court entered an order striking the class arbitration prohibition and compelling arbitration.the court found that the class prohibition was unconscionable.on february,the defendant filed this interlocutory appeal pursuant to supreme court rule a a.
as the defendant correctly contends,this court has applied texas law to the same provision as the one at issue here and found it to be enforceable,in hubbert dell,d.we emphasize that,while the provision involved here is identical to the provision involved in hubbert,the circumstances surrounding the formation of the contract in the instant case differ greatly from those in hubbert.this distinction is significant for reasons we will explain in detail later.moreover,in deciding to apply texas law in hubbert,we explained that we will only apply the law of another state pursuant to a provision if there is some relationship between that state and the controversy at issue and applying the other state law does not violate the public policy of this state.hubbert,d at,at citing potomac leasing chuck pub,d.in hubbert,we found no public policy reason not to apply texas law.hubbert,d at,at.this conclusion has been undermined by subsequent decisions of the illinois supreme court.
in kinkel cingular wireless,llc,the supreme court found a class arbitration prohibition similar to the one here at issue to be unconscionable.this holding presents a conflict between illinois law and texas law that did not exist when we decided hubbert.see hubbert,d at,at noting that the result would be similar under the law of either state.for reasons we will explain,we find that it would violate the public policy of this state to enforce the provision at issue,even assuming it would be enforceable under texas law.first,however,we turn to the impact of the differing circumstances surrounding the contract formation here and in hubbert.
under texas law,as under illinois law,there are two components to and substantive.hubbert,d at,at citing autonation usa leroy.procedural unconscionability relates to the circumstances surrounding the formation of the contract,while substantive unconscionability deals with the unfairness of the provision itself.hubbert,d at,at citing autonation usa,at.when this court decided hubbert,our precedents required us to find both procedural and substantive unconscionability in order to conclude that a provision was unconscionable.see zobrist verizon wireless,d.subsequently,the supreme court rejected this requirement,holding that unconscionability may be either procedural or substantive although it can be a combination of the two types,it does not need to include both.kinkel,at,at citing razor hyundai motor america.it is less clear whether texas courts will likewise invalidate a provision on the basis of either substantive unconscionability or procedural unconscionability alone.see in re halliburton,holding that texas courts may consider both procedural and substantive unconscionability of an arbitration clause in evaluating the validity of the arbitration provision emphasis added.our research has revealed no texas case that squarely addresses the issue as the supreme court did in razor and kinkel.we note,however,that at least one texas appeals court has found contract provisions to be unenforceable after it had addressed only procedural unconscionability.in re brookshire brothers,in re turner brothers trucking.
as previously mentioned,we found that the contract at issue was not procedurally unconscionable in hubbert.however,we find the circumstances surrounding contract formation sufficiently different to warrant a different conclusion in the instant case.in hubbert,we emphasized the fact that the plaintiffs there had purchased their computer systems from dell online.to do so,they had to go to five different pages within dell web site.a blue hyperlink leading online purchasers to the purchase agreement appeared at the top of each page.hubbert,d at,at.in addition,on three of these pages,a statement appeared informing customers purchasing online that a ll sales are subject to dell term s and conditions of sale.hubbert,d at,at.we found that this was sufficient to put consumers on notice that there were terms and conditions that they should inquire about before completing the purchase.hubbert,d at,at.
further,the hyperlinks leading online purchasers to the terms and conditions appeared in a contrasting blue color.hubbert,d at,at.once a customer clicked on the hyperlink to view the terms and conditions,he or she would see a notice at the top of the agreement stating in bold,capital letters that the purchase agreement included a clause.hubbert,d at,at.the arbitration clause itself appeared partially in letters,thereby drawing attention to itself.under all of these circumstances,we found the provision to be conspicuous.hubbert,d at,at.although,as we noted,conspicuity is not required under either texas law or illinois law hubbert,d at,at citing autonation usa,at,it is a factor to be considered in determining whether a contract is procedurally unconscionable see frank maintenance engineering,roberts,d,explaining that the conspicuousness of a contract provision is an important,albeit not conclusive,factor.
in the case before us,by contrast,the plaintiff purchased his computer over the telephone.unlike the plaintiffs in hubbert,he did not go through a series of five steps during which he was repeatedly alerted to the fact that the purchase would be subject to terms and conditions that he could easily discover by clicking on a link.unlike the plaintiffs in hubbert,he did not see the
