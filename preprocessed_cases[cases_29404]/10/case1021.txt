mckeown,circuit judge 
this consolidated appeal presents an issue of first impression in our circuit,namely the scope of appellate jurisdiction to review a district court remand order in a class action case founded on federal question jurisdiction.remand orders are not appealable as a matter of course.d.nonetheless,as part of the class action fairness act of cafa,congress created an exception under c that permits courts of appeals to accept appeals from remand orders in cases that are removed under this section.joining our sister circuits,we conclude that this interlocutory review provision is limited to orders granting or denying remand of diversity class actions brought and removed under cafa.
background 
this case has a long and tortured procedural history that spans a series of interrelated lawsuits.one player is central to the action attorney david breskin,who represented plaintiff david kerbs in previous rounds of litigation and who represents chan healthcare group,ps chan in two ongoing disputes,including this one.
breskin got things going in.on may of that year,he filed a putative class action on behalf of kerbs in washington state court against defendants safeco insurance company of illinois,and safeco insurance company of america collectively safeco.kerbs alleged that safeco violated washington law by using a computerized system that automatically reduced the amounts paid to medical providers pursuant to personal injury protection coverage in automobile insurance contracts.the superior court certified a class of washington health care providers who,from may,through march,submitted claims to safeco for payment under their patients personal injury protection policies and received less than the amount billed based solely on a computerized reduction.
in may,kerbs and safeco reached a settlement agreement in which safeco agreed to pay the class members for safeco past conduct.as to future claims,safeco agreed,among other things,to stop using the computerized system and start using the fair health database to determine the proper amount of reimbursement.in approving the settlement,the superior court explained that the use of the fair health database does not,in and of itself,breach any duty or obligation under any applicable law or contract requiring safeco to pay or reimburse usual and customary or reasonable charges for covered treatments.
in,the drama continued in another state lebanon chiropractic clinic,lebanon commenced a separate class action lawsuit based on the same allegedly improper reductions of reimbursements to medical providers in illinois state court against safeco and its parent,liberty mutual fire insurance company and liberty mutual insurance company collectively,liberty.lebanon chiropractic clinic,liberty mut.ins,wl,at.app.this new case filed without breskin involvement was not limited to one state,but instead challenged safeco and liberty review and payment practices in multiple states,including both illinois and washington.see id.at.
in october,lebanon,safeco,and liberty reached a settlement agreement eerily similar to the one reached in the earlier washington state case.like the settlement in the kerbs case,with regard to future claims,liberty agreed to implement certain measures,such as the continued use of the fair health database.id.at.after preliminary approval of the settlement agreement,breskin reentered the scene.
breskin,on behalf of kerbs,objected to the settlement,contending that the proposed settlement conflicted with the kerbs settlement in the earlier washington case as well as that the proposed settlement was generally unfair to washington providers and the illinois court did not have jurisdiction.simultaneously,breskin unsuccessfully petitioned the washington state court to reopen the kerbs case and enjoin the proposed settlement in illinois.id.at.although the illinois court concluded that there was no conflict between the proposed settlement and the earlier kerbs settlement,it ordered that the proposed settlement include specific language that the lebanon settlement would not conflict in any way with the kerbs settlement.id.at.kerbs did not prevail in his appeal regarding the illinois settlement.see id.at.
this history provides the necessary backdrop to understanding the appeal before us.while the lebanon appeal in illinois was still pending,breskin filed two new offensive class action lawsuits in washington state court.the first,filed in august,was filed on behalf of chan against safeco the safeco case.the second,filed in early september,was filed on behalf of chan against liberty and is the case on appeal to us the liberty case.the complaints make similar allegations that safeco and liberty use of the fair health database to set reimbursement amounts violates various washington statutes.all parties agree that,on the face of the complaint in the liberty case,there was no basis for federal jurisdiction.
liberty asserts that things changed when chan filed its reply brief on its motion for declaratory relief.in the initial motion,filed on october,chan sought a declaratory judgment that the illinois settlement was unenforceable in washington.after liberty responded that it might elect simply to forego raising lebanon as a defense in this case,chan argued in its october,reply that the lebanon agreement could not be applied to bar chan washington state law claim against liberty consistent with chan due process rights.
on the basis of chan reply brief,liberty removed the case to federal court two days later,on october.liberty explained that chan reply brief revealed that chan was raising a standalone federal due process claim,thus creating federal question jurisdiction under.because liberty contended that chan first raised the federal question in the litigation in its reply brief,liberty argued that its removal fell within thirty days after receipt by the defendant,through service or otherwise,of a copy of an amended pleading,motion,order or other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable.b.
based on various papers received and filings made in this case and other cases more than thirty days before liberty removed,chan challenged the timeliness of liberty removal.chan also argued that there was no federal question jurisdiction because its federal due process claim was not raised as an affirmative claim,but instead in response to liberty assertion of the illinois settlement as a defense.
the district court granted chan motion to remand the case to state court based solely on the ground that removal was untimely.the court explicitly declined to reach whether federal question jurisdiction was present.the court also awarded fees to chan,in the amount of,after finding that liberty had no objectively reasonable basis for removal,particularly given defense counsel involvement with the related cases and their acknowledgments about the chan motions made to the court in the illinois appeal.
liberty petitions for review of the district court remand order and appeals the fee award.
jurisdiction to review the merits of the remand order 
the default rule on remand orders is that a n order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.d see kircher putnam funds trust,explaining that d usually stands in the way of reviewing a district court remand order watkins vital,cir.per curiam district court remand orders generally are not reviewable on appeal.
at issue here is a congressional of appellate jurisdiction that was adopted for class action cases as part of cafa.section c,entitled review of remand orders,provides that,when a case is removed under this section,a court of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action.c.the question we consider is whether we have jurisdiction to review the district court order remanding this class action when the asserted basis for jurisdiction is a federal question rather than traditional diversity or cafa minimal diversity jurisdiction.chan argues that c is limited to diversity actions under cafa.liberty takes a more expansive view,claiming that there is no limitation and that all class actions are covered by this grant of jurisdiction.
to understand the genesis of the appeal provision and its place in the statutory structure,it is important to review the multiple provisions adopted as part of cafa,particularly.in broad terms,cafa significantly expanded federal diversity jurisdiction over class and mass actions.congress added a number of statutory provisions to the united states code to ensure f ederal court consideration of interstate cases of national importance.standard fire ins.knowles,emphasis added citation omitted.one of the most notable additions is d,which was added as a new subsection in the diversity statute and allows a class action to be brought in federal court if the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of and any member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a state different from any defendant.this provision is noteworthy because it expands the jurisdiction of federal courts unlike traditional diversity cases under a,which require complete diversity,each plaintiff is a citizen of a different state than each defendant,strawbridge curtiss,d supports jurisdiction when there is minimal diversity,one plaintiff is a citizen of a different state than one defendant.
to pave the way for class action cases to get into federal court,congress also enacted a new removal provision,as part of cafa section b governs the general procedure for removing a case and eliminates some of the obstacles that apply in ordinary diversity cases.section c is designed to provide a limited means,subject to strict timing controls on both the parties and the court,for appellate review of remand orders in cases removed under b.
in examining the scope of appellate jurisdiction under,we look to the text,structure,and purpose behind the statute.see abramski united states,explaining that statutory interpretation involves interpreting the words in light of the statutory context,which includes the structure,history,and purpose of the statute.having done so,those considerations convince us that is limited to diversity cases and does not expand interlocutory appellate review to remand orders where removal is predicated on federal question jurisdiction.
we start with a,the definitional section.here,the terms class,class action,class certification order,and class member shall have the meanings given such terms under section d.significantly,subsection a a second cafa provision,as d was added in its entirety pursuant to cafa.section d definitions also apply to the new minimal diversity provision,d.
subsection b of then addresses removal of class actions 
a class action may be removed to a district court of the united states in accordance with section except that the limitation under section c shall not apply,without regard to whether any defendant is a citizen of the state in which this action is brought,except that such action may be removed by any defendant without the consent of all defendants.
finally,in subsection c,the statute spells out particularized requirements for appellate review 
section shall apply to any removal of a case under this section,except that notwithstanding section d,a court of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the state court from which it was removed if application is made to the court of appeals not more than days after entry of the order.
notably,this subsection circumscribes its applicability to a case removed under this section,presumably meaning.by invoking the phrase notwithstanding section d,the statute brushes aside d traditional bar on reviewing remand orders for a narrow subset of orders,namely,order s of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the state court from which it was removed if application is made to the court of appeals not more than days after entry of the order.
in our view,c use of removal of a case under this section limits the universe of appealable orders to those in class action cases brought under cafa.that conclusion requires a few interpretative steps.the word section is best understood to reference an entire statutory section and,because the statute uses the phrase under this section,it refers to the statutory section in which the language appears,namely.this approach fits with the way the word section is used in common parlance and the normal meaning that legal dictionaries ascribe to it.see,key tronic united states,metro one,comm r,cir.section,black law dictionary ed.defining section as a distinct part or division of a writing,esp.a legal instrument and explaining that it is abbreviated with a section symbol,section,ballentine law dictionary ed.defining section as a subdivision or paragraph of a statute or code.the text of c itself uses section in the same way,stating,just before the under this section language,that s ection shall apply to any removal of a case.the other circuits that have addressed the meaning of c phrase under this section all agree that it points to removal under.see saab home depot,cir.patterson dean morris,cir.
construing under this section as a reference to in its entirety,we also look to the other parts of the section.section a,particularly when read in conjunction with the section as a whole,supports the reading that reach is limited to diversity cases.that subsection defines relevant terms,like class and class action,by reference to the diversity statute,more specifically,to a provision added by cafa,d,which also provides the relevant definitions for cafa minimal diversity provision,d.see a.on its own,the provision defines class action broadly,but it does not stand alone.rather it fits within and must be read in conjunction with the entire section.
an even stronger textual basis for reading as excluding federal question cases comes in b,which states that a class action may be removed to a district court of the united states in accordance with section except that the limitation under section c shall not apply,without regard to whether any defendant is a citizen of the state in which the action is brought,except that such action may be removed by any defendant without the consent of all defendants.while the text could be interpreted to cover both diversity and federal question cases as both types of cases may be removed in accordance with section,it is most naturally read to cover only the former because the exceptions are directed to diversity cases.
in particular,b includes two references that are linked exclusively to diversity and fails to include similar provisions specific to federal question jurisdiction.first,subsection b excepts the limitation under section c.section c is titled requirements removal based on diversity of citizenship,and its limitation for removal applies to diversity cases alone.c.second,subsection b permits removal without regard to whether any defendant is a citizen of the state in which the action is bro
