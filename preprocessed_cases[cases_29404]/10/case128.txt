this is an appeal from a decision decertifying a class action brought by and on behalf of wireless phone customers of cellular one,the name of southwestern bell mobile systems.the putative class members are massachusetts and new hampshire residents who were charged for incoming calls despite having signed a standard form contract,used mainly between august and february,purportedly guaranteeing free incoming call service.
class representative jill ann smilow brought suit in for breach of contract and violations of massachusetts general laws chapter,a,west,and the telecommunications act tca of,b.the district court first certified and then decertified the contract,ch,and tca classes.this court vacated the decertification order and remanded the district court subsequently reinstated its decertification order,smilow bell mobile,memorandum and order.we reverse.
smilow and proposed class representative margaret bibeau each signed a standard form contract for cellular telephone services with cellular one in.the form contract says,chargeable time for calls originated by a mobile subscriber unit starts when the mobile subscriber unit signals call initiation to facilities and ends when the mobile subscriber unit signals call disconnect to facilities and the call disconnect signal has been confirmed.the parties contest the meaning of originated.smilow alleges that this language precludes cellular one from charging for incoming calls.it is undisputed that a large group of cellular one customers signed the same contract and were subject to charges for incoming calls.the contract contains an integration clause providing that changes must be in writing and signed by both parties.
smilow and bibeau purport to represent a class of massachusetts and new hampshire residents who subscribed for cellular one services under this contract.the potential class members all signed the standard form contract,which was in broad use from august to february.they did have a variety of rate plans and usage patterns.some cellular one customers paid a flat fee for a fixed number of minutes each month and an additional charge if they exceeded this fixed amount of air time for example,for the first and thereafter.many cellular one customers paid different rates for day and calls.
cellular one charged smilow,bibeau and the potential class members for incoming as well as outgoing calls.smilow received just one incoming call bibeau received many incoming calls.cellular one invoices clearly indicate that customers are charged for incoming calls.the user guide mailed to new cellular one customers also states that the company charges for both incoming and outgoing calls.bibeau paid her invoices knowing she was being charged for incoming calls.
on february,smilow,as a purported class representative,filed suit in federal district court against cellular one for breach of contract and violations of ch.and the tca.the district court had jurisdiction over the federal claims under and over the state law claims under.the district court originally certified the ch,breach of contract,and tca classes on october,the district court rejected an initial attempt to decertify the classes for smilow claims.the court,with the approval of both parties,then filed a scheduling order on november,bifurcating the liability and damages issues on the incoming calls claims and providing that liability would be litigated to conclusion before further discovery or other activities concerning damages took place.
on september,the district court held an evidentiary hearing on plaintiffs motion to substitute bibeau as a new class representative.cellular one had opposed this motion partly on the grounds that,because common issues of fact did not predominate among the class members,neither bibeau nor any other individual could properly represent the class.both parties stated that they regarded the evidentiary record as adequate to allow the court to rule on plaintiffs motion and did not wish to make additional submissions on this issue.nonetheless,the district court issued a memorandum and order on december,extending the time period to submit evidence on the designation of bibeau as a new class representative.
on march,the district court granted defendants pending motion to decertify the incoming call class,on the grounds that common issues of fact do not predominate smilow bell mobile.the court explained its conclusion that individual issues predominated as follows 
proof that many persons even if not as many as were billed for and paid charges for incoming calls in many months is not enough to show that any specific amount of damages could properly be found by a finder of facts at trial,or that any aggregate amount could properly be found.proof of charges and payments is not evidence of harm or an amount of harm on the basis of which damages could be awarded in the face of i a strong likelihood that services were received in return for the billed payments and ii lack of admissible evidence to rebut that strong likelihood.
plaintiffs assertions that causation will turn out to be a common issue,and that the amount of damages calculable from defendant records will not be reasonably disputable,are not likely to be consistent with the record in this case after further discovery,regardless of how much longer the court allows for further discovery.to be a common issue in the relevant sense,the issue must be one that does not require separate dispute resolution processes for different individuals who are said to have claims in common.
id.at.the court held that additional discovery would not enable plaintiffs to show that common issues predominate for causation and damages.the court opined that separate damages hearings would be required for individual plaintiffs because services were received in return for the billed payments and particular class members had different plans and usage patterns.although the opinion and order purported to decertify all class claims,it contained no reasoning about the ch.or tca claims.
in its march opinion,the court also denied bibeau motion to become a designated class representative.id.at.the district court provided little explanation of its decision to deny the motion to designate bibeau as a class representative.it merely observed that the motion was inadequately supported on the record before the court and thus also not effective to defeat the defense motion to decertify.id.
plaintiffs sought discretionary appellate review of the decertification order,pursuant to.f.on july,this court vacated the entire march,decertification order,noting that the district court had not addressed the ch.claim.smilow bell mobile,slip op.at cir.july.
after remand and additional written submissions and oral argument on the issue,the district court decertified the class for the contract,ch,and tca claims.smilow,slip op.at,the district court reinstated its march,decertification order,quoting the order at length and stating that its earlier reasoning was correct.the court then dismissed the ch.claim class action on two grounds.first,the court held that the class members would fall into two groups those who waived actual damages in favor of statutory damages of and those who claimed actual damages.the court fell back on its original reasoning as to why the fact that actual damages could be easily calculated by computer was irrelevant.second,the court held that individual issues predominated on causation.here,it relied on its earlier rationale that,whatever the common contractual language,services were received in return for the billed payments.although the district court purported to be addressing issues of causation,it again referred to supposed individual differences in the damages calculations to show why causation had no common issues.
the district judge also denied plaintiffs renewed motion to designate bibeau as a class representative on the grounds that she had not suffered the same injury as the class.id.at.
plaintiffs again appealed.this court granted plaintiffs permission to appeal pursuant to.f 
standard of review 
orders certifying or decertifying a class are reviewed for abuse of discretion.califano yamasaki,d.a district court abuses its discretion when it relies significantly on an improper factor,omits a significant factor,or makes a clear error of judgment in weighing the relevant factors.see schubert nissan motor,cir.an abuse of discretion also occurs if the court adopts an incorrect legal rule.waste mgmt.holdings,mowbray,cir.here the district court abused its discretion in decertifying the contract class and the ch.class 
class certification 
general standards 
a district court must conduct a rigorous analysis of the prerequisites established by rule before certifying a class.falcon,d.to obtain class certification,the plaintiff must establish the four elements of rule a and one of several elements of rule b.amchem,windsor,d.the rule a elements are numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation.id.at.from its earlier certification order the district court necessarily concluded that the rule a elements had been met 
the district court decertified on the basis of its analysis of rule b,which requires,in pertinent part 
that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.
the district court examined the predominance,but not the superiority,requirement of rule b.
the predominance requirement 
the district court decertification of the classes for the contract,ch,and tca claims,as well as its denial of the motion to substitute a new class representative,all rested on fundamental errors of law and fact.once these errors are corrected,it becomes clear that common issues as to both liability and damages predominate on the elements of the breach of contract and ch.claims.we first consider the contract claim.
breach of contract claim 
the first error was initially contained in the following statement from the district court march,opinion decertifying the class 
proof of charges and payments is not evidence of harm or an amount of harm on the basis of which damages could be awarded in the face of i a strong likelihood that services were received in return for billed payments and ii lack of admissible evidence to rebut that strong likelihood.
smilow,at.in its april,memorandum and order after remand,the district court repeated this language and stated that it thought this analysis correct.
from this statement we understand the district court to have believed that the defendant would be entitled to payment for incoming calls on a theory of quantum meruit even if plaintiffs were to prevail on their breach of contract claim.under the doctrine of quantum meruit,one who renders goods or services in the absence of an enforceable contract may be entitled to payment for those services to the extent the recipient benefitted from them.see,meng trs.of boston.if the plaintiff is entitled to recover on a contract,he can not recover in quantum meruit.marshall stratus.though we do not decide the question here,it would similarly seem that where a defendant is clearly not due payment under the terms of an enforceable contract,such defendant can not claim a right to payment under quantum meruit.where there is an enforceable express or implied in fact contract that regulates the relations of the parties or that part of their relations about which issues have arisen,there is no room for quasi contract.corbin,corbin on contracts perillo,rev ed.
the district court reliance on the doctrine of quantum meruit led it to overlook questions of law and fact common to all class members.as plaintiffs brief says,the plaintiffs claims are based entirely on a standard form contract which the defendant used with every member of the class.the common factual basis is found in the terms of the contract,which are identical for all class members.the common question of law is whether those terms precluded defendant from charging for incoming calls.
cellular one waiver defense is also common to the class.a ffirmative defenses should be considered in making class certification decisions.mowbray,at.again,both the factual basis for and the legal defense of waiver present common issues for all class members all class members received a user guide and monthly invoices showing that defendant charged the class members for the incoming calls.
even in the unlikely event that individual waiver determinations prove necessary,the proposed class may still satisfy the predominance requirement.see id.at.courts traditionally have been reluctant to deny class action status under rule b simply because affirmative defenses may be available against individual members,fed,defenses to individual members claims citing cases d federal courts citing cases see,hoxworth blinder,robinson,cir given a sufficient nucleus of common questions,the presence of the individual issue of compliance with the statute of limitations has not prevented certification of class actions in securities cases.internal quotation omitted cameron adams,cir same.see generally mowbray,at identifying statute of limitations as an affirmative defense.
instead,where common issues otherwise predominated,courts have usually certified rule b classes even though individual issues were present in one or more affirmative defenses.see,in re visa antitrust,cir hoxworth,at cameron,at.after all,rule b requires merely that common issues predominate,not that all issues be common to the class.in re prudential ins.of am.sales practices,cir see moore,moore federal practice,at to ed.supp.if,moreover,evidence later shows that an affirmative defense is likely to bar claims against at least some class members,then a court has available adequate procedural mechanisms.in re visa antitrust,at describing procedural options and collecting authorities newberg conte,newberg on class actions,at to ed same.for example,it can place class members with potentially barred claims in a separate subclass,fed,predominance of common issues citing cases see.c b,or exclude them from the class altogether,in re visa antitrust,at fed,supra,citing cases.
cellular one argues that even if there are common questions of law and fact,the district court did not abuse its discretion by decertifying the class because individual issues predominate on damages.this is largely an issue of whether plaintiffs could use a computer program to extract from cellular one computer records information about individual damages.the district court viewed this question as mostly beside the point and its decertification orders rested mainly on other grounds.
the individuation of damages in consumer class actions is rarely determinative under rule b.where,as here,common questions predominate regarding liability,then courts generally find the predominance requirement to be satisfied even if individual damages issues remain.in re visa antitrust,at bogosian gulf oil,cir gold strike stamp christensen,cir moore,supra,a,at collecting additional cases newberg conte,supra,at see blackie barrack,cir the amount of damages is invariably an individual question and does not defeat class action treatment.
there is even less reason to decertify a class where the possible existence of individual damages issues is a matter of conjecture.see mowbray,at.common issues predominate where individual factual determinations can be accomplished using computer records,clerical assistance,and objective rendering unnecessary an evidentiary hearing on each claim.see roper consurve,cir,aff on other grounds sub,deposit guar.bank roper,d moore,supra,at collecting cases holding that class certification is appropriate where damages are calculable by mathematical formula.
still,the parties here dispute whether it will be possible to establish breach,causation,and damages using a mechanical process.cellular one argues that smilow has not shown that she could use defendant computer records either to distinguish the subset of incoming call recipients who exceeded their monthly allotment of free minutes or to calculate how much extra each class member was charged as a result of receiving incoming calls.
