opinion of the court 
lifeusa appeals the january,order filed january,of the district court which certified a class of plaintiffs who had purchased lifeusa accumulator annuity policies between august,to the present.in its order certifying a class,the district court focused entirely on the alleged misrepresentations of lifeusa agents in the marketing,advertising,and sales of the accumulator,stating that the gravamen of plaintiffs claims is that defendant sales techniques and advertising constituted an allegedly fraudulent scheme.the district court focus was not on the alleged misrepresentations contained in quarterly statements issued to purchasers of the accumulator.
this emphasis on the marketing of the accumulator is not surprising,considering the allegations of the plaintiffs complaint.however,on appeal for the first time,we learned that the plaintiffs claims were not and are not based upon the sales presentations made by each of lifeusa agents.rather,the plaintiffs have since shifted their emphasis from fraud and misconduct in connection with the sale and marketing of the annuities,to fraud and misconduct the gravamen of this case is the nondisclosure of the real interest rate in every uniform annuity and identical quarterly statement.appellees,at.
because the plaintiffs have alleged no breach of contract claim in their complaint and because their claims are no longer based on the sales predicate of the district court class are rather centered on the interest rates reported in quarterly statements and because the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure a and b have not been met,we will vacate the district court class certification,which resulted from facts,allegations,and a theory differing materially from the facts,allegations,and theory presented to us on appeal.
we will,however,remand to the district court to give that court an opportunity to consider,together with the other issues identified in its summary judgment opinion if the present interest rate and real interest theory of the plaintiffs as explicated in their briefs on appeal and at oral argument warrant relief and if so,class certification.on remand,if a class meets class certification standards and is then certified,the district court must also ascertain whether it may exercise jurisdiction over all class plaintiffs consistent with this court ruling in meritcare,paul mercury ins,cir,and whether jurisdiction pursuant to the employee retirement income security act of erisa,is available.
represent a class of persons who purchased accumulator annuities from lifeusa holding,lifeusa.the accumulator is a deferred annuity contract whereby upon the deposit of the purchaser premiums,a bonus is paid on the amount deposited and interest is then credited to that increased amount.
the contract provisions 
the accumulator is a annuity because it contains both an annuitization value and a cash value.the annuitization value is the amount paid to the owner if the funds deposited are held under the contract for at least one year and annuitized over at least five years.the contract provides that the owner will receive the annuitization value if the policy has been in force for at least one year and the proceeds are paid in a settlement extending over at least five years.the annuitization value consists of premiums,bonuses credited to such premiums,and accumulated interest.the contract guarantees that the minimum interest rate credited to the annuitization value is,id,but provided that lifeusa may declare a higher interest rate than the guaranteed rate.id.
the cash value of the contract is the amount the contract owner receives in the event that he or she elects a full or partial lump sum surrender.the cash value reflects a load,no bonus,and,if the contract has been in deferral for less than ten years,a credited interest rate lower than that used to calculate the annuitization value.the contract explains 
cash value premium payment are equal to of the first year premium payment and of the premium payment in years two through five.cash value premium payments after year five are equal to of the payment made.
premium paid during the first five policy years in excess of the planned annual premium will be credited to the cash value in an amount equal to of the excess amount paid.after the first five policy years,any excess premium will be credited to the cash value in an amount equal to of the excess amount paid.
the guaranteed minimum interest rate credited to the cash value is.we may declare a higher interest rate than the guaranteed rate.the rate in effect for the cash value on the policy date is guaranteed for the first policy year.after the first policy anniversary,we may change the declared rate at our option.the rate declared will never be lower than the guaranteed minimum interest rate.
the interest rate credited to the cash value will be equal to the rate credited to the annuitization value after the tenth policy anniversary.
the contract further provides that policy values before the annuity date are based on interest compounded annually.id.all accumulator contracts contained a free look period providing the prospective purchaser the opportunity to review the contract and return it within days if not satisfied significantly,the complaint filed by the plaintiffs does not contain any claims that lifeusa has breached any of the contract provisions.moreover,in depositions,the named plaintiffs testified that they either failed to read or merely glanced at the contracts after they had received them.
lifeusa marketing of the accumulator 
lifeusa sold the accumulator through independent agents.indeed,the record discloses that a number of accumulator purchasers were themselves independent agents who sold annuities.agents were not all trained by lifeusa.agents learned about the accumulator from written materials describing the product,the contract itself,and from voluntary seminars sponsored by lifeusa and independent field marketing organizations fmos.marketing materials sent by lifeusa to agents were not uniform.decl.of charles kavitsky,while some of the product information lifeusa created was mailed to all lifeusa or allianz agents and fmos,other items were distributed only to agents and fmos licensed in a particular state.
agents also employed marketing materials generated by fmos,not lifeusa.agents were permitted to use their own sales material,provided that the material was approved by lifeusa,for the purpose of complying with state regulation.agents did not uniformly rely on the marketing materials in learning about lifeusa accumulator.in fact,some discarded the materials entirely.approximately of lifeusa agents have attended the seminars,and the oral content of the seminars varies.
the accumulator was sold typically in meetings between agents and clients.the district court found that the accumulator was not sold according to uniform,scripted sales presentations.the information provided to each of the plaintiffs by the individual sales agents who sold them their policies was not identical.agents used varying sales presentations that they developed themselves,based on the prospective purchaser financial objectives and sophistication,and the agent knowledge and experience.agents did not employ lifeusa marketing materials uniformly.for example,some agents always used illustrations provided by lifeusa,while other agents never used them.four of the plaintiffs testified that they might have received literature from their agents before purchasing the accumulator,but none of them relied on such literature and none could recall the substance of it.
plaintiffs class allegations 
plaintiffs complaint asserts claims of fraudulent nondisclosures and misrepresentations count ii,negligent misrepresentation count iii,breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing count iv,negligence count v,and unjust enrichment count vi.in count i,plaintiffs seek injunctive relief.
although the plaintiffs complaint alleges that lifeusa misrepresented the accumulator annuities provisions and the quarterly statements fraudulently misrepresented the interest rates credited to the annuities,the district court class certification opinion was directed entirely to the marketing and sales of the accumulator.with respect to plaintiffs allegations concerning marketing and sales tactics,the complaint alleges that lifeusa induc ed and train ed agents to misrepresent the terms of the accumulator through standardized and uniform misrepresentations and nondisclosures at point of sale.compl.a,b.plaintiffs charged that lifeusa conceal ed and fail ed to disclose the true terms of the lifeusa accumulator annuity from the purchasers,who are given no written materials from lifeusa and provided with only an application and the uniform representations of lifeusa agents based upon lifeusa standardized misrepresentations and material omissions taught to the agents.id.c.they alleged that lifeusa marketed its accumulator annuities through standardized and a uniform pattern and practice of deceptive misrepresentations and nondisclosures to agents.id.see also id.
despite the alleged misrepresentations which plaintiffs claim induced them to purchase accumulator annuities a claim now apparently abandoned the plaintiffs also charged that quarterly accounting statements received after purchase of an accumulator uniformly misrepresented the true interest rate credited to a purchaser account.in essence,the plaintiffs charged that the interest rate is less than the interest rate misrepresented by lifeusa in quarterly statements to lifeusa annuity purchasers.compl.a.
the district court granted plaintiffs rule class certification motion,relying on lifeusa activities,holding,as we have earlier noted,that the gravamen of plaintiffs claims is that defendant sales techniques and advertising constituted an allegedly fraudulent scheme.while conceding that it was presented with a close case,and that lifeusa argument has some merit,the district court nonetheless ruled that the requirements of rule a and b were satisfied.with respect to the predominance requirement of rule b the district court stated 
while lifeusa argument has some merit in that the information provided to each of the plaintiffs by the individual sales agents was not identical,it nevertheless appears that the source of the plaintiffs misinformation confusion was the advertising,sales and marketing literature which life usa prepared and disseminated to its clients and its agents either directly or indirectly through its field marketing organizations fmos.
emphasis added.the district court emphasized that the basis for plaintiffs claims against defendant is that they the plaintiffs and the agents who sold them the plaintiffs their policies were intentionally misled by defendant sales literature and advertising.id.
the district court also ruled that the superiority requirement of rule b was satisfied,with the following analysis 
in addition,in light of the fact that the potential class in this matter could number over,we believe that the class action device is superior to other methods of adjudicating this dispute.obviously,joinder of all class members would be impracticable and duplicative individual trials would impose an inordinate burden on the litigants and the court.accordingly,we conclude that the prerequisites of rule b are present in this case.
citations and footnote omitted.oddly enough,the district court made no mention of the approximately independent agents who sold the policies to the plaintiffs.the district court then certified the following class 
all persons who purchased an accumulator annuity from life usa between august,and the present and are not officers or directors of life usa or members of the immediate family of any officer or director of life usa or any entity in which life usa has a controlling interest or the heir,successor or assign of any such excluded party.
lifeusa has timely appealed.
plaintiffs filed this class action complaint against lifeusa in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.the district court jurisdiction was premised on,as this case is an action between citizens of different states wherein the amount in controversy ostensibly exceeds,exclusive of interests and costs.compl.after extensive discovery,on september,the district court denied lifeusa motion for summary judgment,and on january,granted plaintiffs motion for class certification.lifeusa moved before us to appeal pursuant to rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure.on june,this court granted lifeusa motion.
a threshold issue which came to our attention is whether the district court had diversity jurisdiction under over the class,as the plaintiffs alleged federal courts have diversity jurisdiction where there is complete diversity among the parties,and the amount in controversy meets the jurisdictional minimum.each member of a class action must independently meet the jurisdictional amount requirement in order to establish diversity jurisdiction under.each member who fails to meet the jurisdictional amount must be dismissed from the case.zahn international paper,d holding that e ach plaintiff in a rule b class action must satisfy the jurisdictional amount,and any plaintiff who does not must be dismissed from the case.meritcare,at.zahn does not require that an entire class action be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction over some of the class members.rather,the court is required only to dismiss those class members whose claims appear to a legal certainty to be less than the jurisdictional amount.in re school asbestos,cir 
as a general rule,the jurisdictional amount is determined from the good faith allegations appearing on the face of the complaint.paul mercury indem.red cab.a complaint will be deemed to satisfy the required amount in controversy unless the defendant can show to a legal certainty that the plaintiff can not recover that amount.id.at.the complaint here alleges generally that the amount in controversy in this action exceeds.compl.the complaint also alleges that the named plaintiffs purchased accumulator annuities in the amount of,id.plaintiff krapf,id,plaintiffs benevento and rosenblum,id.plaintiff maze,id.plaintiff baskin,and.id.plaintiff compaine.
however,whereas the complaint alleges that plaintiffs and all members of the class sustained damages,id,it does not allege that each class member suffered damages in the amount of.our remand to the district court will require that court,among other things,to ascertain whether all members of the putative class suffered injury in the amount of,or to limit any class that may be certified to individuals with requisite diversity,as meritcare requires 
we review a district court decision to certify a class action for an abuse of discretion.holmes pension plan of bethlehem steel,cir in re the prudential ins.of am.sales practices,cir.we may find an abuse of discretion where the district court decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.prudential,at citations and internal quotations omitted.a finding is clearly erroneous when the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states igbonwa,cir citations and internal quotations omitted.
in order to be certified,a class must satisfy the four requirements of rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation.a amchem,windsor,d.if these rule a requirements are satisfied,the court must also find that the class is maintainable under rule b,or.b.see note,supra,and appendix.rule b provides that common questions must predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and class representation must be superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.the rule b predominance inquiry tests whether the class is sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation,and mandates that it is far more demanding than the rule a commonality requirement.amchem,at.
in this case,the district court found that the rule a requirements had been satisfied,and that the conditions of rule b were met.lifeusa appeals only the district court conclusions with respect to rule b.see appellant,at.thus we are not concerned on this appeal with the rule b and b subsections.
to qualify for certification under rule b,a class must meet two requirements beyond the rule a prerequisites 
common questions must predominate over any questions affecting only individual members and class resolution must be superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy rule b includes a nonexhaustive list of factors pertinent to a court close look at the predominance and superiority criteria.

in adding predominance and superiority to the list,the advisory committee sought to cover cases in which a class action would achieve economies of time,effort,and expense,and promote uniformity of decision as to persons similarly situated,without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results.

having reprinted in full federal rule of civil procedure a and b in the attached appendix,we do not list all the factors here.rather,in this case,we find particular significance in the last recited factor of rule b d which stresses the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.b d.we also recognize that because the rule b predominance requirement incorporates the commonality requirement of rule a we must treat them together,georgine,at,and as we have noted above,even if rule a commonality requirement is satisfied,predominance may not be,as it is more demanding.amchem,at.
thus our focus is on testing whether the class certified by the district court here meets all the requirements of predominance,that common questions predominate over questions affecting only individual members and that class treatment is a superior method of adjudication.factored into those questions is the difficulty to be encountered in the management of a class action.
predominance 
as noted,the district court found that the plaintiffs satisfied all four of the rule a requirements including commonality rule a.however,in light of the record,we find unconvincing the district court explanation that 
while lifeusa argument has some merit in that the information provided to each of the plaintiffs by the individual sales agents who sold them their policies was not identical,it nevertheless appears that the source of the plaintiffs misinformation confusion was the advertising,sales and marketing literature which lifeusa prepared and disseminated to its clients and its agents either directly or indirectly through its field marketing organizations fmo.
equally unpersuasive is the district court statement that w hile there ar e unquestionably individual issues of fact in each case,we find that the predominant issues in each such case of necessity are whether or not the defendant intentionally misled and deceived the plaintiffs,through its product and sales information and the training provided to its agents.
the district court also noted that the predominance test has also been found to have been easily satisfied in cases involving a common scheme to defraud millions of life insurance policy holders,relying on in re the prudential ins.of am.sales practices,cir.lifeusa had argued that predominance was not established because the purported class members claims arose from individual and transactions involving oral misrepresentations.because common questions commonality must be established before predominance can be found,we turn to that element.
commonality 
we have held that class certification is inappropriate in mass tort claims,asbestos,georgine,and tobacco,barnes american tobacco,cir which present questions of individualized issues of liability.
in georgine,we vacated a district court certification of a nationwide settlement class of people exposed to asbestos.there we recognized that mass torts involving a single accident may be amenable to class action treatment,but observed that the individualized issues can become overwhelming in actions involving mass torts,those which do not arise out of a single accident.georgine,at.we continued furthermore,the alleged tortfeasor affirmative defenses such as failure to follow directions,assumption of the risk,contributory negligence,and the statute of limitations may depend on facts peculiar to each plaintiff case.id.citation omitted.in addition,we held that the predominance requirement was not satisfied in georgine,id.at,because 
initially,each individual plaintiff claim raises radically different factual and legal issues from those of other plaintiffs.these differences,when exponentially magnified by choice of law considerations,eclipse any common issues in this case.in such circumstances,the predominance requirement of rule b can not be met.
id lifeusa claims,and we are compelled to agree that on the record before us,in this case the plaintiffs claims raise different factual and legal issues from those of other plaintiffs.
in barnes,we affirmed the decertification of a statewide class of cigarette smokers who asserted state law claims against a cigarette manufacturer.barnes,at.we stated because of the individual issues involved in this addiction,causation,the need for medical monitoring,negligence and the statute of believe class treatment is inappropriate.id.at footnote omitted.while we recognize that amchem and barnes are multiple tort cases,the principles and reasoning in those cases are applicable here.
here the plaintiffs assert claims arising not out of one single event or misrepresentation,but claims allegedly made to over purchasers by over independent agents where the district court found that the sales presentations hence the alleged misrepresentations were neither uniform nor scripted.indeed,the district court,while acknowledging that the claims or defenses of the class must arise from the same event,pattern,or practice,or be on the same legal theory,never identified any uniform misrepresentation made to the plaintiffs nor did it detail any material fact which was not disclosed to class members,and which accordingly,could have misled them.significantly,in its class certification opinion,the district court,in discussing commonality in connection with rule a,found this case to be a close one.
the district court principal reliance on in re the prudential ins.of am.sales practices,cir,in certifying the lifeusa class was misplaced and unfortunate.in prudential,we affirmed the certification of a settlement class action involving prudential allegedly deceptive sales practices affecting over million claimants nationwide.however,prudential,unlike this case,involved uniform,scripted,and standardized sales presentations.the district court opinion in prudential found that the oral component of the fraudulent sales presentations did not vary appreciably among class members.plaintiffs allegations and the evidence presented to the court demonstrate that throughout the country,prudential agents uniformly misled class members with virtually identical oral misrepresentations.in re the prudential ins.of am.sales practices,citation omitted emphasis supplied.
in prudential,the agents were career agents who worked exclusively for prudential.id.they were not independent agents like the agents who sold accumulator annuities to the plaintiffs.prudential agents were uniformly trained and prudential required its agents to use the uniform sales materials which prudential furnished.id.at.moreover,audits and state regulatory investigations of prudential revealed that prudential agents had indeed committed uniform,deceptive sales practices nationwide.id.at.
the facts here in the extensive evidentiary record of this case depositions,affidavits,declarations,and the like contrast starkly with the facts found in prudential.in this case,as we have earlier pointed out,the accumulator was not sold according to standard,uniform,scripted sales presentations.in fact,the district court found that the information provided to each of the plaintiffs by the individual sales agents was not identical.lifeusa agents are independent agents,not captive agents,as were prudential agents.lifeusa agents learn about the accumulator from written materials describing the product,from the contract itself and from voluntary seminars sponsored by lifeusa,but only of agents attend lifeusa seminars.marketing materials sent to lifeusa agents are not uniform and many utilized marketing materials generated by field marketing organizations who are not affiliated with lifeusa.
moreover,the selling agents did not employ lifeusa marketing materials uniformly.some agents discarded the marketing materials entirely.agents sales presentations were individually tailored to each customer financial objectives.significantly,when the plaintiffs testified on deposition,they admitted that if they received information from sales agents prior to purchase,they did not rely on it,nor could they recall its substance.indeed,a number of the plaintiffs failed to read or merely glanced at the contracts,leading to the district court observation that it was incumbent upon the plaintiffs to read these materials,particularly in light of the defendant examination and return policy.
hence,the facts of this case differ markedly from those which were found in prudential.accordingly,even if the district court had not centered its attention on lifeusa marketing activities,as the plaintiffs now claim it should not have,the record is uncompromising in revealing and individualized sales pitches presented by independent and different sales agents,all subject to varying defenses and differing state laws,thus making certification of individualized issues inappropriate.thus,the district court finding from the record that lifeusa has engaged in standardized conduct,affecting the class members can not be sustained.
moreover,the district court in denying summary judgment to lifeusa identified at least four major factual and legal issues that had to be resolved the district court failed to consider how individualized choice of law analysis of the different jurisdictions would impact on rule predominance requirement,see georgine,at,as well as individual determinations of causation,adjudications of contract law,reliance,the fiduciary status of defendant,and lifeusa defenses of negligence and limitations.
if commonality in the marketing context does not exist,then common questions can not predominate over individual issues because as georgine found,each individual plaintiff claim raises radically differing factual and legal issues from those of other plaintiffs.this,too,is the case here.accordingly,we can not uphold the district court exercise of discretion in concluding from its findings that commonality and predominance have been demonstrated.
superiority 
having determined that the class certified by the district court does not meet the predominance requirement of rule b,we need not dwell at length on the superiority requirement of the rule,inasmuch as failure to meet any of the requirements of rules a and b precludes certification of a class.see,wilcox commerce bank of kansas city,cir harriston chicago tribune,cir.
it will be recalled that the district court here dealt with the superiority test in one cursory paragraph 
in addition,in light of the fact that the potential class in this matter could number over,we believe that the class action device is superior to other methods of adjudicating this dispute.obviously,joinder of all class members would be impracticable and duplicative individual trials would impose an inordinate burden on the litigants and the court.accordingly,we conclude that the prerequisites of rule b are present in this case.
citations and footnote omitted.this discussion,of course,gives little indication as to how a trial of this controversy,if tried as a class action,could be efficiently and fairly managed,which is the polestar of rule b.in georgine which decertified a class action we concluded in discussing the superiority prong of rule b that 
the proposed class action suffers serious problems in both efficiency and fairness.in terms of efficiency,a class of this magnitude and complexity could not be tried.there are simply too many uncommon issues,and the number of class members is surely too large.considered as a litigation class,then,the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of this action are insurmountable.
georgine,at.
in georgine,admittedly,the size of the purported class was much larger than the class here.it ranged from to two million individuals.however,in the present case,lifeusa has issued well over annuities to the class members,and the individual agents who sold the policies numbered over.moreover,as we discussed under the section of this opinion dealing with predominance,there are individualized issues that would require individual determinations of defenses,representations,state laws,and the like without going into detail as to the management of how a trial which would require proofs of individual claims of the plaintiffs and proofs of varying defenses of the defendant could be conducted,it is sufficient for our purposes to recognize that attempting to adjudicate plaintiffs various claims through a class trial would not only be inordinately time consuming and difficult,but it would impermissibly transgress upon the required standards of fair ness and efficiency.
thus having concluded that the requirement of predominance has not been met,and that the superiority and the management of the trial could not be fairly and efficiently conducted as a class action,we are obliged to hold that the district court improperly exercised its discretion in certifying a class.accordingly,we will vacate the january,order of the district court which certified the plaintiff class in a context,and remand this case to the district court with instructions to decertify the class 
even though we have concluded that the class certification decreed by the district court can not be upheld because it rested on the marketing,advertising,and sales pitches of the accumulator,we nevertheless are seriously troubled by the constant assertions made by the plaintiffs in their appellate briefs and their appellate arguments that lifeusa misrepresented interest rates and amounts all of which apparently stem not from the representations but from quarterly statements which could only come about subsequent to the purchase of the annuities by the plaintiffs.as a consequence,we asked at oral argument for memoranda which would expound upon the real interest rate and the amounts actually paid.
plaintiffs furnished us with exhibits detailing calculations which allegedly illustrate the actual interest rate credited assuming daily compounding of interest.those computations purported to show that,assuming daily compounding,the amount of interest credited represented a lower interest rate than the rate stated on the quarterly statements.in response,lifeusa argued that plaintiffs calculations incorrectly assumed that lifeusa represented,in quarterly statements,that it would engage in daily compounding of the declared current rate of interest.instead,it argued,the contract,the quarterly statements,and the marketing literature circulated to agents demonstrate that contract values are calculated based on an annual compounding of the declared current rate 
we had anticipated that these submissions would clarify the issue of misrepresentations which was emphasized by the plaintiffs in their appellate briefs and oral argument.we did so because,among other considerations,plaintiffs had not claimed and do not claim,any breach of contract in their complaint.this is not surprising to us because the contract entered into by each of the named plaintiffs provides no more than a guaranteed interest rate and also provides for different features of payments as well as representing that interest would be compounded annually.thus we found it difficult to understand the shift in the plaintiffs emphasis and even more difficult to understand allegations of standard uniformity in lifeusa representations.
however,we found
