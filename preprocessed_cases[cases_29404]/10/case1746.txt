in this writ proceeding,we hold 
an individual assignment of a cause of action to a third party does not carry with it the individual statutory right to sue in a representative capacity conferred under the labor code private attorneys general act of labor code section and under the unfair competition law business and professions code section.
section of the unfair competition law,as amended by proposition,providing that representative claims may be brought only if the injured claimant complies with section of the code of civil procedure,means that private representative claims must meet the procedural requirements applicable to class action lawsuits.
factual,legal and procedural background 
under the labor code,an employer who fails to provide required meal and rest periods is required to pay the employee one additional hour of pay at the employee regular rate of compensation for each work day that the meal or rest period is not provided,subds.a b.employers who violate regulations governing hours and days of work are also subject to civil penalties under labor code section.the labor code private attorneys general act of paga authorizes an aggrieved employee to bring a civil action,on behalf of himself or herself and other current or former employees,to recover civil penalties for violations of any section of the labor code that provides for assessment and collection of civil penalties by the labor and workforce development agency or any of its departments or divisions,subd.a.
two labor unions that represent mechanics and transit operators unions,along with members or former members of the unions collectively,plaintiffs,filed a lawsuit against several transit company employers plaintiffs alleged the employers failed to provide their employees with the meal and rest periods required by law,and sought unpaid wages estimated at over million dollars,an award of civil penalties estimated at over million,and other relief.in a second cause of action,plaintiffs asserted the employers failure to provide the legally required meal and rest periods violated the unfair competition law ucl,and sought injunctive relief and restitution of unpaid wages.bus,et the fourth amended complaint alleged the unions were suing in their representative capacity on behalf of members who are or were employed by the defendant employers.in addition,the unions brought the action as assignees of rights transferred to the unions by over employees and former employees of the defendant employers,including the right to sue in a representative capacity on behalf of all other current and former aggrieved employees of defendants 
at the trial court suggestion,the parties identified several threshold issues as controlling questions of law,including whether the unions had standing to sue under the ucl and under paga whether the action must be brought as a class action and whether the payments specified in labor code section constituted a penalty or a wage.the trial court deferred considering whether section payments constitute a penalty or a wage,an issue which is now pending before the supreme court in murphy kenneth cole productions,review granted,the parties briefed the other issues,a hearing was held,and on april,the trial court ruled,inter alia,that 
the unions do not have standing to recover civil penalties or attorney fees under paga,which requires such actions to be brought by an aggrieved employee on behalf of himself or herself and other current or former employees,subd.a.
the unions do not have standing to sue for violations of the ucl which,as a result of proposition,allows a private party to bring a ucl action only if the person has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition.bus.
the assignments which the unions obtained from some of their members did not confer standing on the unions to prosecute paga,representative or class claims on behalf of all members of the unions.
proposition requirement that a person may pursue representative claims,or relief on behalf of others,only if the person meets the standing requirements and complies with section of the code of civil procedure,was intended to impose class action procedures on claims such as those asserted in the complaint.
the unions filed a petition for writ of mandate and a request for a stay of the trial court proceedings.they requested a writ directing the trial court to vacate its order and enter a new order holding the unions have standing to recover civil penalties and attorney fees under paga the unions have standing to sue for violations of the ucl and the assignments obtained by the unions confer standing on the unions to prosecute paga and representative claims on behalf of all members of the unions.this court issued a temporary stay order and directed the real parties in interest to file a preliminary response to the petition,and particularly to discuss whether the assignments from current and former union members to the unions conferred standing on the unions.after a preliminary response and a reply from the unions were filed,the court issued an order to show cause why the trial court should not be compelled to vacate portions of its order and enter a new order,concluding that the causes of action are assignable and that the unions have complied with the requirements of code of civil procedure section.
written returns were filed by the real parties in interest the unions filed a reply and the order to show cause was heard on november.we now deny the writ petition.
discussion 
the unions concede they are not aggrieved employee s under paga and have not suffered an injury in fact under the ucl.they assert standing to sue based on the assignment to the unions by some of their members of the members claims for recovery of wages.they further assert the assignments confer standing upon the unions to sue in a representative capacity,and that the unions may sue under the ucl in a representative capacity without meeting the procedural requirements applicable to class actions.
our conclusions are these 
we agree the unions have standing as assignees to assert the claims of union members who have assigned to the unions their rights to recover wages owing to them.the unions may not,however,assert claims on behalf of members who have not assigned their claims to the unions.the assignment of a cause of action,as authorized by civil code sections and,is the transfer by the owner of a right to recover money or other personal property in a judicial proceeding.an individual statutorily conferred right to sue on behalf of others is not itself a cause of action,or any other form of property,that is owned and therefore assignable within the meaning of the civil code.accordingly,while a person may assign his own cause of action to another,the assignment does not carry with it the right to sue in a representative capacity.nothing in vermont agency of natural resources united states ex rel.stevens,d vermont agency,upon which the unions rely,supports a contrary conclusion.consequently,the unions do not have standing under paga or the ucl to assert the rights of members who have not assigned their recovery rights to the unions.
we further conclude that the ucl requirement that a person pursuing relief on behalf of others must both meet standing requirements and compl y with section of the code of civil procedure means,as stated in the voter information guide for proposition,that unfair competition lawsuits on behalf of others,initiated by persons other than the attorney general and local public prosecutors,must meet the additional requirements of class action lawsuits.voter information guide,analysis of by legislative analyst,hereafter guide.
we address each issue in turn.
although an employee may assign his right to recover money to the union,such an assignment does not carry with it the employee statutorily granted right to pursue claims on behalf of others.
the unions contend they have the right to pursue representative claims on behalf of others because one or more employees with that right assigned their causes of action to the unions.the unions contention necessarily depends upon the premise that a legislative grant of the procedural right to bring a representative action is a type of property,like a cause of action,that can be owned and transferred.we conclude the premise is mistaken while a cause of action is an intangible form of property that may be assigned by its owner,the right to bring a representative suit on behalf of others is another matter entirely.the right to bring a representative suit is not itself a cause of action or any other form of property that is owned and therefore assignable.unlike causes of action,which arise from obligations or from the violation of property rights of the owner,the right to sue on behalf of others is a procedural mechanism created by the legislature to facilitate the prosecution of similar claims owned by many different persons.authorization to bring a representative suit is conferred by the legislature,and persons authorized to bring suit have no power to assign that authorization to a third party,nor does an assignment of a cause of action include,by operation of law,the authorization to bring a representative suit.
our conclusion that the right to bring a representative suit on behalf of others is not an assignable property right flows ineluctably from the statutes defining causes of action,as well as from the nature of and the law governing assignments.the unions position to the contrary is founded,it appears,on a failure to distinguish between an injury in fact or cause of action,which is most assuredly a transferable property right,and standing to seek relief on behalf of others,which is not.we turn first to the law of assignment and the statutes defining assignable property rights,and then address the specific contentions raised by the unions.
the law of assignment confirms an employee may assign his own cause of action to his union or to anyone else.
it is settled that california maintains a policy encouraging the free transferability of all types of property.essex ins.five star dye house,cal th,d,essex.essex observed that a chief incident of ownership in property is the right to transfer it,a right which applies equally to tangible and intangible forms of property,including causes of action.ibid.the court quoted civil code section,which states a thing in action,arising out of the violation of a right of property,or out of an obligation,may be transferred by the owner.essex explained that although the assignability of causes of action is derived from the common law,section had the effect of liberalizing restrictions on the types of actions that may be assigned to a third party.essex,supra,cal th at,d.the only causes of action not transferable or assignable are 
those which are founded upon wrongs of a purely personal nature,such as slander,assault and battery,negligent personal injuries,criminal conversation,seduction,breach of marriage promise,malicious prosecution,and others of like nature.all other demands,claims and rights of action whatever are generally held to be transferable.citations.essex,supra,cal th at,d.
from these principles,and in the absence of an express statutory prohibition,we necessarily conclude an employee may assign his or her statutory causes of action for recovery of unpaid wages and for ucl violations founded on unpaid wages to the unions claims for unpaid wages are not wrongs of a purely personal nature essex,supra,cal th at,d,and employees may assign their claims to their unions just as any other person may assign a cause of action arising out of the violation of a right of property,or out of an obligation,road sprinkler fitters local union g g fire sprinklers,th,d road sprinkler because workers had private statutory remedies against their employers,the assignment of their statutory rights to the union gave the union standing to sue for recovery of unpaid prevailing wages under labor code section.
the right to sue in a representative capacity is not a cause of action that may be assigned.
while an employee may assign his own cause of action,the statutes defining causes of action and the law of assignment clearly demonstrate that the right to sue in a representative capacity is not a cause of action,or any other form of property right,and is therefore not assignable,either expressly or by operation of law.
a cause of thing in action has been defined by statute since a thing in action is a right to recover money or other personal property by a judicial proceeding.a thing in action,if it arises out of the violation of a right of property,or out of an obligation,may be transferred by the owner.the legislature may by statute define new legal rights or forms of compensable injury,and authorize recovery for the injury in a judicial proceeding.see vermont agency,supra,at.but it is the violation of the statute or property right that creates a cause of action in the injured party,who owns the cause of right to recover money arising from the therefore may transfer it.see id.at.
by contrast,statutory provisions such as those in the ucl and paga,which authorize injured or aggrieved persons to seek relief for others as well as for themselves,do not create a cause of action.any ucl or paga cause of action arises from the underlying statutory violation.the ucl,for example,defines unfair competition in section and in section allows a person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of unfair competition to seek relief in court.the cause of action owned by the injured party under the ucl is the right to redress,given in section,for the violation defined in section.similarly,paga gives an aggrieved employee the right to recover civil penalties,on behalf of himself or herself and other current or former employees,for violations of other provisions of the labor code,subd.a.again,the right to recover money the cause of from the underlying violation of the labor code here,the failure to give meal or rest periods,for which section requires payment to the employee.the aggrieved employee is aggrieved by the failure to give the meal or rest periods required under section,not by any statutory violation created by paga.consequently,paga does not create a cause of action that may be transferred by its owner.the right it confers to recover civil penalties for other labor code violations on behalf of others,by definition,is not a cause of action,is not owned by the person on whom it is conferred and,as a necessary consequence,is not assignable.see.
in short,section of the ucl and section of the labor code merely identify circumstances under which a person may pursue relief for a cause of action owned by someone else.the right to do so can not be assignable for that very reason in a representative action,the injuries for which the representative is authorized to seek relief belong to others.stated differently,because the assignor the employee,although authorized by section or paga to bring an action on behalf of others,has no ownership interest in the causes of action owned by others,the employee necessarily has no right,expressly or by operation of law,to transfer those causes of action to a third party.
the right to sue in a representative capacity is not an incident of an employee cause of action that is assigned by operation of law along with the cause of action.
the unions insist the legal effect of an employee assignment is to transfer each assignor injury in fact to the union assignee and to grant the union assignee standing to sue in a representative capacity under bus.and labor code a.as we have seen,the first prong of the contention is correct an assignor in effect transfers his injury in fact,and his right to recover for it,to his assignee.the second prong of the contention,however,is a non sequitur,and no authority supports it.
the unions rely solely on the general principle that a n assignment carries with it all rights of the assignor witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts,and t he assignee stands in the shoes of the assignor and his rights are no greater than those of the assignor.road sprinkler,supra,th at,d.while these principles are,of course,correct,the unions apply them incorrectly when they maintain,in effect,that a statutory right to pursue claims on behalf of others is an incident of the assignor right to recover compensation for his own injury.the cases cited by the unions merely teach that,even when an assignment is silent,any incidents of the property right transferred are,by operation of law,transferred with the assignment.see,t he transfer of a thing transfers also all its incidents,unless expressly excepted.for example 
champion home builders sipes d,held that a finance company assignment to plaintiff of defendants debt included the defendants personal guaranties of that debt,even though there was no express assignment of the guaranties.the transfer of the debt from champion credit to champion included by operation of law the guaranty because the transfer of a thing transfers the incidents,footnote omitted.
mitchell shoreridge oil d,held that a mechanics lien is a mere incident of the debt which it secures and the assignment of the debt carries with it the lien,entitling the assignee of the debt to enforce the liens.the assignee became the legal owner of the claims and the liens which secured their payment.ibid.
adjustment marco,held that an assignment by a landlord of a claim for in rent due included the right to recover the attorney fees provided in the lease the right to such fees in that event a suit to enforce the lessor rights was an incident to the demand,and a valuable one.id.at.the assignee was entitled to recover the fee in precisely the same manner as his assignors could have done.id.at.the court observed the principle that transfer of a thing transfers also all its incidents,unless expressly excepted,has been frequently applied.for example,it is uniformly held that the transfer of the note without mention of the security carries with it the benefit of the security.adjustment marco,supra.at.
essex,supra,cal th,d,held that when an insured assigned a bad faith cause of action against an insurer,the assignee received the assignor right to recover the policy benefits in full,including attorney fees incurred in prosecuting the assigned claim.as the assignee of the insured claim against the insurer,the assignee stands in his shoes,and so may assert his right to recover fees incurred in prosecuting the assigned claim.id.at,d.
the cited cases show that the assignee stands in the shoes of the assignor with respect to the assignor recovery for other purposes unrelated to the assignor right to recover his own property.see adjustment marco,supra.at,the assignee stands in the shoes of the assignor and whatever right of recovery was in the assignor on a rescission of the contract passed with the contract to the assignee.the incidents that accompany a right to recover guaranty along with the debt,the security along with the note,the mechanic lien along with the debt,the right to attorney fees along with the bad faith cause of themselves property rights owned by the assignor and therefore transferred by operation of law along with the thing assigned.the right to bring a representative suit,on the other hand,is a procedural right conferred by the legislature to facilitate the prosecution of an incident of the employee right to recover unpaid wages that is in any sense owned and therefore transferable by the employee 
contrary to the unions contention,federal cases do not hold that an assignment carries with it the assignor right to sue in a representative capacity.
the unions press the argument that an assignment carries with it the right of an assignee to sue in a representative capacity,asserting that vermont agency and other federal cases have so held.they have not.vermont agency and other federal cases merely apply the ordinary principle that the assignee of a claim has standing to assert the injury in fact of the assignor.vermont agency,supra,at.vermont agency held that a private individual a qui tam relator has standing to maintain a suit in federal court on behalf of the united states under the false claims act,even though the qui tam relator has suffered no cognizable injury in fact for article iii standing purposes.id.at.the court found an adequate basis for the qui tam relator standing in the doctrine that the assignee of a claim the qui tam relator has standing to assert the injury in fact suffered by the assignor the united states.id.at.it regarded the false claims act as effecting a partial assignment of the government damages claim,so that the united states injury in fact suffices to confer standing on the qui tam relator.id.at,fn.omitted.
vermont agency stands for the proposition that the assignee of a claim has standing to assert the injury in fact suffered by the proposition with which we fully agree.the court reference to representational standing on the part of assignees vermont agency,supra,at.refers only to the assignee representation of the assignor,that is,the assignee standing to assert the assignor injury in to any right in the assignee to represent someone other than the assignor.in short,vermont agency does not suggest that an assignment by a person with an injury in because the person is authorized by statute to seek relief for others as well as for himself or with it the assignor procedural right to sue in a representative capacity in effect,this would permit an assignor to transfer causes of action he or she does not own to someone else.any such right would turn the law of assignment on its head.
b.the provision of proposition stating that representative claims may be pursued only if the claimant complies with section of the code of civil procedure means that claims must comply with class action procedures.
the unions contend proposition,an initiative measure approved at the november general election,does not require class certification of representative actions brought under the ucl.their argument is based on the text of the proposition,which states that a person may pursue representative claims only if the claimant complies with section of the code of civil procedure section.bus.since its enactment in,section has stated that a person may sue for the benefit of others either when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court code civ.according to the unions,the compli ance with section required by proposition can only mean that the plaintiff must demonstrate that it is a plaintiff having the capacity to sue as a representative plaintiff in compliance with the standards set forth in ccp.we are compelled to disagree.
a voter initiative such as proposition is construed using the familiar principles governing statutory construction.horwich superior court cal th,d.the fundamental purpose is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.ibid.to determine intent,we begin with the language of the statute,but it is a settled principle that statutory language should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences that were not intended.the intent prevails over the letter,and the letter will,if possible,be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.citations.ibid.a statute is read with reference to the scheme of law of which it is part and in light of the electorate intent.robert superior court cal th,d.when language is ambiguous,we consult other indicia of the voters intent,particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.citations.ibid.in short,the task of construing a voter initiative is simply to interpret and apply the initiative language so as to effectuate the electorate intent.citation.ibid.
adhering to settled principles for construing a voter initiative,we find the only possible conclusion is that compli ance with section means compliance with class action procedures.the intent of the this case,the evident from the most cursory review of the information presented to the electorate to inform the voting on proposition.for example 
the ballot measure summary in the voter information guide prepared by the secretary of state for the november,election explains what your vote means.it states that a yes vote on proposition means that a person pursuing such unfair competition claims on behalf of others would have to meet the additional requirements of class action lawsuits.guide,supra,ballot measure summary of.it states that a no vote means that a person could bring such a lawsuit without meeting the additional requirements of class action lawsuits.ibid.
the official title and summary of proposition,prepared by the attorney general,states that the initiative statute requires private representative claims to comply with procedural requirements applicable to class action lawsuits.voter information guide,supra,title and summary of.
the analysis by the legislative analyst repeatedly refers to class action requirements.thus 
the background section of the legislative analysis states 
currently,persons initiating unfair competition lawsuits do not have to meet the requirements for class action lawsuits.requirements for a class action lawsuit include certification by the court of a group of individuals as a class of persons with a common interest,demonstration that there is a benefit to the parties of the lawsuit and the court from having a single case,and notification of all potential members of the class.guide,supra,analysis of by legislative analyst.
describing the proposition proposal,the legislative analysis states 
this measure makes the following changes to the current unfair competition law requires lawsuits brought on behalf of others to be class actions.this measure requires that unfair competition lawsuits initiated by any person,other than the attorney general and local public prosecutors,on behalf of others,meet the additional requirements of class action lawsuits.guide,supra,analysis of by legislative analyst.
the unions point out that code of civil procedure section itself contains no class certification requirements and authorizes representative suits that are not class actions,as well as class actions.see residents of beverly glen,city of los angeles d.beverly glen corporation had standing to represent its injured members in suit to set aside a conditional use permit i t may also be true that while all class suits are representative in nature,all representative suits are not necessarily class actions.we do not suggest otherwise.the question,however,is what the electorate meant when it said that a person may pursue representative claims under the ucl only if the claimant complies with section of the code of civil procedure.the secretary of state official voter information guide leaves no doubt what the electorate meant,and this court is not free to reach a different conclusion.
the unions protest that the text of proposition,including its findings and declarations of purpose,says nothing about the intent to require class certification in ucl representative suits.indeed,the text refers only to compli ance with section.this does not assist the unions,because it shows the language of proposition is ambiguous.section is a general statute,authorizing suits by one or more for the benefit of all.depending on the context,sometimes compliance with section means class certification is required sometimes it means an organization may represent its injured members,such as in beverly glen and sometimes it means something else,such as that one trust beneficiary may maintain a representative action on behalf of other beneficiaries.bowles superior court cal d.the ambiguity requires us to consult other indicia of the voters intent,particularly the analyses in the official ballot pamphlet.citations.robert superior court,supra,cal th at,d.as we have seen,consulting the official ballot pamphlet completely eliminates any ambiguity.the voters intended to amend the ucl to require a private person initiating a ucl lawsuit to comply with procedural requirements applicable to class action lawsuits guide,supra,title and summary of,and we are not at liberty to conclude otherwise 
disposition 
the order to show cause is discharged.the unions petition for writ of mandate prohibition or other appropriate relief is denied and this court stay of the trial court order is vacated.the real parties in interest are entitled to recover their costs.
i respectfully dissent from a portion of the opinion of the majority in this case.in specific,i disagree with the conclusion of the majority that the two labor unions that represent mechanics and transit operators unions do not have standing under the labor code private attorneys general act of paga or the unfair competition law ucl to assert the rights of members who have not assigned their recovery rights to the unions.the majority takes the position that the right to bring a representative suit is not itself a cause of action or any other form of property that is owned and therefore assignable.unlike causes of action,which arise from obligations or from the violation of property rights of the owner,the right to sue on behalf of others is a procedural mechanism created by the legislature to facilitate the prosecution of similar claims owned by many different persons.authorization to bring a representative suit is conferred by the legislature,and persons authorized to bring suit have no power to assign that authorization to a third party.the majority further argues that the assignment in this case purporting to transfer the right to sue in a representative capacity is not a transfer of an injury in fact from assignor to assignee that confers standing on the assignee therefore,they conclude that even with a valid assignment,the assignee may not transfer his right to sue in a representative capacity on behalf of current and former employees.i am unable to locate any authority which compels these conclusions urged by the majority,nor does there seem to be a compelling policy or other reason to reach that result.
the majority characterize the unions contention as depending upon the mistaken premise that a legislative grant of the procedural right to bring a representative action is a type of property,like a cause of action,that can be owned and transferred.i believe that this entire approach to the analysis is mistaken.the mistake is to discuss the right to bring a representative action as being a property right in any aspect.one does not own or have legal title to the ability to bring a representative action.a representative action is simply a procedural device created by the legislature to allow the prosecution of certain claims.accordingly,i will hereafter refer to the ability to bring a representative action,not the right to do the same.thus recast,i posit that the only qualification required,is that the party bringing the representative action meet whatever requirements are set forth by the legislature with respect to that particular case.if,by virtue of an assignment,a union meets those specifications,then the union has the ability nee right to pursue the cause.
witkin advises that an assignment may be of either a bilateral contract or of a chose in action,and that most of the common law restrictions on assignability were eliminated by the provisions of the civil code.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.a chose of action is the right to recover money or other personal property by a judicial proceeding and they are assignable when they arise out of an obligation or out of the violation of a right of property,a cause of action for breach of contract is an assignable chose in action.trubowitch riverbank canning cal d.rights are those founded upon wrongs of a purely personal nature,such as slander,assault and battery,negligent personal injuries and other such torts to the person or reputation.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,contracts.
the general rule in california which allows assignment of the right to recovery money or other personal property within the meaning of civil code sections and grants the assignee all of the rights and remedies possessed by the assignor for its enforcement,subject,however,to the defenses which may be urged against the assignor.the enforcement of the assignor rights by the assignee depends upon the rights of the assignor.teater good hope dev.d.
i agree however,with the majority
