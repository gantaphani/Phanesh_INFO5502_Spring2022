plaintiff appellant david pride is a california state prisoner.in an action brought under,pride claims that defendants appellees,officials and employees of calipatria prison,violated his eighth amendment rights by acting with deliberate indifference towards his serious medical needs.he seeks damages and injunctive relief concerning his own individual medical treatment.the district court dismissed pride claim for injunctive relief on the ground that pride claim is already being provided for in the class action plata brown,no.the,pending in the northern district of california.we have jurisdiction under.we reverse the district court dismissal of pride claim for injunctive relief.we hold that because pride claim for injunctive relief concerns only his individual medical care,his claim is not already encompassed in the plata litigation,which seeks systemic reform of medical care in california prisons 
in his pro se complaint,pride alleges that he has a permanent shoulder injury from prior gunshot wounds.he alleges that his shoulder was shattered by bullets and could not be fully mended.his gunshot injuries allegedly cause him significant pain and difficulty sleeping,and prevent him from exercising.pride contends that he also has an old sports injury that causes his knee to slide out of joint,resulting in pain and swelling.
the complaint further alleges that while pride was a prisoner at pelican bay state prison,a prison doctor examined him and prescribed him a double mattress and a knee brace for his injuries.once pride was transferred to calipatria state prison,he sought the same treatment from his treating physician,santiago.pride alleges that after conducting a medical examination,including a specific examination of his shoulder and knees,santiago issued a prescribing pride knee braces and an egg crate mattress pride alleges,however,that a chrono committee reviewing santiago chrono improperly denied the prescribed medical treatment.pride asserts that because of the denial of medical care he is in constant pain and is unable to sleep.
after exhausting his administrative remedies,pride filed his pro se complaint under for denial of adequate medical care against two alleged members of the chrono committee,defendants correa,a nurse,and levin,the chief medical officer of calipatria state prison pride requested injunctive relief to prevent defendants from denying him medical treatment and accommodations.
defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure solely on the ground that pride claim for injunctive relief can not be brought independently of the plata.the assigned magistrate judge recommended denying defendants motion.defendants objected to the recommendation,repeating the same argument.the district court declined to adopt the magistrate judge recommendation.instead,the district court construed defendants motion as a rule b motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter because the claim is currently pending as a class action.so construed,the district court granted defendants motion and dismissed pride claim for injunctive relief.pride timely appealed 
our review of the district court dismissal under rule b or rule b is de novo.edwards marin park,cir vestron,home box office,cir.whether we construe defendants motion as one under rule b or as a facial attack on subject matter jurisdiction under rule b,all factual allegations in pride complaint are taken as true and all reasonable inferences are drawn in his favor.see knievel espn,cir doe holy see,cir 
the district court dismissed pride claim for injunctive relief for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that pride asserts interests that are already being provided for by the plata court.we conclude that the district court erred in dismissing pride claim for injunctive relief.
we have not previously addressed the availability of injunctive relief for individual defendants in the context of the plata litigation.but we have addressed similar issues in crawford bell,cir and krug lutz,cir.
in crawford,we addressed whether a district court may properly dismiss an individual complaint because the complainant is a member in a class action seeking the same relief.crawford,at emphasis added.we held that a district court may dismiss those portions of the complaint which duplicate the class action allegations and prayer for relief.id.at.but a district court may not dismiss those allegations of the complaint which go beyond the allegations and relief prayed for in the class action.see also frost symington,cir remanding for a determination of whether a pending class action involv es the same issues raised by plaintiff.
in krug,we considered when class action consent decrees concerning prison conditions bar an individual claim for relief.krug,at.there,consent decrees had been entered regarding a broad category of conduct at the prisons.id.we held that an individual defendant is permitted to litigate an independent constitutional action where the specific issues raised have not already been addressed conclusively by the decrees.id.
following the principles of crawford and krug,to determine whether an individual inmate claim for injunctive relief is duplicative of plata,we must first identify the relief sought and obtained by plata concerning medical care.
the class in plata consists of all prisoners in the custody of the california department of corrections and rehabilitation cdcr with serious medical needs,except those incarcerated at pelican bay state prison.stip.the plata defendants are the governor of california,director of finance,youth and adult correctional agency secretary,director of corrections,and deputy director,health care services division.plata was filed in,and despite years of litigation,serious constitutional violations in california prison system remain uncorrected.brown plata,d discussing the history of plata.
in,a stipulation for injunctive relief was approved by the plata district court and filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california the plata stipulation pursuant to the plata stipulation,the cdcr was required to implement the following practices and procedures hire medical staff staff registered nurses at emergency clinics hours a day implement certain protocols and systems including protocols for interinstitution transfers and for treatment and provide special diets for patients with liver and kidney failure.stip.after the state failed to comply with the stipulated injunction,the district court appointed a receiver to oversee remedial efforts in the california prisons.plata.at.
in august,the district court found that the plata litigation remedial efforts including the plata stipulation and the receivership had failed to remedy the constitutional violations in california prisons.coleman schwarzenegger,civ s lkk jfm p,wl cal,at.the district court thus requested that a three judge court convene to consider issuing a prisoner release order.id.pursuant to the prison litigation reform act,a prisoner release order,which includes any type of order that has the purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison population,can only be ordered by a three judge court.a b,g.the chief judge of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit granted the request for the three judge court.coleman,wl,at.
the court determined that crowding was the primary cause of the constitutional violations in plata and no other relief,other than a prison release order,would remedy the constitutional violations.id.at.the court found that prior orders for less intrusive relief had failed to remedy the unconstitutional denial of adequate medical health care to prisoners.id.at.the court emphasized that defendants utterly failed to comply with the implementation schedule called for in the plata stipulation.id.at.the court concluded that until the problem of overcrowding is overcome it will be impossible to provide constitutionally compliant care to california prison population.id.at.the court ordered that defendants reduce the prisoner population to of the design capacity of the state prisons wi
