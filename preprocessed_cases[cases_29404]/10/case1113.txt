we affirm.we conclude that ralphs arbitration policy is unconscionable under california law,and that the state law supporting that conclusion is not preempted by the faa.
background 
plaintiff zenia chavarria completed an employment application seeking work with defendant ralphs grocery company.chavarria obtained a position as a deli clerk with ralphs and worked in that capacity for roughly six months.after leaving her employment with ralphs,chavarria filed this action,alleging on behalf of herself and all similarly situated employees that ralphs violated various provisions of the california labor code and california business and professions code et.ralphs moved to compel arbitration of her individual claim pursuant to an arbitration policy incorporated into the employment application.chavarria opposed the motion,arguing that the arbitration agreement was unconscionable under california law.
by completing an employment application with ralphs,all potential employees agree to be bound by ralphs arbitration policy.the application contains an acknowledgment that the terms of the mandatory and binding arbitration policy have been provided for the applicant review.ralphs policy contains several provisions central to this appeal.
paragraph governs the selection of the single arbitrator who will decide the dispute it provides that,unless the parties agree otherwise,the arbitrator must be a retired state or federal judge.it explicitly prohibits the use of an administrator from either the american arbitration association aaa or the judicial arbitration and mediation service jams.
if the parties do not agree on an arbitrator,the policy provides for the following procedure 
each party proposes a list of three arbitrators 
the parties alternate striking one name from the other party list of arbitrators until only one name remains 
the party who has not demanded arbitration makes the first strike from the respective lists and 
the lone remaining arbitrator decides the claims.
in practice,the arbitrator selected through this process will invariably be one of the three candidates nominated by the party that did not demand arbitration.
paragraph concerns attorney and arbitration fees and costs it specifies that each party must pay its own attorney fees,subject to a later claim for reimbursement under applicable law.the provision regarding arbitration fees,including the amount to be paid to the arbitrator,is more than a little convoluted.ultimately,it provides that the arbitrator fees must be apportioned at the outset of the arbitration and must be split evenly between ralphs and the employee unless a decision of the supreme court directly addressing the issue requires that they be apportioned differently.
paragraph of the policy permits ralphs to unilaterally modify the policy without notice to the employee.the employee continued employment constitutes acceptance of any modification 
the district court held that ralphs arbitration policy was unconscionable under california law,and it accordingly denied ralphs motion to compel arbitration.ralphs appeals the district court denial under.
ii.discussion 
ralphs argues that the district court erred when it held that the arbitration policy was unconscionable under california law.ralphs also contends that federal law requires that the policy be enforced in accordance with its terms,even if the policy is unconscionable under california law,and that therefore the district court was required to compel arbitration.we review de novo the denial of a motion to compel arbitration.bushley credit suisse first boston,cir.
the faa provides that any contract to settle a dispute by arbitration shall be valid and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.this provision reflects both that a arbitration is fundamentally a matter of contract,and b congress expressed a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration.concepcion.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.arbitration agreements,therefore,must be placed on equal footing with other contracts.id.
like other contracts,arbitration agreements can be invalidated for fraud,duress,or unconscionability.id.at.a defense such as unconscionability,however,can not justify invalidating an arbitration agreement if the defense applies only to arbitration or derives its meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.id.the supreme court has held that state rules disproportionately impacting arbitration,though generally applicable to contracts of all types,are nonetheless preempted by the faa when the rule stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of congress objectives in enacting the faa.id.at.
no single rule of unconscionability uniquely applicable to arbitration is at issue in this case.we must therefore apply california general principle of contract unconscionability.armendariz found.health psychcare,cal th,d,cal see nagrampa mailcoups,cir en banc applying california general principle of unconscionability to an arbitration agreement.the parties dispute whether the ralphs arbitration policy is unconscionable under california contract principles.
unconscionability under california law 
under california law,a contract must be both procedurally and substantively unconscionable to be rendered invalid.armendariz,d,at.california law utilizes a sliding scale to determine unconscionability greater substantive unconscionability may compensate for lesser procedural unconscionability.id.applying california law,the district court held that the arbitration agreement in this case was both procedurally unconscionable and substantively unconscionable.we agree.
procedural unconscionability 
procedural unconscionability concerns the manner in which the contract was negotiated and the respective circumstances of the parties at that time,focusing on the level of oppression and surprise involved in the agreement.ferguson countrywide credit,cir a m produce fmc,d.oppression addresses the weaker party absence of choice and unequal bargaining power that results in no real negotiation.a m produce.at.surprise involves the extent to which the contract clearly discloses its terms as well as the reasonable expectations of the weaker party.parada,th,d.
the district court held that ralphs arbitration policy was procedurally unconscionable for several reasons.the court found that agreeing to ralphs policy was a condition of applying for employment and that the policy was presented on a take it or leave it basis with no opportunity for chavarria to negotiate its terms.it further found that the terms of the policy were not provided to chavarria until three weeks after she had agreed to be bound by it.this additional defect,the court held,multiplied the degree of procedural unconscionability.
ralphs argues that the policy is not procedurally unconscionable because chavarria was not even required to agree to its terms.ralphs bases this contention on a provision in the employment application that provides,please sign and date the employment application to acknowledge you have read,understand agree to the following statements.the word please,ralphs contends,belies any suggestion of a requirement.ralphs argues that chavarria could have been hired without signing the agreement.
ralphs argument ignores the terms of the policy itself,which bound chavarria regardless of whether she signed the application.the policy provides that n o signature by an employee or the company is required for this arbitration policy to apply to covered disputes.that ralphs asked nicely for a signature is irrelevant.the policy bound chavarria and all other potential employees upon submission of their applications.
these circumstances are similar to others where we have held agreements to be procedurally unconscionable.in davis myers,cir,we held that an arbitration agreement was procedurally unconscionable under california law because it was imposed upon employees as a condition of their continued employment.id.at.we explained,where the employee is facing an employer with overwhelming bargaining power who drafted the contract and presented it to the employee on a basis,the clause is procedurally unconscionable.id.at quoting nagrampa,at.likewise,in pokorny quixtar,cir,we held that a contract is procedurally unconscionable under california law if it is a standardized contract,drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,that relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.id.at citing ting v.at t,cir.chavarria could only agree to be bound by the policy or seek work elsewhere.ralphs policy meets the standard under which we have previously found arbitration provisions in employment contracts to be procedurally unconscionable.
further,we have held that the degree of procedural unconscionability is enhanced when a contract binds an individual to terms.pokorny,at.ralphs did not provide chavarria the terms of the arbitration policy until her employment orientation,three weeks after the policy came into effect regarding any dispute related to her employment.the employment application merely contains a notice of the policy.the policy itself is a,document with several complex terms.see harper ultimo,th,d,holding that a contract was procedurally unconscionable because the customer was forced to obtain the terms from another source to find out the full import of what he or she is about to sign.ralphs arbitration policy fits squarely within these decisions,so the district court did not err when it held that the policy was procedurally unconscionable.
substantive unconscionability 
chavarria must also demonstrate that ralphs arbitration policy is substantively unconscionable under california law.a contract is substantively unconscionable when it is unjustifiably to such an extent that it shocks the conscience.parada,th,d,quoting morris redwood empire bancorp,th,d.
the district court found that several terms rendered ralphs arbitration policy substantively unconscionable.first,the court noted that ralphs arbitrator selection provision would always produce an arbitrator proposed by ralphs in arbitration proceedings.second,the court cited the preclusion of institutional arbitration administrators,namely aaa or jams,which have established rules and procedures to select a neutral arbitrator.third,the court was troubled by the policy requirement that the arbitrator must,at the outset of the arbitration proceedings,apportion the arbitrator fees between ralphs and the employee regardless of the merits of the claim.the court identified this provision as a model of how employers can draft fee provisions to price almost any employee out of the dispute resolution process.the combination of these terms created a policy,according to the court,that lacks any semblance of fairness and eviscerates the right to seek civil redress to condone such a policy would be a disservice to the legitimate practice of arbitration and a stain on the credibility of our justice system.
ralphs contests the district court conclusion and argues that the policy is not unconscionable.indeed,ralphs goes a step further and argues that the provisions relied upon by the district court actually disadvantage ralphs and are intended to benefit the employee.ralphs strained construction of its policy is unpersuasive.in fact,the policy includes further provisions that add to its unconscionability.
regarding the arbitrator selection provision,ralphs does not deny that its policy precludes the selection of an arbitrator proposed by the party demanding arbitration.nor does it deny that the party selecting the arbitrator gains an advantage in subsequent proceedings.ralphs opening brief affirmatively acknowledges as much section of the arbitration policy disadvantages the party seeking arbitration in the arbitrator selection process,by ensuring that the party resisting arbitration is guaranteed an arbitrator of its choosing.ralphs simply argues that it wo always be the party that is guaranteed an arbitrator of its choosing.
in particular,ralphs argues that the district court erred in assuming that an employee will always be the party that demands arbitration.ralphs contends that the opposite is true.in ralphs view,chavarria,the employee in this case,will wind up with an arbitrator of her choosing because it is ralphs that demanded arbitration.ralphs logic is thus 
chavarria brought a claim in federal court 
ralphs filed a motion to compel arbitration 
if the court grants the motion,then the case will go to arbitration and 
ralphs will have demanded arbitration and thereby relinquished the first strike to chavarria.
chavarria will,under ralphs scenario,strike all three of the arbitrators on ralphs list,and the last remaining arbitrator will necessarily be from chavarria list.
it does take a close examination of ralphs argument to reveal its flaws.to begin with,ralphs argument invites an employee to disregard the arbitration policy and to file a lawsuit in court,knowing that the claim is subject to arbitration.even if ralphs is willing to waste its time and money for that detour,it is not one that makes any sense for the court.we can not endorse an interpretation that encourages the filing of an unnecessary lawsuit simply to gain some advantage in subsequent arbitration.
perhaps more to the point,ralphs argument relies on a fanciful interpretation of its arbitration policy.ralphs motion to compel arbitration does not constitute a demand for arbitration as provided in the policy.paragraph of the arbitration policy provides that a demand for arbitration must be made in writing,comply with the requirements for pleadings under the federal rules of civil procedure and be served on the other party.emphasis added.ralphs motion to compel arbitration is not a demand for arbitration under the terms of ralphs policy because it does not comply with the federal rules of civil procedure requirements governing pleadings.see.a providing that o nly these pleadings are allowed before listing types of pleadings.stating the general rules of pleading.
a fair construction of the agreement suggests that an employee,even after filing a frivolous claim in federal court,nonetheless must serve on ralphs a demand for arbitration that complies with the federal rules.accordingly,as the district court found,ralphs gets to pick the pool of potential arbitrators every time an employee brings a claim.
even if it were the case that ralphs policy does not guarantee that ralphs will always be the party with the final selection,the selection process is not one designed to produce a true neutral in any individual case.as noted above,ralphs has not argued that the selection process is fair,acknowledging that the process disadvantages the party seeking arbitration.ralphs simply argues that sometimes the process may work to its disadvantage.but that is no consolation to the individual employee who is disadvantaged in her one and only claim.forcing her into an arbitration process where ralphs has an advantage can not be justified by the possibility that some other employee might someday get the upper hand in that employe
