this case concerns the proper boundary between the courts and arbitrators in some novel circumstances.we must determine whether the district court effectively denied the right of appellants national financial services and fidelity brokerage services collectively fidelity to arbitrate a dispute with their customers,joan and david berenson,when it opined on the merits of the berensons claims after granting appellants motion to compel arbitration.
the arbitration agreement in this case requires the arbitration of individual claims between fidelity and its customers but exempts class actions from the arbitration requirement.the berensons brought a putative class action against fidelity.for reasons described below,the district court determined that it would adjudicate the merits of the berensons claims before addressing the issues of class certification.all parties agreed to this arrangement.
fidelity filed several motions for summary judgment,whittling away the berensons claims while class certification was pending.in response to the final such motion,the district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part,dismissing the class claims and declaring that an opinion would follow.with the class claims dismissed,fidelity moved to compel arbitration on the berensons remaining claims,and the district court granted the motion.shortly thereafter,the district court issued its summary judgment memorandum and order,explaining its earlier ruling.
fidelity now claims that the district court effectively rescinded its arbitration order when it addressed the merits of the berensons remaining claims in its summary judgment memorandum,justifying an interlocutory appeal from the denial of an application to compel arbitration.fidelity urges us to either vacate the ruling,on the basis that the district court had no authority to issue it,or to reverse the ruling on its merits.because we do not agree with fidelity claim that the district court effectively denied its motion to compel arbitration,we conclude that we have no jurisdiction to entertain fidelity appeal.
factual background 
joan and david berenson opened a brokerage account at fidelity in the early.since at least the,they have used the company electronic bill payment service,billpay,to make payments from an account comprised of mutual funds.at first,fidelity operated the service itself over time,it contracted with different companies to provide the service.
in june,fidelity contracted with checkfree,whose electronic bill payment service used the good funds method.in that system,the customer request for payment triggers a debit against the payor account at on the day the request is made the money is then held in a fidelity account until the next day,when it is wired to checkfree.if checkfree has an agreement with the designated payee,it then wires the money directly to the payee if there is no such agreement,checkfree issues and mails a checkfree corporate check to the payee.this method is known as the good funds model because debiting the payor account immediately assures that a payment is not made unless the customer has sufficient funds,eliminating the possibility that the payment will bounce.this benefit comes at a cost the payor loses the opportunity to earn interest on the funds it has scheduled for payment during the period between on the day payment is initiated and when it is received by the payee,the float.
in august,the berensons began using fidelity electronic bill payment service to transfer money from their primary account into another fidelity account held by berenson company international,which was owned by david berenson.because there was no agreement between fidelity and checkfree to directly transfer money,checkfree issued corporate checks to effect those transfers,resulting in a delay between when the primary account was debited and the corporate account was credited 
in early,berenson called fidelity to complain about this delay,arguing that he believed the interest earned on his money during the period of delay belonged to him and not to fidelity.he reiterated his complaint in a letter dated september.a fidelity representative called berenson in response to his letter to explain the good funds system,but was unsuccessful in his attempt to resolve the berensons complaint.
early procedural background 
on september,the berensons filed a putative class action in the united states district court for the district of columbia significantly,a customer agreement they signed when they opened their fidelity account contained a provision requiring arbitration of all controversies that may arise between us.however,a limiting clause stated 
no person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration,nor seek to enforce any arbitration agreement against any person who has initiated in court a putative class action until a the class certification is denied b the class is decertified or c the customer is excluded from the class by the court.
the berensons alleged multiple grounds for fidelity liability fidelity violated the electronic funds transfer act,efta both a because the interest it gained on the float constituted a fee that the efta requires be disclosed,and b because fidelity failed to respond to the berensons complaint in writing within ten days,as required by the efta error resolution provision fidelity failure to disclose this fee amounted to either intentional or negligent misrepresentation fidelity collection of this fee breached its contract with the berensons collection of the fee breached fidelity fiduciary duty to the berensons fidelity violated the massachusetts truth in savings law mtisl.laws ch,which requires financial institutions to disclose certain information to customers when they open an account and fidelity failure to disclose that the berensons would not receive interest on the float of their funds constituted a violation of the massachusetts consumer protection act.laws ch.chapter 
on november,fidelity responded by filing a motion to dismiss and for summary judgment on all claims that motion reserved the right to compel arbitration if class certification was denied.after a hearing in october,the district court granted summary judgment in an oral ruling for fidelity on the contract and mtisl claims.it found no contract language promising that the payor would continue to earn interest on its funds up to the point when the payee received them and concluded that the mtisl provides no private right of action.it denied the motion as to all other claims,without prejudice.fidelity filed its second motion for summary judgment on february,alleging that the berensons efta claims were barred by the statute of limitations.
class certification 
while the renewed motion for summary judgment was pending,the court held a hearing on the berensons motion for class certification.under the federal rules of civil procedure,individuals who wish to represent a class of litigants must meet several qualifications.the prerequisites include 
the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable numerosity,there are questions of law or fact common to the class commonality,the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class typicality,and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class adequacy.
during the hearing,fidelity argued that the berensons could not fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.specifically,fidelity asserted a potential conflict of interest because berenson son was a partner in the law firm representing the berensons.while the berensons had a fiduciary duty to the class to ensure a maximum return,they would also have an interest in the law firm maximizing its fees.consequently,fidelity argued,they might be unable to represent the true interests of the class.
to deal with this issue,the district court suggested that it try the berensons claims on the merits before certifying the class why do we try the case without it being a class action,win,lose or draw.if the berensons lose,well,you know that.but if the berensons win,then fidelity is collaterally estopped,res judicata,and then we see if any class wants to come out of the woodwork and pile on that.turning to counsel for fidelity,the court asked you not hurt by that.if i simply try this case as an exemplar case.they lose it,then it lost and we see where we are.then surely their interests wo be typical.but if they win it,then we see where we are,too.does that make sense fidelity replied i think that there would be a definite advantage to deferring the class certification because we believe that there are these other dispositive motions that can be addressed to the berensons in particular.so from the point of view of judicial efficiency we do understand deferral in that respect.if fidelity saw any incompatibility between the court exemplar proposal and subsequent arbitration of any of the berensons claims,it never disclosed those views at this critical hearing.
later procedural background 
fidelity second motion for summary judgment urged the court to declare the berensons efta claims barred by the efta statute of limitations.in a ruling from the bench on march,the court granted the motion as to the claim of inadequate disclosure the disclosure claim because berenson letter of september,indicated knowledge of fidelity alleged failure to disclose,but the berensons did not file suit until september.the court denied the motion,however,as to the berensons claim that fidelity had violated the efta by failing to respond in writing within ten days of berenson complaint the error resolution claim.the period following the complaint letter expired on september,the lawsuit was therefore just within the statute of limitations on that claim.the court noted that this partial loss by the berensons makes them less representative of any class.i do think perhaps i should say anymore.
on may,fidelity moved for summary judgment on all remaining claims the error resolution claim,the misrepresentation claims,breach of fiduciary duty,and the chapter claim.it made some arguments that were particular to the berensons,that their claims were time barred and so might have been relevant to class certification however,other arguments extended beyond the berensons particular claims,that their misrepresentation claims,error resolution claim,breach of fiduciary duty claim and chapter claim failed as a matter of law.on july,the court issued an order granting summary judgment for fidelity on the misrepresentation and fiduciary duty claims.it again denied summary judgment on the berensons error resolution claim but,because the berensons did not file their efta disclosure claim within the statute of limitations,the court found that they are not representative of the proposed class and thus the class claims are dismissed.finally,the court denied fidelity motion for summary judgment on the chapter claim.the order also stated that a n opinion will follow shortly.
with the class claims dismissed,fidelity moved to compel arbitration on the berensons remaining individual claims.in doing so,it raised no objection to the court intention,disclosed in its july order,to issue an opinion explaining its decision to grant summary judgment on some of fidelity claims and to deny it on others.the district court granted the motion to compel arbitration on august.two months later,on october,the district court issued a written opinion explaining its summary judgment ruling.the court stated that it allowed the motion as to misrepresentation and fiduciary duty because fidelity made no misrepresentation and owed no fiduciary duty to the berensons.it denied the motion as to the error resolution claim,rejecting fidelity arguments that its conduct could not be deemed error under the efta the berensons never properly notified fidelity of an error and any error resolution claim is untimely.
addressing the berensons chapter claim,the court concluded that the berensons allegations were sufficient to state a claim under the statute for an unfair trade practice.the court noted that massachusetts courts have adopted the following test to determine an unfair trade practice 
whether the practice offends public policy as it has been established by statutes,the common law,or otherwise whether it is within at least the penumbra of some,statutory,or other established concept of unfairness whether it is immoral,unethical,oppressive,or unscrupulous whether it causes substantial injury to consumers or competitors or other businessmen.
berenson fin,llc,d,citing purity supreme,attorney.with that framework in mind,the court opined that the berensons had alleged a potentially viable chapter claim based on their allegations under the efta and mtisl.it accepted their argument that lost interest could be a fee under the efta and that fidelity could be a financial institution as defined by the mtisl.a chapter claim also was timely because the statute has a limitations period the court therefore concluded that fidelity was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
shortly thereafter,fidelity filed a motion asking the court to take one of three alternative steps to reconsider its summary judgment ruling,to certify it for interlocutory appeal,or to vacate it in part.arguing for reconsideration,fidelity claimed that the court made three critical errors of law in finding that the subject of the berensons complaints constituted an error,triggering the efta error resolution provisions,even though the claimed impropriety did not fall within any of the narrowly defined categories of error enumerated in the statute the lost opportunity to earn interest was a fee subject to disclosure under efta and fidelity is a bank under mtisl.
alternatively,fidelity argued that the court should certify its rulings for interlocutory appeal under b,which provides that 
when a district judge,in making in a civil action an order not otherwise appealable shall be of the opinion that such order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation,he shall so state in writing in such order.
fidelity argued that the issues in the case involve open questions of controlling law,are important because of the impact they are likely to have throughout the financial industry,and that resolution of these issues was likely to materially advance the ultimate termination of litigation.finally,fidelity argued that the court should withdraw its order to the extent that it concerned substantive matters that should properly be decided by arbitrators,the legal points on which it sought reconsideration.
the court denied fidelity motion without explanation on november.fidelity filed this interlocutory appeal under the federal arbitration act,a b faa which provides,in pertinent part,that a n appeal may be taken from an order denying a petition to order arbitration to proceed.fidelity argues that,once the district court entered its order to compel arbitration,it no longer had the authority to address the merits of any remaining claims.by discussing the efta and chapter claims on the merits in its october opinion,fidelity asserts that the district court effectively denied its request for arbitration as to those claims.similarly,fidelity argues that the court refusal to reconsider or vacate its october opinion and order constituted a second denial of its request for arbitration of the berensons claims.at the heart of fidelity appeal lie two concerns that the arbitrator who will now resolve the parties dispute will rely on the court substantive determinations,which fidelity views as erroneous and that an unwelcome district court decision will remain on the books.
the berensons insist that we do not have jurisdiction to hear this appeal.we begin by examining that proposition.ordinarily,appeal is available only from a final judgment of the district court.marie allied home mortg,cir.however,there are a few exceptions to this general rule,including when a party seeks interlocutory review of a district court order denying a petition to order arbitration to proceed,a b.although the dispute between f
