introduction 
plaintiffs bernadette tanguilig and juan carlos pinela brought this putative class action against their former employer,neiman marcus group,nmg,alleging violations of the california labor code,and nmg moved to compel arbitration.the trial court initially ordered arbitration of all pinela claims except his claim under the labor code private attorneys general act of paga,et,but later reconsidered its order and denied the motion,concluding the arbitration agreement at issue is illusory.on appeal,nmg argues the court lacked jurisdiction to reconsider its initial order,an arbitrator,rather than a court,must determine any challenges to the enforceability of the arbitration agreement,and the arbitration agreement is enforceable and encompasses all pinela claims,including his paga claim.finding no merit to these arguments,we affirm.
ii.background 
nmg is a fashion retailer headquartered in texas with stores across the united states.tanguilig originally sued nmg in august.the case was designated complex,and after a series of pretrial motions not relevant here,she filed the operative third amended complaint tac in march,among other things adding pinela as a second proposed class representative.tanguilig and pinela worked for nmg in california and sought to represent a class of nmg current and former california employees.the tac alleges various claims under the california labor code and includes a cause of action under paga 
in august,after plaintiffs moved for class certification,nmg prompted,it says,by the united states supreme court then recent decision in at t mobility llc concepcion,concepcion moved to compel arbitration of pinela claims under nmg mandatory arbitration program for disputes.in support of its motion,nmg submitted evidence that,at the time of pinela employment november through november,it distributed to each new employee a copy of its mandatory arbitration agreement,brochures explaining the arbitration program,and an employee handbook that included a brief description of the program collectively,the nmg arbitration agreement or the agreement.under the nmg arbitration agreement,any employee working for nmg after july,is deemed to have consented to the terms of the agreement.
included within the scope of the agreement are any and all complaints,disputes,or legal claims that pinela or nmg may have against the other,arising out of or connected in any way with pinela employment,including claims for v iolations of any state statute,ordinance,regulation,or public policy relating to meal or rest breaks,minimum wage and overtime pay,or payment at termination.the agreement prohibits the arbitrator from consolidat ing claims of different employees into one proceeding or from consider ing,certify ing,or hear ing an arbitration as a class action.during the orientation process for all new employees,nmg provided each new employee with two acknowledgment forms that refer to the arbitration program.the forms stated that the employee had received the agreement and understood that it required the employee and nmg to arbitrate any disputes.pinela signed the two acknowledgment forms in november 
on november,the trial court issued an order granting nmg motion in part.the court found that the nmg arbitration agreement did not clearly and unmistakably designate the question of arbitrability to an arbitrator,but ruled that the agreement is enforceable and that t he scope of the agreement is broad enough to cover all of pinela claims in this case with the exception of his claim under paga,which is not subject to arbitration all other questions on arbitration,the court ruled,including the impact,if any,of the california supreme court decisions in armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th armendariz and gentry superior court cal th gentry abrogated as stated in iskanian cls transportation los angeles,llc cal th,are for the arbitrator to decide.pinela sought writ relief no,which this court denied in january on the ground he has an adequate remedy at law by appeal after a judgment confirming any arbitration award.
in a joint case management conference statement filed with the trial court following our order denying the writ petition,plaintiffs counsel reported that pinela had submitted a formal demand for arbitration before the american arbitration association aaa,but that,as of february,the parties had not yet selected an arbitrator and arbitration proceedings had not yet begun.given the nascent state of the arbitration proceedings,plaintiffs counsel suggested the court might wish to reconsider its arbitration order in light of the february,decision in ajamian th ajamian.in a march order,the court,on its own motion and exercising its inherent authority,decided to reconsider its arbitration order.the parties stipulated to a stay of all arbitration proceedings 
initially,no one questioned whether the trial court had jurisdiction to reconsider or modify its order granting nmg motion to compel arbitration.all parties were in favor of it,for different reasons.pinela and tanguilig wanted another shot at convincing the court to deny the motion outright.and nmg,facing an effort by pinela to convince the aaa to permit him to proceed on a class basis under gentry,an issue that the trial court ruling compelling arbitration left open for consideration by the arbitrator,wanted a definitive order that foreclosed any possibility of class arbitration in light of concepcion.in fact,nmg affirmatively took the position that the trial court had jurisdiction to reconsider.after the briefing relating to reconsideration was underway,however,nmg took a different tack and argued the trial court lacked jurisdiction to reconsider its order.
reconsideration proceedings eventually expanded to cover a number of issues,including the effect of the april,decision in peleg neiman marcus group,th peleg.in peleg,division one of the second district court of appeal held an arbitration agreement identical in form to the agreement at issue in this case was illusory under texas law which the appellate court applied pursuant to a choice of law provision and therefore unenforceable.peleg,supra,at.in an order dated november,the trial court vacated its november,order compelling arbitration,and denied nmg motion to compel arbitration.the court stated that,under peleg,the nmg arbitration agreement was illusory and therefore unenforceable 
nmg timely appealed.
iii.discussion 
a.the trial court had jurisdiction to reconsider its order compelling arbitration 
nmg contends that,once the trial court entered an order compelling arbitration,the court lost jurisdiction to reconsider whether the case belongs in arbitration.we disagree.
if a court at any time determines that there has been a change of law that warrants it to reconsider a prior order it entered,it may do so on its own motion and enter a different order.code civ,subd.c.even without a change of law,a trial court may exercise its inherent jurisdiction to reconsider an interim ruling.le francois goel cal th,le francois.specifically,the trial court has authority to reconsider orders compelling or denying arbitration.malek blue cross of california th,malek blake ecker th,blake,disapproved on other grounds in le francois,supra,at,fn.see knight et,cal.practice guide alternative dispute resolution the rutter group.
the cases relied on by nmg do not establish the court lacked jurisdiction.as nmg notes,courts have held that,when an order compelling arbitration is in place and the trial court has stayed pending litigation while the arbitration is proceeding see code civ,the court retains only vestigial powers over the matters submitted to arbitration.cinel christopher th.the arbitrator,not the court,for example,must generally decide questions as to how the arbitration will be conducted equities group,superior court th,the court may not dismiss a case for lack of prosecution when the claims at issue have been ordered to arbitration blake,supra,th at and a court may not lift a stay of litigation while the arbitration remains pending on the ground the parties can not afford to arbitrate mkja,fit franchising,llc th,mkja 
these and similar cases cited by nmg are inapposite.none of them addresses a claim that a trial court lacks authority to reconsider its own order compelling arbitration.see malek,supra,th at pp.inapposite because it did not involve a motion for reconsideration trial court had jurisdiction to reconsider its prior ruling compelling arbitration despite the parties near completion of arbitration.while it is correct as a general matter that the granting of a stay under code of civil procedure section places the proceedings before the trial court in the twilight zone of abatement brock kaiser foundation hospitals th,such a stay does not effect the ouster of the judicial power vested in the trial court of this state by our constitution id.at.because contractual arbitration dr aws its vitality from the contract id.at,a trial court has inherent power to revisit the foundational question of whether the parties are bound by a particular arbitration agreement malek,supra,th at,just as it may on its own motion revise any other interim ruling in the action pending before it le francois,supra,cal th at pp.
after initially sending the vast bulk of this case to an arbitrator while keeping a piece of it a split procedural result that presented its own complexities the trial court continued to monitor and remain alert to new legal developments bearing on the correctness of its original decision to compel arbitration.in doing so,the court was responding to suggestions from the parties,pertinent developments in the appellate courts including writ proceedings in this court,see ante fn,and its own considerable experience in this rapidly evolving area of law.that is as it should be.as justice frankfurter once observed,w isdom too often never comes,and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late.henslee union planters national bank trust,frankfurter,dissenting.recognizing this reality,the le francois rule provides ample flexibility to accommodate the need to revisit interim rulings sua sponte whenever and for whatever reasons a trial judge deems appropriate.an order compelling arbitration is not exempt from that rule.
b.a court may determine the enforceability of the arbitration agreement 
nmg argues an arbitrator,not a court,must determine whether the nmg arbitration agreement is enforceable,because the agreement delegates questions of enforceability to the arbitrator.section of the agreement states any dispute concerning this agreement the way it was formed,its applicability,meaning,scope,enforceability,or any claim that all or part of this agreement is void or voidable is subject to arbitration under this agreement and shall be determined by the arbitrator.
under section of the federal arbitration act faa,a written provision in any contract involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.see armendariz,supra,cal th at pp.see also code civ.although threshold questions of arbitrability are ordinarily for courts to decide in the first instance under the faa ajamian,supra,th at,the p arties to an arbitration agreement may agree to delegate to the arbitrator,instead of a court,questions regarding the enforceability of the agreement.tiri lucky chances,th,tiri.
for a delegation clause to be effective,two prerequisites must be satisfied.first,the language of the clause must be clear and unmistakable.rent a center,west,jackson,fn.rent a center tiri,supra,th at.the required clear and unmistakable expression is a heightened standard rent a center,supra,at,fn,pertain ing to the parties manifestation of intent,not the agreement validity i t is an interpretive rule,based on an assumption about the parties expectations.in circumstance s where contracting parties would likely have expected a court to have decided the gateway matter of arbitrability,citation,we assume that is what they agreed to.thus,u nless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise,the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is to be decided by the court,not the arbitrator,italics omitted,citing at t technologies communications workers.
second,the delegation must not be revocable under state contract defenses to enforcement.rent a center,supra,at see sonic calabasas a,moreno cal th,sonic ii.among these defenses is unconscionability.in california,the common law doctrine of unconscionability was codified in in civil code section.carboni arrospide th.the legislature adopted as generally applicable to all contracts the terms of a uniform commercial code provision governing unconscionability.carboni arrospide,supra,th at.although unconscionability is now codified as a statutory defense,a claim that a contract is unenforceable on this ground remains an equitable matter.hartley superior court th.that equity does not enforce unconscionable bargains is too well established to require elaborate citation.under both federal and california law,arbitration agreements are valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the voiding of any contract,citations omitted.
as to the first requirement,the peleg court determined that,under california law the nmg arbitration agreement did not clearly and unmistakably delegate enforceability questions to the arbitrator.peleg,supra,th at pp.the agreement does point in two directions.section states the arbitrator is to decide enforceability questions,but the severability provision section recognizes a court may decide the same issue.id.at pp.section states in part if any court determines that this agreement in its entirety shall not be enforced,such determination shall be effective only as to covered employees who reside in the state where such court is located,and not as to any other covered employees id.at,italics added by peleg court.after reviewing california cases addressing similar contractual provisions,the peleg court concluded the inconsistency between the agreement delegation and severability provisions indicates the parties did not clearly and unmistakably delegate enforceability questions to the arbitrator.id.at.
nmg argues this court should apply texas law to determine whether the agreement clearly and unmistakably delegates enforceability questions to the arbitrator,and under texas law,the agreement does clearly and unmistakably delegate such questions.we agree with peleg that under california law there is no clear and unmistakable delegation in the nmg arbitration agreement,but even assuming texas law might dictate a different outcome on that threshold question,it makes no difference here because we conclude the second prerequisite to delegation the nonrevocability of the delegation provision is not met.see tiri,supra th at.as we shall explain,california law applies to this issue,and under california law the delegation provision is revocable because it is unconscionable 
pinela argued in the trial court,and argues on appeal,that both the delegation provision and the agreement as a whole are unconscionable.the trial court did not address unconscionability in either respect.because the issue was raised below and is properly before us,and because the underlying facts are undisputed,we will decide the legal question of unconscionability here,in the first instance.higgins superior court th.with no facts in dispute,our review is de novo.serafin balco properties,llc th,serafin.
the core concern of the unconscionability doctrine is the absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party.sonic ii,supra,cal th at.the doctrine is meant to ensure that contracts,particularly contracts of adhesion,do not impose terms that are overly harsh,unduly oppressive,so one sided as to shock the conscience,or unfairly one sided.ibid.tiri,supra,th at,fn.omitted.substantively unconscionable terms may take various forms,but may generally be described as unfairly.citation.in assessing substantive unconscionability,the paramount consideration is mutuality.citation.murphy check n go of california,th,murphy.
the analysis begins with an inquiry into whether the contract is one of adhesion.citation.the term contract of adhesion signifies a standardized contract,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.citation.if the contract is adhesive,the court must then determine whether other factors are present which,under established legal rules legislative or judicial operate to render it unenforceable.armendariz,supra,cal th at.the adhesive nature of an agreement under challenge thus heralds the beginning,not the end,of our inquiry into its enforceability.parada superior court th.
moving a step deeper into the analysis,u nconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element,the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,the latter on overly harsh or results.citation.tiri,supra,th at accord,serafin,supra,th at.the prevailing view is that procedural and substantive unconscionability must both be present in order for a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability.citation.tiri,supra,th at pp.both,however,need not be present to the same degree.a sliding scale is applied so that the more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.serafin,supra,th at.the party opposing arbitration has the burden of proving unconscionability.tiri,supra,th at.
the supreme court explained in rent a center that any claim of unconscionability must be specific to the delegation clause.rent a center,supra,at.tiri,supra,th at.the plaintiff in rent a center failed to direct his claim of unconscionability specifically to the delegation clause,and thus delegation of the issue to the arbitrator was upheld in that case.rent a center,supra,at.to illustrate how such a claim might be made,however,the court explained that the employee contention that discovery limitations in arbitration were substantively unconscionable would have had to be specifically directed at the delegation clause.in the court words,the employee would have had to argue that the limitation upon the number of depositions causes the arbitration of his claim that the agreement is unenforceable to be unconscionable.rent a center,supra,at.the court acknowledged that this would be,of course,a much more difficult argument to sustain than the argument that the same limitation renders arbitration of the employee factbound claim unconscionable.ibid.tiri,supra,th at.
pinela starts with an advantage over the plaintiff in rent a center because he does make a specific unconscionability challenge to the delegation clause.he first argues,as he did in the trial court,that the delegation clause is part of a contract of adhesion.we agree.nmg drafted the delegation clause and presented it to pinela on a basis.the nmg agreement is mandatory.in his declaration in opposition to nmg motion to compel arbitration,pinela states it was his understanding he had to sign the agreement to be hired,and a human resources manager later confirmed that was the case.pinela further states that no one at nmg gave him the opportunity to discuss or change any of the provisions in the agreement.nmg makes no argument that anything in the delegation clause or the agreement as a whole was negotiable.to the contrary,in its opening brief on appeal,nmg affirms that all persons working for nmg after the initiation of the mandatory arbitration program were subject to the program,including the arbitration agreement,as a condition of employment.
the procedural element of unconscionability,as noted above,focuses on two factors oppression and surprise.oppression arises from an inequality of bargaining power which results in no real negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice.serafin,supra,th at.surprise involves the extent to which the supposedly terms of the bargain are hidden in the prolix printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce the disputed terms.tiri,supra,th at.for the same reasons that we conclude the delegation clause is part of a contract of adhesion,we conclude it is procedurally unconscionable.
the delegation clause was presented along with the rest of the agreement on a basis.ajamian,supra,th at,fn.arbitration provision procedurally unconscionable where presented on basis.courts have recognized that the issue of delegating arbitrability questions to an arbitrator is a rather arcane issue upon which parties likely do not focus.tiri,supra,th at.here,section of the nmg arbitration agreement,the choice of law clause,further complicates this issue,making it even less likely that an unsophisticated layperson like pinela would understand how arbitrability questions are to be resolved under the agreement.
section states this agreement shall be construed,governed by,and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of texas except where specifically stated otherwise herein,except that for claims or defenses arising under federal law,the arbitrator shall follow the substantive law as set forth by the united states supreme court and the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit.the arbitrator does not have the authority to enlarge,add to,subtract from,disregard,or otherwise alter the parties rights under such laws,except to the extent set forth herein.the parties recognize that nmg operates in many states in interstate commerce.therefore,it is acknowledged and agreed that the federal arbitration act,et,shall govern this agreement and the arbitration.italics added,boldface omitted.notably,the choice of law clause here is more exotic than a simple election of texas rather than california law.it adds the nuance that,where federal claims or defenses are at issue,fifth circuit law will govern 
while this is not a case involving fraud or sharp practices,we conclude there is more than the minimum degree of procedural unconscionability that is always present with an adhesive contract.grasping the import and meaning of this particular delegation clause would have been beyond the ken of most anyone in these rushed circumstances.without going to the expense of hiring a lawyer not just any lawyer,but a texas lawyer skilled in the intricacies of arbitrability,with the choice of law overlay presented here and then having sufficient time to seek and obtain legal advice from that lawyer,pinela was not in a position to make an informed assessment of the consequences of agreeing to delegate all questions concerning the applicability,meaning,scope or enforceability of the agreement to the arbitrator.although the delegation clause was not hidden from him,it might as well have been.
we are not the first court to recognize that obscure,difficult to comprehend choice of law clauses may serve as traps for the unwary in mandatory arbitration agreements.in mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton,mastrobuono,for example,antonio mastrobuono pressed an arbitration claim against shearson,his securities,and won an arbitration award that included punitive damages.invoking a new york choice of law clause in its standard form customer arbitration agreement,shearson sought to vacate the punitive damages element of the award on the ground that new york law does not permit punitive damages in arbitration.id.at.because mastrobuono had a right to seek punitive damages under the federal arbitration act,the united states supreme court upheld the award in its entirety.id.at.
the supreme court refused to permit contractual displacement of mastrobuono right to punitive damages under a choice of law clause he likely never saw and would not have understood even if he had seen it.the court explained that,at best,r espondents drafted an ambiguous document,and they can not now claim the benefit of the doubt.the reason for this rule is to protect the party who did not choose the language from an unintended or unfair result.that rationale is well suited to the facts of this case.as a practical matter,it seems unlikely that petitioners were actually aware of new york bifurcated approach to punitive damages,or that they had any idea that by signing a agreement to arbitrate disputes they might be giving up an important substantive right.in the face of such doubt,we are unwilling to impute this intent to petitioners.mastrobuono,supra,at,fn.omitted.nor do we see a basis to conclude,on this record,that full knowledge and appreciation of the consequences of agreeing to the delegation clause may be inferred from the fact that pinela signed an acknowledgment of the agreement.
turning to substantive unconscionability,we look first to our recent decision in tiri,where we explained that,in light of the united states supreme court decisions in rent a center,supra,at pages which held delegation clauses are valid absent a challenge specific to the delegation and concepcion,supra.at page which held courts may not issue categorical rulings that interfere with fundamental aspects of arbitration,clear delegation clauses in employment arbitration agreements are substantively unconscionable only if they impose unfair or burdens that are different from the clauses inherent features and consequences.tiri,supra,th at see id.at pp.mindful of the requisite need to focus specifically on delegation,we declined in tiri to follow prior decisions from this district holding that delegation clauses were unfair and therefore substantively unconscionable because employees are more likely to bring enforcement challenges,and arbitrators could be invested in the outcome of a challenge to the enforceability of an arbitration agreement.id.at pp.declining to follow ontiveros dhl express usa,th ontiveros and murphy,supra,th on this point see malone superior court th,fn.concluding ontiveros and murphy have been undermined by more recent authority.citing some of the same cases that we chose not to follow in tiri,pinela makes a sweeping argument that the delegation clause in the nmg arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable because it would frustrate the reasonable expectations of nmg employees to have an arbitrator,rather than a court,determine his or her own jurisdiction.once again we reject this line of argument,for it proves too much.as we noted in tiri,unconscionability arguments framed so broadly that they amount to attacks on inherent features and consequences of arbitral delegation clauses run contrary to rent a center and concepcion.
pinela does,however,make a more particularized substantive unconscionability challenge to the delegation clause that meets the standard we described in tiri,such a clause may be found substantively unconscionable where it imposes an unfair burden that is different from the inherent features and consequences of delegation clauses.see tiri,supra,th at.specifically,pinela points out,because of the texas choice of law provision,an arbitrator addressing pinela argument that the agreement as a whole is unconscionable would not have the authority to apply california unconscionability standards in making that determination.from this premise,pinela argues the texas choice of law provision as applied under section,the delegation provision renders section unconscionable because it unfairly restricts the legal arguments that he can make if he is required to arbitrate his claim that the nmg arbitration agreement is unconscionable.
this claim differs from the challenges to delegation discussed in rent a center and tiri.see rent a center,supra,at employee did not argue that limitations on discovery,as applied to delegation provision,rendered that provision unconscionable tiri,supra,th at employee did not assert and demonstrate that the confidentiality clause as applied to the delegation clause renders that clause unconscionable by impeding her ability to arbitrate whether the arbitration agreement as a whole is unconscionable.we conclude it has merit.as noted,section of the nmg arbitration agreement the choice of law provision requires application of texas law or,in some instances,fifth circuit law,and specifies the arbitrator does not have the authority to enlarge,add to,subtract from,disregard,or otherwise alter the parties rights under such laws,except to the extent set forth herein.italics added.while section provides the arbitrator will determine a challenge to the enforceability of the agreement brought by a california employee of nmg such as pinela,section prohibits the arbitrator from applying california unconscionability standards in making that determination.
when the weaker party to an adhesion contract can show the contract is unconscionable under california law,a contractual provision requiring the application of a different state law to enforce the contract is itself unenforceable.see samaniego empire today,llc th,samaniego.in samaniego,a panel in division three of this district affirmed a trial court determination that an arbitration clause in an employment agreement was unconscionable under california law.id.at.the plaintiffs in that case spoke spanish and did not read english at all,or sufficiently well to understand.id.at.they were given an employment contract in english and required to sign it,not knowing that the contract limited their substantive rights under california law.id.at.after analyzing substantive unconscionability,the samaniego court rejected the employer argument that,pursuant to a choice of law provision in the employment agreement,the enforceability of the arbitration clause was governed by illinois law.id.at pp.and it so held without examining the substance of illinois law.id.at,fn.we need not and do not make any determination whether illinois law would,in fact,require arbitration in this case.
in support of this holding,the samaniego court relied on the california supreme court decision in washington mutual bank superior court cal th washington mutual,stating in washington mutual,the supreme court explained that u nder nedlloyd lines superior court cal th nedlloyd,the weaker party to an adhesion contract may seek to avoid enforcement of a provision therein by establishing that substantial injustice would result from its enforcement citation or that superior power was unfairly used in imposing the contract citation indicating that evidence of unfair use of bargaining power may defeat enforcement of a clause contained in an adhesion contract.washington mutual,supra,cal th at pp,fn omitted.provisions contained in adhesion contracts are usually respected.nevertheless,the forum will scrutinize such contracts with care and will refuse to apply any provision they may contain if to do so would result in substantial injustice to the adherent.washington mutual,supra,at,fn,quoting rest d conflict of laws,com.b.samaniego,supra,th at.under these principles,the court explained,the same factors that render the arbitration provision unconscionable warrant the application of california law t o the extent illinois law might require enforcement of its arbitration clause,enforcing the employer provision would result in substantial injustice.the trial court correctly declined to apply it.samaniego,supra,th at,fn.omitted see harris bingham mccutchen llp th,harris as noted in samaniego,in california the weaker party to an adhesion contract may avoid enforcement of a provision therein where enforcement would result in substantial injustice,as defined by california law.
we find the analysis in samaniego persuasive and apply it here.we have concluded the nmg arbitration agreement is a contract of adhesion and is procedurally unconscionable.because of the choice of law clause in the nmg arbitration agreement,an arbitrator acting pursuant to the delegation clause could not apply california law to determine whether the agreement is unconscionable,or even limit the application of the choice of law provision to the extent necessary to prevent substantial injustice,as california law would require.see samaniego,supra,th at pp.harris,supra,th at see also ajamian,supra,th at,fn.delegation of enforceability questions was substantively unconscionable because in order to obtain relief from having to present her claims to a panel in new york under new york law,the arbitration provision would require the plaintiff to present her argument to that very panel in new york under new york law.instead,section states the arbitrator would not have authority to alter the rights the parties have under texas law.the elimination of pinela ability to contend that the nmg arbitration agreement as a whole is unconscionable under california law renders the delegation clause substantively unconscionable.
in addition to samaniego,hall superior court d,hall is instructive.hall,a securities case,arose in a situation where two california investors exchanged their interests in an oil and gas limited partnership in return for stock in one of their,imperial petroleum,a utah corporation.id.at.the contract memorializing their exchange agreement contained both forum selection and choice of law provisions identifying nevada as the selected forum and governing law.ibid.when the two investors later sued imperial in california on a securities fraud claim under california corporate securities law,imperial invoked the forum selection clause.id.at.the trial court found the clause to be enforceable and stayed the action,forcing the plaintiffs to repair to nevada.id.at.in reversing,the court of appeal analyzed the interaction of both clauses,noting that their enforceability was inextricably bound up with one another.id.at.
the reason for considering the forum selection and choice of law provisions together in hall was that a nevada court application of nevada law pursuant to the choice of law clause would deprive the investor plaintiffs of the protection of california securities laws.id.at.while recognizing that california does not have any public policy against a choice of law provision,where it is otherwise appropriate and that choice of law provisions are usually respected by california courts,the hall court held that an agreement designating a foreign law will not be given effect if it would violate a strong california public policy or result in an evasion of a statute of the forum protecting its citizens.hall,supra,d at.there was no need in hall to try to divine what a nevada court might do if it were to apply nevada law,just as the samaniego court saw no need to examine illinois law.because the effect of transferring the case to nevada would have been to strip plaintiffs of statutory protections guaranteed them under california law,the mere potential that those protections might be undermined was enough to justify refusing enforcement of the nevada forum selection clause.see hall,supra,d at.
returning to the enforceability of the delegation clause in this case,it is the interaction of the choice of law clause section with the delegation clause section that we focus upon.putting the matter in the language used by the hall court,because the ability of the arbitrator to call upon california law in deciding the enforceability questions entrusted to him is a consideration inextricably bound up in the question of the validity of the choice of law provision,a determination as to the validity of the choice of law provision as it applies to the delegation clause is prerequisite to a determination of whether the delegation clause should be enforced.hall,supra,d at.because the choice of law clause at issue here fails that threshold test,the delegation clause fails with it.
accordingly,because of the particular burdens imposed on pinela by sections and,burdens that are not an inherent feature or consequence of delegation clauses generally,and that were not borne equally by both contracting parties,we hold that the delegation clause in the nmg arbitration agreement is procedurally and substantively unconscionable.in our application of the test,we see more than a minimal degree of unconscionability for purposes of each prong of the test.no matter how finely we were to calibrate the scale at each end,the combination of both meets the overall test of unconscionability.thus,we conclude,the delegation clause is unenforceable under california law.
c.the nmg arbitration agreement as a whole is unconscionable 
having found the delegation clause to be unenforceable,we proceed to consider the enforceability of the nmg arbitration agreement as a whole.on reconsideration,the trial court,relying on peleg,found the agreement as a whole to be illusory and therefore unenforceable because section permits nmg to modify its terms unilaterally upon days notice.we agree that the nmg arbitration agreement is unenforceable,but we reach that conclusion because it is unconscionable,not because it is illusory.because we have already found procedural unconscionability,the enforceability of the agreement as a whole rises or falls largely on an analysis of substantive unconscionability.we therefore begin with that issue and focus most of our attention on it,applying california law,as we did in our analysis of unconscionability.
as we recently explained in serafin,s ubstantive unconscionability typically is found in the employment context when the arbitration agreement is in favor of the employer without sufficient justification,for example,when the employee claims against the employer,but not the employer claims against the employee,are subject to arbitration.serafin,supra,th at.additionally,t o be valid,at minimum the arbitration agreement must require a neutral arbitrator,sufficient discovery,and a written decision adequate enough to allow judicial review.further,it must include all remedies available in a judicial action and the employee may not be required to pay unreasonable costs or fees.citation.elimination of or interference with any of these provisions makes an arbitration agreement substantively unconscionable.wherry award,th,wherry,citing armendariz,supra,cal th at.serafin,supra,th at.
applying this test here,we see multiple unconscionable aspects to the nmg arbitration agreement.pinela attacks seven distinct provisions of the agreement as substantively unconscionable,and of these we focus primarily on three.
first,although pinela discussion of the choice of law clause focuses chiefly on the delegation provision,he also argues,and we agree,that section is more broadly problematic than that since it not only limits his ability to attack the agreement as a whole as unconscionable,but on its face disables california substantive law,undermining his claims on the merits.since pinela claims in this case are specifically founded on california statutory law,section works a substantial injustice on him as a citizen of california.see samaniego,supra,th at pp.ajamian,supra,th at pp,fn.arbitration provision unconscionably required employee to waive california substantive law by requiring application of new york law to the employee california employment employer fail ed to show that new york law would provide the employee with rights and remedies equivalent to those provided by california law see also serafin,supra,th at such a modification of california law as to attorney fees and costs is inappropriate under armendariz as it has the effect of denying a plaintiff the rights and remedies he or she would have if he or she were litigating his or her claims in court.
the issue here is not whether the absence of certain procedural rights in arbitration such as a bar on class proceedings or limited discovery raises questions about whether statutory claims under california law may be pursued effectively in an arbitral forum.texas extends statutory protections to employees for at least some of the violations alleged here,but it does not recognize a private cause of action for enforcement of any of them.see abatement williams,abatement tex.california does permit private enforcement of the labor code provisions identified in the tac see,subd.e,subd.c,subd.a,subd.a,but section amounts to an advance waiver of rights under those very statutes.by contractual choice of law,therefore,the substantive basis for pinela statutory claims has been eliminated,thus blocking him from pursuing his claims at all,not merely burdening their pursuit in arbitration 
this aspect of the agreement is plainly obnoxious to public policy in california.under california law,statutory rights may be waived only if the statute does not prohibit waiver,the statute public purpose is incidental to its primary purpose,and the waiver does not seriously undermine any public purpose the statute was designed to serve.lanigan city of los angeles th,citing sharon superior court cal th.more specifically,many statutory rights designed for the protection of a class of employees,including the labor code rights identified in the tac,are unwaivable,subd.a,subd.a.even when a limited waiver is permissible,the waiver of an important right must be a voluntary and knowing act done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.county of riverside,supra,cal th at.because there is nothing to support a valid and knowing waiver here,we conclude section is substantively unconscionable.mitsubishi motors soler chrysler plymouth,fn.upholding arbitrability of statutory antitrust claims under the federal sherman act with the caveat that in the event and clauses operated in tandem as a prospective waiver of a party right to pursue statutory remedies for antitrust violations,we would have little hesitation in condemning the arbitration agreement as against public policy.
our determination of substantive unconscionability with respect to section is buttressed by section of the agreement,which limits the parties to selection of an arbitrator who is licensed to practice law in texas and who reside s in texas.these requirements,along with the provision requiring the arbitrator to apply texas substantive law section,create an arbitral process that is designed to favor one side nmg.the procedures for arbitrator selection do give pinela the right to participate in choosing an arbitrator,but he can not put forward his own suggested candidates who are members of the california bar,chosen for their expertise in california law and their willingness to apply whatever regime of substantive law may be dictated under california principles.in a california dispute where the claimant seeks to enforce the california labor code and paga,we see no rational justification to limit the pool of potential arbitrators in this fashion.see ajamian,supra,th at,arbitration provision was unconscionable,in part because it allowed employer to unilaterally select the arbitration organization that would conduct the arbitration.
it is generally true that,under the faa,short of authorizing trial by battle or ordeal parties can stipulate to whatever procedures they want to govern the arbitration of their disputes and those procedures will be respected no matter how idiosyncratic they may be baravati josephthal,lyon ross,cir,but setting up procedures that have no apparent justification other than to tilt the scale of arbitral justice to one side advantage crosses the line.both the appearance and the reality of objective fairness matter when analyzing substantive unconscionability.as our supreme court explained in armendariz,unconscionability turns not only on a result,but also on an absence of justification for it.citation.if the arbitration system established by the employer is indeed fair,then the employer as well as the employee should be willing to submit claims to arbitration.without reasonable justification for a lack of mutuality,arbitration appears less as a forum for neutral dispute resolution and more as a means of maximizing employer advantage.armendariz,supra,cal th at pp.
second,section.a of the agreement agreed statute of limitations specifies a private statute of limitations generally requiring all claims to be brought within one year after the employee employment with nmg ends.section.a states all claims must be brought within the time allowed by the applicable statute of limitations,provided that no claim may be brought after one year of the date that the employee employment with nmg ceased.however,if a specific remedial statute provides for a longer limitations period and the arbitrator determines that to limit the time to a period shorter than that provided by statute would be illegal or unconscionable under applicable law,then the statutory time limitation shall be enforced by the arbitrator.california courts have held that,in the context of statutory claims such as the claims brought by pinela,a provision in an arbitration agreement shortening the statutory limitations period is substantively unconscionable.the labor code affords employees three or four years to assert claims.citations.where,as in this case,arbitration provisions undermine statutory protections,courts have readily found unconscionability.samaniego,supra,th at see wherry,supra,th at.
we are not persuaded by nmg argument that section.a is valid because it includes a saving clause allowing the arbitrator to enforce a longer limitations period if the arbitrator determines that applying the shorter private limitations period specified in the agreement would be illegal or unconscionable under applicable law.we have concluded above that the agreement delegation of unconscionability questions to the arbitrator is itself unconscionable.moreover,despite the general statement that the arbitrator may determine whether a shortened private limitations period is invalid under applicable law,the arbitrator authority to enforce california law limiting the waiver of particular limitations periods is uncertain in light of the directive in section that the arbitrator is to apply texas law and lacks authority to alter the rights the parties have under texas law.
third,pinela challenges section of the agreement,which states that,although nmg must pay most arbitration costs and the parties must pay their own attorney fees,the arbitrator may award such costs and fees as part of any award,to the extent such an award is permitted by applicable law.we agree this provision is substantively unconscionable as well,because imposition of costs and fees on pinela may burden his exercise of statutory rights.w hen an employer imposes mandatory arbitration as a condition of employment,the arbitration agreement or arbitration process can not generally require the employee to bear any type of expense that the employee would not be required to bear if he or she were free to bring the action in court.armendariz,supra,cal th at pp,italics omitted see sonic ii,supra,cal th at pp.imposition of costs and fees on employee may burden exercise of statutory rights ajamian,supra,th at attorney fee provision arguably strips the employee of her right to recover attorney fees under her california statutory labor code claims and imposes on her the obligation to pay the employer attorney fees where she would have no such obligation under at least one of her california statutory claims wherry,supra,th at.
in serafin,we recently addressed this very issue,noting that a provision in an arbitration agreement requiring both parties to bear their own attorney fees and costs was substantively unconscionable but severable in the circumstances of that case because it runs counter to california fair employment and housing act feha which allows a successful plaintiff to recover attorney fees and costs from the employer but does not similarly allow an employer to recover fees and costs from an employee in most cases.serafin,supra,th at.we stated such a modification of california law is inappropriate under armendariz as it has the effect of denying a plaintiff the rights and remedies he or she would have if he or she were litigating his or her claims in court.serafin,supra,th at.as nmg noted in the trial court,section of the agreement authorizes an award of arbitration costs or attorney fees to the extent such an award is permitted by applicable law.but,again,the arbitrator authority to apply the limitations outlined above california law limitations on the imposition of fees and costs is questionable in light of section of the agreement.
it is illuminating to compare the contract at issue in this case to the one we recently analyzed for unconscionability in serafin,supra,th.there,because the plaintiff showed a minimal degree of procedural unconscionability arising from the adhesive nature of the arbitration agreement at issue,under the approach she had the burden of making a strong showing of substantive unconscionability.id.at.she was unable to demonstrate any or lack of mutuality.id.at.and she pointed to only one clause that we found to be substantively unconscionable,a provision apportioning attorney fees and costs.id.at.after determining the fees and costs apportionment provision to be severable id.at,we found that no substantive unconscionability remained and affirmed the trial court order compelling arbitration id.at.
here,the approach produces a different result.the record shows more than the minimal degree of procedural unconscionability shown in serafin.and in sharp contrast to serafin,substantive unconscionability infects at least three contract provisions in addition to the delegation clause,including one that would have the effect of disabling california law in a case involving claims anchored in the statutory law of california.since both procedural and substantive unconscionability are present,pinela meets the overall test for unconscionability.unless the unconscionable provisions can be severed,we conclude that the nmg arbitration agreement as a whole is unenforceable under california law.severance was the correct solution in serafin where only one clause in an arbitration agreement was found to be substantively unconscionable,but in light of our determination that multiple provisions of the nmg arbitration agreement are substantively unconscionable here,we conclude that severance of the offending provisions is not appropriate.see carmona lincoln millennium car wash,th,when an arbitration agreement contains multiple unconscionable provisions,s uch multiple defects indicate a systematic effort to impose arbitration on an employee not simply as an alternative to litigation,but as an inferior forum that works to the employer advantage.the unconscionability we have found permeates the nmg arbitration agreement to such a degree that severance would amount to the parties contract,something we can not do.see ajamian,supra,th at.
california law applies whether we apply the abbreviated test for enforcement of the choice of law clause under samaniego and hall,or a full nedlloyd comparative governmental interest analysis 
we complete our unconscionability analysis by returning briefly to the issue of choice of law,which in many ways lies at the heart of this case.we have applied california law under samaniego and hall at both steps of the analysis,initially with respect to the delegation clause,and then again with respect to the agreement as a whole.but in light of the broadened scope of our evaluation at the second step of the unconscionability analysis,and in particular given our conclusion that the nmg arbitration agreement actually strips pinela of statutory protections of california law on multiple levels not merely that it has the potential to do so we emphasize that we would reach the same conclusion,and we do reach the same conclusion,under a full nedlloyd analysis.
using the conventional nedlloyd approach,a court must first determine whether the chosen state has a substantial relationship to the parties or their transaction,or whether there is any other reasonable basis for the parties choice of law.if neither of these tests is met,that is the end of the inquiry,and the court need not enforce the parties choice of law.if,however,either test is met,the court must next determine whether the chosen state law is contrary to a fundamental policy of california.if there is no such conflict,the court shall enforce the parties choice of law.if,however,there is a fundamental conflict with california law,the court must then determine whether california has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue rest atement second of conflict of laws,subd.if california has a materially greater interest than the chosen state,the choice of law shall not be enforced,for the obvious reason that in such circumstance we will decline to enforce a law contrary to this state fundamental policy.nedlloyd,supra,cal th at,fns.omitted accord,washington mutual,supra,cal th at pp.
there is no question that the chosen state,texas,has a substantial relationship to the parties.nmg,although a delaware corporation,is headquartered in texas.nor can there be any real doubt that this case presents a conflict between california and texas law.there is no legal basis in texas law for the claims pleaded in the tac.see abatement,supra,at.as a result,forcing pinela to arbitrate under texas law not only destroys the foundation for his affirmative claims,it eliminates his ability to argue unconscionability using california public policy as a measuring stick for enforceability.texas law does recognize the equitable defense of unconscionability in re poly america,and in some circumstances will refuse to enforce arbitration agreements that strip arbitration claimants of unwaivable statutory rights id.at,but if the chosen law of texas applies,pinela had no rights to waive.
faced with a conflict between california and texas law,we turn to which state,california or texas,has a greater interest in enforcement of its law in this circumstance.we acknowledge the value and efficiency to nmg of having a predictable,uniform regime wherever it does business nationally,and we do not minimize the priority texas may place on providing a hospitable legal climate for employers that is conducive to such uniformity.but when weighed against the countervailing interest of california in ensuring that its statutory protections for workers are not selectively disabled by companies wishing to do business in this state,we think california has the materially greater interest.that being the case,the parties choice of texas law will not be enforced for the obvious reason that it would be contrary to fundamental policy in california to do so.nedlloyd,supra,cal th at.the preemptive effect of the faa may not be used,in effect,as a lever to nationalize the policies of one state in derogation of the conflicting policies of other states.
accordingly,whether by the short route,under samaniego and hall,or the long route,under nedlloyd,california conflict of law rules lead us back to the same place california law applies to the unconscionability analysis at step one,the pinpoint evaluation of the delegation clause,and at step two,the evaluation of the nmg arbitration agreement as a whole.we conclude that the delegation clause and the agreement are both unconscionable and therefore unenforceable under california law.this case must proceed in court

tanguilig,who was already employed by nmg when the arbitration program was initiated,objected to the agreement and asked nmg to make changes to it.nmg declined to do so,emphasizing that its arbitration program was not optional and would apply to tanguilig if she continued to work for nmg.tanguilig states that she therefore declined to report for
