order modifying opinion and denying rehearing no change in judgment 
it is ordered that the opinion filed here on october,be modified as follows 
on page,delete footnote in its entirety and replace it with 
we recognize release in section,subdivision b,is used in the active,not passive,voice an action may be brought against any person or entity who has negligently released confidential information,rather than brought by a person whose confidential information has been released.however,that a patient may need to plead and prove the health care provider engaged in some affirmative conduct leading to an unauthorized third party access to confidential information does not mean,as the regents argues,the negligent conduct must involve a communicative act.
on page,at the end the paragraph before the disposition,after the sentence ending demurrer should have been sustained without leave to amend and the case dismissed.add as footnote the following footnote 
in a petition for rehearing platter for the first time requests leave to amend the complaint to allege the confidentiality of her personal information on the encrypted external hard drive was breached as a result of the regents negligence.specifically,platter asserts within months of the loss of the external hard drive an unauthorized telephone account was opened using the same personal information that was contained on the hard drive.because she had not previously been the victim of identity theft,platter contends it is a reasonable inference the two events are related and the unidentified individual who opened the telephone account is either the unknown thief who stole the hard drive or someone who obtained platter information from the thief.
we acknowledge leave to amend should be granted when the plaintiff has demonstrated a reasonable possibility she can amend her claim to state a viable cause of action see schifando city of los angeles,supra,cal th at,even if no similar request was made in the trial court.see code civ,subd.a schultz harney th.but here platter request is too late,coming only after she admitted in her return to the regents petition she had not alleged that any person accessed,viewed or used the confidential information on the external hard drive and then failed to suggest any possible amendment to the complaint in her briefing in this court or even at oral argument when questioned about the possible significance of a release of confidential information that was not thereafter accessed by an unauthorized individual.see reynolds bement cal th,argument regarding possible amendment of complaint not properly raised for first time in petition for rehearing.moreover,platter concedes there are other means by which her personal information may have been obtained,and the regents has presented information the theft of the external hard drive occurred in hawaii,not southern california as platter has assumed and where the identity theft apparently took place.under the circumstances there are simply too many layers of speculation required for these minimal facts to be considered sufficient to overcome the deficiency in platter complaint.see sandler sanchez th,leave to amend should not be granted where amendment would be futile vaillette fireman fund ins.th,same.

the confidentiality of medical information act cmia,et prohibits health care providers and related entities from disclosing medical information regarding a patient without authorization except in certain specified instances.a patient may bring an action for actual damages,nominal statutory damages of,or both against any person or entity that negligently released confidential medical information concerning him or her in violation of cmia,subd.b.in addition,any person or entity that negligently disclosed medical information in violation of cima is subject to an administrative fine or civil penalty,subd.c.
under cmia every health care provider who creates,maintains or disposes of medical information is also required to do so in a manner that preserves the confidentiality of that information,subd.a.any provider who negligently creates,maintains or disposes of medical information is subject to the remedies and penalties provided under subdivisions b and c of section,subd.a.
does this statutory scheme authorize a private cause of action for damages based solely on the negligent maintenance or storage of medical information even if the patient confidential records were never viewed or otherwise accessed by an unauthorized individual specifically,has a cause of action for nominal or statutory damages of been adequately pleaded by real party in interest and putative class plaintiff melinda platter,who has alleged the regents of the university of california,through its ucla health system,failed to have reasonable systems and controls in place to prevent the removal of protected medical information from one of its hospitals and,as a result,negligently lost possession of that information 
ruling a damage claim may be stated under section,subdivision a,based on a health care provider negligent maintenance or storage of an individual medical information without regard to whether it resulted in any actual release or disclosure of the information,respondent los angeles superior court overruled the regents demurrer to platter complaint.although we do not agree with the regents argument an affirmative communicative act by the health care provider is an essential element of platter claim,we hold,by incorporating the remedy specified in section,subdivision b,section allows a private right of action for negligent maintenance only when such negligence results in unauthorized or wrongful access to the information.because platter can not allege her information was improperly viewed or otherwise accessed,we grant the regents petition and issue a writ of mandate to the superior court directing it to vacate its order overruling the regents demurrer and to enter a new order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend and dismissing the action.
factual and procedural background 
the loss of the encrypted external hard drive and platter complaint for violation of cmia 
in a letter dated november,signed by robert gross,chief privacy officer of the ucla health system david geffen school of medicine,the regents advised certain patients treated at ucla facilities that an encrypted external hard drive containing some of their personally identifiable medical information had been stolen as part of a home invasion robbery approximately two months earlier.the letter also informed the recipients the password for the encrypted information was written on an index card near the device and that card could not be located.the letter stated,the theft was reported to the police and there is no evidence suggesting that your information has been accessed or misused.a public notice regarding the incident was published in the los angeles times for three consecutive days on november,
on october,platter filed a class action complaint in los angeles superior court seeking damages from the regents in a single cause of action for unlawful disclosure of confidential medical information in violation of cmia.platter alleged she had been treated on numerous occasions at ronald reagan ucla medical center and was one of more than ucla health system patients who had been notified of the loss of the external hard drive and the related password needed to decode the encrypted data.according to platter complaint,a physician in the ucla faculty practice group took the external hard drive,which contained patient names,dates of birth,addresses,financial information and medical records,to his home and left it unsecured with the encryption password.on or about september,the hard drive and written password were taken from the physician home.as of the date of the complaint neither the hard drive nor the encryption password had been recovered.
platter alleged the regents had failed to exercise due care to prevent the release or disclosure of her private medical information and that of the other putative class members without their written authorization.specifically,it failed to have reasonable systems and controls in place to prevent the removal of protected health information from the hospital premises and as a result it negligently lost possession of the hard drive and encryption passwords.platter did not allege she had suffered any actual damages,but sought statutory damages of for herself and for each member of the putative class pursuant to section,subdivision b 
the regents demurrer platter response 
the regents demurred to the complaint on january,pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision e,contending platter had failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for statutory damages under cmia because that remedy was available only if a health care provider had negligently disclosed or released confidential medical information and platter had not alleged her medical information was disclosed or released by the regents within the meaning of cmia.in its memorandum of points and authorities the regents asserted disclosure or release by a health care provider under cmia occurs only when the provider actively communicates medical information to a third party without the patient authorization a disclosure or release within the meaning of cmia does not occur when a third party through burglary,computer hacking or otherwise wrongfully obtains such information against the health care provider will.negligent storage or maintenance of medical information by a health care provider without such active disclosure or release,the regents argued,could subject the health care provider to administrative discipline,including fines or civil penalties,but not a private cause of action for damages under section,subdivision b.
in her response platter disputed the regents construction of the governing statutes.according to platter,cmia provides a cause of action for statutory damages in any case where it can be proved a health care provider negligence was the proximate cause of an unauthorized third party obtaining confidential patient information,whether the third party is a thief or the intended recipient of the provider affirmative or intentional act of communication.
the regents filed a reply memorandum.both parties also submitted requests for judicial notice to the superior court,including with their papers excerpts from the legislative history of cmia in the request by platter,as well as separate legislation enacted to safeguard electronically stored medical information from unauthorized access by third parties in the request by the regents.
the superior court order overruling the demurrer but striking portions of the complaint 
the superior court heard oral argument on april.on april,the court issued a page ruling and order,overruling the regents demurrer but striking a portion of platter cause of action for violation of cmia.
relying upon what it concluded was the plain meaning of the terms at issue,the court agreed with the regents that,under the facts as alleged,there was no disclosure of confidential information,a prerequisite to a claim for violation of section.however,the court also ruled cmia established two separate types of wrongful conduct wrongful disclosure of confidential medical information under section and wrongful maintenance and storage of confidential information under section t he negligent maintenance,preservation,and storage of confidential data under specifically provides the remedy of in nominal damages this is because the remedy portion of b and c is incorporated by reference into.as such,on the face of the statute,there is no requirement under that,to be eligible for the nominal damages or,as the case may be,actual damages,that there also have been a negligent release of the confidential information under b.
based on this analysis of the statutory scheme,the court overruled the demurrer,finding platter had stated a claim for violation of cmia because she alleged the regents failed to have reasonable systems and controls in place to prevent the removal of protected health information from the hospital premises and as a result it negligently lost possession of the hard drive and encryption passwords.nevertheless,because platter had not alleged any affirmative disclosure of confidential information by the regents,the court struck that portion of her cmia claim premised on the allegation in paragraph of the complaint that the regents had failed to exercise due care to prevent the release or disclosure of private medical information of plaintiff and the class members without their written authorization.
in an order filed april,pursuant to code of civil procedure section,the superior court indicated its belief the april,ruling and order addressed a controlling question of law as to which there were substantial grounds for difference of opinion and stated that immediate appellate resolution of the question of statutory interpretation raised by the regents demurrer might materially advance the conclusion of the litigation.
the writ proceedings 
on june,the regents petitioned this court for a writ of mandate directing the superior court to vacate its order overruling the demurrer and to enter a new order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend and dismissing the action.the petition argued the superior court ruling would create a sweeping private right of action that was not intended by the legislature,emphasized the regents potential liability for million in nominal damages under the superior court interpretation of cmia and asserted the need to expend resources to defend this litigation,rather than resolve the pure legal question raised through this writ proceeding,would create serious difficulties for the regents.
while initially considering the petition we received letter briefs from amici curiae in support of the regents position from the lucile packard children hospital and stanford hospital and clinic,the california hospital association and the california medical association.real party in interest platter submitted an opposition to the petition for writ of mandate,and the regents filed a reply.on june,we issued an order to show cause why the relief requested in the petition should not be granted.on july,platter filed her return to the petition,and on august,the regents filed its reply.on august,we received an amicus curiae brief in support of the regents from sutter health,sutter medical foundation and sutter connect,llc dba sutter physician services,which advised us,in part,the issue presented here is also currently pending before the third district court of appeal sutter health superior court of sacramento county.
discussion 
the propriety of extraordinary writ relief 
an order overruling a demurrer is not directly appealable and will rarely be reviewed in a petition for extraordinary writ relief.see,brandt superior court cal d,we are reluctant to exercise our discretion to review rulings at the pleading stage of a lawsuit city of huntington park superior court th.however,when the question is purely legal and the issue significant,relief by extraordinary writ is appropriate babb superior court cal d,county of santa clara superior court th,city of huntington park,at.here,the issue of statutory construction raised by the superior court ruling and presented by the regents petition has not previously been addressed by an appellate court and,based on the amici curiae submissions we have received,appears to be of widespread interest.accordingly,writ review is appropriate.
standard of review 
a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint.we independently review the superior court ruling on a demurrer and determine de novo whether the complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action or discloses a complete defense.mccall pacificare of,cal th,aubry tri city hospital dist.cal th.we assume the truth of the properly pleaded factual allegations,facts that reasonably can be inferred from those expressly pleaded and matters of which judicial notice has been taken.evans city of berkeley cal th,schifando city of los angeles cal th.we liberally construe the pleading with a view to substantial justice between the parties.code civ,schifando,at.

the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for statutory damages under cmia 
the superior court found,and the regents does not dispute,platter complaint adequately alleges the regents violated the duty imposed by section,subdivision a,to maintain and store medical information in a manner that preserves the confidentiality of that information.mack soung th,all properly pleaded allegations deemed true for purposes of demurrer regardless of plaintiff ability to later prove them.the regents,therefore,is potentially subject to the remedies and penalties provided under subdivisions b and c of section,subd.a.section,subdivision c,concerns administrative fines and civil penalties and is not directly at issue in this case.subdivision b authorizes an individual action for damages actual in nominal or statutory damages,but what is the nature of that remedy as applied to the negligent maintenance or storage of medical information specifically,who may bring the action,and what must he or she plead and prove 
a.a cause of action for statutory damages based on negligent storage or maintenance of confidential medical information requires pleading and proof that the plaintiff confidential information has been released to a third party 
obviously troubled by the implications of its conclusion that disclose,as used in section,subdivision a,and release,as used in section,subdivision b,are synonymous and that both require an affirmative communicative act,as the regents had argued the issue we discuss in the following section of this opinion the superior court determined cmia defined two separate species of wrongful conduct and two separate violations the wrongful disclosure of confidential medical information under section and the wrongful maintenance and storage of confidential information under section,subdivision a.in the absence of proof of actual damages,the remedy for the negligent release of information,which the court equated with its wrongful disclosure,is in nominal or statutory damages,as provided in section,subdivision b.in addition,the court reasoned,the remedy for negligent maintenance,preservation or storage of confidential information that does not cause actual damage is again in nominal damages because the remedy portion of section,subdivision b,is incorporated into section.as such,the court concluded,there is no requirement under that,to be eligible for the nominal damages,that there also have been a negligent release of the confidential information under b.in the court view,section merely incorporated the damages available under section,subdivision b,but did not import the affirmative elements of the cause of action described in that subdivision,that is,the negligent release of confidential information.
the superior court read section,subdivision a incorporation of the remedies and penalties provided under subdivisions b and c of section far too narrowly.the remedy provided in subdivision b is the right of an individual whose confidential information has been released in violation of cmia to bring a private cause of action for nominal actual damages.see legis.counsel,bill reg.sess.t he bill would provide that violation of the act would be grounds for suspension o r revocation of a health care service plan license and would create a right of action to recover damages,as specified,for any individual whose confidential information or records are negligently released.by incorporating the entire subdivision b remedy,and not simply the measure of damages described in subdivision b and,the legislature plainly intended an action predicated on a health care provider negligent maintenance of confidential information in violation of section also plead and prove a release of that information.
this use of the term remedy to refer to the private cause of action itself,rather than to the particular form of relief available,is hardly unusual.see,munson del taco,cal th,addition of subd.f to section of the unruh civil rights act,which incorporated the americans with disabilities act of ada,was intended to provide a person injured by violation of the ada with the remedy of a private damages action lu hawaiian gardens casino,cal th,discussing how courts determine whether legislature intended to create a private cause of action a statute may refer to a remedy or means of enforcing its substantive provisions,by way of an action id.at nothing we hold herein would prevent the legislature from creating additional civil or administrative remedies,including,of course,creation of a private cause of action for violation of the labor code section at issue see also san diego gas electric superior court cal th,pub,authorize es the traditional private remedy of an action for damages brought by the injured party in superior or municipal court against any public utility.moreover,when the legislature simply wants to incorporate the damage measure from one provision into another,it does so directly.for example,health and safety code section,subdivision a,provides an administrative fine may be assessed by the office of health information integrity for any violation of this division concerning additional safeguards to protect the privacy of patient information in an amount as provided in section of the civil code.here,in contrast,section,subdivision a,does not refer to the amount as provided but rather to the remedy specified in subdivision b,an incorporation that includes more than just the nominal damage amount available to a successful plaintiff.
any lingering uncertainty about this interpretation of the elements of a private cause of action based on negligent maintenance of medical records is dispelled by the original language of senate bill reg.sess,which added both sections and,subdivisions b and c,to cmia,effective january.stats,ch.as enacted in,in addition to imposing a duty on health care providers to maintain and store medical records in a manner that preserves the confidentiality of the information contained therein,section stated,any provider of health care,health care service plan,or contractor who negligently disposes,abandons or destroys medical records shall be subject to the provisions of this part that is,to the provisions of cmia.stats,ch,italics added.thus,as originally enacted under senate bill,negligent preservation of confidential patient information would expose a health care provider not only to administrative sanctions under new section,subdivision c,but also to the new private cause of action established in section,subdivision b,as well as potentially to a damage action under section and a criminal misdemeanor proceeding under section,subdivision a.there was no separate,private cause of action for violation of section.
the following year,as part of legislation making technical and clarifying changes to cmia,section was amended to substitute negligently creates,maintains,preserves,stores for negligently disposes and to replace subject to the provisions of this part with subject to the remedies and penalties provided under subdivisions b and c of section.stats,ch,see com.on,analysis of bill reg.sess.bill would make clarifying and conforming changes to.this revision simply clarified which provisions of this part contained the available remedies for violation of section it did not purport to create a new private cause of action for violations of that section.the incorporation of section,subdivision b remedy,therefore,necessarily included the affirmative elements of the cause of action for negligent release of confidential information.
notwithstanding its conclusion that section incorporated only the measure of damages specified in section,subdivision b,and not the other elements of subdivision b private cause of action,the superior court implicitly acknowledged the flaw in its analysis and recognized that more than a bare allegation of negligent maintenance of confidential information by a health care provider is required to recover nominal or statutory damages.thus,the superior court did not rule,and platter herself does not argue,a cause of action may be stated under section,subdivision a,by any patient of a health care provider who has negligently maintained or stored some of its confidential medical records,let alone by someone who is not even a patient of the provider.at the very least,the information potentially compromised as a result of the negligent conduct must relate to the individual initiating the action,consistent with section,subdivision b requirement that the confidential information or records at issue concern him or her.yet this minimum threshold requirement must necessarily be based on the incorporation of at least some of the affirmative elements of the private damage remedy created by section,subdivision b there is no other statutory ground on which it could stand 
here,platter has satisfied this initial pleading requirement,alleging as reported in the notice she received from ucla health system that her confidential medical records were among those on the external hard drive taken from the physician home on september.for the reasons discussed,however,more is required section,subdivision b,incorporated into section,subdivision a,requires pleading and proof that confidential information has been released in violation of cmia to bring a private cause of action for nominal actual damages.
b.a cause of action for statutory damages based on negligent storage or maintenance of confidential medical information requires pleading and proof of a release of the information but not an affirmative communicative act by the health care provider 
although we agree with the regents an action for nominal damages under sections,subdivision a,and,subdivision b,requires pleading and proof of a release of confidential information,that does not mean,as the regents contends,an affirmative communicative act by the health care provider is an essential element of platter claim.specifically,release as used in section,subdivision b,is not synonymous with disclose in section,subdivision a and the regents posits a false dichotomy between disclosure or release,on the one hand,and unauthorized access by third parties,on the other hand.
to disclose and to release are not synonymous 
cmia does not define disclose or release.as a matter of their common or ordinary dictionary meanings,however,to disclose and to release are not synonymous.see generally angelucci century supper club cal th,i n interpreting a statute,we first consider its words,giving them their ordinary meaning and construing them in a manner consistent with their context and the apparent purpose of the legislation.disclose,as the regents explains,is an active verb,denoting in the context of cmia and the protections afforded confidential medical information an affirmative act of communication but to release is broader,including not only to give permission for publication,performance,exhibition or sale of or to make available to the public,the definitions identified by the superior court and to set free from restraint,confinement,or servitude to let go,among the definitions proffered by the regents but also to cause or allow to move away or spread from a source or place of confinement and to allow or enable to escape from confinement.allow to spread and enable to escape plainly do not connote affirmative acts propelling information or a substance outward.health,subd.d legislative findings regarding asbestos abatement and control w hen asbestos materials deteriorate or become loose,damaged,or friable,they release asbestos fibers into the ambient air.thus,under the usual and ordinary meaning of the statutory language,a health care provider who has negligently maintained confidential medical information and thereby allowed it to be accessed by an unauthorized third person that is,permitted it to escape or spread from its normal place of storage may have negligently released the information within the meaning of cmia 
ii.established principles of statutory construction require we ascribe different meanings to different words used in the same statutory scheme and avoid an interpretation that would render any provision superfluous 
this plain meaning construction of sections and,subdivision b,is reinforced by our obligation to interpret different terms used by the legislature in the same statutory scheme to have different meanings.roy superior court th,w hen the legislature uses different words a part of the same statutory scheme,those words are presumed to have different meanings romano mercury ins.th,same see also brown kelly broadcasting cal d,when the legislature has carefully employed a term in one place and has excluded it in another,it should not be implied where excluded.the legislature elected to define the private cause of action created by section,subdivision b,in terms of a negligent release of information,rather than a negligent disclosure.there is no reason to believe that decision was anything but deliberate.
as discussed,both sections and,subdivision b,were added to cmia by senate bill in.prior to that time the legislature had provided a private cause of action for a patient whose medical information had been used or disclosed in violation of section and who has sustained economic loss or personal injury therefrom.such an individual could recover both compensatory and limited punitive damages in addition to any other remedies available at law.former stats,ch,italics added.
the provisions in senate bill expanded the private right of action for individuals whose medical information had been compromised in several different ways.first,new section,subdivision b,created a private cause of action for the negligent release of medical records,not only for their unauthorized disclosure or use.stats,ch.second,in addition to authorizing an action for compensatory damages for the negligent release of confidential information or records in subdivision b,section,subdivision b,expressly provides that nominal statutory damages of are available for a patient whose confidential information was negligently released without proof that the plaintiff suffered or was threatened with actual damages.moreover,by virtue of section health care providers are now charged with the duty not only to refrain from unauthorized disclosures of confidential medical information but also to maintain such information in a manner that preserves the confidentiality of the information contained therein former,stats,ch,duties far broader than the duty created by section.
for our purposes two aspects of this legislation bear emphasis.first,section,subdivision b,permitting the recovery of actual damages for the negligent release of confidential medical information or records,would be superfluous in light of section,if release as used in section,subdivision b,were synonymous with disclose as used in sections and.when interpreting a statute,w ords must be construed in context,and statutes must be harmonized,both internally and with each other to the extent possible.citation.interpretations that lead to absurd results or render words surplusage are to be avoided.people loeun cal th,accord,dyna med,fair employment housing com.cal d,a construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.reno baird cal th,c ourts should give meaning to every word of a statute if possible,and should avoid a construction making any word surplusage.
second,at the same time it created a private cause of action for the negligent release of confidential medical information in section,subdivision b,the legislature created a new system of administrative fines and civil penalties for the negligent or willful use or disclosure of such information in violation of cmia in section,subdivision c.again,our obligation to interpret different terms used by the legislature in the same statutory scheme to have different meanings requires we reject the regents argument that to disclose information and to release it within the meaning of cmia are synonymous and that both require an affirmative communicative act.in sum,by incorporating the remedy provision of section,subdivision b,in section,the legislature simply did not intend a private cause of action under section for negligent maintenance or disposal of confidential medical information to be limited to instances in which the health care provider disseminated the information through an affirmative communicative act.
indeed,if an affirmative communicative act by the health care provider were required to state a claim under sections that is,if only the negligent disclosure of that information,not just its negligent storage leading to unauthorized access,could support an award of civil damages the second sentence of former section now section,subdivision a expressly providing remedies for violations of section would be superfluous.the regents attempts to avoid this untenable conclusion by noting that section applies to pharmaceutical companies,which are not covered by section.thus,it reasons,section has independent significance because a private cause of action now exists against pharmaceutical companies that negligently maintain and release medical information.but pharmaceutical companies were not added to section until.stats,ch.this development does nothing to validate the regents interpretation of section remedial provisions an interpretation that would mean those provisions,when adopted in,were simply redundant and thus unnecessary.
nor are we persuaded by the regents observation that the legislature may create certain duties that are not enforceable through any private cause of action.although that is certainly true see,lu hawaiian gardens casino,supra,cal th at,it does little to explain what the legislature intended when it provided,first,that violation of the duty imposed by section was subject to the provisions of this part,and,thereafter,that such violations were subject to the remedies and penalties provided under subdivisions b and c of section.as discussed,section,subdivision b,only provides for a private cause of action for actual damages,nominal or statutory damages,or both.the legislature plainly created some form of private cause of action for negligent maintenance or disposal of confidential medical information the issue presented here is not whether a private right of action exists to enforce the duties created by section,but what are the elements of such a claim.
iii.subsequent legislation to further protect confidential medical information does not support the regents cramped interpretation of sections and,subdivision b 
finally,we reject the regents argument that a private cause of action under sections and,subdivision b,must include pleading and proof of an affirmative disclosure by the health care provider because in,some years after those provisions were adopted,the legislature enacted new regulatory safeguards for confidential medical records that expressly addressed unlawful or unauthorized access to such information,as well as its unauthorized use or disclosure.health,et see stats,ch,stats,ch.health and safety code section,subdivision a,imposes on health care facilities and clinics a duty to prevent unlawful or unauthorized access to,and use or disclosure of,patients medical information and,in subdivision b provides administrative remedies for the failure to report improper access,use or disclosure.a finding of negligence is not necessary to trigger administrative sanctions.similarly,health and safety code section,subdivision a,requires health care providers to establish and implement appropriate administrative,technic
