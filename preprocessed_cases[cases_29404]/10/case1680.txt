this is a consolidated appeal of matters that arose in the course of a class action in the marin county superior court case,perry vitamin shoppe.case no.perry.
after the trial court conditionally certified the class for settlement purposes,appellant jeffrey spencer,attorney for appellant lisa hernandez,a plaintiff in perry,sent a letter to various class members urging them to opt out of the settlement,and to retain him as counsel against vitamin shoppe in another class action involving the same matters.the court subsequently issued orders and rulings regarding these communications,barring spencer from certain future communications,and granting monetary sanctions against him,which appellants hernandez and spencer challenge on appeal.in the published portion of this opinion,we affirm these rulings and orders,except that we reverse the trial court imposition of monetary sanctions against spencer.
in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we consider the arguments of appellant andrew shatz,the sole objector to the settlement,who contends that the trial court acted improperly in the course of supervising the exclusion period,and should not have approved an inadequate settlement.we reject shatz arguments,and affirm the court final judgment.
background to both appeals 
perry was filed in the marin county superior in august on behalf of certain california employees of vitamin shoppe.the complaint alleged nonpayment of overtime wages,meal and rest period violations,other violations of the labor and business and professions codes and of industrial welfare commission wage orders,and violations of common law.
after vitamin shoppe answered the complaint,it informally provided extensive written discovery,and plaintiffs counsel interviewed class members and putative class representatives,and conducted operational observations.this informal discovery included disclosure of vitamin shoppe wage,payroll,and time records for the class period,and its applicable written policies.the information exchanged indicated that vitamin shoppe had been operating in california since december,starting with a handful of stores.at the time of the complaint filings,it had approximately stores,store managers,and assistant managers.vitamin shoppe had not classified assistant managers as exempt and had reclassified managers as prior to january.declarations from store managers and assistant managers indicated that the declarants were receiving meal and rest breaks on a consistent basis.
in the second half of,vitamin shoppe counsel approached plaintiffs counsel in the three different putative class actions that had been filed regarding these matters,including perry,and offered to settle on a classwide basis if the plaintiffs would agree to participate in mediation.spencer,as attorney for the named plaintiff thompson in thompson v.the vitamin shoppe thompson,filed in orange county,declined to participate.
the parties in perry reached a settlement after a day of mediation.they established a settlement fund of,which,after deduction of for attorney fees,for litigation expenses,and for administrative expenses,provided for payments to two subclasses of vitamin shoppe employees.the unpublished section of this opinion in february,certain named plaintiffs and vitamin shoppe jointly moved for preliminary approval of the class settlement,arguing that it was fair for numerous reasons.
spencer had petitioned the judicial council to coordinate the three class actions and stay them,without success,and had moved in thompson to stay the perry proceedings,also without success.the thompson court deferred hearing a pending petition for coordination to give the perry court the opportunity to rule on the motion for preliminary approval of the settlement.
hernandez and plaintiff thompson in thompson,both represented by attorneys spencer and jeffrey wilens,opposed preliminary approval on the grounds that class counsel had not engaged in formal discovery with vitamin shoppe,that the settlement was based on erroneous factual and legal assumptions,and that it was not within a range of reasonableness.the named plaintiffs in the third class action,beauford vitamin shoppe industries,filed in marin county,also opposed this preliminary approval.
in april,after hearing oral argument,including by spencer,the trial court,judge sutro presiding,granted the motion for preliminary approval and conditionally certified a class for settlement purposes.the court found that t he unique circumstances of this case,including the short time period,the small class size,the unsettled law regarding the applicable statute of limitations,and the extensive documentary evidence produced by vitamin shoppe and reviewed by all counsel and the mediator,support a proposed settlement at this stage of the litigation.the court also found that the lack of discovery was not an obvious deficiency in light of the extensive documents produced,and that the settlement was negotiated between experienced counsel who investigated and evaluated the case,conducted a lengthy mediation,and reached a settlement untainted by collusion.the court concluded that the proposed settlement appeared to be fair and within the range of reasonableness.it approved the proposed notice to class members regarding the settlement and a procedure for class members to object to,and exclude themselves from the settlement,appointed a claims administrator and ordered the administrator to mail the approved notices and exclusion forms,designated janine perry and tom vitrano as the class representatives,designated wynne law firm as class counsel,and scheduled the hearing for final review of the settlement for october.
i.the hernandez appeal 
additional background 
hernandez appeal centers around a dispute that resulted from letters hernandez attorney,spencer sent in june to various vitamin shoppe employees after the court had conditionally certified the class and approved the notice of proposed class settlement,but before the perry claims administrator sent the notice.the dispute led to certain court rulings and orders,the disqualification of judge sutro,the appointment of a new judge,and the issuance of written rulings,orders,and sanctions against spencer.
spencer,identifying himself as counsel in thompson,represented in his letters to various members of the conditionally certified class that if the perry settlement were approved,substantial compensation will be forfeited,that you will not be able to recover compensation for all the rest and meal periods you were denied or for all of the overtime compensation or penalties you are owed,and that u nder california law you are entitled to an extra hour of pay for each rest and meal period that you missed during your employment.he advised them to protect themselves from the perry settlement by opting out of the class and joining the thompson action,which he stated was in progress,encouraged them to request exclusion from the settlement,and warned that those who did not exclude themselves would be stuck with the settlement terms.he solicited them to retain him as counsel,or to contact him for advice or assistance with respect to excluding themselves from the class,and enclosed his retainer agreement.
upon learning about spencer letter,counsel for the perry class representatives and vitamin shoppe jointly applied ex parte for an order enjoining spencer from further communications with any class members.they also sought orders disqualifying him from further participation in the action,imposing monetary sanctions against him,directing that a corrective notice be sent to class members,and establishing a procedure to determine spencer had improperly influenced class members who had opted out of the settlement.spencer,as counsel for hernandez,argued that he had not received proper notice of the application,that his letters were proper because he had sent them as counsel in thompson rather than in perry,that the recipients,as members of a conditionally certified class,were not represented by class counsel,and that the letters constituted protected speech.the court,judge sutro presiding,continued the hearing to give spencer a further opportunity to respond.
at the continued hearing in july,the court,judge sutro presiding,heard further argument and granted the application.it rejected spencer arguments based on the fact that he had sent his letters after the court had conditionally certified a class and approved a notice procedure.it found that spencer letters were misleading,violated the rules of professional conduct regarding communications with represented parties,and had attempted to interfere with the proper procedures governing the proposed settlement of the case.it ordered that a corrective notice be sent,directed spencer to refrain from any further communications with class members that he did not represent,and granted the request for monetary sanctions,subject to further hearing on the amount.among other things,the court stated it was contemplating referring spencer to the state bar,but would not take action at that point,and that spencer ethical violations merited his disqualification as hernandez attorney,but granted spencer an opportunity to further brief that issue.
spencer,as counsel for hernandez,filed a verified statement of disqualification of judge sutro,arguing that judge sutro rulings and certain of his remarks about spencer at the hearing demonstrated bias and prejudice towards hernandez.judge sutro struck hernandez statement pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,finding that it failed to set forth legally cognizable grounds for disqualification.in hernandez marin county superior court,case no,hernandez filed a petition for writ of mandate with this court regarding judge sutro striking of the statement.we issued an alternative writ of mandate on august,and the statement was reinstated.
the judicial council subsequently assigned the matter to santa clara superior court judge john garibaldi.judge garibaldi ordered judge sutro disqualified from sitting and acting in the above case because of the appearance of probable bias toward a lawyer in the proceeding pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.in his analysis,judge garibaldi relied upon code of civil procedure section,subdivisions a a and b,and considered the t he totality of judge sutro statements made at the subject hearing in july.he determined that a judge impartiality was subject to an objective,rather than a subjective standard,and that the issue is not limited to the existence of an actual bias.the question becomes whether a reasonable person would entertain doubts concerning the judge impartiality.judge garibaldi found a number of judge sutro hearing comments were appropriate,but was concerned about a half a dozen other comments,which appear to show judicial bias against counsel in this case.after discussing these comments,judge garibaldi stated 
much of this gratuitous language to an objective observer is highly indicative that judge sutro has adopted a mental attitude or disposition against a lawyer to the action.the comments strongly suggest,if they do not directly state,that the court believed spencer was an attorney who lacked credibility,whose only concern about litigation was to make money for himself,and whose willingness to engage in unprofessional behavior for his own financial gain undermined the principles of justice that judge sutro believed so deeply in.to a member of the discerning public,it would reasonably appear judge sutro has formed such a negative opinion of spencer that he would be unable to give him fair consideration in any future hearings in this case.
judge garibaldi also stated that his order was not a ruling on the legal soundness of judge sutro rulings at the ex parte application hearing.a party remedy for erroneous ruling is not a motion to disqualify,but rather a review by appeal or writ.he also expressed concerns about the court award of sanctions,but stated that he was not ruling on its legal propriety either.
the case was reassigned to judge duryee.class counsel and vitamin shoppe moved for an order formalizing judge sutro rulings and for sanctions,all of which hernandez opposed.the court,judge duryee presiding,after considering briefing and argument on the merits of judge sutro rulings,granted most of what was requested.it found that judge sutro disqualification had not rendered his oral rulings void,and that it had the authority to both impose monetary sanctions under code of civil procedure section and enjoin spencer.the court enjoined spencer from communicating with class members other than those who had retained him before the date of the preliminary approval of the class settlement,ordered the parties to prepare corrective notice to be sent to all class members,authorized the parties to establish a procedure to review decisions by class members to opt out of the class settlement to determine if they were impacted by spencer letter,and awarded attorney fees of to class counsel and to vitamin shoppe counsel,to be later supplemented,as sanctions against spencer.the court stated in its order that spencer communications with the conditionally certified class members were improper,and that judge sutro orders were not void pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b 
hernandez and spencer referred to collectively as hernandez herein subsequently filed a timely notice of appeal from this order.
issues raised on appeal 
hernandez argues that the trial court erred in numerous ways when it formalized judge sutro rulings and orders.
judge sutro orders were not void 
first,hernandez argues that the trial court erred when it formalized judge sutro orders and rulings because they were null and void as a result of his subsequent disqualification.this is incorrect.
code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,provides that a judge shall be disqualified if,for any reason,iii a person aware of the facts might reasonably entertain a doubt that the judge would be able to be impartial.section,subdivision b,provides that a judge shall be disqualified if b bias or prejudice toward a lawyer in the proceeding may be grounds for disqualification.generally,a judge disqualification occurs as of when the disqualifying facts arise.christie city of el centro th,d finding that the disqualification occurred at the time a judge discussed a case with a previously disqualified judge.
hernandez argues that judge sutro july orders,as subsequently formalized by the trial court,are void because judge sutro made them at the end of the july hearing,after he made the comments that judge garibaldi subsequently cited in his disqualification order.this argument lacks merit for two reasons.
first,judge garibaldi did not disqualify judge sutro based on a finding of actual bias.instead,judge garibaldi found judge sutro had the appearance of probable bias toward a lawyer,and stated that it would reasonably appear judge sutro formed such a negative opinion of spencer that he would be unable to give him fair consideration in any future hearings in this case.italics added.in other words,judge garibaldi did not find actual bias,or that judge sutro was disqualified at any time before his july hearing rulings.rather,judge garibaldi finding related only to judge sutro appearance of bias,and was expressly prospective in nature.
second,to the extent spencer argues that the facts giving rise to judge sutro disqualification occurred at the time of the july hearing,we agree with respondents that the analysis employed in people williams th,d williams,applies here.in williams,the appellate court held that a judge order,issued at a hearing denying a motion to suppress evidence,was valid pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,even though the judge made statements at the same hearing that subsequently led to his prospective disqualification in the case for the appearance of bias against defendant.williams,at,d.the appellate court relied on the fact that the judge had not given the appearance of any bias against defendant prior to the hearing,and that the disqualification order referred to further proceedings rather than past proceedings.id.at,d.
hernandez argues that the cases are distinguishable because judge sutro made his comments just before announcing his ruling at the hearing,while the judge in williams made his comments just afterwards.this is a distinction without meaning.both judges were disqualified prospectively because of the appearance of bias created by their remarks,and not because of a finding of actual bias existing at the time the judges made their substantive rulings.in short,hernandez null and void argument lacks merit.
judge duryee conducted an independent review 
even if judge sutro orders were null and void,we see no reason why judge duryee subsequent order would not stand on its own.it was based on independent review and determinations regarding spencer communications,judge sutro actions,and the parties dispute,as indicated by two findings.
first,judge duryee found that judge sutro orders were not void pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b.code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,provides if grounds for disqualification are first learned of or arise after the judge has made one or more rulings in a proceeding,but before the judge has completed judicial action in a proceeding,the judge shall,unless the disqualification be waived,disqualify himself or herself,but in the absence of good cause the rulings he or she has made up to that time shall not be set aside by the judge who replaces the disqualified judge.
judge duryee express reliance on this provision indicates that she conducted an independent review of the merits of judge sutro orders,and found that there was not good cause to set them aside.
second,judge duryee found that spencer communications with the conditionally certified class members were improper.this too indicates an independent review of the merits of the dispute.
thus,the record indicates that judge duryee,despite granting a motion styled as a request that she formalize judge sutro rulings,relied upon her own consideration of the underlying merits in issuing the order.
hernandez arguments regarding the propriety of the court order 
hernandez argues on various grounds that the court order was improper on its merits.these arguments are unpersuasive,except regarding the court imposition of monetary sanctions.
a.the sanctions 
judge duryee imposed monetary sanctions against spencer pursuant to code of civil procedure section.as respondents concede,section does not provide a court with the power to impose such sanctions.sheller superior court th,d clark optical coating laboratory,th,d.therefore,we reverse this part of judge duryee order.
spencer duties under the rules of professional conduct 
hernandez argues that the trial court enjoining spencer from communicating with clients who retained him after the conditional certification of the class creates an irreconcilable conflict between compliance with that order and attorney spencer obligations under code of professional responsibility section that he communicate with his clients and keep them informed of the status of their cases.since the injunction requires attorney spencer to violate his obligations to his clients it must be reversed.we reject this argument for several reasons.
first,although respondents do not raise the issue,we do not need to address the merits of hernandez argument because hernandez does not establish necessary facts in his briefing.spencer could not have violated his professional duties unless the court enjoined him from communicating as required with clients who retained him after the conditional class certification.hernandez makes no effort to establish that anyone so retained him.indeed,hernandez opening brief contains an ambiguous contention that suggests the contrary letters were sent by spencer and only one person responded to the letter.that person is represented by attorneys spencer and wilens in a different class action and would have likely contacted them regarding the vitamin shoppe litigation regardless of the letter.the only other relevant reference in the briefing is contained in a footnote in vitamin shoppe reply brief.vitamin shoppe states that c ounsel admitted that his letter generated a response from one of the plaintiffs in estel,another wage and hour case that counsel filed against vitamin shoppe after judge sutro ordered counsel to refrain from contacting members of the perry class.vitamin shoppe cites to its own submissions to the trial court,including a statement in the declaration of its own attorney,john zaimes,that o n january,i attended a status conference in the estel case.during that hearing,counsel for hernandez,jeffrey spencer admitted for the first time,that one of the individual plaintiffs in the estel case had initiated contact with him after,and as a result of,receiving the improper letter that he sent.it is not clear from zaimes statement whether this individual had previously retained spencer,or whether spencer had any duty to keep this client informed of the status of any case thus,hernandez never establishes that the court injunction actually prevented spencer from communicating with anyone who retained him after the conditional certification.
we have the discretion to disregard issues not properly addressed in the briefs,and may treat them as having been abandoned or waived.see,people stanley cal th,d.it is the duty of a party to support the arguments in its briefs by appropriate reference to the record,which includes providing exact page citations.citation.because t here is no duty on this court to search the record for evidence citation,an appellate court may disregard any factual contention not supported by a proper citation to the record citation.covenant care,th,d see also nwosu uba th,d noting that the california rules of court require factual assertions to be supported by citations to the record.accordingly,we conclude hernandez has waived his breach of duty argument by failing to establish that the court injunction actually caused spencer to breach a duty to communicate with anyone who retained him after the conditional class certification.
even if we were to consider spencer argument on its merits,it is unpersuasive.to the extent the record ambiguously suggests that spencer may have been retained by a perry class member who first contacted him after he sent his letters,whom spencer subsequently may have represented in the estel case,we fail to see how spencer was entitled to maintain such a representation,given that he obtained it as a direct result of his violation of model rules of professional conduct,rule rule.as for any duty he had to inform such a person about the status of a case such as estel,the court corrective notice put that person on notice that spencer was unable to do so as long as he or she remained a class member in perry.furthermore,hernandez does not establish that any perry class member could pursue another lawsuit regarding the same subject matter upon the final approval of the perry settlement.in any event,nothing prevented a person desiring spencer representation from opting out of the perry class.for that matter,nothing prevented spencer from seeking permission from the trial court to communicate further with any client in order to end the representation.
we conclude that spencer has waived,and has failed to establish the merits of his argument that he had a purported duty to keep a client or clients informed of legal matters,but was prevented from doing so by the trial court order.
abuse of discretion 
hernandez also argues that the trial court abused its discretion by enjoining spencer as it did.this argument lacks merit.
as we have already discussed,hernandez has waived,and failed to establish,that the court improperly barred spencer from communicating with any client who retained him after conditional class certification.
regarding the court enjoining spencer from communicating with other class members,all courts possess inherent supervisory or administrative powers to enable them to carry out their duties,albeit subject to certain limitations.bauguess paine cal d,superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in olmstead arthur gallagher cal th,d.in a class action,a trial court has the authority and the duty to protect the rights of all parties,and to prevent abuses which might undermine the proper administration of justice.howard gunty profit sharing plan superior court th,d.where a trial court identifies a potential for abuse,the court has both the duty and the broad authority to exercise control over a class action and to enter appropriate orders governing the conduct of counsel and parties.id.at,d.
the court duty to protect the rights of all parties is particularly pronounced once a class has been certified and notified of a potential class settlement because class members must decide whether or not to opt out.gainey occidental land research d.gainey.the notice is a matter of extreme importance,committed to the discretion of the court,not the whim of litigants.id.at.the court must assure that the notice be neutral and objective in tone,neither promoting nor discouraging the assertion of claims.citation.it is essential that the class members decision to participate or to withdraw be made on the basis of independent analysis of its own.it is the responsibility of the court as a neutral arbiter,and of the attorneys in their adversary capacity,to insure this type of free and unfettered decision.the mechanism selected for accomplishing this is the class notice,which is designed to present the relevant facts in an unbiased format.id.at.thus,once a notice is approved,a party can not send out its own competing and argumentative notice and invitation to the class members to opt out.citation.such conduct defeats the whole point of the court holding a hearing to approve the notice to the class.id.at.it amounts to an end run around the court supervisory powers.ibid.
spencer sent his letters unilaterally,without court approval,after the court had reviewed the proposed settlement,counsel arguments,preliminarily approved the settlement,and ordered the claims administrator to send notice to the class.hernandez contends that the contents of spencer letters were not misleading.we disagree.he flatly declared to class members that,if the settlement were approved,substantial compensation will be forfeited,and that you will not be able to recover compensation for all the rest and meal periods you were denied or for all of the overtime compensation or penalties you are owed.he further declared that class members who did not protect themselves by opting out and joining the thompson action would be stuck with the settlement terms,and presented himself as an available advisor and counsel to be retained.in other words,spencer stated a wholly biased view of the settlement in inflammatory language in order to persuade class members to opt out of the perry class action and join thompson.his communications misled members about the substance of the settlement by what he did and did not state,encouraging them to think that they were doing nothing less than forfeiting substantial compensation if they remained in the class,ignoring the numerous risks and uncertainties of litigation,remaining silent about defendant arguments,leaving unsaid that the court had reviewed and preliminarily approved the settlement,and would again review the matter before giving final approval,and prejudicing class members view of the settlement before they received the notice.rather than disclose his financial interest in their joining thompson,he characterized himself,rather than the court,as the protector of the class.it is difficult to imagine a more inappropriate end run around the court supervisory powers.gainey,supra,d at.
hernandez argues that the court remedy for any harm done by spencer letter had to be limited to correct any potential harm it caused.since the letter only went to approximately stores and a handful of class members,the remedy should have been limited to sending a corrective notice to those stores and recipients of the letter.further,any injunctions could not have exceeded a prohibition against sending like communications in the future.the trial court did not articulate any imminent or continuing harm that would occur 
these arguments are unpersuasive.they ignore that the class members were,or had been,employed by the same company,making it possible that spencer letters would be discussed among class members beyond those who actually received them.furthermore,the biased,inflammatory,and misleading content of spencer letters made plain the possibility that he would engage in future abuses if he were permitted to continue to unilaterally communicate with class members.we also disagree with hernandez contention that the trial court did not articulate any imminent or continuing harm.judge duryee confirmed the merits of judge sutro rulings,which judge sutro made after indicating spencer had improperly interfered with a conditionally certified class represented by class counsel,in violation of rules of professional conduct,after the court had approved a notice procedure.furthermore,judge duryee stated that spencer communications with the conditionally certified class members were improper,further indicating agreement with judge sutro conclusions.these findings indicate an imminent and continuing harm with the exclusion process and the relationships approved by the court.in short,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in issuing its orders.
free speech 
hernandez also argues that the trial court,by enjoining spencer from engaging in communications regarding any topic with clients who retained him after the conditional class certification and with other class members,ordered a prior restraint on his speech and,therefore,was unconstitutional under the federal and state constitutions.this argument also lacks merit.
as we have already discussed,hernandez has waived any argument about clients who retained him after conditional class certification by his failure to establish that he was so retained.
regarding spencer communications with perry class members,spencer fails to establish that his constitutional free speech rights entitled him to interfere with the trial court duty and authority to supervise the exclusion process after conditionally certifying the class,or to contact class members for whom the court had appointed class counsel.
conditional class certification 
the trial court applied the stringent certification requirements applicable to all class actions.citing class action case law the court found that t he moving parties have shown the existence of ascertaining classes,and community of interest in the questions of law and fact among the represented parties.the court unquestionably had the authority to conditionally certify a class for settlement purposes.wershba apple computer,th,d wershba.
hernandez nonetheless argues this certification did not authorize the court to regulate spencer communications as it did.hernandez argument relies heavily on case law involving circumstances,such as parris superior court th,d referring to communications prior to class certification and gulf oil bernard,d referring to communications with potential class members.however,as respondents point out,the trial court duties and authority after class certification include acting to protect the class from the kind of biased,unilateral communications sent by spencer.
for example,in gainey,supra,d,the trial court had found the action to be a proper class action and approved plaintiff draft of a notice to class members,which gave members the chance to opt out by notifying the trial court.id.at.during the period,defendant unilaterally sent its own notice to class members presenting its defense,emphasizing possible disadvantages to members who did not request exclusion,and enclosing a form which members could use to opt out of the class.id.at.by the time plaintiff moved for relief,class members opted out using defendant form.id.at,fn.the trial court denied plaintiff request that those class members who returned defendant exclusion form be returned to the class,and that a corrective notice be sent giving them a new period to determine whether or not to opt out.id.at.
the appellate court reversed the trial court denial.it held that t he notice is a matter of extreme importance,committed to the discretion of the court,not the whim of the litigants.gainey,supr
