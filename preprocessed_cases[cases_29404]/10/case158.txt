background 
plaintiffs worked as unpaid interns either on the fox film black swan or at the fox corporate offices in new york city.they contend that the defendants,fox searchlight and fox entertainment group,violated the fair labor standards act flsa,and new york labor,labor law,by failing to pay them as employees during their internships as required by the flsa and nyll minimum wage and overtime provisions.the following background facts are undisputed except where noted.
eric glatt 
eric glatt graduated with a degree in multimedia instructional design from new york university.glatt was enrolled in a graduate program at nyu school of education when he started working on black swan.his graduate program did not offer him credit for his internship.
from december,through the end of february,glatt interned in black swan accounting department under the supervision of production accountant theodore au.he worked from approximately to five days a week.as an accounting intern,glatt responsibilities included copying,scanning,and filing documents tracking purchase orders transporting paperwork and items to and from the black swan set maintaining employee personnel files and answering questions about the accounting department.
glatt interned a second time in black swan department from march to august,under the supervision of post production supervisor jeff robinson.glatt worked two days a week from approximately until or his responsibilities included drafting cover letters for mailings organizing filing cabinets filing paperwork making photocopies keeping the menus and organized bringing documents to the payroll company and running errands,one of which required him to purchase a pillow for director darren aronofsky.
alexander footman 
alexander footman graduated from wesleyan university with a degree in film studies.he was not enrolled in a degree program at the time of his black swan internship.from september,through late february or early march,footman interned in the production department under the supervision of production office coordinator lindsay feldman and assistant production office coordinator jodi arneson.footman worked approximately days.at first,footman worked five days a week,but,beginning in november,he worked only three days a week.after this schedule change,black swan replaced footman with another unpaid intern in the production department.
footman responsibilities included picking up and setting up office furniture arranging lodging for cast and crew taking out the trash taking lunch orders answering phone calls watermarking scripts drafting daily call sheets photocopying making coffee making deliveries to and from the film production set,rental houses,and the payroll office accepting deliveries admitting guests to the office compiling lists of local vendors breaking down,removing,and selling office furniture and supplies at the end of production internet research sending invitations to the wrap party and other similar tasks and errands,including bringing tea to aronofsky and dropping off a dvd of black swan footage at aronofsky apartment.
eden antalik 
eden antalik worked as an unpaid publicity intern in fox searchlight corporate office in new york from the beginning of may until the second week of august.during her internship,antalik was enrolled in a degree program at duquesne university that required her to have an internship in order to graduate.antalik was supposed to receive credit for her internship at fox searchlight,but,for reasons that are unclear from the record,she never actually received the credit.
antalik began work each morning around by assembling a brief,referred to as the breaks,summarizing mentions of various fox searchlight films in the media.she also made travel arrangements,organized catering,shipped documents,and set up rooms for press events.
prior proceedings 
on october,plaintiffs filed their first amended class complaint seeking unpaid minimum wages and overtime for themselves and all others similarly situated.thereafter,glatt and footman abandoned their class claims and proceeded as individuals.after discovery,glatt and footman moved for partial summary judgment,contending that they were employees under the flsa and nyll.the defendants for summary judgment claiming that glatt and footman were not employees under either statute.at about the same time,antalik moved to certify a class of new york state interns working at certain fox divisions and a nationwide flsa collective of interns working at those same divisions.
on june,the district court concluded that glatt and footman had been improperly classified as unpaid interns rather than employees and granted their partial motion for summary judgment.the district court also granted antalik motions to certify the class of new york interns and to conditionally certify the nationwide flsa collective.
on september,the district court,acting on defendants motion,certified its order for immediate appeal under b.on november,we granted defendants petition for leave to file an interlocutory appeal from the district court orders.for the reasons that follow,we vacate the district court orders and remand.
discussion 
at its core,this interlocutory appeal raises the broad question of under what circumstances an unpaid intern must be deemed an employee under the flsa and therefore compensated for his work.that broad question underlies our answers to the three specific questions on appeal.first,did the district court apply the correct standard in evaluating whether glatt and footman were employees,and,if so,did it reach the correct result second,did the district court err by certifying antalik class of new york interns third,did the district court err by conditionally certifying antalik nationwide collective 
glatt and footman employment status 
we review the district court order granting partial summary judgment to glatt and footman de novo.see velez sanchez,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.at.
with certain exceptions not relevant here,the flsa requires employers to pay all employees a specified minimum wage,and overtime of time and for hours worked in excess of forty hours per week.nyll requires the same,except that it specifies a higher wage rate than the federal minimum.see labor law.an employee can not waive his right to the minimum wage and overtime pay because waiver would nullify the purposes of the flsa and thwart the legislative policies it was designed to effectuate.barrentine arkansas best freight,internal quotation marks omitted see also tony susan alamo found.sec y of labor,exceptions to coverage under the flsa affect more people than those workers directly at issue because exceptions are likely to exert a general downward pressure on wages in competing businesses.
the strictures of both the flsa and nyll apply only to employees.the flsa unhelpfully defines employee as an individual employed by an employer.e.employ is defined as to suffer or permit to work.id.g.new york likewise defines employee as any individual employed,suffered or permitted to work by an employer.a.because the statutes define employee in nearly identical terms,we construe the nyll definition as the same in substance as the definition in the flsa.see zheng liberty apparel,cir.
the supreme court has yet to address the difference between unpaid interns and paid employees under the flsa.in,however,the court recognized that unpaid railroad brakemen trainees should not be treated as employees,and thus that they were beyond the reach of the flsa minimum wage provision.see walling portland terminal.the court adduced several facts.first,the at issue did not displace any regular employees,and their work did not expedite the employer business.id.at.second,the did not expect to receive any compensation and would not necessarily be hired upon successful completion of the course.see id.at.third,the training course was similar to one offered by a vocational school.id.at.finally,the employer received no immediate advantage from the work done by the trainees.id.at.
in,the department of labor dol issued informal guidance on trainees as part of its field operations handbook.the guidance enumerated six criteria and stated that the trainee is not an employee only if all of the criteria were met.see dol,wage hour,field operations handbook,ch,available at.in,the dol published similar guidance for unpaid interns working in the private sector.this intern fact sheet provides that an employment relationship does not exist if all of the following factors apply 
the internship,even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer,is similar to training which would be given in an educational environment 
the internship experience is for the benefit of the intern 
the intern does not displace regular employees,but works under close supervision of existing staff 
the employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded 
the intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the internship and 
the employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the internship.
dol,wage hour,fact sheet,internship programs under the fair labor standards act april,available at http.
the district court evaluated glatt and footman employment using a version of the dol test.however,the district court,unlike the dol,did not explicitly require that all six factors be present to establish that the intern is not an employee and instead balanced the factors.the district court found that the first four factors weighed in favor of finding that glatt and footman were employees and the last two factors favored finding them to be trainees.as a result,the district court concluded that glatt and footman had been improperly classified as unpaid interns and granted their motion for partial summary judgment.
the specific issue we face when is an unpaid intern entitled to compensation as an employee under the flsa is a matter of first impression in this circuit.when properly designed,unpaid internship programs can greatly benefit interns.for this reason,internships are widely supported by educators and by employers looking to hire recent graduates however,employers can also exploit unpaid interns by using their free labor without providing them with an appreciable benefit in education or experience.recognizing this concern,all parties agree that there are circumstances in which someone who is labeled an unpaid intern is actually an employee entitled to compensation under the flsa.all parties also agree that there are circumstances in which unpaid interns are not employees under the flsa.they do not agree on what those circumstances are or what standard we should use to identify them.
the plaintiffs urge us to adopt a test whereby interns will be considered employees whenever the employer receives an immediate advantage from the interns work.plaintiffs argue that focusing on any immediate advantage that accrues to the employer is appropriate because,in their view,the supreme court in portland terminal rested its holding on the finding that the brakemen trainees provided no immediate advantage to the employer.
the defendants urge us to adopt a more nuanced primary beneficiary test.under this standard,an employment relationship is created when the tangible and intangible benefits provided to the intern are greater than the intern contribution to the employer operation.they argue that the primary beneficiary test best reflects the economic realities of the relationship between intern and employer.they further contend that a primary beneficiary test that considers the totality of the circumstances is in accordance with how we decide whether individuals are employees in other circumstances.
dol,appearing as amicus curiae in support of the plaintiffs,defends the six factors enumerated in its intern fact sheet and its requirement that every factor be present before the employer can escape its obligation to pay the worker.dol argues that its views on employee status are entitled to deference because it is the agency charged with administering the flsa and that we should use the six factors because they come directly from portland terminal.
we decline dol invitation to defer to the test laid out in the intern fact sheet.as dol makes clear in its brief,its test is essentially a distillation of the facts discussed in portland terminal.dol br.at.unlike an agency interpretation of ambiguous statutory terms or its own regulations,an agency has no special competence or role in interpreting a judicial decision.state of shalala,cir.and as dol concedes,dol br.at,this interpretation is entitled,at most,to skidmore deference to the extent we find it persuasive.see skidmore swift,the weight given to the administrator judgment depends on all those factors which give it power to persuade.because the dol test attempts to fit portland terminal particular facts to all workplaces,and because the test is too rigid for our precedent to withstand,see,velez,at,we do not find it persuasive,and we will not defer to it.
instead,we agree with defendants that the proper question is whether the intern or the employer is the primary beneficiary of the relationship.the primary beneficiary test has two salient features.first,it focuses on what the intern receives in exchange for his work.see portland terminal,at focusing on the trainee interests.second,it also accords courts the flexibility to examine the economic reality as it exists between the intern and the employer.see barfield health hosps,cir employment for flsa purposes is a flexible concept to be determined on a basis by review of the totality of the circumstances.
although the flexibility of the primary beneficiary test is primarily a virtue,this virtue is not unalloyed.the defendants conception of the primary beneficiary test requires courts to weigh a diverse set of benefits to the intern against an equally diverse set of benefits received by the employer without specifying the relevance of particular facts.brown dep t of,cir while our ultimate determination of employment status is based on the totality of circumstances,our discussion necessarily focuses on discrete facts relevant to particular statutory and regulatory criteria.internal citation omitted.
in somewhat analogous contexts,we have articulated a set of factors to aid courts in determining whether a worker is an employee for purposes of the flsa.see,velez,f d at domestic workers brock superior care,cir independent contractors.in the context of unpaid internships we think a set of considerations should include 
the extent to which the intern and the employer clearly understand that there is no expectation of compensation.any promise of compensation,express or implied,suggests that the intern is an employee and vice versa.
the extent to which the internship provides training that would be similar to that which would be given in an educational environment,including the clinical and other training provided by educational institutions.
the extent to which the internship is tied to the intern formal education
