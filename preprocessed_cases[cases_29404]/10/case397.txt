opinion of the court 
introduction 
shah rahman,now the appellant,brought this federal securities class action on march,against defendant kid brands,a new jersey corporation,and against the individual defendants,bruce crain,guy paglinco,and raphael benaroya,officers of kid brands collectively with kid brands appellees.kid brands is in the business of importing inexpensive infant furniture and products for the purpose of ultimate resale to consumers.the complaint alleged that defendants,now appellees,violated section b of the securities exchange act the exchange act and sec rule and and section a of the exchange act.in particular,the complaint alleged that defendants misled investors by artificially inflating kid brands stock price by issuing deceptive public financial reports and press releases dealing with kid brands compliance with customs laws and overall financial performance.the putative class included rahman and all others similarly situated who purchased or obtained kid brands common stock between march,and august,inclusive the class period.
subsequently,rahman filed a first amended complaint fac which the district court dismissed without prejudice on defendants motion,on march,in an order that permitted rahman to file an amended complaint within days.rahman kid brands,civ,wl.on may,rahman timely filed a second amended complaint sac alleging that,in addition to customs violations,defendants failed to disclose product recalls,safety violations,and illegal staffing practices affecting kid brands.nevertheless,rahman brief focuses almost exclusively on the customs violations and makes only passing reference to the other issues.on october,on defendants motion the district court dismissed the sac with prejudice because it did not satisfy the heightened scienter pleading standard required by the private securities litigation reform act pslra,b.in its opinion the court explained that upon a holistic consideration of the relabeling allegations contained in the sac,the court finds that a reasonable person would not deem the inference of scienter at least as strong as any opposing inference.at.on november,rahman filed a timely notice of appeal.
kid brands operates through four wholly owned subsidiaries kids line,llc,sassy,lajobi,and cocalo,kid brands primarily imports the inexpensive furniture in which it deals from china for ultimate resale to the public.kid brands is a substantial business as its net sales in were.under laws,kid brands is subject to duties that the united states imposes beyond those ordinarily assessed to discourage the importation of some products at very low cost.during the class period,crain was the president and chief executive officer of kid brands and served on its board of directors,and paglinco was its vice president and chief financial officer.paglinco retained both positions after the close of the class period.in september,after the close of the class period,benaroya,previously an outside director,was appointed interim chief executive officer.
the sac alleges that kid brands obscured the origin of its products to reduce import duties and increase profits,and then made misleading statements regarding its financial health.rahman supported the sac with statements from six confidential witnesses who had been employees of kid brands or its subsidiaries rahman believes that the statements support his contention that defendants engaged in repeated violations of customs laws.he described the witnesses in the sac as follows 
a former lajobi employee who worked in the outbound shipping department from march march and dealt with the products entering and exiting the distribution center.
a former lajobi employee who worked in the recovering and shipping department from june january and dealt with inbound and outbound shipments of products.
a former lajobi distribution manager who worked for the company from may november.oversaw safety and security at a cranbury,new jersey,warehouse and dealt with the packing slips.
a former kid brands employee who worked in the internal auditing department as a sarbanes oxley consultant from march august and reviewed the internal financial information for kid brands and its subsidiaries.
a former lajobi sales and forecast demand manager who worked at the company from march april.had personal knowledge and familiarity with the subsidiary operations,database and inventory tools.
a former kids line employee who worked in packaging design from june march and whose statements relate to his discharge from that employment.
the immediate event that led to this litigation occurred in december,when customs and border protection informed kid brands that it was conducting a focused assessment of its import practices and procedures.following this notification,kid brands board of directors initiated an investigation of kid brands practices and,for that purpose,hired the outside law firm of skadden,arps,slate,meagher flom.kid brands,however,did not publicly disclose that it was subject to the focused assessment or that it had hired the law firm until after it received a report from the firm.eventually on march,kid brands revealed that lajobi had violated united states law by misidentifying the manufacturer and shipper of certain products,that it had discharged two lajobi employees,and that it anticipated needing to pay million in fines and charges to resolve issues largely arising from the focused assessment.as might be expected,this information had a negative impact on kid brands stock price.thus,at the end of the day on march,kid brands stock closed at a share,a large drop from its prior day closing price of.five months later,on august,kid brands filed a federal form q for the quarter ending june,in which it indicated that cocalo and kids line also had evaded custom duties.the next day,august,kid brands issued a form k that estimated its total liabilities to be in excess of million for wrongful practices extending over a period of nearly five years.kid brands stock closed at per share on august,at the following day,and at on august.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we exercise plenary review of the district court order of dismissal pursuant to.b.in conducting that review,we accept rahman allegations in the sac as true and review the complaint in its entirety.see tellabs,makor issues rights.but in this process we recognize that,when alleging a securities fraud cause of action,a plaintiff must satisfy the heightened pleading rules codified in the pslra.institutional investors grp.avaya,cir.
iii.discussion 
the pslra established heightened pleading requirements for a plaintiff to meet in order to plead a cause of action successfully in class actions alleging securities fraud.thus,it requires that a complaint state with particularity both the facts constituting the alleged violation,and the facts evidencing scienter,the defendant intention to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.tellabs,at.at.to satisfy the latter requirement,a plaintiff must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.id.at.at emphasis added quoting b.in tellabs,in holding that the investors bringing a securities fraud class action had failed to meet that standard,the supreme court explained t o qualify as strong within the intendment of b an inference of scienter must be more than merely plausible or must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.id.at.at.
pursuant to its authority under section b of the exchange act,the sec issued rule,which renders it unlawful for any person 
a to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,
b to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made not misleading,or 
c to engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
the supreme court long has construed the rule to provide a basis for individuals to bring private securities fraud actions on behalf of putative classes.tellabs,at.at.to state a rule b claim,plaintiffs must allege defendants made a misstatement or an omission of material fact with scienter in connection with the purchase or the sale of a security upon which plaintiffs reasonably relied and plaintifff s reliance was the proximate cause of their injury.avaya,at quoting winer family trust queen,cir.under the pslra heightened pleading standard,a private securities complaint involving an allegedly false or misleading statement must specify each statement alleged to have been misleading and the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,b,and state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind,b.tellabs,at.at.the required state of mind is scienter,which the supreme court has defined as a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.tellabs,at.at quoting ernst ernst hochfelder.
the district court found that some,but not all,of defendants statements satisfied the first,materiality prong of the pslra heightened pleading requirements.an allegation of materiality is crucial because t he first requirement under the pslra obliges a plaintiff to specify each allegedly misleading statement,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation is made on information and belief,all facts supporting that belief with particularity.avaya,at citations omitted an allegation that a defendant uttered an immaterial statement will not satisfy the requirement that the complaint include a false or misleading statement.
in considering the sac,the district court indicated that it did not believe that a jury could find fault with kid brands delay in the disclosure of the information regarding lajobi misidentification of the manufacturer and shipper of its products until march.the court reached this conclusion taking into account d efendants efforts to investigate the matter through an independent law firm and the practical considerations regarding the timing of the disclosures.at.on the other hand,the court held that the delayed august disclosure regarding the other subsidiaries violations was sufficiently misleading and as such could be found material by a jury.id.
though we are inclined to agree with the district court latter but not former conclusion,we do not make a definitive holding on the point as we have no need to do so.we think that rahman makes a strong argument when he contends that a jury reasonably could have found fault under rule with kid brands failure to disclose the focused assessment and the resultant internal investigation prior to march,inasmuch as this information was available to kid brands before that date and surely was negative.of course,we recognize that in explaining its conclusion the district court referenced kid brands practical considerations for delaying the announcement.yet the court did not detail these considerations beyond indicating the need for kid brands to investigate the matter to give out accurate information.id arguably kid brands should have released information with respect to the focused assessment and internal investigation on a tentative basis before march.
but our possible partial disagreement with the district court ultimately does not matter because we agree with it that rahman failed to plead scienter with sufficient particularity.we explained in avaya that under the pslra e xacting pleading standard for scienter,any private securities complaint alleging that the defendant made a false or misleading statement must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.at quoting tellabs,at,s.at,internal quotation marks omitted.rahman relied on the evidence from the confidential witnesses that we have described to plead scienter in the sac in california public employees retirement system chubb,cir,which we decided prior to tellabs,we adopted the following standard dealing with such evidence from novak kasaks,cir 
w here plaintiffs rely on confidential personal sources but also on other facts,they need not name their sources as long as the latter facts provide an adequate basis for believing that the defendants statements were false.moreover,even if personal sources must be identified,there is no requirement that they be named,provided they are described in the complaint with sufficient particularity to support the probability that a person in the position occupied by the source would possess the information alleged.
we have continued to apply this standard even after the supreme court decision in tellabs.in avaya,we explained that when dealing with confidential witnesses,courts should assess the detail provided by the confidential sources,the sources basis of knowledge,the reliability of the sources,the corroborative nature of other facts alleged,including from other sources,the coherence and plausibility of the allegations,and similar indicia.avaya,at quoting chubb,at.if,after that assessment,anonymous source allegations are found wanting with respect to these criteria courts must discount them steeply.id.at.we explained in avaya that such a discount is consistent with tellabs teaching that omissions and ambiguities count against inferring scienter under the pslra particularity requirements,but if a complaint confidential witness allegations are adequately particularized,we will not dismiss them simply on account of their anonymity.id.footnote omitted internal quotation marks omitted.we concur with the district court conclusion that such discounting is necessary in this case.
regarding the customs duty violations,stated that he was in charge of furniture from china with stickers containing a different country of origin,and confirmed his account.according to both witnesses,director of operations myles mcgrath demonstrated how to apply the new labels,and another manager referred to only as brenda provided the labels according to,this practice was a normal process the whole time he was there,and the kid brands ceo and cfo toured lajobi and met with the management team bimonthly.at sac.alleged that lajobi management conferred with the kid brands leadership in mcgrath office about the protocol for altering the country of origin labels,and that brenda moved the labels from her office into mcgrath office for the meetings.but the problem with allegations is that did not begin working for lajobi until june,so can not have personal knowledge regarding the violations moreover,as far as we can ascertain,neither nor had any way of knowing what was discussed in those meetings between the lajobi and kid brands leadership.furthermore,the witnesses do not provide any dates for the meetings,explain how they would know that the labels were moved from one office to another,or claim to have attended any of the meetings or even entered any of the management offices.
offers general information regarding meetings between the kid brands and lajobi leadership including the kid brands ceo.yet the fact that a ceo visited a subsidiary premises to meet with its president will not establish that the ceo had knowledge of illegal activities at the subsidiary.after all,it would be expected that the ceo would visit his company subsidiaries in the course of conducting legitimate business.provides even more abstract commentary,suggesting that he and his coworkers in the lajobi distribution center ha d a feeling something suspicious was going on.at sac,the only confidential witness from kids line,was enmeshed in an employment dispute that had no bearing on the customs violations in question.of all the confidential witnesses,the statements of were the most plausible and he was in a position to have what was potentially the most damaging information.yet even,who allegedly spent more than five years reviewing kid brands internal financial information,offers little more than generalized allegations with few specifics and even less concrete support.
it also is significant that rahman did not demonstrate that the individual defendants had a motive for
