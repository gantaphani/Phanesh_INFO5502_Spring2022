these appeals raise an issue of first impression involving california credit reporting investigative consumer reporting agencies act icraa,et and the consumer credit reporting agencies act ccraa et and a novel class action issue.
first,plaintiff rae ortiz appeals from a summary judgment entered in favor of defendant lyon management group.plaintiff alleges defendant violated the icraa when it obtained a tenant screening report to assess her rental application the icraa governs investigative consumer reports containing information on a consumer character,general reputation,personal characteristics,or mode of living,subd.c.plaintiff contends her tenant screening report contained character information because it indicated whether any unlawful detainer actions had been filed against her.
we hold the icraa is unconstitutionally vague as applied to tenant screening reports containing unlawful detainer information.reasonable persons can not readily determine whether unlawful detainer information constitutes character information governed by the icraa or creditworthiness information governed by the ccraa.the court correctly granted summary judgment to defendant.
second,defendant appeals from an order denying its motion for class certification.defendant filed this motion after the court had already granted its summary judgment motion.
we hold defendant could not obtain class certification after the court decided the merits of plaintiff individual claim.as a general procedural rule,class certification should be determined before the merits are adjudicated.and as a general substantive rule,a precertification decision on the merits against a named plaintiff does not bind absent class members.the court did not abuse its discretion by holding defendant to these general rules.we affirm.
plaintiff applied to rent an apartment managed by defendant.plaintiff gave written consent to defendant to obtain a tenant screening report,including an unlawful detainer eviction search.defendant obtained plaintiff tenant screening report.the report contained a section entitled,court records on file,which simply stated,no court records found.the parties agree this section would have disclosed whether any unlawful detainer actions had been filed against plaintiff.they further agree the section correctly indicated no such actions had been filed.defendant approved plaintiff application,and she moved into one of defendant apartments.
nonetheless,plaintiff sued defendant for violating the icraa.she alleged defendant failed to give her a written notice and a report requesting form,as required by the icraa but not the ccraa,subds.a,b.she sought relief individually and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons.under icraa,the statutory violation would carry with it a minimum statutory damage award in her individual action of,subd.a.
defendant moved for summary judgment,which the court granted.it found the tenant screening report contained no character information subject to the icraa.it noted the court records entry was blank,containing no unlawful detainer or character information at all.even if it did,the court observed unlawful detainer information would not prove plaintiff had a bad character.the court also held plaintiff broad reading of the icraa would render it unconstitutionally vague and inconsistent with federal law.the court did not,however,immediately enter judgment.
almost two months later,defendant moved for class certification.the court denied the motion,holding defendant waived any right to class certification by seeking summary judgment on plaintiff individual claims.the court entered judgment,and both parties appealed.
discussion 
the icraa is unconstitutionally vague as applied to unlawful detainer information 
plaintiff appeal presents us with a platypus,a categorization challenge early zoologists categorized animals into distinct families with little effort until faced with an animal that laid eggs like a reptile but nursed its young like a mammal.the platypus defied the previously discrete categories.it was thought to be hoax,or at least a paradox.the zoologists solved this paradox by creating a new category,the monotreme order of mammals,to account for the platypus and its cousin,the spiny anteater.but the paradox arose only because the zoologists had adopted purportedly distinct categories that did not actually correspond to the full variety of animal life.
our categorization challenge involves tenant screening reports.the legislature enacted two distinct statutes to regulate tenant screening reports.the icraa governs reports containing information on a consumer character,while the ccraa governs reports containing information on a consumer creditworthiness.whether an unlawful detainer action has been filed against a consumer appears to speak to both creditworthiness and character unlawful detainer information defies categorization.but we can not create a new statute to govern it.
our challenge arises not because unlawful detainer information is somehow paradoxical,but because the statutory scheme fails to set forth truly distinct categories.it presents a false dichotomy between creditworthiness and character.the icraa nebulous reference to character information,as applied to tenant screening reports containing unlawful detainer information,is unconstitutionally vague.
t he underlying concern of a vagueness challenge is the core due process requirement of adequate notice.people ex rel.gallo acuna cal th,d,gallo.a vague statute can not be upheld because w e insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited,so that he may act accordingly.cranston city of richmond cal d,cranston.a statute should be sufficiently certain so that a person may know what is prohibited thereby and what may be done without violating its provisions.lockheed aircraft superior court cal d,lockheed.a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application,violates the first essential of due process of law.connally general const.connally.
to determine whether a statute is unconstitutionally vague,it must be applied in a specific context.gallo,supra,cal th at,d.thus,in judging the constitutionality of a statute we must determine not whether it is vague in the abstract but,rather,whether it is vague as applied to this appellant conduct in light of the specific facts of this particular case.cranston,supra,cal d at.also,the challenged statute need only be reasonably certain or specific.gallo,at,d.it can not be held void for uncertainty if any reasonable and practical construction can be given to its language.lockheed,supra,cal d at.finally,a ll presumptions and intendments favor the validity of a statute ibid.
we turn to the statutes.in,the california legislature enacted two statutes modeled after the federal credit reporting act fcra et see cisneros registry,th,d noting legislative history.s tatutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible,fair employment housing com.cal d.
the first statute,the ccraa,governs consumer credit reports.et it defines a consumer credit report as any written,oral,or other communication of any information by a consumer credit reporting agency bearing on a consumer credit worthiness,credit standing,or credit capacity,when that information is collected or used to establish the consumer eligibility for personal credit,employment,rental housing,or other specified purposes,subd.c.as shorthand,we will refer to the type of information governed by the ccraa as creditworthiness information.
the second statute,the icraa,governs investigative consumer reports.et it defines an investigative consumer report as a consumer report in which information on a consumer character,general reputation,personal characteristics,or mode of living is obtained through any means,subd.c.we will refer to the type of information governed by the icraa as character information.
the ccraa and icraa impose different obligations on persons compiling or requesting tenant screening reports,depending on whether the information therein pertains to creditworthiness or character the icraa imposes stricter duties and more severe penalties on persons compiling or requesting tenant screening reports containing character information than the ccraa does on those compiling or requesting tenant screening reports containing creditworthiness information consumers have different rights depending on whether their tenant screening reports contain creditworthiness or character information 
this statutory separate statutes governing two kinds of tenant screening reports depending on the type of information they a legislative intent to distinguish between creditworthiness information and character information.see,supra,cal d at,statutes must be harmonized.nothing in the statutes suggests any one item of information may constitute both creditworthiness and character information such that it alone subjects a tenant screening report to both statutes.rather,any one item of information may be classified as either creditworthiness or character information,but not both.construing the two statutes to govern discrete items of information harmonizes the statutes,rather than collapsing them into one.ibid.
while the statutes require a distinction between creditworthiness and character information,the line between the two is not readily apparent.on the one hand,a consumer creditworthiness itself pertains to the consumer character or personal characteristics.creditworthiness is a personal attribute,the quality of being financially sound enough that a lender will extend credit in the belief that the chances of default are slight fiscally healthy.black law dict.ed.creditworthiness information is a type of character information.on the other hand,certain types of character information may also constitute creditworthiness information.information that a consumer has the character traits or personal characteristics of or a general reputation for dishonesty,profligacy,carelessness,or would reasonably relate to the consumer financial soundness,likelihood of default,or fiscal health.at least these types of character information pertain to the consumer creditworthiness.
the statutory scheme itself recognizes that creditworthiness information and character information are not inherently exclusive.the two credit reporting statutes do not rely on any necessary distinction between creditworthiness and character to segregate ccraa reports from icraa reports.rather,each statute expressly excludes from its ambit any reports containing only information covered by the other.the ccraa expressly excludes any report containing information solely on a consumer character,general reputation,personal characteristics,or mode of living which is obtained through personal interviews,subd.c.the icraa expressly excludes a consumer report that is limited to specific factual information relating to a consumer credit record or manner of obtaining credit obtained directly from a creditor of the consumer,subd.c.
we must give these express exclusions effect and significance.copley press,superior court cal th,d,accord code civ,courts must construe statutory provisions to give effect to all.t rue statutory exceptions exist only to exempt something which would otherwise be covered.syngenta crop protection,helliker th,d.each statute express exclusion of reports containing only information covered by the other shows that,absent the exclusion,the type of information covered by the other statute would also be covered by it.thus,the ccraa scope over creditworthiness information would otherwise include character information,at least if obtained through personal interviews,were it not for the express exclusion.and the icraa scope over character information would otherwise include creditworthiness information,at least if it consists of specific factual information obtained directly from creditors,were it not for the express exclusion.
in this way,the legislature recognized the inherent overlap between creditworthiness information and character information.yet it simultaneously demanded that the two types of information be distinguished when classifying tenant screening reports as subject either to the ccraa or the icraa.
this incongruity in the statutory scheme does not undermine all efforts at classification.it is still relatively simple to categorize a traditional credit report containing information on a consumer credit accounts,outstanding and available credit,and payment histories supplied by the consumer creditors.this information constitutes creditworthiness information.it may also speak to the consumer character,for the reasons discussed above.but the report is not impermissibly subject to both the ccraa and the icraa,due to the express statutory exclusions.the icraa excludes the report because it contains only specific factual information relating to the consumer credit record obtained directly from the consumer creditors,subd.c.the ccraa does not exclude the report,even though it contains character information,because the statute excludes only character information obtained through personal interviews,subd.c.thus,the traditional credit report remains subject to the ccraa,not the icraa.
until,it was almost as simple to categorize investigative consumer reports.as originally enacted,the icraa defined investigative consumer reports as containing information on a consumer character,general reputation,personal characteristics,or mode of living obtained through personal interviews former,subd.c,added by stats,ch.this language mirrors the ccraa express exclusion for character information.and it provided some restraint on the statute otherwise expansive scope.an investigative consumer report was defined not just by the type of information it contains,character information,but also by the means by which the information was obtained,through personal interviews.credit reporting agencies and credit report users could rely on both aspects to ascertain whether the information in a tenant screening report would subject it to the icraa.
the legislature removed this restraint in.it amended the icraa to eliminate the through personal interviews limitation,replacing it with the expansive phrase,through any means,subd.c,as amended by stats,ch.it may have done so in response to cisneros,supra,th,d,which exempted a report containing the observations of a consumer landlords from the icraa because the credit reporting agency obtained the observations through written questionnaires,not personal interviews.id.at,d.after the amendment,one could still look at the means by which information was obtained to determine whether the report was excluded from the ccraa.the ccraa still excludes character information obtained through personal interviews.but one could no longer look at the means by which information was obtained to determine whether it is subject to the icraa.one may look only at the type of it relates to the consumer character.
by eliminating the means by which information is obtained as a way to distinguish character information subject to the icraa,the legislature exposed an underlying uncertainty in the statute the uncertainty is revealed when one attempts to categorize information that speaks to both creditworthiness and character,but which is not obtained through personal interviews.this type of information now falls under the icraa,due to the amendment,but it is not excluded from the ccraa.the information is now subject to both statutes,though the statutory scheme disallows this.
enter the platypus.
unlawful detainer information,because of the amendment,can be categorized under both statutes.case that may have inspired the why.because cisneros relied on the icraa through personal interview limitation,it had no occasion to consider the broader question of whether unlawful detainer information constitutes character information governed by the icraa.cisneros,supra,th at,d.but cisneros did consider whether unlawful detainer information falls within the fcra,which governs reports containing information either on a consumer creditworthiness or character.d.
cisneros held unlawful detainer information was subject to the frca because it pertained to both creditworthiness and character.it relied on a federal case noting that information on a tenant incidents of late payments or nonpayment of rent relates to the tenant creditworthiness.cisneros,supra,th at,d citing cotto jenney.it also relied on federal trade commission commentary stating that r eports about rental characteristics consumers evictions,rental payment histories,treatment of premises are consumer reports because they relate to character.id.at,d citing,pt,d,g and f.
cisneros is correct that unlawful detainer information relates to the tenant creditworthiness.cisneros,supra,th at,d.the specific unlawful detainer information in this unlawful detainer actions had been filed against whether plaintiff former landlords had formally alleged a legal basis for an unlawful detainer action.code civ.a typical,perhaps the typical,basis for a residential unlawful detainer action is the late payment or nonpayment of rent.id.at subd.thus,unlawful detainer information would most commonly reveal allegations that plaintiff has not timely paid his or her rental obligations.timely payment of obligations relates to creditworthiness.
yet cisneros is also correct when it notes unlawful detainer information relate s to character.cisneros,supra,th at,d.not all unlawful detainer actions are premised on a failure to pay rent on time.an unlawful detainer action may also be premised on holding over after the lease expires,a breach of a lease covenant,the commission of waste,or the maintenance of a nuisance.code civ,subds.these acts may suggest various character traits or personal characteristics obstinacy,carelessness,untrustworthiness,or selfishness,perhaps.even if the allegations are ultimately unproven,the bare fact that a landlord made the allegations may relate to the consumer general reputation,character information.
adding to the confusion,good exist to each of cisneros observations about the nature of unlawful detainer information.renting an apartment is not truly a credit transaction.credit is t he time that a seller gives the buyer to make the payment that is due or t he availability of funds either from a financial institution or under a letter of credit.black law,supra.a landlord neither sells property on time nor makes funds available to tenants.and while the various bases for an unlawful detainer action may tend to suggest certain character traits,they do not necessarily reveal the tenant character.a lease is a contract,and the law ordinarily assigns no moral blameworthiness to breaching a contract.see freeman mills,belcher oil cal th,d,conc.dis.opn.of mosk,t he intentional breach of contract has come to be viewed as a morally neutral act.
we are left with no rational basis to determine whether unlawful detainer information constitutes creditworthiness information subject to the ccraa or character information subject to the icraa.we doubt any person of ordinary intelligence can do so either.cranston,supra,cal d at.rather,credit reporting agencies and landlords must necessarily guess at the icraa meaning and differ as to its application.connally,supra,at.worse,landlords must make their guesses when they request tenant screening reports,before they learn whether the report will contain any unlawful detainer information or exactly what kind of unlawful detainer information it will include.see listing conditions that must be met before procuring investigative consumer reports.
the icraa thus fails to provide adequate notice to persons who compile or request tenant screening reports that may contain unlawful detainer information.gallo,supra,cal th at,d,noting the core due process requirement of adequate notice lockheed,supra,cal d at,a statute should be sufficiently certain so that a person may know what is prohibited thereby and what may be done without violating its provisions.the amendment rendered the icraa unconstitutional as applied to tenant screening reports containing unlawful detainer information.accordingly,the court correctly granted summary judgment to defendant 
the court correctly denied class certification because defendant had already obtained adjudication of the merits of plaintiff individual claim 
defendant appeal raises another issue may a defendant obtain certification of a plaintiff class after it has obtained a favorable ruling on the merits of the named plaintiff individual claim the parties cite no case in which a defendant has even tried this tactic.lacking direct guidance,we turn to the general rule governing the timing of class certification and apply it to this unprecedented context.
defendant concedes its tactic appears to conflict with the general home savings rule requiring courts to determine class certification before adjudicating the merits.home sav.loan superior court d.home savings i court must determine certification before trial home sav.loan superior court d.home savings ii court must determine certification before dispositive motion.we agree the tactic does conflict with the home savings rule,for both a procedural and a substantive reason.first,the procedural reason.
postmerits class certification requires a showing of changed circumstances and a compelling justification 
home savings i reversed an order granting the plaintiff motion to try the defendant liability before the court would decide whether the plaintiff could obtain class certification.home savings i,supra,d at.it noted,t he vice in the procedure followed by the trial court is that it allows intervention,a procedure under which potential members of the class can reserve their decision to become part of the class until the validity of the cause asserted by the named plaintiffs on behalf of the class has been determined.id.at.it noted,for a defendant intervention holds the terrors of an lawsuit that can not be defeated,can not be settled,and can not be adjudicated.to him it presents a classic option.ibid.
the california supreme court adopted the home savings rule in green obledo cal d,green,expanding it to protect plaintiffs against postmerits class decertification.it noted,although this home savings rule has thus far been applied only for the benefit of defendants,no reason appears why plaintiffs should not also enjoy its benefits id.at.thus,it required class certification be decided before the merits whether the motion to certify or decertify be made by the plaintiff or the defendant.id.at.on the other hand,it created a narrow exception to postmerits decertification where a party could show changed circumstances making continued class action treatment improper.ibid.
the california supreme court has since applied green postmerits decertification analysis to postmerits certification.fireside bank superior court cal th,d,fireside.it noted,of course,just as we recognized in green that there was no reason not to apply the general home savings rule to decertification motions,so there is no reason not to apply this limited green exception to certification motions.thus,under green,postmerits certification may be permitted when there is a clear showing of changed circumstances.fireside,at,d.
fireside sets forth a strict rubric for postmerits certification.if a party seeks and obtains a merits ruling before moving for class certification,it must demonstrate changed circumstances to justify its belated motion for class certification.citation.absent a showing of changed circumstances,the trial court may not consider the motion absent a further finding of a compelling justification,it may not grant it.fireside,supra,cal th at,d.
this rubric provides a procedural reason to affirm the court denial of defendant class certification motion.defendant,having s ought and obtain ed a merits ruling before moving for class certification,failed to demonstrate changed circumstances to justify its belated motion for class certification.fireside,supra,cal th at,d.the record suggests no practical reason why defendant could not have moved for class certification sooner,other than to maximize its strategic advantage.
defendant nevertheless contends the home savings rule does not apply here because this is a mandatory class action posing no risk of intervention.a mandatory class action is one certified because separate,individual actions could prejudice the defendant or absent class members,or the defendant alleged misconduct applied generally to the class,making classwide injunctive relief appropriate.fed.rules civ,rule b,b,see also conte newberg,newberg on class actions ed.absent class members can not opt out of a class action certified pursuant to these subdivisions their inclusion is mandatory.conte newberg,supra.thus,class members in a mandatory class action can not adopt the wait and see approach derided as intervention.
but even if this is a mandatory class action from which absent class members can not opt out,we can not opt out of the home savings rule the california supreme court well understands intervention.a section of the fireside opinion is entitled,intervention,the first subsection of which is entitled,the rule against intervention.fireside,supra,cal th at,d.the court analyzed the issue at length and in depth.id.at,d.the court could have restricted its analysis of the home savings rule to class actions,but it did not.and the court could have limited its holding to plaintiffs seeking postmerits situation risking it instead spoke broadly of parties seeking postmerits certification if a party seeks and obtains a merits ruling before moving for class certification,it must demonstrate changed circumstances to justify its belated motion for class certification.fireside,at,d.given a choice between applying the clear,unambiguous language of the california supreme court or adopting defendant federal law based,policy driven analysis to the contrary,we choose the former.auto equity sales,superior court cal d.
defendant takes out of context fireside comment that the scope of any rule should be coextensive with its rationale,wrongly claiming it allows postmerits certification in cases posing no risk of intervention.fireside,supra,cal th at,d.by the time fireside makes this comment,it had already broadly endorsed the home savings rule and green changed circumstances exception,applying them equally to plaintiffs and defendants seeking postmerits certification.fireside,at,d.and fireside did so not just to protect against intervention,but also for reasons of judicial efficiency and logic.id.at,d.the comment arises during fireside analysis of a narrow issue is a motion for judgment on the pleadings directed to the merits,such that the court should decide class certification before deciding the motion thus,fireside considered the range of motions that implicate the rules governing intervention.id.at,d.it concluded any motion sufficiently substantive to create a risk of intervention should be decided after the class issues are decided.id.at,d.it concluded courts should decide class certification before deciding a motion for summary judgment,summary adjudication,or judgment on the pleadings,depending on the issue raised.ibid.
fireside analysis of which motions are does not trump its prior analysis and broad holding on our issue.it unambiguously held a party can not seek class certification after obtaining a concededly ruling without showing changed circumstances and a compelling justification.fireside,supra,cal th at,d.defendant,having done neither,waived any right to class certification.
finally,fireside stressed that application of the home savings rule is best left to the court discretion.it stated,given a trial court broad discretion to structure and streamline class action proceedings,the appropriate standard of review is abuse of discretion.fireside,supra,cal th at,d,accord linder thrifty oil cal th,d,courts are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification.accordingly,even if the home savings rule does not necessarily apply here as a matter of law,the court still could choose to apply it to maximize efficiency without abusing its broad discretion to structure this case.either way,we affirm 
postmerits certification would wrongly give binding effect to a judgment 
fireside also highlighted an independent,substantive reason to affirm the order denying class certification.the opinion began,a largely settled feature of state and federal procedure is that trial courts in class action proceedings should decide whether a class is proper and,if so,order class notice before ruling on the substantive merits of the action.citations.the virtue of this sequence is that it promotes judicial efficiency,by postponing merits rulings until such time as all parties may be bound,and fairness,by ensuring that parties bear equally the benefits and burdens of favorable and unfavorable merits rulings.fireside,supra,cal th at,d,emphasis added.
the reference to binding all parties harkens back to a warning given to defendants by home savings i.that case warned defendants they can not bind absent class members to a precertification adjudication.it observed,notification makes possible a binding adjudication and an enforceable judgment with respect to the rights of the members of the class.absent such notification no member of the class need be bound by the result of the litigation.home savings i,supra,d at.thus,if defendant prevails in the first cause of action involving merely individual members of the class,no other members of the class need be bound by the outcome,for they were not parties to the lawsuit and received no notification about it.ibid.
home savings ii reiterated this warning to defendants.home savings ii,supra,d at.the plaintiffs there sought summary judgment the defendant moved to stay adjudication of the motion until the court resolved class certification.id.at.the plaintiffs contended summary judgment posed no risk of intervention because the defendant could seek appellate review and stare decisis would preclude further litigation by absent class members.id.at.the court was unconvinced.adequacy of appellate review and availability of stare decisis are strong practical reasons why a litigant may desire adjudication of a motion for summary judgment in an individual action,but they can not compel a class litigant to proceed in this manner,nor do they bind absent members of the class.ibid.
home savings ii noted defendants risk only their own due process rights,not those of the class members,by seeking adjudication of a named plaintiff claims without class certification.such adjudication will bind an individual plaintiff,it may bind the defendant in similar actions on the principle of collateral estoppel,but it will not bind absent members of the class.citations.if a defendant chooses to run the risk of collateral estoppel on an unfavorable judgment,it is defendant right to due process that it hazards,not someone else.home savings ii,supra,d at.
the california supreme court quickly echoed these warnings to defendants seeking precertification adjudication in two cases,notably before it adopted the home savings rule.in people pacific land research cal d,pacific land,the court stated,failure to require notification of the class before a decision on the merits prevents a binding adjudication against the class because members of the class who were not notified are not barred by the determination in the defendant favor since they were not parties.id.at.and in civil service employees ins.superior court cal d,it stated,even though a determination of the partial summary judgment issue in defendant favor may not have been legally binding on unnotified class members,defendant assumed that risk by acquiescing to adjudication of the motion before class notification.id.at.
the california supreme court has repeated this warning twice again.fireside,supra,cal th at,d,deciding class certification first postpon es merits rulings until such time as all parties may be bound green,supra,cal d at,citing pacific land,supra,cal d at.
this consistent warning to defendants seeking precertification summary judgment must mean something.it would be meaningless to warn defendants that winning summary judgment before class certification will not bind class members,if defendants could simply move for class certification after obt
