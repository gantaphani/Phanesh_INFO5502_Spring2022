we are asked to decide whether patients who suffered no injuries but who were subject to the use of a medical device for eye surgeries may bring suit solely because the food and drug administration fda status of the device was not disclosed to them.the third amended complaint the complaint does not state a claim under the california protection of human subjects in medical experimentation act the human subjects act because the surgeries were not medical experiments subject to the protection of the act.robert perez does not have standing to sue for injunctive relief under the california consumers legal remedies act clra,and his other substantive claim is preempted by the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca.we affirm the district court dismissal of the complaint.
robert perez,nancy art,and brett harbach collectively,perez each sought and received laser in situ keratomileusis lasik eye surgery with a nidek ec excimer laser system the laser to correct farsightedness.they claim that,at the time of their surgeries,they did not know the fda had not approved the laser for this use.according to the complaint,had they known,they would not have consented to the surgeries.
perez sued on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated individuals who received hyperopic surgery surgery to correct farsightedness with the laser between february and october.perez does not allege any injury stemming from surgery.nor does perez claim that his or any other surgery was ineffective.instead,he asserts claims under the human subjects act and the clra,as well as claims of fraud by omission,civil conspiracy,and aiding and abetting.perez brought these claims against various nidek corporate entities nidek,named and unnamed physicians who allegedly used the laser for unapproved purposes on individuals in the purported class physician defendants,named and unnamed medical centers where these procedures were allegedly performed,and other unnamed persons and entities who allegedly participated in the conduct at issue.of the named physician defendants,only two performed lasik surgery on the named plaintiffs.
the laser is a class iii medical device under the fdca,as amended by the medical device amendments of mda.for that reason,nidek was required to get premarket approval pma from the fda before it could sell or distribute the laser.between and,nidek obtained three pmas for treating nearsightedness with the laser,but the laser was not approved for treating farsightedness until october.the pmas restricted the laser from being used for hyperopic corrections outside of approved investigations.during the class period,use of the laser for farsightedness was being investigated in clinical trials,which required full disclosure of the device experimental use and informed consent from patients receiving treatment.
perez alleges that the defendants engaged in a nationwide scheme to modify the approved laser to enable it to correct farsightedness before it was approved for that purpose.he claims that physician defendants used the modified lasers to perform hyperopic surgeries without informing patients that the laser was not approved for that use outside of approved clinical trials,and that nidek knew about the improper use of the laser.perez further alleges that the defendants conspired and aided and abetted each other in their unlawful conduct.
the fda was aware of claims that the laser was being put to unauthorized uses,and it took steps to halt abuses.in late,the fda sent nidek a letter expressing concern that chips in laser units were being replaced with chips that enable the device for unapproved applications,such as hyperopia.the letter addressed allegations that nidek employees were providing the replacement chips and that nidek had fired at least one employee for doing so.it also noted that nidek had waited several months after becoming aware that some lasers had been tampered with before reporting the problem,in violation of the pma conditions.
in,the fda sent two sets of warning letters to certain physicians after an investigator determined that the lasers they were using for hyperopia were manufactured before nidek pma was effective and that the lasers contained software not approved for commercial distribution in the united states.the first letter stated,because an approved pma or an approved ide investigational device exemption does not cover this laser,it is adulterated within the meaning of the act.therefore,you should not be using this laser to treat patients.the second letter reiterated the information in the first letter and added that the modified lasers needed to be certified as in compliance with the federal laser product performance standard.in addition,the fda published an import alert addressing the problem of lasers with software not approved under the pmas.
perez alleges that,d espite these actions by the fda,defendants continued to sell,distribute,lease,use,service,and market the lasers in the united states with the capacity to perform hyperopic procedures.he alleges that nidek continued to install,service and enable the lasers to perform hyperopic corrections outside of sanctioned clinical trials and that nidek falsified many service records indicating that it had removed the software.in october,the laser was approved for hyperopic use with improved and updated software and treatment parameters.
perez sued two groups of doctors the two doctors who performed surgery on the named plaintiffs,and named and unnamed doctors who performed no surgery on the named plaintiffs,but who allegedly performed surgery on other individuals in the proposed class.with respect to the first group,standing is not at issue,but the second group raises a serious standing question see easter am,cir holding that borrowers of second mortgage loans had no standing to sue those investment trusts that did not hold a named plaintiff note because they could not trace the alleged injury in fact to those defendants actions.
perez apparently endeavors to sidestep the traceability hurdle for the second group of doctors through his allegations of conspiracy and aiding and abetting.a look at those allegations reveals virtually nothing because they are no more than conclusory and bare bones words and phrases without any factual content.such vacuous claims are insufficient to establish standing or to survive a motion to dismiss.see lujan,at explaining that the elements of standing must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof,with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation iqbal,at to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.citation omitted.
because perez substantive claims fail,amendment would be futile.for the same reason,we do not need to reach the more difficult question of whether class certification should be decided before standing.see easter,at explaining that the district court correctly addressed standing before class certification and that ortiz fibreboard,d,does not require courts to consider class certification before standing.
nor does perez have standing to sue any of the defendants under the clra.the complaint requests only injunctive relief under that statute.perez has not demonstrated that he faces a real or immediate threat of an irreparable injury.hangarter provident life acc.ins,cir emphasis in original citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also los angeles lyons,d.perez does not allege that he intends to have further hyperopic surgery and,more importantly,the laser has been approved for hyperopic use since.no post conduct is alleged.although the district court dismissed the clra claim on the basis of preemption,we affirm on the alternate ground of standing,which is a threshold determination.see thompson paul,cir explaining that we can affirm a dismissal under rule b on any ground supported by the record bates united parcel,cir en banc standing is a threshold matter central to our subject matter jurisdiction.
ii.california protection of human subjects in medical experimentation act human subjects act claimm 
the california legislature enacted the human subjects act to provide minimum statutory protection for the citizens of the state with regard to human experimentation and to provide penalties for those who violate such provisions.cal.health.the act lays out detailed guidelines for informed consent,which is required before a person can be subjected to any medical experiment.id.a see id.for purposes of the informed consent provisions,medical experiment is defined as follows 
a the severance or penetration or damaging of tissues of a human subject or the use of a drug or device,as defined in section or,electromagnetic radiation,heat or cold,or a biological substance or organism,in or upon a human subject in the practice or research of medicine in a manner not reasonably related to maintaining or improving the health of the subject or otherwise directly benefiting the subject.
b the investigational use of a drug or device as provided in sections and.
c withholding medical treatment from a human subject for any purpose other than maintenance or improvement of the health of the subject.
id.perez claims do not fit the definition of medical experiment under either provision at issue here a or b.
as to a,there is no dispute that the laser eye surgeries involved the use of a device upon a human subject.where the parties disagree is whether the surgeries were performed in the practice of medicine in a manner not reasonably related to maintaining or improving the health of the subject or otherwise directly benefiting the subject.
only one published california case has addressed the interpretation of medical experiment under a.trantafello medical center of tarzana,d.in trantafello,an orthopedic surgeon implanted a piece of acrylic in trantafello neck to fill the space once occupied by a removed cervical disk.id.at.the surgeon did not advise trantafello that he planned to use an acrylic implant or that this was an innovative procedure not generally accepted in the united states.id.at.in holding that the patient could not rely on the human subjects act to extend the statute of limitations for his medical malpractice claim,the court stated in a footnote that the act was irrelevant to trantafello claim because the act deals with experiments on human subjects in the course of pure research here the doctor used the acrylic implant not in the course of a medical research program but in a course of therapeutic treatment for plaintiff.id.at.emphasis added.
perez quibbles with trantafello restriction of the act to experiments done in the course of pure research.according to perez,the fact that a procedure is meant to impart some benefit to a patient does not mean that it can not also constitute a medical experiment under the act.without deciding whether there is any more play in the joints of a than trantafello signals,the eye surgeries fell well outside the scope of subsection a.perez alleges that the procedures were undertaken to attempt to correct farsightedness.perez admits that the surgeries had a therapeutic purpose.he does not claim that this therapeutic purpose was merely incidental to a broader research goal in fact,he does not claim that there was any research goal whatsoever.without doubt,the hyperopic surgeries at issue here were reasonably related to improving perez health and directly benefiting him.see a.
perez is unable to explain why his broad definition of medical experiment would not swallow up all use.as the supreme court has recognized,usage of medical devices is an accepted and necessary corollary of the fda mission to regulate in the area of medical devices without directly interfering with the practice of medicine.buckman plaintiffs legal committee,d.the legislative history of the human subjects act reflects that california purposefully excluded therapeutic use from the scope of.the assembly bill originally included use and the use of a drug or device for which an application had been denied or withdrawn by the fda or the california department of health as falling within the definition of medical experiment,assemb.reg.sess.cal revisions to ab as amended in assembly,may,at assembly member herschel rosenthal,letter to governor edmund brown,re assemb.bill reg.sess,june,at rosenthal letter.those provisions were deleted before the bill became law,at least in part in response to the california medical association opposition to the bill.rosenthal letter.
perez remaining arguments that the eye surgeries were not reasonably related to improving the proposed class members health because the doctors performed the surgeries to line their own pockets and because the surgeries were elective are unpersuasive.both arguments attempt to import requirements into a that are not found in the text and have nothing to do with medical experimentation.the standard under a is objective,not subjective the doctors alleged motivations do not come into play.nor does the statute embody any requirement of altruism.a doctor desire to profit from a procedure hardly transforms that procedure from therapeutic to experimental.finally,the elective nature of a procedure is not a component of the statutory definition.many elective surgeries are performed to improve the patient health.the term often is used merely to distinguish emergency procedures from those that can be scheduled at the convenience of doctor and patient and even elective surgery that is not health related may be reasonably related to directly benefiting a patient.for example,elective cosmetic surgery that ostensibly has no health component,that is solely undertaken for aesthetic reasons,and that may be lucrative for certain physicians nonetheless may be performed to benefit a patient and thus fall outside of the act.perez is unable to advance a rationale that places these lasik surgeries within the requirements of the human subjects act.
the term medical experiment also includes,under b,the investigational use of a drug or device as provided in sections and.these latter referenced sections,respectively,govern investigations,commonly dubbed clinical trials,conducted in accordance with the requirements of the fdca,and investigations conducted under conditions specified by state law.
perez does not claim that he or any proposed class member was part of a clinical trial or that physician defendants performed their surgeries under the conditions specified in such as submitting reports to the state department of health services.with respect to this claim,perez undoing is that he affirmatively pled that he and the proposed class members were not participants in officially sanctioned clinical trials.the defendant doctor class is defined as a ll physicians who performed hyperopic lasik prk in california with the nidek laser during the class period,other than during an approved fda clinical trial.according to the complaint,those defendants knew and understood that the lasers were being used on plaintiffs and the class without their informed consent to be subjected to the investigational use of the laser,and without including them in a sanctioned clinical trial.perez can not argue both that he was not included in clinical trials and that the procedure falls under the clinical trial provisions of the human subjects act.see huntman danek medical,ieg rbb,wl,at.july,explaining that because there was no evidence that the plaintiff was part of an investigational device exemption,the defendant did not need to comply with the informed consent provisions of the ide regulations.
perez allegation that the laser was being investigated under fda approved clinical trials by both nidek and independent physician groups during the class period does not convert his own surgery which falls outside of the provisions of sections and into part of a clinical trial.for this reason,perez reliance on daum spinecare medical group,th,d,is misplaced.the plaintiff in daum was part of a clinical investigation conducted under the requirements of the fdca.id.at,d.
although perez may find it perverse and inequitable,as he puts it,to provide patients admitted to clinical trials with more pr
