this appeal presents for the first time in this circuit the threshold question of when interlocutory review of a class certification decision is appropriate under federal rule of civil procedure f.we take the opportunity to offer general guidance on the scope of our discretion under rule f in considering the petition for rule f review by mylan laboratories,mylan pharmaceuticals,udl laboratories,profarmaco,cambrex corporation,and gyma laboratories of america,collectively mylan,of the district court certification of a class of direct purchasers of the generic drugs lorazepam and clorazepate from mylan or udl.mylan contends that the district court erred in ruling that despite the federal trade commission ftc procurement of a settlement against mylan on behalf of a class of indirect purchasers,a class of direct purchasers had antitrust standing under illinois brick illinois,d,and,in the alternative that the certified class consists of both direct and indirect purchasers in violation of illinois brick.we conclude that interlocutory appeal pursuant to rule f typically is appropriate in three circumstances when there is a situation for either the plaintiff or defendant that is independent of the merits of the underlying claims,coupled with a class certification decision by the district court that is questionable,taking into account the district court discretion over class certification when the certification decision presents an unsettled and fundamental issue of law relating to class actions,important both to the specific litigation and generally,that is likely to evade review and when the district court class certification decision is manifestly erroneous.applying these standards we deny mylan petition for interlocutory review.
the class action now pending in the district court was preceded by two lawsuits brought by the ftc and several states attorneys general against mylan that were ultimately consolidated and ended in a settlement.on december,the ftc filed suit,pursuant to and b of the federal trade commission act ftc act,b,against mylan,cambrex,profarmaco,and gyma laboratories,seeking injunctive and equitable relief,including disgorgement of million plus interest.ftc mylan,d.the amended complaint alleged that the defendants had engaged in unfair methods of competition in violation of a of the ftc act,a,by mylan entering into exclusive licensing agreements with the other defendants,allowing mylan to control the supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredients api for generic lorazepam and clorazepate tablets so that mylan could increase the price of these generic drugs.on december,the attorneys general of ten states,later joined by an additional states and the district of columbia,brought suit against the same defendants and sst corporation,seeking equitable relief and treble damages for violations of and of the sherman act,and various state antitrust laws.mylan,d at see also in re lorazepam clorazepate antitrust.as to the ftc,the district court denied the defendants motion to dismiss,which argued that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the ftc was not authorized to seek either monetary relief or a permanent injunction in an antitrust case.mylan,d at.as to the states,the district court partially granted the defendants motion to dismiss,inter alia,narrowing the states federal claims to claims under of the clayton act for direct purchases and limiting restitution and disgorgement on behalf of indirect purchasers on a basis.id.at see also ftc mylan,d.subsequently,the parties entered into a settlement agreement,which the district court approved on february.mylan,at.the settlement agreement provided,in part,that mylan would pay disgorgement in the amount of to satisfy the consumer claims in the states lawsuit and to satisfy the states agency claims.the settlement agreement also provided that the ftc,states,state agencies,and consumers who did not exclude themselves from the settlement,would release their claims against the defendants.
on august,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred to the united states district court for the district of columbia a northern district of illinois lawsuit pending against mylan.this lawsuit was consolidated,on march,with a lawsuit brought by charles rehabilitation center against mylan.the named plaintiffs in the consolidated action were advocate health care,charles hospital and rehabilitation center,dik drug company,and harvard pilgrim health care,and they sought class certification as direct purchasers of lorazepam and clorazepate.the amended complaint alleged that mylan had engaged in price fixing and monopolization in violation of and of the sherman act,and the plaintiffs sought treble damages pursuant to of the clayton act.mylan moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b,on the ground that the plaintiffs proposed class of direct purchasers lacked antitrust standing to assert their claims.in illinois brick,the supreme court held that,with narrow exceptions,only direct purchasers may recover damages for illegal overcharges under of the clayton act.illinois brick,at.at.essentially,mylan argued that the usual direct purchaser rule of illinois brick should not apply because the ftc had won a monetary recovery for the benefit of a class of indirect consumer purchasers pursuant to b of the ftc act for alleged antitrust violations,and to allow both purchaser classes to obtain relief would undermine the policy rationales behind illinois brick.in the alternative,mylan opposed the class certification arguing,inter alia,that the class consisted of direct and indirect purchasers in violation of illinois brick direct purchaser rule.on july,the district court denied the motion to dismiss,and,in accord with the plaintiffs request,certified the following class 
all persons and entities in the united sates who purchased generic lorazepam tablets generic clorazepate tablets directly from defendants mylan and udl during the period january,through the present,excluding defendants,their respective parents,subsidiaries and affiliates,any of defendants,and all governmental entities.
in re lorazepam clorazepate antitrust.the district court appointed advocate health care,charles hospital,dik drug,and harvard pilgrim as class representatives.
mylan now petitions for interlocutory review of the district court denial of its rule b motion to dismiss and the district court certification of a class of direct purchasers.asserting that t his is not the typical case,petitioners br.at,mylan contends that,in light of the flexible standards for review developed in the circuits,appellate review of its petition under rule f is warranted not only does mylan petition raise the novel issue of law of how properly to calibrate antitrust standing where two antitrust cases collide,id.at,the outcome of which is potentially dispositive of the case,but also the district court decision is particularly susceptible to challenge and there may be no further opportunity to review its decision.reviving its rule b contention,mylan challenges the district court certification decision by contending first that under illinois brick,the ftc b enforcement action on behalf of the ultimate consumers of lorazepam and clorazepate precludes suit by a direct purchaser class.allowing a direct purchaser class to sue the same defendants for antitrust damages following the ftc suit and settlement would,in mylan view,topple every rationale supporting illinois brick rule confining potential antitrust plaintiffs to one level of purchasers.id.at.in these uncommon circumstances,mylan concludes,the direct purchaser class should be denied recovery.id.second,as to the certified class,mylan maintains that,even if direct purchasers may sue for antitrust damages in addition to the consumer class,the district court erred in ruling that the class had antitrust standing under the direct purchaser rule and its narrow exceptions.according to mylan,many members of the class,including three of the four class representatives,bought lorazepam and clorazepate,not from mylan,but from pharmaceutical wholesalers,who also purport to be members of the direct purchaser class.mylan asserts that this purchasing chain makes these class members who purchased from intermediaries quintessential indirect purchasers,who,under illinois brick,can not sue for antitrust damages.hence,mylan maintains,the district court erred in not determining,prior to certifying the class,whether the class and its representatives had antitrust standing under illinois brick.
we first set forth the standards that we will ordinarily apply in exercising our discretion under rule f,and then we address the contentions in mylan petition.
rule f,added by amendment in,provides that a court of appeals may in its discretion permit an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying class action certification under this rule if application is made to it within ten days after entry of the order.f.although other circuit courts of appeals have addressed the scope of rule f review,this is a question of first impression for this court.the advisory committee note to rule f states that a ppeal from an order granting or denying class certification is permitted in the sole discretion of the court of appeals and is akin to the discretion exercised by the supreme court in acting on a petition for certiorari.f advisory committee note.the advisory committee note also indicates that not all class certification issues warrant review,noting that many suits with allegations present familiar and almost routine issues that are no more worthy of immediate appeal than many other interlocutory rulings and accordingly directs the courts of appeals to develop standards for granting review that reflect the changing areas of uncertainty in class litigation.id.the advisory committee note offers this further guidance 
permission to appeal may be granted or denied on the basis of any consideration that the court of appeals finds persuasive.permission is most likely to be granted when the certification decision turns on a novel or unsettled question of law,or when,as a practical matter,the decision on certification is likely dispositive of the litigation.
id.thus,the advisory committee note identifies two instances in which rule f review would likely be appropriate when a class certification decision as a practical matter terminates the litigation and when a class certification decision raises a novel issue of law.relying on this guidance,other circuits have examined the appropriate scope of rule f.
first among the circuits to address the scope of appellate review pursuant to rule f,was the seventh circuit in blair equifax check services,cir.in blair,the seventh circuit rejected the adoption of a rule as imprudent and,looking to the reasons for the addition of rule f,identified three categories of cases in which appellate review would be appropriate.id.at.first,for some cases,denial of class status would sound the death knell of the litigation because the representative plaintiff claim is too small to justify the expense of litigation.id.second,the grant of class status can put substantial pressure on the defendant to settle independent of the merits of the plaintiffs claims.id.third,an appeal may facilitate the development of the law of class actions.id.at.regarding the first two categories,the seventh circuit added that the petitioner must demonstrate that the district court certification decision was questionable and must do this taking into account the discretion the district judge possesses in implementing rule,and the correspondingly deferential standard of appellate review.id.it explained,if the district court decision is impervious to revision,there is no point to an interlocutory appeal no matter how dramatic the effect of the grant or denial of class status is in undercutting the plaintiff claim or inducing the defendant to capitulate.id.regarding the third category of cases,which it noted is likely to include fundamental issues about class actions that have been poorly developed because so many class actions settle or are resolved in a manner that overtakes procedural matters,the seventh circuit observed that it is less important to show that the district court certification decision is questionable,explaining that law can be advanced through affirmances as well as reversals rather,the more important the question under the second factor is and the greater the likelihood that it will escape effective disposition at the end of the case,the more appropriate the appeal.id.
the first circuit in waste management holdings,mowbray,cir,agreed that blair captured the essential principles on which rule f rests.id.at.however,because of the ease with which issues of law can be characterized as fundamental,id.at,and because so many class certification decisions turn on familiar and almost routine issues,id.quoting.f advisory committee note,the first circuit narrowed the third category to include only those instances in which an appeal will permit the resolution of an unsettled legal issue that is important to the particular litigation as well as important in itself and likely to escape effective review if left hanging until the end of the case.id.at the same time,however,the first circuit duly noted the broad discretion ceded to the appellate courts by the rule,and cautioned that 
while we hope that these general comments will be helpful to parties deciding whether to pursue applications under rule f,we do not foreclose the possibility that special circumstances may lead us either to deny leave to appeal in cases that seem superficially to fit into one of these three pigeonholes,or conversely,to grant leave to appeal in cases that do not match any of the three described categories.
id.stating as well that it intend s to exercise its discretion judiciously,however,the first circuit observed that b y their nature,interlocutory appeals are disruptive,and expensive,and that notwithstanding the access to the appellate courts provided by rule f,the court should err,if at all,on the side of allowing the district court an opportunity to its class certification order,rather than opening the door too widely to interlocutory appellate review.id.citing.c.the second circuit,in in re sumitomo copper litigation,cir,appears to have adopted the approach set forth in mowbray.id.at.it stated that rule f petitioners ordinarily must show either that the certification order will effectively terminate the litigation and there has been a substantial showing that the district court decision is questionable,or implicates a legal question about which there is a compelling need for immediate resolution.id.at.
other circuits have elaborated on the mowbray approach.the eleventh circuit,in bush,cir,adopted five guideposts for rule f review whether the certification ruling is likely to sound the death knell of the litigation whether the district court certification decision contains a substantial weakness,such that it likely was an abuse of discretion whether the appeal presents an unsettled legal question that is of specific and general importance,issues likely to evade review,issues that are involved in related actions,and interests that affect the public interest the nature and status of the litigation before the district court,the status of discovery,the pendency of relevant motions,and how long the matter has been pending and the likelihood that future events will make immediate appellate review more appropriate,a change in financial status of a party or ongoing settlement negotiations.id.at.the second factor serves as a sliding scale the more questionable the district court decision,the less the remaining four factors need weigh in.id.at.the eleventh circuit recognized the possibility that when the district court certification decision is clearly wrong,rule f review may be warranted even if none of the other factors supports granting the rule f petition.id.at.the fourth circuit,in lienhart dryvit systems,cir,adopted the eleventh circuit approach with the sliding scale,but firmly stated that when a class certification decision is manifestly erroneous,review is warranted regardless of the remaining factors.id.at.the court explained that stringent standards for review are inappropriate as rule f purpose was to eliminate the unduly restrictive review practices which obtained when mandamus was the only available means to review a class certification prior to final judgment in the absence of a district court decision to voluntarily certify the issue for immediate review id.at.hence,the fourth circuit observed that i n addition to addressing death knell situations and promoting the resolution of legal questions of general importance,a careful and sparing use of rule f may promote judicial economy by enabling the correction of certain manifestly flawed class certifications prior to trial and final judgment.id.at.following the eleventh and fourth circuits decisions,the third circuit,in newton merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir,identified four categories of cases in which rule f would be appropriate the three set forth by the seventh circuit in blair and the advisory committee note plus the eleventh and fourth circuits inclusion of a category of likely erroneous class certification decisions.id.at.
the differences among the circuits,which are subtle,are of three types.first,two circuits permit appeal if the district court decision is erroneous,regardless whether the other factors governing appeal under rule f are present.compare newton,at and lienhart,at with mowbray,at and blair,at.second,two circuits allow appeal when a petition raises an unsettled and fundamental question of law,regardless whether the district court likely erred.see mowbray,at blair,at.third,those same circuits caution that interlocutory appeal of an unsettled question of law is appropriate only when that question may evade effective appellate review at the end of the trial court proceedings.see mowbray,at blair,at.
in our view,interlocutory appellate review under rule f is properly directed by the guidance set forth in the advisory committee note.the note reflects,on balance,a reluctance to depart from the traditional procedure in which claimed errors by the district court are reviewed on appeal only upon the conclusion of the proceedings in the district court.although the rule ceded broad discretion to the appellate courts,it is understood,if not presumed,that appellate courts will act with cognizance of both the concerns underlying interlocutory appeals generally and the specific purposes for the allowance of interlocutory appeals of class certification decisions in rule f.delay caused by interlocutory appeals under rule f may be less of a concern because filing a petition does not automatically stay the litigation,see blair,at in the instant case,the docket indicates that the case proceeded until the district court granted mylan motion for a stay on april.still,interlocutory appeals are generally disfavored as disruptive,timeconsuming,and expensive for both the parties and the courts,mowbray,at,and the more so in a complex class action where the district court may reconsider and modify the class as the case progresses,at.c.as the eleventh circuit aptly commented,the exception provided by rule f should be exercised in a manner that avoids both micromanagement of complex class actions as they evolve in the district court and inhibition of the district court willingness to revise the class certification for fear of triggering another round of appellate review.see,at.thus,petitions for rule f review are likely to be granted sparingly in cases that fall within neither the guidelines in the advisory committee note nor the standards we adopt today.nonetheless,the circuit courts addressing rule f are in agreement that restrictions on review should not preclude review in special circumstances that neither the advisory committee note nor the courts foresaw.see,mowbray,at blair,at.
with these considerations in mind,we offer the following guidance.rule f review will ordinarily be appropriate in three circumstances when there is a situation for either the plaintiff or defendant that is independent of the merits of the underlying claims,coupled with a class certification decision by the district court that is questionable,taking into account the district court discretion over class certification when the certification decision presents an unsettled and fundamental issue of law relating to class actions,important both to the specific litigation and generally,that is likely to evade review and when the district court class certification decision is manifestly erroneous.whether the district court decision is questionable need not affect the appropriateness of rule f review in the second category,as issues of law can be advanced through affirmances as well as reversals.blair,at.but we conclude,unlike mowbray and blair,that error in certifying a class should not entirely be ignored outside the first category.where a district court class certification decision is manifestly erroneous,for example,rule f review would be warranted even in the absence of a situation if for no other reason than to avoid a lengthy and costly trial that is for naught once the final judgment is appealed.although these standards are meant as guidance on when rule f review ordinarily will be granted,we caution that the standards represent guidance,not a rigid test.
as is true for all the circuits,we are of the view that rule f review should be granted rarely where a case does not fall within one of these three categories.the sheer number of class actions,the district court authority to modify its class certification decision,see.c,and the ease with which litigants can characterize legal issues as novel,all militate in favor of narrowing the scope of rule f review.see,at see also mowbray,at.at the same time,there necessarily should be some hesitancy in creating a rigid test for the exercise of an appellate court discretion to grant a rule f petition for review because circumstances may arise that can not now be anticipated in which review would be appropriate,and conversely,in which review would be inappropriate notwithstanding the fact that a petition falls within the categories of cases in which review would ordinarily be appropriate.as the advisory committee note indicates,the circuit court standards should reflect the changing areas of uncertainty in class litigation.f advisory committee note.each circuit,thus,has reserved some leeway in its standards.see,newton,at,at mowbray,at blair,at.so do we.that said,we nevertheless conclude that,absent special circumstances,this court consideration of petitions for interlocutory review under rule f should ordinarily fall within the three circumstances that we have identified.
mylan contends in its rule f petition for review that,although certification of a class of direct purchasers is consistent with the direct purchaser rule of illinois brick,it conflicts with what mylan regards as the underlying policy of illinois only one purchaser class has antitrust standing to sue under of the clayton,as here,the ftc has brought suit and obtained a settlement on behalf of a class of consumer indirect purchasers.mylan also contends that the certified class consists of both direct and indirect purchasers in contravention of illinois brick and rule class certification requirements.seeking to bring itself within the flexible standards for rule f adopted by the circuit courts,mylan maintains that its petition for review should be granted because important issues of antitrust standing are raised by the district court class certification ruling that are novel,significant,and potentially dispositive,and because the class as certified is particularly suspect and may avoid later review given the potential liability mylan faces.we conclude that rule f review is inappropriate because mylan arguments in support of its rule b motion to dismiss are unrelated to class certification,and because mylan only challenge to the class certification decision falls outside the categories for rule f review set forth in part ii.
rule f interlocutory review is limited to issues that relate to class certification.see.f bertulli indep.ass of cont l pilots,cir carter publ g,cir.thus,under rule f,this court can review the merits of an appeal only inso
