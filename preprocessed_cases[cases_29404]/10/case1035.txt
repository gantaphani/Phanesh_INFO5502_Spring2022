plaintiffs appellants the arizona civil rights division the division and the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc collectively plaintiffs appeal the district court summary judgment rulings against them and in favor of defendant appellee geo group,incorporated geo.a female corrections officer,alice hancock,filed a charge of discrimination with the division against her employer,geo,alleging that she had been subjected to discrimination,harassment,and retaliation in violation of state and federal employment laws.after an investigation,the division and eeoc found reasonable cause to believe that geo had violated the employment rights of the corrections officer and a class of female employees.conciliation attempts failed,and the eeoc and the division brought suit on behalf of a class of female employees alleging that geo violated title vii of the civil rights act of and the arizona civil rights act acra.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of geo dismissing several employees whom neither the eeoc nor the division had identified until after filing the complaint.the district court also dismissed several employees who had not alleged acts within days of the division reasonable cause determination.the district court dismissed the hostile work environment claim of another aggrieved employee,sofia hines,on the ground that the conduct she alleged was not sufficiently severe or pervasive.
this appeal raises four issues the scope of the requirement that the eeoc and the division conciliate any claims with an employer prior to bringing suit,when title vii day limitations period starts to run in an eeoc class action whether,in an eeoc class action,an aggrieved employee is required to file a new charge of discrimination for acts that occur after the reasonable cause determination and whether aggrieved employee sophia hines has presented material issues of fact as to her hostile work environment claim.
we vacate the district court order.we hold that the eeoc and the division sufficiently conciliated its class claims against geo in this lawsuit in light of mach mining,llc eeoc,d assuming that title vii and the acra exhaustion requirements apply in this case,we hold that the eeoc and the division may maintain their claims on behalf of aggrieved employees provided that the employee has alleged at least one act of misconduct that occurred within days prior to the date the first aggrieved employee,alice hancock,filed her charge against geo.we also hold that in an eeoc class action an aggrieved employee is not required to file a new charge of discrimination with the eeoc if her claim is already encompassed within the reasonable cause determination or if the claim is like or reasonably related to the initial charge.finally,we hold that aggrieved employee sofia hines has presented material issues of fact as to her hostile work environment claim.
alice hancock was employed by geo as a correctional officer at the arizona state prison,florence west facility.geo is a corporation that employs over employees and provides corrections and detention management,health and mental health services to federal,state,and local government agencies.geo contracts with the arizona department of corrections to maintain and operate two facilities the security and units at florence west and the unit at central arizona correctional facility cacf.
on june,hancock filed a charge of discrimination with the arizona civil rights division and the eeoc hancock alleged that while working with sergeant robert kroen he grabbed her crotch and pinched her vagina.hancock filed an incident report with geo,but contends that geo did not remedy the harassment.after hancock complained about kroen conduct,three of her coworkers complained that hancock had made an offensive comment.geo placed hancock on unpaid administrative leave pending an internal investigation,and later suspended her for days without pay.three months after hancock filed her charge of discrimination,geo terminated hancock employment.
the division investigated the allegations in hancock charge it asked geo for a position statement and served discovery on geo asking for similar complaints made by others involving the same issues or individuals as involved in hancock complaint to the division.geo provided documentation regarding previous investigations of complaints of sexual harassment at its florence west facility involving individuals other than hancock.based on geo responses,the division identified five additional female correctional officers who either witnessed or complained of sexual harassment.the division then subpoenaed and interviewed current and former geo employees,who identified additional female employees as potential aggrieved employees.
on may,the division concluded its investigation and issued a reasonable cause determination substantiating hancock allegations of discrimination and harassment based on her sex and retaliation.the division found that kroen had sexually harassed her,kroen and others created a hostile work environment,and that geo retaliated against hancock after she complained about kroen.additionally,the division identified other incidents of misconduct by kroen and other male supervisors that created an offensive and hostile work environment based on gender that adversely affected hancock and a class of female employees working at the facility.the division identified several egregious acts allegedly committed by three male correctional officers against subordinate female officers.the alleged acts included that a male officer grabbed hancock breast he made offensive comments and gestures including that he was fucking a female correctional officer,told female officers that he wanted to bend them over the desk and wanted to ram them from the back while making humping gestures,and told female correctional officers to suck his dick while making gestures towards his penis.another male officer allegedly rubbed against a subordinate female correctional officer when she bent over to replace a trash can liner,and forcibly lifted her onto a table,shoved himself between her legs and tried to kiss her.
the division also found reasonable cause to believe that geo did not take reasonable steps to prevent and correct harassment in the workplace and subjected female officers to different terms and conditions of employment.the division investigation suggested,among other things,that even after substantiating sexual harassment claims against two male correctional officers,geo gave one officer a positive performance review and made the other officer an instructor for mandatory training that his victims would be required to attend.additionally the division found that while geo had a practice of transferring male supervisors accused of harassment to other units which also employed female correctional officers,female correctional officers were assigned to less desirable positions after they complained.
based on its investigation,the division determined that hancock and the other aggrieved females were subjected to different terms and conditions of employment,including harassment and retaliation.the division concluded that there was reasonable cause to believe geo had violated arizona revised statutes prohibiting discrimination,harassment,and retaliation,against hancock and a class of female employees.the eeoc adopted the division reasonable cause determination in a separate letter to geo.
a.the eeoc and the division conciliation efforts with geo 
the eeoc and the division invited geo to conciliate the matter in their reasonable cause determinations.additionally,the eeoc and the division conveyed a conciliation letter to geo that outlined a proposal to settle alice hancock charge of discrimination and the claims of other aggrieved employees of geo.the letter proposed damages for hancock,a class fund for unidentified class members,and injunctive relief.plaintiffs and geo also attended a joint conciliation session.during the conciliation session,geo made a counteroffer as to hancock but did not make a counteroffer to the class demand.geo asked plaintiffs to identify the unidentified class members but they declined to do so.geo also proposed a separate settlement with the eeoc and the division,which they rejected.ultimately the conciliation was unsuccessful.
b.the eeoc and the division civil complaints 
the eeoc and the division filed civil complaints against geo alleging that geo group has engaged in unlawful employment practices at the florence west and cacf facilities in violation of title vii and the acra.the complaints alleged that hancock and similarly situated employees were subject to different terms and conditions of employment,including,but not limited to,hostile work environment and sexual harassment,and retaliation.while litigation was pending,plaintiffs sent letters entitled notice of class litigation to female correctional officers and male officers encouraging the officers to contact them if they ever witnessed any sexual harassment or retaliation.as a result of these letters,additional female geo employees came forward to participate in the lawsuit.
c.the district court summary judgment orders 
the district court granted in part geo successive motions for partial summary judgment.the district court first dismissed the claims of women who had not been specifically identified during the course of the investigation or in the reasonable cause determination.the district court concluded that the eeoc and the division were required to identify these women and attempt to conciliate their claims prior to bringing suit on their behalf.the court reasoned that because plaintiffs did not identify the fifteen women at issue until after sending their notices of class litigation,plaintiffs had wholly failed to satisfy their statutory obligations to conciliate their claims.the district court stayed the claims of the five aggrieved employees who were discovered during the investigation into hancock allegations while the plaintiffs and geo attempted conciliation.
after conciliation failed for the remaining aggrieved employees,the district court granted geo partial summary judgment motion finding that hancock and the other five remaining aggrieved employees claims were untimely in part.the court found that title vii and the arizona civil rights act required that a party file a charge of discrimination within days of the alleged discriminatory act.the district court found that hancock had timely filed her charge with the eeoc and the division on june,but that any discrete acts prior to august,days before hancock june,charge were untimely.the court found,however,that any alleged misconduct that formed hancock hostile work environment claim would not be barred.
with respect to other aggrieved employees,the court noted that they were not necessarily required to file their own charge if their claims arose out of similar discriminatory treatment as hancock.however,the district court found the operative date for other employees was not the date of hancock charge june,but rather may,the date of the division reasonable cause determination that placed geo on notice that the division was expanding its investigation to include a class of women.thus,the district court found that any discrete acts alleged by the other aggrieved employees prior to july,days preceding the division reasonable cause determination,were untimely.
the district court also barred any discrete acts that arose after the date of the reasonable cause determination,may,as those acts were not investigated and,therefore,can not be considered.the district court noted that the eeoc and the division had failed to respond to geo argument that acts should be excluded.the court also found that aggrieved employees with claims arising after the reasonable cause determination were required to file their own charges.accordingly,the district court found that two aggrieved employees,roach and wilcox,had failed to allege any timely acts and granted summary judgment in geo favor.
finally,the district court found that,regardless of whether hines claims were timely,the conduct that hines alleged did not rise to the level of actionable hostile work environment.
hancock settled with geo prior to trial for an undisclosed amount,and the district court dismissed her claims.the final two remaining employees entered into a consent decree prior to trial.the consent decree preserved the eeoc and the division right to appeal the district court summary judgment orders in an effort to pursue claims and remedies on behalf for the dismissed employees.the eeoc and the division timely appealed.
we review summary judgment de novo.szajer city of,cir.we focus on the agencies obligation to seek conciliation prior to filing suit on behalf of aggrieved employees,when the day period begins to run for employees who seek to join an agency class action,whether,in an eeoc class action,an aggrieved employee is required to file a new charge of discrimination for acts that occur after the reasonable cause determination,and whether sophia hines has presented material issues of fact that precluded summary judgment against her.
a.the eeoc and the division conciliation efforts are subject to limited judicial review 
title vii of the civil rights act of,stat.et,sets out a detailed,procedure through which the eeoc enforces the statute prohibition on employment discrimination.mach mining,llc eeoc,d unanimous.the process generally starts when a person claiming to be aggrieved files a charge of an unlawful workplace practice with the eeoc.id.quoting.b.t he eeoc notifies the employer of the complaint and undertakes an investigation.id.if the commission finds no reasonable cause to think that the allegation has merit,it dismisses the charge and notifies the parties,and the complainant may then pursue her own lawsuit if she chooses.id.citing f.
if,on the other hand,the commission finds reasonable cause,it must first endeavor to eliminate the alleged unlawful employment practice by informal methods of conference,conciliation,and persuasion.id.quoting b.the statute leaves to the eeoc the ultimate decision whether to accept a settlement or instead to bring a lawsuit on its own behalf.id.so long as the commission has been unable to secure from the respondent a conciliation agreement acceptable to the commission itself,the eeoc may sue the employer.id.at quoting f.thus,before suing an employer for discrimination,the eeoc must try to remedy unlawful workplace practices through informal methods of conciliation.the acra is modeled after and is generally identical to title vii of the civil rights act.civil rights div.hughes air,quoting higdon evergreen int l airlines.it contains a similar condition requiring a conciliation attempt.b,d.
after principal briefing in this case was completed,the supreme court granted certiorari in mach mining to determine whether and to what extent may a court enforce the eeoc mandatory duty to conciliate discrimination claims before filing suit.at.the court unanimously held that courts have jurisdiction to review whether the eeoc has satisfied the conciliation requirement.id.at.however,the review of whether the eeoc has satisfied its conciliation requirements is limited.id.at.
t he eeoc must inform the employer about the specific allegation,as the commission typically does in a letter announcing its determination of reasonable cause.b.such notice properly describes both what the employer has done and which employees or what class of employees have suffered as a result.and the eeoc must try to engage the employer in some form of discussion whether written or oral,so as to give the employer an opportunity to remedy the allegedly discriminatory practice.judicial review of those requirements and nothing else ensures that the commission complies with the statute.at the same time,that relatively barebones review allows the eeoc to exercise all the expansive discretion title vii gives it to decide how to conduct conciliation efforts and when to end them.and such review can occur consistent with the statute provision,because a court looks only to whether the eeoc attempted to confer about a charge,and not to what happened,statements made or positions taken during those discussions.
here,it is undisputed that the eeoc and the division served geo with a reasonable cause determination detailing hancock allegations against kroen and her complaint to geo.moreover,the reasonable cause determination referred to a class of female employees who had also been subject to discrimination,harassment,and retaliation at the security and unit at florence west and the unit,which was located at the cacf.both agencies invited geo to conciliate and all parties participated in a formal mediation session.the eeoc and the division proposed a settlement including damages,injunctive relief,and a class fund for unnamed class members.under the supreme court guidance in mach mining,the agencies actions clearly satisfied title vii and the acra conciliatory requirements.
even if the eeoc and the division had failed to conciliate prior to bringing suit,the appropriate remedy would be a stay of proceedings to permit an attempt at conciliation,not the dismissal of the aggrieved employees claims.
if,however,the employer provides credible evidence of its own,in the form of an affidavit or otherwise,indicating that the eeoc did not provide the requisite information about the charge or attempt to engage in a discussion about conciliating the claim,a court must conduct the factfinding necessary to decide that limited dispute,at,at,at.should the court find in favor of the employer,the appropriate remedy is to order the eeoc to undertake the mandated efforts to obtain voluntary compliance.see f authorizing a stay of a title vii action for that purpose.
id.at emphasis added.
although the eeoc,like any party to litigation,may not negotiate in good faith,these concerns were addressed by a unanimous supreme court in mach mining.the court explained 
congress left to the eeoc such strategic decisions as whether to make a offer,to lay all its cards on the table,or to respond to each of an employer,however far afield.so too congress granted the eeoc discretion over the pace and duration of conciliation efforts,the plasticity or firmness of its negotiating positions,and the content of its demands for relief.for a court to assess any of those choices as mach mining urges and many courts have done,is not to enforce the law congress wrote,but to impose extra procedural requirements.such judicial review extends too far.
id.at citation omitted.
thus,the eeoc and the division sufficiently conciliated its class claims against the employer,geo,in this lawsuit under title vii and the acra.the district court grant of summary judgment for failure to conciliate is vacated.
neither the eeoc nor the division is required to conciliate on an individual basis prior to bringing a lawsuit on behalf of a class of aggrieved individuals 
the district court was also concerned that the eeoc and the division had used the discovery process to identify additional aggrieved employees,and accordingly deduced that they were required to identify and conciliate on behalf of all class members during the investigation period.but we reject the district court premise that the eeoc and the division must identify and conciliate on behalf of each individual aggrieved employee during the investigation process prior to filing a lawsuit seeking recovery on behalf of a class we hold that the eeoc and the division satisfy their conciliation requirements to bring a class action if they attempt to conciliate on behalf of an identified class of individuals prior to bringing suit.
our determination is based in part on mach mining,which was a lawsuit brought by the eeoc on behalf of a class of women.the court held that in order to satisfy its conciliation requirements,the eeoc must identify what the employer has done and which employees or what class of employees have suffered as a result,d.the supreme court did not articulate any further requirement of individual conciliation prior to bringing a lawsuit on behalf of a class of individuals.accordingly,we will not impose any additional conciliation requirement.
if the eeoc and the division were required to pursue individual conciliation on behalf of every aggrieved employee,they would be effectively barred from seeking relief on behalf of any unnamed class members they had yet to identify when they filed their suit.civil litigants in private class actions may discover additional aggrieved employees who may wish to participate in the class.in light of the broad enforcement authority of the eeoc and the division,it would be illogical to limit their ability to seek classwide relief to something narrower than the abilities of private litigants 
our determination that the eeoc and the division satisfy their conciliation requirements if they attempt to conciliate on behalf of a class of individuals prior to bringing suit is also consistent with the supreme court broad interpretation of the eeoc enforcement powers.the court has held that e very aspect of title vii conciliation provision smacks of flexibility.id.at.indeed,the eeoc may seek specific relief for a group of aggrieved individuals without first obtaining class certification pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.of the nw.eeoc,d.additionally,we have noted,in a different posture,that the eeoc is not required to provide documentation of individual attempts to conciliate on behalf of each potential claimant in a class action.eeoc bruno restaurant,cir.in bruno,the defendant restaurant fired its pregnant waitresses.the eeoc investigated and found reasonable cause to believe that the defendant had illegally discriminated against them.id.at.the defendant rejected the eeoc efforts to settle and the eeoc brought suit.the district court dismissed the eeoc action and awarded the defendant its attorney fees based on the failure of the eeoc to conciliate a pattern and practice claim.id.at.we vacated the award of attorney fees holding that the eeoc could have reasonably believed that its efforts to conciliate were sufficient.although we clarified that we were not deciding whether the eeoc in fact conciliated the claim,we acknowledged case law that had held in a class action suit,the eeoc is not required to provide documentation of individual attempts to conciliate on behalf of each potential claimant.id.at quoting eeoc rhone poulenc,cir alteration omitted.
our view is also consistent with the rulings of our sister circuits.see,serrano cintas,cir holding that eeoc satisfied its requirement to attempt to conciliate class claims by provid ing notice to cintas that it was investigating instances of discrimination rhone poulenc,at per curiam holding the eeoc is not required to provide documentation of individual attempts to conciliate on behalf of each potential claimant internal quotation marks omitted eeoc keco indus,cir the record establishes that the eeoc sought to conciliate the class based claim with keco.eeoc am.bank,cir holding that eeoc conciliation efforts regarding discriminatory practices at one branch office were sufficient to cover claims of similar discrimination at another branch.
we further note that the conciliation requirements do not change depending on whether the eeoc brings a claim under a claim or a claim.title vii indicates that the conciliation procedures for both sections are the same.see e all such actions shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth in section of this title.in mach mining,the eeoc brought suit under both f and on behalf of a class of women.the court held that the eeoc would fulfill its duty to attempt to conciliate by engaging the employer to remedy the alleged discriminatory practice including identifying both what the employer has done and which employees or what class of employees have suffered as a result.at.the court did not differentiate between class suits brought under and.in any event,such differences would not apply here where mach mining and this case were both brought under.
thus,we vacate the district court dismissal of eeoc and the division claims on behalf of aggrieved employees.
title vii requires that a charge shall be filed by or on behalf of the person aggrieved within three hundred days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred e.for hostile work environment claims of a continuing nature,the aggrieved employee must allege at least one discrete act had occurred within the day time frame.porter cal.dep t of,cir citing passenger morgan,d.an individual failure to file a charge with the agency within this time frame will usually operate to bar that person from bringing a lawsuit for failure to exhaust their administrative remedies.see zipes trans world airlines,d.however,unnamed class members in a private class action need not exhaust administrative remedies.united airlines,mcdonald,d f ull relief under title vii may be awarded on a class basis without exhaustion of administrative procedures by the unnamed class members.quoting albemarle paper moody,d franks bowman transp,d th e justification that unnamed class members had not filed administrative charges for denying relief in title vii suits has been unanimously rejected by the courts of appeals,and congress ratified that construction by the title vii amendments.albemarle paper,at b ackpay may be awarded on a class basis under title vii without exhaustion of administrative procedures by the unnamed class members.
in addition,an aggrieved employee who fails to file a timely charge with the eeoc may still be able to pursue a claim under the piggyback or rule,in which the employee piggyback s onto the timely charge filed by another plaintiff for purposes of exhausting administrative remedies.see harris cty.of orange,cir citing,inter alia,bean crocker bank,cir.the piggyback rule is a judicially created equitable tolling rule based on the observation that it would be duplicative and wasteful for complainants with similar grievances to have to file identical notices of intent to sue with a governmental agency.id.citing bean,at.
the district court found that hancock had timely filed a charge with the eeoc and the division within days of the alleged discriminatory practice.the court further found that plaintiffs could assert claims on behalf of a class of individuals who had suffered an unlawful employment practice,but held that the filing period for those aggrieved employees should run from the date of the reasonable cause determination and not hancock charge 
we hold that the district court erred in requiring that aggrieved employees allege an act that occurred within the days before the reasonable cause determination.the proper starting date of the eeoc and divison class action is days prior to hancock charge,not the reasonable cause determination.this is evident from the plain language of title vii that requires a charge be filed within three hundred days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred e.nothing in the text refers to the agencies reasonable cause determination or indicates that a reasonable cause determination be filed within days of the alleged unlawful employment practice.rather,the statute timing requirement refers exclusively to the charge.
furthermore,we have previously held in a private class action that the proper starting date of the class action is days prior to the date the charging party filed his eeoc charge.domingo new england fish,cir,as modified.as domingo holds that the day period starts from the date of the charge filed by the named plaintiff for all class members in a private class action,it follows that the limitations period for class actions brought by the eeoc should be no later.
thus,the district court erred in limiting the time for which aggrieved employees may allege unlawful acts to days preceding the reasonable cause determination in an eeoc class action.the district court may have been concerned that hancock initial charge did not provide sufficient notice to geo of the existence of class claims by other aggrieved female employees,particularly those employed at the cacf,a different facility than where hancock worked.see hipp liberty nat.life,cir per curiam a single charge can not be expected to put the eeoc and employer on notice that general policies as applied to different individuals in different offices are being challenged indefinitely.however,this concern fails to distinguish the time frame in which the employee is required to file their charge of discrimination,days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred from the eeoc responsibility to notify the employer of the results of the eeoc investigation.nothing in the text of the statute supports the district court imputation of the employee time limit into the eeoc duty to notify the employer of the results of its investigation.
moreover,we have held that a single charge of discrimination may be sufficient to put an employer on notice that additional people may be subject to the same unlawful employment practices.paige california,cir.in paige,we held that the plaintiff could maintain a class action alleging disparate impact in promotions even though he had not raised class claims in the administrative charge.id.we explained that even if neither the eeoc nor the state charges on their face explicitly alleged class discrimination,it is plain that an eeoc investigation of class discrimination on the basis of race could reasonably be expected to grow out of the allegations in the charges.id.at citing fellows universal,cir.similarly,in lucky stores,eeoc,cir,we held that the eeoc could bring claims on behalf of employees at sacramento and san leandro facilities where the employer had adequate notice notice that the eeoc was investigating those facilities successor facility in vacaville 
it follows from domingo,paige,and lucky stores,that an employer may be on notice of classwide allegations of discrimination from a single charge.here,hancock charge alleged that she had been subject to discrimination,harassment,and retaliation.although hancock alleged incident with kroen may have been isolated,she further elaborated that she complained about the harassment and geo did nothing to remedy it.furthermore,she alleged that after she complained,geo initiated an investigation against her based on false pretenses,and placed her on administrative leave.thus,the charge was not limited to an isolated act of discrimination by one individual against another.see paige,at,t he investigation that actually results or that can reasonably be expected to result from a charge filed by an individual is not limited by the literal terms of the charge.the eeoc and the division then brought an enforcement action against geo on the same grounds articulated in hancock charge discrimination,harassment,and retaliation against female correctional officers 
accordingly,the aggrieved employees who alleged acts of discrimination,harassment,or retaliation the kind of discriminatory conduct alleged in hancock charge within the days preceding hancock initial charge have made timely claims.
we also hold that in an eeoc class action,an aggrieved employee is not required to file a new charge of discrimination if her claim is already encompassed within the reasonable cause determination or if the claim is like or reasonably related to the initial charge.
we first note that the eeoc failed to argue this point to the district court below.however,we have discretion to review an issue of law,that the district court addressed,and that would result in prejudice if not addressed.see ahanchian xenon pictures,cir.whether an aggrieved employee is required to file a new charge of discrimination in an eeoc class action is an issue of law,that the district court addressed,and that otherwise could result in prejudice to those aggrieved employees if we did not discuss it.
we have held that an eeoc civil suit may allege any discrimination stated in the charge itself or discovered in the course of a reasonable investigation of that charge,provided such additional discrimination was included in the eeoc reasonable cause determination and was followed by compliance with the conciliation procedures of the act.eeoc hearst,cir.similarly,in eeoc farmer,cir,we held that the eeoc could assert an employee discriminatory layoff claim as it was like and reasonably related to her charge which alleged discriminatory failure to recall and rehire.see also vasquez cty.of,cir holding individual employee may assert unexhausted re
