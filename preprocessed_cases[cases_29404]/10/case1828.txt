this consumer class action arises out of alleged anticompetitive conduct in connection with patents on certain computer memory chip technology obtained by defendant and respondent,rambus,rambus.plaintiff and appellant holiday matinee,holiday alleged three causes of action in its second amended complaint complaint a claim for violation of the cartwright act bus.et a claim for violation of california unfair competition law bus,et and a claim for unjust enrichment.
the case is before us as a result of a stipulated judgment of dismissal that was entered after the court below sustained rambus demurrer to each cause of action of the complaint.rambus challenges to the complaint included lack of subject matter jurisdiction,litigation privilege,subd.b,privilege under the doctrine and failure to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.holiday contends that the trial court erred in concluding that the complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
for the reasons stated below,we conclude that the trial court correctly sustained the demurrer to the complaint.we therefore affirm the judgment.
the facts recited below are from the allegations made by holiday in the complaint.in reviewing the propriety of the trial court sustaining of the demurrer,we,of course,accept as true the factual allegations properly pleaded in the complaint.see construction protective services,tig specialty ins.cal th,d,cryolife,superior court th,d.
general allegations.
holiday is an independent publicity and marketing company that is based in san diego.rambus is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in los altos,california.
the relevant product market at issue is the market for certain computer memory chip technology,dynamic random access memory dram.the dram technology market comprises three distinct technologies rambus dynamic random access memory technology rdram synchronous dynamic random access memory sdram and synchronous dynamic access memory technologies ddr.the relevant geographic market is worldwide.rambus is alleged to have a monopoly market share of the relevant product and geographic markets,in that rambus a has a percent share of rdram technology,and b holds approximately percent of the overall dram technology market rdram,sdram,and ddr technologies.
the claims asserted in the complaint arise out of rambus anticompetitive use of its wrongfully obtained market power in the relevant market for dram to coerce dram manufacturers into license agreements in restraint of trade.this anticompetitive scheme occurred as detailed below as a result of rambus participation in an open forum of dram manufacturers called jedec joint electronics devices engineering council.rambus participated in jedec to influence the evolution of jedec compliant dram architecture,all the while concealing from jedec and its members that it was obtaining patents to cover features of these new industry standard technologies.rambus concealed these patents in violation of jedec rules,and then sought to enforce its patent rights against dram manufacturers through various anticompetitive means.
on april,rambus filed a patent application,number application.the application is alleged to be the essential innovation for the development of sdram devices.beginning in march,rambus filed several patent applications to the application to ensure its own patents would include the features of the underlying architecture required to manufacture jedec compliant sdram and ddr.
ii.rambus participation in jedec.
in,jedec began formulating technical open standards for the purpose of ensuring that various sdram technologies would be compatible with the architecture of each dram manufacturer.jedec had a basic rule that the standardization process must be conducted in a manner that shall not be proposed for or indirectly result in restricting competition,giving a competitive advantage to any manufacturer,excluding competitors from the market.consistent with its governing rules,jedec had attempted to avoid incorporating patented technologies into its standards,so that the standards would be available to all on terms or otherwise reasonable and terms.in accordance with this policy,jedec required that its members disclose all existing and pending patents that covered technologies being considered by the body as the industry standard.
rambus joined jedec in early and withdrew from the organization in june.rambus used various subcommittee forums for the purpose of incorporating technical information about sdram and ddr technologies into rambus own patents,and in order to promote its own rdram technologies.
rambus regularly attended the jedec committee meetings,during which the members discussed sdram technologies and future industry standards for sdram and ddr.on june,richard crisp,a rambus executive,completed four jedec ballots.on each ballot,rambus intentionally failed to disclose to the jedec committee the existence of the application or any of the new patent applications that lay claim to the architecture being developed as the open standards.this intentional omission by rambus occurred,notwithstanding the fact that jedec ballots stated if anyone receiving this ballot is aware of patents involving this ballot,please alert the committee according to your voting response.in march,billy garrett,another rambus executive,attended a jedec committee meeting in which the members approved an sdram standard and forwarded it to the jedec council for final review.
on june,rambus advised jedec in writing that it would not be renewing its jedec membership.in that notice,rambus referred to dram technology patents and made a vague reference to additional patent applications.rambus,however,omitted from the notice one particular patent issued in april cover ing the architecture in jedec compliant sdram and ddr technologies.
iii.claims against rambus.
the complaint alleges that rambus intentionally defrauded jedec members,inter alia,by failing to disclose information about its patents,by obtaining additional patents covering features of jedec standards for sdram,and by urging jedec members to adopt into jedec standards at least four core technologies.rambus did not reveal its sdram and ddr patents until november at that point,jedec had already adopted rambus patents as the industry standard,and dram manufacturers and consumers had long since become locked in to the jedec compliant architecture.the complaint alleges,as an example,that infineon designed new products consistent with the jedec standard and built production lines in this country and in germany to make those products.when rambus disclosed its patents,infineon alternatively was forced to abandon its products and investment in the production lines,pay exorbitant royalties to rambus,or engage in litigation with rambus concerning claims that infineon products infringed rambus patents.
rambus used its patents to coerce dram manufacturers into unfair and deceptive license agreements after they were locked in to manufacturing the jedec compliant sdram and ddr architecture.this coercive scheme was accomplished by rambus making demands that dram manufacturers enter into agreements with it to license sdram,ddr,or rdram technology.rambus attempted to move the manufacturers away from sdram and ddr technology to the more expensive rdram technology by charging royalty rates on rdram technology that were significantly lower than the rates it charged for the alternative dram technologies.
rambus licensing scheme the complaint alleges was unlawful,in that rambus was not entitled to charge any royalties for the licensing of sdram or ddr technologies,because any patent protection that rambus obtained for those technologies was procured through fraud.therefore,the royalty rates rambus charged for licensing rdram technology were improperly inflated,because dram they not been faced with rambus wrongful royalty claims for sdram and ddr have chosen to use either ddr technology with no licensing fees,or rdram technology at lower licensing rates than those ultimately charged by rambus.
rambus carried out the alleged coercive licensing scheme by threatening filing baseless infringement litigation against manufacturers that refused its demands for royalties.rambus did so despite knowing that its claims for royalties against jedec members were wrongful and unenforceable,as a result of rambus actions in the development of jedec open standards policies.the complaint alleges that rambus filed patent infringement actions against several dram manufacturers,including infineon rambus also demanded higher royalties from those manufacturers that chose to engage in litigation,and rambus made it clear that any manufacturer who lost such a lawsuit would be cut off completely from licensing any rambus technology.
the complaint alleges that rambus wrongful acts and practices constituted unlawful combinations to restrict trade,prevent competition,to pool,combine or unite interests connected with the sale of products,affecting the price of the products,in violation of the cartwright act bus,et.rambus acts,omissions,misrepresentations,practices and nondisclosures also constituted unlawful,unfair,and fraudulent business practices in violation of the unfair competition law bus,et.lastly,the complaint alleges that rambus actions caused it to be unjustly enriched.
holiday alleges that it and members of its class were damaged by rambus conduct in that they paid supracompetitive prices for products,computers that incorporated dram technology.the royalties unlawfully charged by rambus to dram manufacturers were passed along to consumers,holiday and members of its class.
procedural history 
holiday filed its initial complaint on march.on september,the trial court sustained rambus demurrer to each cause of action with leave to amend.thereafter,holiday filed its first amended complaint.the court sustained rambus demurrer to this amended pleading with leave to amend on december.

the court entered a judgment of dismissal pursuant to the stipulation of the parties on april.holiday filed timely its notice of appeal on june.
discussion 
standard of review.
the function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of the complaint as a matter of law,and it raises only a question of law.see code civ,schmidt foundation health th,d.on a question of law,we apply a de novo standard of review on appeal.vallejo development beck development th,d.
a general demurrer is appropriate where the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.code civ,subd.e.although privilege is typically asserted as an affirmative defense,it may be raised by general demurrer where the existence of privilege appears from the face of the complaint.pavlovsky board of trade d.
a demurrer is likewise appropriate where the complaint on its face discloses that t he court has no jurisdiction of the subject matter of the cause of action.code civ,subd.a.such a demurrer is functionally similar to a demurrer for failure to state a cause of action,and therefore is deemed a general demurrer.citation.weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group,citing buss martin d.
we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.blank kirwan cal d,quoting serrano priest cal d.the trial court construction of the pleadings is not binding upon us we determine independently whether the complaint states a cause of action.schmidt foundation health,supra,th at,d.

ii.issues raised on appeal.
rambus challenged the sufficiency of the complaint both below and on appeal on several grounds.first,rambus asserted that each cause of action was demurrable under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,because the court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action.rambus contended that the three claims were barred because they each necessarily required resolution of a substantial issue of patent law over which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.
second,rambus claimed that the absolute litigation privilege under civil code section,subdivision b,barred each of holiday claims.rambus argued that all conduct alleged in the complaint to have been,prosecution of baseless litigation against dram manufacturers and threatening such subject to the litigation privilege.
third,rambus demurrer challenged the claims on the basis that they were barred under the doctrine.rambus claimed that this reasons parallel to those asserted in connection with the litigation as a bar to the alleged actionable conduct of threatening to file,and the filing of,infringement suits.
fourth,rambus contended that the complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action,under code of civil procedure section,subdivision e.rambus asserted that,for a variety of reasons,holiday pleading was insufficient to state claims for violation of the cartwright act,violation of the unfair competition law,and for unjust enrichment.
the court below expressly did not reach the issue of subject matter jurisdiction.since the question of subject matter jurisdiction,however,is a threshold matter that we must address whenever it is raised see consolidated theatres,theatrical stage employees union cal d,we will consider first whether the action is maintainable in state court.as we will explain,the claims alleged in the complaint present substantial issues of patent law that invoke exclusive federal jurisdiction.since we conclude that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint and that,hence,the demurrer was properly sustained,we do not reach the merits of the remaining challenges to the complaint.
iii.exclusive federal jurisdiction.
applicable law.
the district courts of the united states shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to patents,such jurisdiction shall be exclusive of the courts of the states in patent cases.a section a.such federal question jurisdiction extend s only to those cases in which a complaint establishes either that federal patent law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal patent law,in that patent law is a necessary element of one of the claims.christianson colt industries operating,d christianson see also holmes group,vornado air circulation systems,d.
under this complaint rule,the court determines whether a claim arises under patent law from what necessarily appears in the plaintiff statement of his own claim in the bill or declaration,unaided by anything alleged in anticipation or avoidance of defenses which it is thought the defendant may interpose.franchise tax board of california construction laborers vacation trust,d quoting taylor anderson.citation.thus,a case raising a federal defense does not,for that reason alone,arise under patent law.christianson,supra,at.further,federal jurisdiction under section a is not established where a claim is supported by alternative theories,unless patent law is essential to each of those theories.christianson,at.
