plaintiffs ryan walsh walsh and kevin miller miller,on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated,appeal from an order decertifying one of several subclasses in their class action against respondent ikon office solutions,ikon.appellants contend the order is erroneous because it fails to identify sufficiently the court reasons for decertification and the evidence does not support the trial court conclusion and ikon motion was untimely and procedurally defective in its failure to comply with local rules of the san francisco superior court.
we affirm the order.in the published portion of our opinion,we rule that the trial court used proper criteria and sufficiently set forth its reasons for decertification,and that substantial evidence supports the court order.in the unpublished portion of the opinion,we conclude that appellants procedural objections to the decertification motion are without merit.
facts and procedural history 
respondent ikon provides document copy services to attorneys through its legal document services lds division.ikon account managers service the lds customers.appellants walsh and miller are alleged to be former ikon account managers.
according to ikon policies,as well as in practice,the account managers are responsible for direct sales as potential customers,making sales presentations,and taking orders for well as activities such as transporting documents from customers to ikon reproduction facilities,the copies,correcting reproduction errors,advising customers of the status of their copy jobs,and delivering the copies to the customer.
appellants class action 
appellant walsh and another former ikon employee filed this action in their individual capacities,and on behalf of ikon employees see code civ,and the general public see bus,alleging that ikon had violated california wage and hour laws.according to the april amended complaint,ikon required certain employees to work in excess of eight hours per day,and in excess of hours per week,without paying overtime wages as required by the labor code and applicable industrial welfare commission orders in addition,it was alleged,ikon failed to compensate employees for work without meal and break periods,unlawfully deducted costs and expenses from wages,and failed to pay commission wages.based on these statutory violations,ikon allegedly perpetrated unlawful,unfair,and fraudulent business practices bus,and was liable for civil penalties under labor code section.
order granting class certification 
on november,walsh filed a motion for class certification,identifying the class as persons employed by ikon between march,and the present.five subclasses were proposed,the fourth of which is most important for purposes of this appeal california employees paid overtime wages,hourly rate pay,and other compensation in a single pay period california employees for whom a dso adjustment reduced commission wages california employees subject to business expense reimbursement limits and business expense deductions from payroll checks ikon lds account managers employed in california between march,to the present and ikon sales representatives who procured equipment service agreements in effect upon termination of ikon copy management program cmp on or about which remained in effect after march.
as to the fourth subclass defined as ikon lds account managers employed in california between march,to the present account manager subclass,walsh noted that ikon classified the account managers as exempt from overtime wage laws under the outside salesperson exemption.see,industrial welfare commission wage order,subds.c,m hereafter iwc wage order,codified at,tit,subds.c,m outside salesperson is one who works more than half of his or her working time away from the employer place of business in sales activity.walsh asserted,however,that ikon based this classification on federal rather than california law,without observing the actual work the account managers performed.further,walsh argued,the account managers in the account manager subclass were misclassified because they spent more than half of their worktime on non exempt activities,rather than on sales activity germane to the outside salesperson exemption.in support of this argument,declarations from putative class members averred that all account managers engaged in the same nonexempt work activities for more than percent of their worktime.pursuant to ikon policies,those activities include picking up and delivering documents and materials from customers to be copied at the ikon plant quality checking orders before return to ikon customers correcting errors discovered when documents are returned to customers and advising ikon customers regarding the status of pending reproduction jobs.walsh asserted that the uniform nature of the account managers job descriptions and actual work meant that common questions of law and fact predominated over individual issues,thus warranting class certification.see generally code civ.
on february,judge mcbride certified the class with the requested subclasses,including the account manager subclass.
c.the second amended complaint 
appellants second amended complaint was filed in march,after appellant miller had been added as a named party and class representative.the second amended complaint sought relief on behalf of the class certified by the court,including the account manager subclass,based on the same six causes of action asserted in the first amended complaint,including the claim that ikon failed to pay overtime wages.
ikon answer and affirmative defenses 
on april,ikon filed its answer to appellants second amended complaint,asserting among other things that members of the account manager subclass were exempt from overtime laws under the outside salesperson and commission sales exemptions.as its ninth affirmative defense,ikon alleged plaintiffs complaint is barred because any failure of defendant to pay overtime was not unlawful,unfair or fraudulent.at all times relevant and material herein,the parties to this action either were outside salespersons commissioned employees exempt from sic california labor code and the industrial welfare commission wage order overtime compensation requirements.
case management conference and discovery 
ikon decertification motion and order decertifying subclass 
on november,ikon filed a motion to decertify the account manager subclass,contending inter alia that common questions of law and fact did not predominate over individual issues,because whether subclass members were exempt from overtime wage law based in part on the outside salesperson exemption required individualized analysis of each subclass member work circumstances.in support of its motion,ikon submitted as evidence excerpts from depositions of numerous current or former ikon employees,which demonstrated,in ikon view,that variations in the manner in which account managers performed their duties during the class period required individual proof and demonstrated a lack of commonality requisite for class certification.ikon scheduled the decertification motions for hearing on december,the date set for the hearing on ikon two motions for summary adjudication.
by ex parte application on november,appellants sought an order striking ikon motion for decertification,on the grounds that the motion inter alia was filed days after the november,stipulated filing deadline failed to provide days notice of hearing san francisco superior court class action manual sfcam,rule and failed to include an affidavit identifying newly discovered facts or explaining why the evidence was not available at the certification hearing sfcam,rule.
the record contains no order expressly ruling on appellants ex parte application,but the hearing on ikon decertification motion went forward as scheduled on december,before judge ballati.by written order on january,the trial court decertified the account manager subclass with the following explanation common issues of law and fact do not predominate in this matter with respect to the lds account manager class,as the circumstances of each class member employment differs significantly from every other member of the class.as a result,individual hearings on both liability and damages are required for each of the or so class members,as well as the two class representatives,walsh and miller.in these circumstances,and on the evidence presented in support of and in opposition to the motion,the court concludes that common issues of law or fact do not predominate.
ii.discussion 
appellants contend that the order decertifying the account manager subclass failed to explain in detail why decertification was appropriate the evidence did not support the conclusion that common issues of fact and law do not predominate and ikon decertification motion was untimely and did not comply with sfcam,rules,and.ikon disagrees with these contentions and further asserts that the appeal should be dismissed,because the decertification order is not directly appealable.we address the last issue first.then,after revisiting basic principles of class certification,we consider each of appellants contentions.
appealability and jurisdiction 
an order denying a class certification motion in its entirety,and preserving only a claim for damages for the individual plaintiff,is tantamount to a dismissal of the action as to all members of the class other than plaintiff.daar yellow cab cal d,daar.thus,an order denying class certification has the legal effect of a final which an appeal it virtually demolishes the action as a class action.see linder thrifty oil cal th,d,order denying certification to an entire class is an appealable order linder.by the same logic,an order de certifying a class would be directly appealable if it virtually demolishes the action as a class action.daar,supra,at.
an order denying certification is not directly appealable,however,if it does not dispose of the class claims in their entirety.thus,an order of partial decertification may not be appealable.green obledo cal d,fn,green see vasquez superior court cal d,order dismissing one class cause of action and leaving another intact must be reviewed by writ of mandate vasquez.in green,for example,there was significant overlap between the portion of the class that was decertified and the rest of the class that remained in the case,such that they were not separate and distinct.green,supra,at,fn.accordingly,the order of partial decertification was not tantamount to a dismissal of the action as to all members of the class and was not immediately appealable.ibid.
in the matter before us,the order of partial decertification,from which walsh and miller filed their notice of appeal,stated plaintiffs lds account manager class allegations are hereby dismissed without prejudice to the claims of the individual members of the class,including the two class representatives.in ikon view,this order decertified the class action as it pertained to the cause of action for unpaid overtime,but members of the account manager subclass remained in the case as members of the business expense reimbursement subclass,which went to trial in march,and as members of the dso and deductions classes,whose claims were settled.ikon urges there was significant overlap between the account manager subclass that was decertified and the subclasses that remained certified and,as in green and vasquez,the order did not entirely dispose of the class claims.furthermore,ikon contends,permitting piecemeal appeals of certification orders would cause undue delay and expense.
appellants counter that the claims presented by the account manager subclass were separate and distinct whether or not the members of the subclass had other claims as members of other subclasses,because no other subclass sought recovery for overtime compensation.the decertification order ended the action as to all the claims of the account manager subclass,even though it did not necessarily end the case in its entirety for account manager subclass members who were members of another subclass.
in the end,we need not decide whether the decertification order itself was an appealable order,since walsh and miller not only filed a notice of appeal from that order,but also filed a notice of appeal from the final judgment.if in fact the decertification order was immediately appealable,appellants notice of appeal from that order was timely.if the decertification order was not immediately appealable,and an appeal could be taken only from the subsequent judgment,appellants filed a protective notice of appeal from the judgment on september.a modified judgment was entered in august appellants filed a timely notice of appeal from the modified judgment on october.therefore,whether the decertification order was immediately appealable or not,appellants have preserved their right of review and this court has jurisdiction.because the issues raised by appellants have been fully briefed by the parties in this appeal,and the appeal from the judgment appeal no.is only in its early stages,we proceed to address appellants contentions at this time in the interest of judicial efficiency.
legal principles pertaining to class certification 
code of civil procedure section authorizes class actions when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court.to maintain a class action,the class proponent must demonstrate that there is an ascertainable,manageable class of plaintiffs and a community of interest among class members,such that litigating the controversy as a class action would be a superior method of resolving the dispute and of substantial benefit to the litigants and the court.daar,supra,cal d at,see washington mutual bank superior court cal th,d,proponent of class has the burden to prove the elements for class treatment.the community of interest requirement is established if common issues of law or fact predominate over issues unique to individual class members the class representatives have claims typical of the class and the class representatives will adequately present the class.richmond dart industries,cal d.of these three requirements,the parties to this appeal address only the element of commonality.
in examining whether common issues of law or fact predominate,the court must consider the plaintiff legal theory of liability.drug stores,superior court cal th,d.the affirmative defenses of the defendant must also be considered,because a defendant may defeat class certification by showing that an affirmative defense would raise issues specific to each potential class member and that the issues presented by that defense predominate over common issues.gerhard stephens cal d,kennedy baxter healthcare th,d.
here,appellants contend that the account managers were entitled to overtime pay under labor code section,and that ikon misclassified them as exempt from this overtime requirement as an affirmative defense,ikon contends that the subclass members were exempt from overtime laws under the outside sales person exemption,which may apply to employees who spend more than half their time outside the office on sales activity.ramirez yosemite water cal th,d,ramirez.therefore,the question is whether common questions of law and fact do not predominate,such that class treatment is inappropriate,because determining whether the outside salesperson exemption applied to members of the account manager subclass would require individualized examination of the circumstances of the account managers activities 
we review a trial court ruling on class certification for abuse of discretion,supra,cal th at,d.because of the great discretion afforded the trial court in this context,we will not reverse the court ruling,if supported by substantial evidence,unless improper criteria were used citation or erroneous legal assumptions were made,supra,at,d.we turn to appellants contentions that the trial court employed improper criteria and that the court conclusion was not supported by substantial evidence.
c.the court used proper criteria in decertifying the account manager subclass 
the proper legal criterion for deciding whether to certify or decertify a class is simply whether the class meets the requirements for class certification.see,supra,cal th at,d.as a general matter,this pertains to the fundamental question whether the class action proceeding is superior to alternate means for a fair and efficient adjudication of the litigation.ibid.more particularly,whether common questions of law and fact predominate constitutes a proper criterion for certifying or decertifying a class.ferdinand roten galleries,d.decertification of class was based on proper criterion where the court determined there was a lack of commonality.
in the matter before us,the trial court expressly granted ikon decertification motion on the ground of insufficient commonality.the court explained common issues of law and fact do not predominate in this matter with respect to the lds account manager class,as the circumstances of each class member employment differs significantly from every other member of the class.as a result,individual hearings on both liability and damages are required for each of the or so class members,as well as the two class representatives,walsh and miller.in these circumstances,and on the evidence presented in support of and in opposition to the motion,the court concludes that common issues of law or fact do not predominate.the court implicitly concluded that this lack of commonality prevented class treatment from being a superior means of adjudicating the claims of the account manager subclass.the decertification order was based on proper criteria,supra,cal th at,d,supra,d at.
appellants complain that the trial court did not identify the reasons for its conclusion that commonality was lacking,such as the particular circumstances that were different among class members and the legal criteria that rendered these differences material.appellants insist that this detailed explanation is necessary,relying on the following quotation,which they represent can be found in,supra,d.simply stating,without explanation of any kind,that common issues of fact did not predominate does not suffice.a trial court must state the reasons for its conclusion.the failure to do so denies plaintiff a right to review the legal assumptions or criteria applied by the trial court.the quotation does not appear anywhere in.
in fact,demonstrates that appellants position is not meritorious.the court in stated although the trial court did not state its reasons for the decertification order,it is clear from the record that the dispute over class treatment turned on the issue of commonality of interest in law and fact.defendants moving papers focused on the assertion that defendants liability to each unnamed plaintiff would have to be individually litigated in various respects.in light of the arguments in defendants motion papers,it is clear that the trial court decertification order was based on insufficient commonality to justify class treatment,supra,d at,italics added.
in the matter before us,the trial court did not explain at length why it concluded there was a lack of commonality.linder,supra,cal th at,d,describing the specific reasons trial court found class certification inappropriate.however,it did refer to different employment circumstances among the subclass members,stating that the circumstances of each class member employment differs significantly from every other member of the class,that individual hearings on both liability and damages are required for each of the or so members of the subclass,and that common issues of law and fact do not predominate.the court also stated that it had read and considered the papers submitted in support of and in opposition to the motion and heard and considered the oral arguments of counsel,which included substantial discussion of commonality with respect to the outside salesperson exemption.in context,the trial court explanation was not so vague that we are unable to determine whether substantial evidence supports the decision.appellants challenge to the order on this ground is unavailing.see,supra,cal th at,d,rejecting argument that trial court failed to explain basis for finding of commonality,where the court had examined the parties contentions at the hearing and noted its reliance on the moving papers and admissible evidence.
substantial evidence supports the court finding of lack of commonality 
we next consider whether the trial court the commonality requisite for class treatment was supported by substantial evidence.the first part of our discussion focuses on ikon evidence that the varying circumstances of each subclass member employment rendered determination of the outside salespersons exemption dependent on individualized proof,which we conclude provides substantial evidence for the court ruling.the second part of our analysis explains why appellants contentions to the contrary are not persuasive.
evidence of lack of commonality 
ikon classified all members of the account manager subclass under the outside salesperson exemption,alleged this exemption as an affirmative defense,and relied upon it in arguing that common questions of law and fact do not predominate 
the outside salesperson exemption is set forth in labor code section,which states the provisions of this chapter including labor code section shall apply to and include men,women and minors employed in any occupation,trade,or industry,whether compensation is measured by time,piece,or otherwise,but shall not include any individual employed as an outside salesman italics added.iwc wage order,subdivision m,defines an outside salesperson as a ny person,years of age or over,who customarily and regularly works more than half the working time away from the employer place of business selling tangible or intangible items or obtaining orders or contracts for products,services or use of facilities.italics added.the outside salesperson exemption turns on how the employee actually spends his or her time as well as the employer realistic expectations of the job and the extent to which the employee diverges from them.ramirez,supra,cal th at,d.
ikon submitted evidence that the account manager positions were designed to be,and class members expected them to be,outside sales positions.such evidence demonstrated that ikon pays the account managers a commission on their transactions and measures their performance based on sales quotas and the account manager satisfaction of specific sales activity requirements,including the number of cold calls,client visits,and contacts,as well as sales revenue.indeed,ikon characterizes all the things that the account manager does,including the five core tasks appellants contend are non exempt activities common to all account managers,as part of the sales process.
employer job descriptions and expectations alone,however,do not necessarily establish the outside salesperson exemption.ramirez,supra,cal th at,d,supra,cal th at,d.moreover,since the job descriptions were common to all account manager subclass members,that evidence does not advance ikon contention that commonality is lacking.see,supra,at,d,under the facts presented,considerations such as the employer realistic expectations of the employee work and the actual requirements of the job were likely susceptible of common proof.
the lack of commonality is suggested,however,in the manner and extent these common functions were actually performed by the account managers.ikon presented evidence,from deposition testimony of appellant miller and others,that the performance of these tasks varied significantly from individual to individual and from office to office,based on the account manager territory,number of customers and job orders,support from customer service representatives csr,and the personal approach of each account manager to the job and customers.for example,miller testified that the way he performed his job varied dramatically in the two offices in which he worked and that his work varied depending on the number and type of customers,the customer volume of business,and the number of csr available to him.further,miller noted,the number of csr varied among account managers,he did not know and could not say how other account managers performed their jobs,and each account manager would have to be asked individually.
other evidence supported ikon contention of a variation in work performance among account managers.ikon submitted declarations and deposition testimony indicating that account managers differed in the amount of time they spent outside the office,which is relevant because the outside salesperson exemption requires that the employee spend more than half of his or her work time outside the workplace.according to this evidence,many account managers spent more than percent of their working time outside the office,while some spent percent or less of their working time outside the office.moreover,the outside salesperson exemption requires that the employee time outside the office be spent on activity,and in this regard there was variance among subclass members as well some spent considerable amounts of time engaged in sales activities,some spent a moderate amount of time,and some spent minimal time 
there was also variance among subclass members in the amount of time spent on separate sales appointments,the time spent managing or overseeing the copying production process and checking the quality of the product,and the number of orders the account managers received.there was variance in whether the account manager had an assigned csr,which affected the amount of time an account manager could spend on direct sales activities.
lastly,there was variance in the extent to which account managers used and as sales opportunities.for example,miller spent most of his time on a combination of,delivery,and other outside activities,but he did not consider and deliveries to constitute sales activity.other class members performed and treated the and deliveries differently,the way ikon conceptualized it,as part of sales work.leamer,for instance,testified that his and delivery of customer documents was,for him,a sales opportunity.
these variations among account managers are material to deciding whether each subclass member was properly classified under the outside salesperson exemption the time they spent outside the office in sales,whether outside activities such as and were used as part of their selling activities,and factors such as orders,csr,sales appointments,and other individual circumstances would affect whether any particular subclass member did,in fact,customarily and regularly spend over percent of his or her time outside the office on sales activity.iwc wage order,subd.m see nordquist broadcasting th,d whether an employee is exempt is a factual question ramirez,supra,cal th at,d,meaning of term outside salesperson is question of law,but what work the employee actually performs is a question of fact.
our supreme court in ramirez anticipated that the adjudication of the outside salesperson exemption could result in this very type of individualized factual examination if a salesperson must travel one hour to destination a in order to attempt a sale,then surely the most reasonable interpretation of wage order is to count the hour of travel time as time spent selling.but if,as in the present case,an employee travels to a destination to engage in both sales and nonsales activities,the travel time must be apportioned among the two types of activities for purposes of determining the total amount of time spent doing sales and nonsales work.ramirez,supra,cal th at,d.further,the court admonished,the trial court must neither look solely to the employer job description,nor solely to the hours worked in sales activity which might be reduced by the employee own substandard performance,but inquire into the realistic requirements of the job including not only how the employee spends his or her time but also whether the employee practice diverges from the employer realistic expectations and realistic views of the employee performance.id.at,d.
in the final analysis,there was a sufficient evidentiary basis from which the trial court could reasonably infer that commonality was lacking due to the differences in the subclass members work circumstances and how they approached their jobs,such that each individual subclass member would have to establish entitlement to damages liability as well as the amount of damages.the court conclusion that there was insufficient commonality to warrant certification of the account manager subclass was therefore supported by substantial evidence and was not an abuse of discretion.
appellants contentions regarding the outside salesperson exemption 
appellants dispute this conclusion with four arguments.none compels reversal.
appellants contend that the decision in,supra,cal th,d,held that the existence of factors relevant to proving the outside salesperson exemption under ramirez did not preclude class certification.we disagree.
in,the defendant had classified the plaintiffs as salaried managers,purportedly exempt from the overtime wage laws,supra,cal th at,d.in seeking certification of the class,plaintiffs argued that class members had been misclassified based on their job title and job descriptions,without reference to their actual work.when their actual work was considered,evidence suggested that class members generally performed non exempt work more than half of their workdays.id.at,d.opposing certification,the defendant contended that whether any individual member of the class is exempt from the overtime requirements turned on the tasks performed and the time actually spent on those tasks,both of which varied among the class members.ibid.the trial court granted the certification motion,finding that common questions of law and fact predominated.ibid.upon review by our supreme court,the court decided that substantial evidence supported the conclusions that deliberate misclassification was defendant policy and practice and that classification based on job descriptions alone resulted in widespread de facto misclassification.id.at,d.emphasizing the great deference given to a trial court certification order,our supreme court ruled that the court had not abused its discretion in certifying the class.id.at,d.
appellants here,arguing that our supreme court rejected the idea that the individualized proof referenced in ramirez could preclude class certification,point us to several passages in including the following presence in a particular overtime class action of the considerations reviewed in ramirez does not necessarily preclude class certification.any dispute over how the employee actually spends his or her time citation omitted,of course,has the potential to generate individual issues.but considerations such as the employer realistic expectations citation omitted and the actual overall requirements of the job citation omitted are likely to prove susceptible of common proof,supra,cal th at,d.
contrary to appellants suggestion,this passage does not compel reversal of the trial court decision.we do not conclude that merely by raising the outside salesperson exemption,ikon necessarily insulated itself from class certification.rather,the record suggests that the dispute over how the employee actually spends his or her time does generate individual issues which,in the trial court estimation,rendered commonality so lacking as to destroy the justification for class treatment of appellants claims,supra,cal th at,d.it was within the trial court discretion to determine whether this lack of commonality rendered class certification inappropriate.
appellants reference to the following language in is similarly unavailing contrary to defendant implication,our observation in ramirez that whether the employee is an outside salesperson depends first and foremost,on how the employee actually spends his or her time citation omitted did not create or imply a requirement that courts assess an employer affirmative exemption defense against every class member claim before certifying an overtime class action,supra,cal th at,d.
here again,the point was that defendants could not preclude certification per se merely because there were factual circumstances that might require individual proof the court did not strip the trial court of its discretion to conclude that,in light of the factual variations among individual employees,the class action device would not be a superior mec
