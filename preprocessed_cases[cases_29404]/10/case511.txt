opinion of the court 
we remanded this case to the district court for determination of whether chase national manhattan bank chase,as custodian,had established excusable neglect for late filing of documents confirming its right to participate in the distribution of a fund created to settle a class action.in re cendant.prides,cir chase i.after reconsideration,the district court adhered to its previous ruling rejecting the applicability of excusable neglect.we will reverse and remand with directions to allow the claims.
the case is based on securities act violations with respect to cendant corporation convertible securities called prides.as we observed in one of the numerous opinions in this complex litigation it is basically undisputed that cendant employees committed fraud.in re cendant,cir.
chase i reviewed the issues here in some detail,but we will only summarize the principal points that are relevant to this appeal.chase,custodian for three mutual income builder,income fund of america,and capital world growth and income,filed proofs of claim for each entity against the settlement fund of.capital income claim was income fund,and world growth.
at the request of valley forge administrative services,the claims administrator,chase provided additional information in august with respect to income fund and world growth.although the cures were eight days late,valley forge approved them.no information was supplied,however,in connection with the capital income claim,and valley forge rejected it on august.
in september,cendant moved to dismiss all late cured claims,including income fund and world growth.in october,the district court granted a four day extension of the deadline for curing claims as originally set,but stated that it would accept no excuses for tardiness that were filed with the court after september.
in january,the district court rejected the income fund and world growth claims because they had failed to file excuses for their untimely filing of cures.in april,chase,invoking federal rule of civil procedure b,sought allowance of all three claims,including that of capital income.the district court denied the request and chase appealed.we concluded that the district court had failed to consider matters that might have constituted a basis for establishing excusable neglect and remanded for further proceedings.
in accordance with our instructions,the district court reconsidered chase rule b motion.after permitting limited discovery and hearing oral argument,the court again denied the motion.chase has appealed.
as chase i made clear,the proper standard to be applied in determining whether tardy claims were entitled to share in the settlement proceeds is excusable neglect.chase i,at.the inquiry,essentially equitable,requires consideration of the entire situation.pioneer inv.servs.brunswick,d.pioneer set out four factors to be considered prejudice to the adverse party length of the delay and its potential impact on the judicial proceedings reason for the delay,including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant and whether the movant acted in good faith.id.
with these general principles as the backdrop,we will review the district court rulings on remand as to the respective claims under the abuse of discretion standard.ahmed dragovich,cir.because of a difference in material facts,we will discuss the capital income claim after we have first considered the other two.
many of the surrounding matters are in dispute,but the controlling circumstances with respect to income fund and world growth are definitive enough to reach a conclusion on the proper disposition.the crucial chronology follows.valley forge sent separate letters dated july,to income fund and world growth and a duplicate one to income fund dated july.the letters requested further information about the previously submitted proofs of claim.chase responded by fax on august,although this was late as per the terms of the settlement agreement and court order 
the district court found that after receiving the faxed responses,valley forge approved those two claims.this finding appears to be based on the unchallenged affidavit submitted by collins,a chase employee who telephoned valley forge after sending the fax on august.she averred that she was told that the income fund and world growth claims were now in order.she had also given chase fax and telephone numbers to valley forge on that occasion.
substantial dispute exists with respect to two other mailings allegedly sent by valley forge.one letter dated august,reminded chase of the necessity for information to cure the proofs of claim.two form letters,dated august,and addressed to claimant rather than chase,stated that the cures were late,but that valley forge and class counsel nevertheless believed the claims should be accepted as valid.however,the letters urged the claimant to write to the court explaining why the cures were tardy.
the district court,relying on the presumption of mailing and delivery,found that the notices of august,had been received,despite chase denial of receipt.finding that cendant had not been prejudiced and chase rule b motion had been brought within a reasonable time,the court,however,refused to modify its january,order denying the income fund and world growth claims.
the parties devoted much of their argument before the district court on remand and on this appeal discussing whether the august,claimant letters had been received by chase.we conclude,however,that that issue is a distraction and is not material to a determination of whether the delay in filing income fund and world growth cures falls within the ambit of excusable neglect 
as stated in chase i,cendant could not establish prejudice.the district court had earlier reached that same conclusion in granting the grace period for filing the cures,explaining that the limits of cendant financial obligations,have not been expanded.in re cendant.prides,at.we agreed that,the only prejudice cendant would suffer by being forced to pay chase is the loss of a windfall.chase i,at.
on remand,the district court also concluded that chase delay in filing its rule b motion was reasonable and had no actual negative impact on the judicial proceedings.notwithstanding the findings favorable to chase,the judge criticized it for lack of diligence following disallowance of the income fund and world growth claims in the january,order and further commented that chase conduct indicated a lack of good faith in the claims process.
in its defense,chase pointed out that cendant motion in september to disallow these two claims along with those of other parties was served on only class counsel who failed to notify the claimants.moreover,in a brief submitted in response to cendant motion,class counsel had suggested that all late cures,including chase,be considered timely if filed by august.
in response to the district court limitation of excuses to those submitted before september,class counsel filed a brief that listed extenuating circumstances for some claimants,but proffered nothing with respect to income fund and world growth.
although chase lack of diligence in following the progress of the court proceedings is far from commendable,it did not amount to a lack of good faith.certainly,chase could assume that during the period in question,class counsel was looking after the interests of the funds as well as the other class members.
but most critical on remand was the district court failure to consider the length of the delay in sending the cure information to valley days.as we commented in a companion case,we agree with the prides class that the district court need not have scrutinized claims meeting that extended date september,with the same exactitude as those claims missing even that deadline.in re cendant.prides,cir.in another prides case.in re cendant.prides,cir santander,we characterized the delay of five days,or three business days,in filing the initial proof of claim by another claimant in this same litigation as trivial.
in the case now before us,we conclude that the delay in filing the cures by income fund and world growth was trivial as well.indeed,the justi
