the issues on appeal are whether the arbitration provisions in defendant service agreements with two of its customers are enforceable under washington state law and,if not,whether the state law is preempted by the federal arbitration act faa.after two consumers of cellular phone service brought a class action against in state court for breach of contract and violation of the washington consumer protection act the cpa,removed the case to federal district court and moved to compel arbitration per its service agreements.the district court denied motion to compel arbitration,holding that the arbitration agreements were tainted by substantive unconscionability and thus were unenforceable.we conclude that the washington state supreme court decision in scott cingular wireless,establishes that arbitration provision is substantively unconscionable and unenforceable under washington state law,and that there is no federal preemption in light of our decision in shroyer new cingular wireless,cir.we therefore affirm.
the two named plaintiffs,kathleen lowden and john mahowald,are or were customers whose service agreements contained mandatory arbitration provisions with slightly varying terms.plaintiffs sued,alleging that the service provider had improperly charged them for certain fees beyond the advertised price of service,charged them for calls during a billing period other than that in which the calls were made,and charged them for roaming and other services that should have been free.moved to compel arbitration in accord with the arbitration provisions in lowden and mahowald service agreements.
in lowden service agreement immediately above the signature line,the following provision appeared disputes are subject to mandatory arbitration pursuant to paragraph.see reverse.paragraph stated 
mandatory arbitration.any controversy,claim or dispute between you and company arising under this agreement,excluding actions by company to collect unpaid charges,shall be submitted to final,binding arbitration under the auspices of the american arbitration association aaa pursuant to its published wireless industry arbitration rules,incorporated herein by this reference and available by calling the aaa at or visiting its web site at.notice of an arbitration commenced by you shall be served on company registered agent.all claims shall be arbitrated individually and you agree that no person shall bring a punitive sic or certified class action to arbitration or seek to consolidate or bring previously consolidated claims in arbitration.the arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive damages.you acknowledge that this arbitration provision constitutes a waiver of any right to a jury trial.
those provisions were also in the terms conditions that accompanied the phone delivered to lowden and that stated that,by activating service with company,you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the terms of this agreement.asserts that,had lowden or her disagreed with those terms,they could have canceled service and thereby avoided arbitration.
the service agreement in effect when mahowald signed up with was slightly different in substance.while containing an almost identical provision above the signature line,the provision on the reverse stated 
mandatory arbitration dispute resolution.any claim or dispute between you and arising under or in any way related to or concerning the agreement,our provision to you of goods,service,or units,shall be submitted to final,binding arbitration with the american arbitration association aaa pursuant to its published wireless industry association rules,incorporated herein by this reference and available by calling the aaa at or visiting its website at.any arbitration proceeding shall be subject to the choice of law provision in paragraph.notice of an arbitration commenced by you must be served on our registered agent.no party may act as a representative of other claimants or potential claimants in any dispute,and two or more individuals disputes may not be consolidated or otherwise determined in one proceeding.
an arbitrator may not award relief in excess of or inconsistent with the provisions of the agreement,order consolidation or arbitration on a class wide basis,or award lost profits,punitive,incidental,or consequential damages or any other damages other than the prevailing party direct damages,except that the arbitrator may order injunctive or declaratory relief pursuant to applicable law.all administrative expenses of an arbitration will be equally divided between you and us,except that if the claim is less that,you will be obligated to pay only.if the claim is less than,we will pay all administrative expenses.each party agrees to pay the fees and costs of its own counsel,experts,and witnesses at arbitration.subject to the foregoing limitations on consolidated or classwide proceedings,you agree,however,that if you fail to timely pay amounts due,we may assign your account for collection and the collection agency may pursue such claims in court limited strictly to the collection of the past due debt and any interest or cost of collection permitted by law or the agreement.
you acknowledge and agree that this arbitration provision constitutes a waiver of any right to lost profits,punitive,special,indirect,incidental,consequential or treble damages disclaimed damages,a jury trial,or participation as a plaintiff or as a class member in a class action.if for any reason this arbitration clause is deemed inapplicable or invalid,you and we both waive any claims to recover disclaimed damages and any right to pursue,or participate as a plaintiff or a class member in,claims on a classwide,consolidated,or representative basis.
as in lowden case,the terms conditions accompanying the phones delivered to mahowald contained the same arbitration provision,along with a similar warning that service activation constituted an agreement to be bound thereby.
relying on those arbitration provisions,brought its motion to compel individual arbitration.the district court denied the motion,holding that arbitration provisions were tainted by substantive unconscionability and were therefore unenforceable.
the district court first determined that each named plaintiff had an agreement.then,after dismissing plaintiffs argument that the agreements as a whole were procedurally unconscionable,the court assessed the agreements for substantive unconscionability.the court preliminarily noted that the washington state supreme court was considering scott,which,the court stated,places squarely at issue the question of whether class action prohibitions contained in arbitration agreements are unconscionable under washington law and therefore unenforceable.however,at the urging of the parties to decide the issue nonetheless,the district court declined to stay its ruling pending scott.the district court next turned to the unconscionability of each contested provision within the two arbitration agreements.
the district court held that the prohibition on class relief and the limitation on punitive damages,found in both agreements,were each substantively unconscionable.the district court also concluded that mahowald attorney fees provision was substantively unconscionable.although the court rejected the arguments that the remaining provisions were invalid,it nonetheless declared both arbitration agreements to be unenforceable,despite the severability provisions,because they were tainted with substantive unconscionability.the district court denied motion to compel arbitration and entered a stay so that could bring the present interlocutory appeal.we have jurisdiction of this appeal pursuant to a a and b.
