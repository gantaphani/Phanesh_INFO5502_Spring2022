leslie morgan kenneth stacker,and theodore boldin,black managers at united parcel service ups,brought a civil rights action alleging individual and class claims of employment discrimination under title vii and.these individuals moved for class certification and the district court partially granted the motion,certifying four classes of employees collectively,plaintiffs.ups moved for summary judgment on both the title vii and the class claims or to decertify the class.plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on their class claims of racially discriminatory pay.the district court denied plaintiffs motion,granted summary judgment to ups,and denied ups motion to decertify the class.it held that plaintiffs had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of a pattern or practice of discrimination.we affirm.
factual background 
ups delivers packages for individuals and businesses.ups is divided into eleven geographic regions in the united states,each with a regional manager.a region is subdivided into approximately six districts,each with a district manager.the district managers are responsible for nearly every aspect of district operations,including picking up,sorting,and delivering packages,as well as employee development,promotion,and compensation.there are between sixty and seventy districts in the united states and each one varies in geographic size,population density,package volume,and labor climate.a district is further divided into divisions,each with a division manager.divisions are organized along functional lines with some related to package operations and some related to supporting staff.
two levels of managerial employees exist below the division level supervisors and center managers.the entry level managerial position is a supervisor who reports to the center manager.the center manager reports to the division manager,the division manager to the district manager,and the district manager to the regional manager.
ups vests decisionmaking authority in district managers to promote employees to division manager,center manager,and supervisor.district managers hold people meetings approximately twice a year,where they discuss the upward mobility of management personnel.at these meetings,information is presented on supervisors and center managers in the district,and their performance and readiness for promotion are assessed.at some of the meetings,a color photograph of the individual is displayed.the meeting produces a list of the employees who the district managers believe are ready for promotion to managerial positions.open positions within the company are not posted.the district manager may consult the list compiled at the meetings to determine who will receive a promotion.
ii.procedural background 
plaintiffs are all ups center managers and they allege that ups racially discriminated against them in terms of upward mobility,working conditions,and pay.with regard to the claim,plaintiffs argue that the subjective selection process for managerial positions at ups limits the promotion of blacks,which,in turn,inhibits their overall upward mobility and causes them to peak in their careers at or below the level.
the district court bifurcated the trial into a phase,followed by a phase.four classes were certified under federal rule of civil procedure b for the first phase.the court said it would consider certifying the damages phase as a rule b class action if liability was established.
the title vii class was defined as 
a ll black salaried employees of ups nationwide employed as center managers in operations package,hub,feeder,air or human resources at any time between december,and the date of judgment,and who worked as a supervisory or managerial employee of ups for at least five years without being promoted above the center manager level.
the title vii and class was defined as 
a ll black salaried employees of ups nationwide employed as center managers in operations package,hub,feeder,air or human resources at any time between december,and the date of judgment.
the class was defined as 
a ll black salaried employees of ups nationwide employed as center managers in operations package,hub,feeder,air or human resources at any time on or after june,and the date of judgment,and who worked as a supervisory or managerial employee of ups for at least eight years without being promoted above the center manager level.
the and class was defined as 
a ll black salaried employees of ups nationwide employed as center managers in operations package,hub,feeder,air or human resources at any time on or after november,and the date of the judgment.
the district court granted a motion by the eeoc to intervene,but the eeoc is not involved in these appeals.at the time of the original class certification,charles cartwright was a member of at least two certified classes.after modification of the certified classes,the district court ruled that he no longer qualified as a member of any of the four classes and thus vacated the order allowing him to intervene.frank jackson was also denied intervenor status.both cartwright and jackson appeal those decisions.brian needham,francis truitt,and bedell finley also sought,but were denied,intervenor status however,they are not parties to this appeal 
discovery proceedings produced reports,statistical analyses,and models of ups employment data and practices prepared by experts for all parties.plaintiffs presented two experts who conducted statistical analyses weiner and stapleton.and the defendant offered statistical analyses conducted by its expert,evans.at the close of discovery,ups moved for summary judgment on all class claims or to decertify the classes.plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on their class claim of discriminatory pay.ups also moved to bar the testimony of two of plaintiffs experts as inadmissible under federal rule of evidence and daubert merrell dow,d,because of faulty methodology and data.the district court granted ups summary judgment on all class claims and denied plaintiffs summary judgment motion.the court also denied as moot ups motions to decertify the class and to bar plaintiffs expert testimony.
iii.discussion 
plaintiffs claim the district court erred in granting ups summary judgment motion on each of the three class claims denial of overall upward mobility,working conditions,and pay.
we review de novo a grant of summary judgment to determine whether a claim is factually supported.jackson.dep t of,cir.summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we must view all facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and give the nonmoving party the benefit of all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from those facts.widoe dist.otoe county,cir.however,t he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff position will be insufficient there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.anderson liberty lobby,d.therefore,in a motion for summary judgment,t he judge inquiry unavoidably asks whether reasonable jurors could find by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict.id.
plaintiffs case centers on discriminatory treatment in the form of unequal working conditions,promotions,and pay.more specifically,this class action alleges a pattern or practice of discrimination with regard to each of these three aspects of employment.in a class action,the class must prove that the defendant regularly and purposefully treated members of the protected group less favorably and that unlawful discrimination was the employer regular procedure or policy.eeoc mcdonnell douglas,cir quoting int l of teamsters united states,d.stated differently,the class must prove that the discrimination was the company standard operating regular rather than the unusual practice.craik.state,cir quoting teamsters,at.upon an employer summary judgment motion,the plaintiff class must adduce some evidence from which this conclusion can be drawn.proving discrimination that is isolated or sporadic is insufficient.mcdonnell douglas,at quoting cooper federal reserve bank,d.
typically in a case like this one,plaintiffs will offer statistical evidence of disparities between protected and unprotected employees who are otherwise similarly situated.craik,at.in defense,employers attempt to show that the plaintiffs proof is either inaccurate or insignificant.id.quoting teamsters,at.to be legally sufficient,the plaintiffs statistical evidence must show a disparity of treatment,eliminate the most common nondiscriminatory explanations of the disparity,and thus permit the inference that,absent other explanation,the disparity more likely than not resulted from illegal discrimination.hervey little rock,cir quotation omitted.the question in this case is whether plaintiffs produced more than a scintilla of evidence showing ups engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination with regard to the class members.the typical mcdonnell douglas framework,while not irrelevant,is not tremendously helpful in this context.craik,at.
upward mobility 
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to ups on the claims.plaintiffs contend they proved discrimination in upward mobility under both and models.like the district court,we conclude plaintiffs have failed to establish a prima facie case because their evidence of racial disparities was insufficient,giving rise to no inference of discrimination.
initially,plaintiffs offered a wilcoxon test performed by weiner.plaintiffs argue this test showed that it took longer for black center managers to be promoted to their first job than it did for white center managers.however,ups experts pointed out,and weiner admitted,that she did not perform the correct wilcoxon test.when weiner used the correct test,she determined that there was no racial disparity in the pattern of these promotions.
next,plaintiffs offered evidence that in of ups districts,there were no blacks promoted to division manager between and.the district court pointed out two problems with this analysis.first,this tally did not take into account whether there were any qualified black employees available for promotion in those districts.ups expert,evans,performed an analysis taking the availability of qualified black employees into account and determined that the number of districts in which no blacks were promoted was actually lower than would be expected.second,even a successful showing of discrimination in some districts does not prove nationwide discrimination.in fact,as the district court pointed out,proof of discrimination in some districts and not others tends to defeat the argument that discrimination was ups nationwide standard operating procedure.
in addition,plaintiffs presented charts comparing the representation of blacks at the level to the percentage of all black officials and managers,operatives and laborers,blue collar workers,and the total ups workforce.the district court properly found that a racial disparity amongst these populations would not give rise to an inference of discrimination.the proper comparison is between the racial composition of the jobs and the racial composition of the qualified population in the relevant labor market.wards cove packing atonio,d quoting hazelwood sch.dist.united states,d alterations in original.s tatistics based on an applicant pool containing individuals lacking minimal qualifications for the job would be of little probative value.watson fort worth bank trust,d.the classes consist of center managers who have not been promoted to division manager.thus,the probative inquiry involves a comparison between the percentage of division managers who are black and the percentage of qualified employees who are black in the population from which division managers are chosen.as the district court held,plaintiff reliance on a bottom line racial imbalance in the workforce is insufficient to establish that blacks are less likely to be promoted.morgan ups,mem.order at.june.
finally,weiner presented a cohort analysis suggesting it takes black employees significantly longer to be promoted from their first supervisor position to division manager than it takes similarly situated white employees.however,weiner admitted that the data she looked at is not appropriate for examining the time to promotion from center manager to division level manager,id.at,and center managers are the class of employees at issue.ups expert,evans,performed an analysis on the correct set of promotions and concluded that it actually takes whites longer than blacks to get promoted from center manager to division manager.
plaintiffs proof is insufficient under both the and models.to avoid summary judgment under the model through the use of statistics,plaintiffs must show that w hen the proper labor market is considered,the statistical evidence is sufficient to raise an inference of discrimination.paxton union bank,cir.as discussed above,weiner correct wilcoxon test showed no racial disparity,and her other analyses do not take into account the proper labor qualified employees.thus,the claim fails under the model.
and,to the extent plaintiffs raise a claim they have failed to show relevant statistical disparities permitting an inference of racial imbalance in defendant workforce.emanuel marsh,cir.the relevant inquiry was whether promotions from center to division manager were racially discriminatory,taking into account the proper pool of available qualified employees.the evidence presented of overall racial imbalances and even more general trends in upward mobility is insufficient.plaintiffs did not adduce sufficient evidence to avoid summary judgment.
working conditions 
the district court ruled that plaintiffs presented insufficient evidence to prove a claim of unequal working conditions.plaintiffs argue that the district court erred because ups did not move for summary judgment on working conditions,and plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment.
ups motion for summary judgment was sufficient.ups moved for summary judgment on class plaintiffs amended and supplemental complaint,which encompassed claims of unequal working conditions.ups also specifically mentioned working conditions in its motion and asked the court to strike those class claims as unsupported.plaintiffs were aware that the claim was at issue because in their response to the summary judgment motion they discussed evidence and cited the record on the issue.we therefore agree with the district court that ups moved for summary judgment on this claim.
we also agree that plaintiffs proof on the working conditions was insufficient to survive summary judgment.while plaintiffs correctly note that statistical evidence is not required to prove discrimination,catlett.highway transp.comm n,cir,the anecdotal evidence here is not enough to support their claims.plaintiffs evidence consists of statements by individual class members made in response to interrogatories,unsigned by the class members.the district court did not err in finding this evidence insufficient.the grant of summary judgment for ups on the claim is therefore affirmed.
plaintiffs argue that ups was not entitled to summary judgment on the discriminatory pay claim.they contend that they presented sufficient evidence of a pattern or practice of discrimination with regard to pay in the form of two multiple regression analyses.they say that those analyses give rise to a reasonable inference of discrimination because they show ups paid white center managers more than black center managers after controlling for many legitimate reasons for such a pay disparity.
a multiple regression analysis attempts to reveal relationships between explanatory variables and a dependent variable.daniel rubinfeld,reference guide on multiple regression,in federal judicial center,reference manual on scientific evidence ed.explanatory variables are the expected influences on the dependent variable.id.in this case,pay is the dependent variable.the explanatory variables are what bring race into the picture.in effect,the regression controls for the explanatory factors that one would expect to influence then compares the wages of white and black employees.at best,the regression equation used to assess discrimination in compensation levels can be viewed as a good representation,based on available information,of what factors seem to be related to compensation levels,on average.ramona paetzold steven willborn,the statistics of discrimination using statistical evidence in discrimination cases.thus,the selection of explanatory variables is quite important.however,even the best regression equation can not directly show discrimination because it can not prove causation.the most it can show is a correlation that can give rise to an inference of discrimination.id.rubinfeld,ante,at.whether such an inference is reasonable is the legal question we address.
all three experts performed regression analyses,and all agreed that this form of statistical analysis was proper.but the experts came to different conclusions because each of them included different explanatory variables.plaintiffs first expert,weiner,found a statistically significant pay disparity of between and per year.she included two years of measured performance pay region,and time as a supervisor as explanatory variables.plaintiffs other expert,stapleton,found a statistically significant pay disparity of between and per year.he included two years of measured performance,geographic district,tenure with ups,time as a center manager,and whether the employee was currently in human resources,air operations,or package operations.
ups expert evans preferred method found statistically significant pay differentials in each year except,for which he found no statistically significant difference in pay.this analysis was achieved using as variables union tenure,supervisor tenure,supervisor tenure,center manager tenure,an indicator for having previously been a division manager and others for having been in air operations or having been a package operations supervisor,indicators for the various districts,and current and past performance.evans concluded that his study demonstrated there was no statistically significant difference in pay between black and white center managers during the class period.he reasoned that was the only year for which he could do a proper analysis,because it was the only year for which there was sufficient measured performance data.in other years,he said,the analysis incorrectly indicated a disparity because insufficient measured performance data existed.evans admitted that when no performance data was included,a statistically significant pay disparity existed.
because the only evidence that substantiates plaintiffs claim is their regression analyses,and because this sort of evidence is subject to daubert,two issues arise admissibility and the propriety of summary judgment.if the analyses were not admissible,then summary judgment was appropriate.if the analyses were admissible,summary judgment may or may not be appropriate,depending on whether they create a reasonable inference of a pattern or practice of disparate pay.
it is not clear whether the district court deemed plaintiffs regressions inadmissible or concluded that they did not create a genuine issue of fact.the district court found that the variables are properly included in evans analysis.morgan,mem.order at.and it concluded,defendants have shown that any pay disparity between black and white center managers is caused by factors other than race.id.at.
we defer to admissibility determinations under an standard of review,even at summary judgment.joiner,d.the district court did not mention daubert,but its analysis plainly hinges on problems with plaintiffs analyses that are arguably explanatory variables are proper.daubert,at.stating that admissibility determinations entail a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue accord eckelkamp beste,cir applying deferential review to evidentiary determination plainly premised on the methodological underpinnings of an expert opinion.but because the district court denied ups motions relating to daubert and rule as moot we are not inclined to accord the trial court decision that degree of deference.moreover,the question of what explanatory variables should be included in a particular regression normally affect s the analysis probativeness,not its admissibility.bazemore friday,d.
while the omission of variables from a regression analysis may render the analysis less probative than it otherwise might be,it can hardly be said,absent some other infirmity,that an analysis which accounts for the major factors must be considered unacceptable as evidence of discrimination.
i t is clear that a regression analysis that includes less than all measurable variables may serve to prove a plaintiff case.
id.at.quotation omitted.
admissible regressions,however,do not necessarily mean summary judgment is inappropriate.see daubert,at.i n the event the trial court concludes that the scintilla of evidence presented supporting a position is insufficient to allow a reasonable juror to conclude that the position more likely than not is true,the court remains free to grant summary judgment.while a trial court may not weigh the evidence or consider credibility at summary judgment,anderson,at,it can use the scale to a limited degree it must ensure that the nonmoving party has at least a scintilla of evidence in support of its position.in so doing,the court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.reeves sanderson plumbing,d accord carter chrysler,cir.
g ross statistical disparities alone may in a proper case constitute prima facie proof of a pattern or practice of discrimination.hazelwood sch.dist.united states,d.and the usefulness of statistics depends on all of the surrounding facts and circumstances.teamsters,at.here,the regression analyses are all the evidence of discriminatory pay that plaintiffs have,so those analyses must show a gross statistical disparity and this must be a proper case in which the gross disparity can give rise to a reasonable inference that paying blacks less because they are black is ups standard operating procedure.
a reasonable inference of such discrimination does not arise in this case.first,plaintiffs regressions fail to take into account past pay,performance,or both.second,when evaluated in the context of the undisputed facts,the regressions fail to create a triable case of discrimination.
evaluating the propriety of explanatory variables is a somewhat comparative exercise.when a defendant attacks a plaintiff regression,he must typically do more than point out the flaws in his opponent analysis.instead,the defendant must show that the omission had an impact on the result.see catlett,at but,there may be a few instances in which the relevance of a factor is so obvious that the defendants,by merely pointing out its omission,can defeat the inference of discrimination created by the plaintiffs statistics.palmer shultz.
selecting proper explanatory variables is a function of the particular employer compensation determinations.under ups pay scheme,pay has two components base pay and salary increases.a center manager base pay is determined when he becomes a center manager,subject to later salary increases based on performance.an individual base pay remains constant during his tenure as a center manager.base pay is calculated in part by using the individual prior pay,generally as a supervisor.supervisor pay has the same two pay at the time of promotion and salary increases based on performance during one tenure as a supervisor.supervisor base pay is calculated using that individual prior hourly wage.individuals in certain operations,air operations are paid more as a part of their job thus,their hourly rate,and supervisor and base pay are higher.union membership could have a similar effect.
the discrimination alleged in this claim is that black center managers,between and the time of judgment,were paid less than similarly
