we have consolidated for decision a number of appeals from orders by the district court approving a settlement of class action litigation,denying petitions to intervene,and awarding attorneys fees.federal rule of civil procedure e requires court approval of any settlement that effects the dismissal of a class action.before such a settlement may be approved,the district court must determine that a class action settlement is fair,adequate,and reasonable,and not a product of collusion.joel giuliani,cir.the principal issue presented by these appeals is whether the district judge discharged the judicial duty to protect the members of a class in class action litigation from lawyers for the class who may,in derogation of their professional and fiduciary obligations,place their pecuniary ahead of that of the class.this problem,repeatedly remarked by judges and scholars,see,culver city of milwaukee,cir greisz household bank illinois,cir rand monsanto,cir duhaime john hancock mutual life ins,cir john coffee,class action accountability reconciling exit,voice,and loyalty in representative litigation,colum,david shapiro,class actions the class as party and client,notre dame,and,requires district judges to exercise the highest degree of vigilance in scrutinizing proposed settlements of class actions.we and other courts have gone so far as to term the district judge in the settlement phase of a class action suit a fiduciary of the class,who is subject therefore to the high duty of care that the law requires of fiduciaries.culver city of milwaukee,supra,at stewart general motors,cir in re cendant.litigation,cir grant bethlehem steel,cir.
we do not know whether the million settlement that the district judge approved is a reasonable amount given the risk and likely return to the class of continued litigation we do not have sufficient information to make a judgment on that question.what we do know is that,as in such cases as in re general motors.engine interchange litigation,cir ficalora lockheed california,cir per curiam holmes continental can,cir,and pettway american cast iron pipe,cir,the judge did not give the issue of the settlement adequacy the care that it deserved.
this litigation arose out of refund anticipation loans made jointly by the two principal defendants,beneficial national bank and h r block,the tax preparer.when h r block files a refund claim with the internal revenue service on behalf of one of its customers,the customer can expect to receive the refund within a few weeks unless the irs decides to scrutinize the return for one reason or another.but even a few weeks is too long for the most necessitous taxpayers,and so beneficial through block offers to lend the customer the amount of the refund for the period between the filing of the claim and the receipt of the refund.the annual interest rate on such a loan will often exceed a quarter of the refund,even though the loan may be outstanding for only a few days.block arranges the loan but beneficial puts up the money for it.not disclosed to the customer is the fact that beneficial pays block a fee for arranging the loan and also that block owns part of the loan.
beginning in,more than twenty class actions were brought against the defendants on behalf of the refund anticipation borrowers.the suits charged a variety of violations of state and federal laws and also breach of fiduciary duty under state law.some of the alleged violations appear to be technical.the most damaging charge appears to be that block customers are led to believe that block is acting as their agent or fiduciary,much as if they had hired a lawyer or accountant to prepare their income tax returns,as affluent people do,whereas block is,without disclosure to them,engaged in.
most of the suits failed on one ground or another none has resulted in a final judgment against beneficial or block.but in the late several withstood motions to dismiss or motions for summary judgment,and at least one,a texas suit,was slated for trial.
on september,two lawyers who had prosecuted two of the unsuccessful class actions,howard prossnitz and francine schwartz,had lunch in chicago with burt rublin,who was and remains beneficial lead lawyer in defending against the avalanche.prossnitz and schwartz brought with them to the lunch another lawyer,daniel harris.although neither prossnitz nor schwartz,nor their friend harris,had a pending suit against beneficial or against block,which was not represented at the lunch,they discussed a global ral settlement with rublin.it is doubtful whether prossnitz or schwartz even had a client at this time and certainly harris did not.schwartz later bought a client from another lawyer,to whom she promised a referral fee.the necessity for such a transaction,when the class contains million members,eludes our understanding.
in the hearing before the district judge on the adequacy of the settlement the fairness hearing,as it is called,harris testified that at the lunch rublin threw out a number,for purposes of illustration,of or million.the judge described this testimony which he elsewhere describes as harris believes he heard rublin say the case was worth or million,though it is vociferously denied by rublin,as credible.there was,however,no actual settlement negotiation at the lunch.
prossnitz,schwartz,and harris,all solo practitioners,brought a substantial law firm,miller faucher and cafferty llp,into the picture.in april of the following year the foursome filed two class action suits against beneficial similar to the others that had been filed and that were those that had flopped wending their way through the courts of various states.one of the two suits filed also named as defendants h r block and three affiliated block entities,but three of those,including block itself,were voluntarily dismissed from the suit by the plaintiffs in october and the fourth was dismissed in february.shortly after the suits were filed,harris made a settlement offer to beneficial that was rejected,but after a hiatus negotiations began.block was included in the settlement negotiations,despite the fact that there were by then no claims pending against it.it was included because beneficial was reluctant to settle without block,having promised to indemnify it for any liability resulting from block role in beneficial refund anticipation loans.
in october of,a class jointly represented by the three solo practitioners and the miller firm we call these the settlement class lawyers,plus beneficial and block,entered into a settlement agreement which they submitted to the district court for its approval.the agreement contemplated the filing of an amended complaint naming h r block as a defendant,and by its terms covered claims against five block entities,of which four were the entities originally named but subsequently dismissed as defendants in one of the two original class action complaints.the agreement defined the class as all persons who had obtained refund anticipation loans from beneficial between january,and october,and provided for the release of all claims arising out of or in any way relating to the tax refund anticipation loans rals,sometimes erroneously referred to as rapid refunds obtained by the class at any time up to and through that date.the defendants agreed to create a fund of million against which members of the class could file a claim not to exceed.any money left in the fund after the expiration of the period for filing claims was to revert to the defendants,who also agreed to injunctive relief in the form of certain required disclosures to future customers,primarily of the financial arrangements between beneficial and block,and to bear the cost of notice to class members and of the class counsel legal fees out of their own pockets rather than out of the settlement fund.one ral class action,the basile suit pending in the pennsylvania courts,was excluded from the agreement,apparently because block thought it could get the supreme court of that state to reverse a lower court decision that had gone against the company.beneficial and block agreed to split the expense of the settlement.
the district judge approved the settlement except for the reversion and the cap,which at his insistence the parties raised to for those members of the class apparently the vast majority who had received two or more tax refund anticipation loans from block.with these changes the settlement was approved and notices mailed to million of whom ignored them several million of the notices,moreover,were undeliverable,presumably because the addressees had moved and left no forwarding address.only million of the recipients filed claims,which would be enough,however,to exhaust the settlement fund.only about of the recipients opted out of the class action so that they could seek additional relief against the defendants.
incidentally,there is an unremarked conflict of interest within the class,between those class members who took out one or two refund anticipation loans and those who took out more than two and thus will receive no compensation for the additional damages that they incurred.conflicts of interest can create serious problems for class action settlements,see,amchem products,windsor,d retired chicago police ass city of chicago,cir,and require the creation of separately represented subclasses.but in light of the modesty of the stakes even of class members who had multiple refund anticipation loans and the expense of subdividing the class and how many subdivisions would be necessary to reflect the full range of damages,we are not disposed to regard this particular defect in the settlement as fatal.
in finding that million was an adequate settlement,the judge relied in part on an unsworn report by james adler,an accountant who purported to estimate the damages caused by the defendants alleged violations of law.he was not deposed or subjected to and the judge did not discuss the adequacy of his methodology.adler came up with a figure of million,but it is unclear whether this was intended to be an estimate of the entire damages that the class might hope to recover if the case was tried and went to judgment and what legal assumptions underpinned the estimates.
the various objectors to the settlement,primarily intervening or intervening plaintiffs who have claims that the settlement will release,contend that the settlement agreement is the product of a reverse auction,the practice whereby the defendant in a series of class actions picks the most ineffectual class lawyers to negotiate a settlement with in the hope that the district court will approve a weak settlement that will preclude other claims against the defendant.blyden mancusi,cir coffee,supra,at samuel issacharoff,governance and legitimacy in the law of class actions,marcel kahan linda silberman,the inadequate search for adequacy in class actions a critique of epstein mca,john coffee,class wars the dilemma of the mass tort class action,colum.the ineffectual lawyers are happy to sell out a class they anyway ca do much for in exchange for generous attorneys fees,and the defendants are happy to pay generous attorneys fees since all they care about is the bottom sum of the settlement and the attorneys not the allocation of money between the two categories of expense.the defendants agreed to pay attorneys fees in this case,to the three solo practitioners and the law firm that negotiated the settlement,of up to million.
although there is no proof that the settlement was actually collusive in the sense,the circumstances demanded closer scrutiny than the district judge gave it.he painted with too broad a brush,substituting intuition for the evidence and careful analysis that a case of this magnitude,and a settlement proposal of such questionable antecedents and circumstances,required.the initial agreement submitted for the judge approval,remember,had provided for a reversion and also capped each class member recovery at.if the parties had an inkling that only million class members would file claims,they were agreeing to a settlement worth only million,and probably less for if million class members filed claims capped at,fewer would have filed claims capped at.yet according to a credibility determination by the district judge that we are not in a position to second guess,two and half years earlier,before ral plaintiffs began having some success in the courts,beneficial counsel had indicated that to million were ballpark figures for a settlement with beneficial alone.beneficial share of a million settlement in which block was a codefendant would be only million remember that beneficial and block agreed to split the cost of the settlement yet that is the settlement the lawyers for the settlement class agreed to,plus injunctive relief the value of which no one has attempted to monetize and which is barely discussed in the briefs or by the judge.the injunctive relief signally does not include a requirement that h r block disclose its interest in beneficial refund anticipation loans.
moreover,h r block appears to have faced substantial exposure in a texas class action in which it was accused of breach of fiduciary obligations to its customers.the class in that suit was seeking disgorgement of all the fees paid to block by the banks that made refund anticipation loans through it.the class argued that such a forfeiture was mandatory if block was found to have violated its fiduciary duties.disgorgement was also sought of all other fees that block had received in connection with each ral transaction that is,the and fees that block had charged its ral customers to file their taxes for form of relief that the class claimed was within the trial court equitable discretion.the total amount sought could have reached billion.the class had been certified,the case was proceeding in the texas courts,and the theory of liability and damages could not be dismissed as frivolous indeed,the case had been set for trial.even if the class had only a percent chance of prevailing,the expected value of its suit might reach million.this is on the unrealistic assumption that the only possible outcomes were a billion judgment and a zero judgment.realistic intermediate possibilities would make the million estimate expand.
remarkably in view of the progress and promise of the texas suit relative to the efforts of the settlement class counsel,the district judge enjoined the texas suit on the authority of the all writs act,a,reasoning that the suit might upend the settlement.in re vms securities litigation,cir in re agent orange product liability litigation,cir in re single premium deferred annuities ins.litigation,cir.the effect of the injunction is that the settlement release,if upheld,would release the claims in the texas suit.for this release of potentially substantial claims against h r block the settlement class received no consideration.in fact the settlement class received no consideration for the release of any claims against block.the only effect of bringing block into the settlement was to allow beneficial to cut its own expense of the settlement in half.the lawyers for the settlement class were richly rewarded for negotiations that greatly diminished the cost of settlement to beneficial from the level that it had considered to be in the ballpark years earlier when the cases were running more in its favor than when the settlement agreement was negotiated.in effect,the settlement values the texas and all other claims against block at zero.
the district judge enjoined the lawyers for the texas class from notifying the members of that class of the status of the texas litigation to assist them in deciding whether to opt out of the settlement that the settlement class counsel had negotiated with beneficial and block and continue to litigate in the texas courts.the judge should not have done this,especially since opting out was likely to be the sensible course of action given the ungenerosity of the settlement to the texas class.a pattern of withholding information likely to undermine the settlement emerged when,after approving the settlement,the district judge encouraged the solo practitioners to submit their fee applications in camera,lest the paucity of the time they had devoted to the case for which the judge awarded them more than million in attorneys fees be use
