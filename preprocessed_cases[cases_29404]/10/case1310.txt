linda kildare kildare,jonean daniel daniel,tyrone bozman bozman,edgar copeland copeland,donald furr furr,christopher boyko boyko and harvey winfield winfield,collectively appellants,appeal the district court dismissal of their class action suit alleging that california state officials systematically disregard federal regulations when they initially evaluate applications for social security disability insurance ssdi and supplemental security income ssi,and that the social security administration ssa fails to exercise adequate oversight over the state officials.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
background 
appellants filed this action in the district court on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated against two sets of defendants acting in their official capacities the united states commissioner commissioner,regional commissioner,assistant regional commissioner of the ssa,and the manager for the center for disability of the ssa,collectively federal defendants and the director of the california department of social services and the deputy director of its disability adult programs division dapd,collectively state defendants.
statutory and regulatory framework 
the federal government provides disability benefits under two programs administered by the ssa.bowen city of new york,d.title ii ssdi of the social security act act,et,provides benefits to persons with mental or physical disabilities,and title xvi ssi of the act,et,provides benefits to indigent persons with disabilities.state agencies,acting under the authority of the commissioner,make the initial determination of whether an individual is disabled for purposes of receiving benefits.city of new york,at.
federal regulations regulations prescribe a sequential evaluation for making the disability determination,city of new york,at.citations omitted.the regulations have detailed rules and standards for state agencies to use in obtaining medical evidence for the initial disability determination.pts.for example,the regulations require state agencies to develop each claimant complete medical history and make every reasonable effort to obtain medical evidence from the claimant own medical sources.d,d.the regulations also contain detailed guidelines on the use of consultative examinations ces,which are physical or mental examinations requested and purchased by state agencies after determining that additional medical evidence is necessary,a,b,a,
claimants may employ a administrative review process if the state agency determines they are not disabled.pt,j pt,upon completion of the administrative review process,claimants may seek judicial review in federal district court pursuant to g 
appellants general and specific allegations 
appellants,a group of individuals with disabilities who were initially denied ssdi and ssi benefits,allege that the state defendants systematically disregard regulations governing the evaluation of medical evidence for approval of ssdi ssi claims.generally,appellants claim that the state defendants systematically fail to develop claimants medical records as required by the regulations,give insufficient weight to claimants own medical records,improperly make disability determinations on the basis of ces that frequently fail to meet federal standards,and issue denial of benefits letters without sufficient explanation for denial.appellants also claim that the federal defendants fail to adequately oversee the state defendants.
appellants specific allegations,however,reveal claims that the state defendants committed a host of individual errors in making initial disability determinations that vary with each appellant,rather than a policy of systematically disregarding the regulations.the specific allegations can be divided into nine categories that dapd did not adequately or completely develop the claimant medical history kildare,daniel,boyko,that dapd denial of benefits letters did not give a sufficient explanation for their denial kildare that dapd did not give proper weight to certain medical reports daniel,bozman that dapd did not properly consider the relationship between a claimant various disabilities daniel that dapd requested ces in contravention of the regulations,such as requesting ces on the same or following day as the application kildare,copeland,furr,winfield that the ces failed to include an explanation or discuss the evidence for their conclusion bozman,furr that dapd performed an inadequate analysis did not draw its conclusions from the facts bozman,copeland that dapd failed to explain inconsistencies between two medical reports that were admittedly in conflict furr,boyko and that dapd drew a conclusion that conflicted with certain reports and opinions without further explanation copeland,winfield.appellants also allege specific injuries to each appellant as a result of the denial of their benefits,such as subsistence on general assistance and food stamps,lack of medical insurance,and homelessness.
appellants sought declaratory relief that the state and federal defendants policies,practices,and procedures in evaluating applications violate state and federal law and the regulations,and injunctive relief requiring the state and federal defendants to apply policies and procedures in accordance with applicable law.we note with interest that six of the seven appellants have succeeded since the filing of this lawsuit in obtaining benefits through the process of administrative review.
discussion 
defendants 
appellants appeal the district court order finding that it did not have jurisdiction over appellants claims against the federal defendants based on g and mandamus 
standard of review 
we review de novo a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,including a dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and denial of mandamus.sommatino united states,cir hoeft tucson unified sch,cir exhaustion of administrative remedies vanderbilt babbitt,cir mandamus.
exhaustion of administrative remedies 
section g provides that an individual who has been denied benefits may seek judicial review of any final decision of the commissioner.a final decision has two elements presentment of the claim to the commissioner,and complete exhaustion of administrative remedies.johnson shalala,cir.the parties do not dispute that appellants met the presentment requirement,but did not exhaust their administrative remedies.appellants assert that the district court should have waived exhaustion.
following city of new york,d,we adopted a test for determining whether a particular case merits judicial waiver of g exhaustion requirement.johnson,at.the claim must be collateral to a substantive claim of entitlement collaterality,colorable in its showing that denial of relief will cause irreparable harm irreparability,and one whose resolution would not serve the purposes of exhaustion futility.id.citing briggs,at.we conclude that waiver of g exhaustion requirement is not appropriate in this case because appellants claims are not collateral to their claims for benefits,and because the purposes of exhaustion would not be served by waiver.see also heckler ringer,d where the claims for benefits are inextricably intertwined with the secretary procedures,administrative exhaustion pursuant to g must be respected.
collaterality 
in city of new york,the plaintiffs challenged a secret policy of the ssa mandating a presumption that certain mentally disabled applicants were qualified to do unskilled work,which effectively eliminated the last two steps in the disability evaluation.at.the supreme court held that t he claims are collateral to the claims for benefits that class members had presented administratively.the class members neither sought nor were awarded benefits in the district court,but rather challenged the secretary failure to follow the applicable regulations.id.at.
in johnson,the plaintiffs challenged the health and human services secretary secretary policy of treating loans as income.at.we found the claim collateral because it was not essentially a claim for benefits.id.at.moreover,we explained with regards to readjudication of claims that were denied under the loans
