factual background 
california sexually violent predators scheme 
the svp act defines an svp as a person convicted of a sexually violent offense against two or more victims for which he or she received a determinate sentence and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others,is likely to engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.cal.welf.a the department of corrections and the department of mental health evaluate convicts who committed predicate offenses at least six months before those convicts complete their sentences.see id.if those two departments agree that the convict might qualify as an svp,the district attorney or counsel for the county in which the evaluated person was convicted may file a petition for commitment.see id.i.if a jury finds someone to be an svp,that person is civilly committed for an indefinite period to commence after his criminal sentence is fulfilled.id.
once civilly committed,svps undergo a treatment program.phase one consists of group sessions that educate the svp about california svp act.during phase one,the svp must attend and participate in the treatment sessions.if he does not,his access level is reduced and he is not allowed to advance to phase two of the treatment program.in addition,an svp failure to attend or participate in treatment sessions is used against him at future probable cause and confinement hearings.the svp can not advance beyond phase one unless he signs a statement in which he acknowledges that he has an illness that requires treatment.plaintiffs allege that the signed statements are often used against them as admissions of illness in future probable cause and confinement hearings.
phases two through five of the treatment plan involve cognitive treatment.this treatment includes viewing videos that depict violent or other inappropriate sexual activities while a repugnant odor or other unpleasant sensation is applied to elicit a negative association.
each year,an svp has a right to a show cause hearing to determine whether his commitment should be continued.id.a b.if it is found that the svp continues to be a danger to the health or safety of the community,the person is committed for two years from the date of the finding.id.e.successive periods of commitment can be continued indefinitely,or until the svp completes all five phases of treatment.upon successful completion of phase five,the svp is conditionally released under the supervision of the california mental health department.according to the plaintiffs,only a handful of svps have been allowed into phase four and no svp has progressed to phase five or ha s been found to be ready for release under the treatment protocol.
b.the current lawsuit 
on september,the plaintiffs filed a pro se class action,under,against stephen mayberg director of the california department of mental health,cal terhune director of the california department of corrections,jon demorales former executive director at atascadero state hospital,grenda ernst clinical administrator at atascadero state hospital,and craig nelson senior psychologist specialist at atascadero state hospital.the plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief,as well as monetary damages,on the grounds that the policies and procedures governing their confinement and treatment at atascadero state hospital violate their constitutional rights.
in march,the district court appointed pro bono counsel for the plaintiffs.counsel filed an amended complaint approximately five months later.the defendants filed a motion to dismiss.the motion to dismiss raised eleventh amendment and qualified immunity defenses.the district court denied the motion.
the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on august,both the first and second amended complaints alleged that the defendants violated the plaintiffs rights by,inter alia the plaintiffs in situations reducing the plaintiffs access levels and other privileges as a form of punishment for refusing to participate in treatment sessions or as retaliation for filing lawsuits putting the plaintiffs in restraints for nonthreatening nondisruptive conduct,including the refusal to participate in treatment or therapy subjecting the plaintiffs to public sometimes while in restraints failing to protect the plaintiffs from abuse by other patients or by atascadero employees failing to provide the plaintiffs with constitutionally satisfactory conditions of confinement forcing the plaintiffs to participate in treatment and denying the plaintiffs adequate treatment,thereby converting the plaintiffs civil confinement to a de facto extension of their prison sentence.
the defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint,on the same grounds presented in their first motion to dismiss.the district court again denied the motion.the defendants timely appealed.the defendants contend that the district court erred by failing to rule that the eleventh amendment,state abstention doctrine,or qualified immunity barr the plaintiffs suit.
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court denial of a motion to dismiss.decker advantage fund,cir.immunity under the eleventh amendment presents a question of law,which we review de novo.see demshki monteith,cir.to determine if the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity,we review de novo whether governing law was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation and whether the specific facts alleged constitute a violation of established law.see mabe san bernardino county of pub.soc,cir.
although a district court denial of a motion under federal rule of civil procedure b is not ordinarily appealable,the denial of a claim for immunity is appealable before final judgment under the collateral order doctrine and is reviewed de novo.see morley walker,cir.all allegations of material fact are accepted as true and should be construed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.see resnick hayes,cir.a complaint should not be dismissed under rule b unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the claim that would entitle the plaintiff to relief.thompson davis,cir.
we note,again,the special difficulty of deciding the motion to dismiss a defendant on qualified immunity grounds at this stage.under the notice pleading standard of the federal rules,plaintiffs are only required to give a short and plain statement of their claims.a.thus,when reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint before receiving any evidence,our task is a limited one.the issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.scheuer rhodes,d.
as we recognized in kwai fun wong united states,cir,a motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds puts the court in the difficult position of deciding constitutional questions on a factual record.id.at.while government officials have the right to raise qualified immunity defense on a motion to dismiss,the exercise of that authority is not a wise choice in every case.id.we find that applicable here.the policy justifying qualified immunity motions at this stage is to protect officers against the burden of discovery and pretrial motions.see behrens pelletier,d.in this case,it appears that discovery was almost complete.the defendants could have presented this as a motion for summary judgment,and we would have a more developed factual record to guide our decision.however,because the defendants motion is framed as a motion to dismiss,we must evaluate the merits of the defendants qualified immunity defense before we know the full extent of the alleged abuses at atascadero,or the reason behind atascadero policy,or the level of involvement the defendants had in creating the conditions at atascadero.as we decide the defendants motion,however,we are cautious not to eviscerate the notice pleading standard in suits where qualified immunity is at issue.see galbraith county of santa clara,cir 
b.the law of the case doctrine 
the plaintiffs argue that under the law of the case doctrine,we should not reach the merits of the defendants appeal because the defendants second motion to dismiss was barred by the district court denial of the defendants first motion to dismiss.the relevant facts are as follows after the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint,the defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim and based on qualified immunity.the district court denied the motion,and the defendants did not appeal.the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint,in which they changed only the name of one of the defendants.the defendants then moved to dismiss on grounds substantially similar to those in the previous motion.the district court again denied the motion.the plaintiffs argue that the defendants second motion to dismiss is an impermissible second bite at the apple and should be dismissed under the law of the case doctrine.
under the law of the case doctrine,a court is ordinarily precluded from reexamining an issue previously decided by the same court,or a higher court,in the same case.richardson united states,cir citations omitted.for the law of the case doctrine to apply,the issue in question must have been decided explicitly or by necessary implication in the previous disposition.united states lummi indian tribe,cir quoting liberty mut.ins.eeoc,cir united states cote,cir t he law of the case acts as a bar only when the issue in question was actually considered and decided by the first court.
the district court denied both of defendants motions to dismiss in orders.thus,we do not know the district court grounds for denying the motions.nor can we say that the district court decided any issue by implication in the first order.the district court could have denied either motion for any number of procedural or technical reasons unrelated to the substance of the motions.it is possible that the district court denied the defendants second motion based on the law of the case doctrine,but,it is also possible that the district court decided,in its discretion,not to apply the law of the case doctrine due to subsequent changes in the law,or that the manifest injustice that would result given the new party to the suit.see united states alexander,cir.because we can not determine the bases for the district court denial of the motions,the law of the case does not apply.therefore,we address the appeal on the merits.
eleventh amendment immunity and the abstention doctrine 
the defendants concede that suits for injunctive or declaratory relief do not violate the eleventh amendment under ex parte young.the defendants contend,instead,that the eleventh amendment bars the plaintiffs request for monetary damages.the plaintiffs can not seek monetary damages against state officials in their official capacity.see doe lawrence livermore,cir.but,the eleventh amendment does not bar damage suits against state officials in their personal capacity.hafer melo,d ashker cal.dep t of,cir.
the plaintiffs allege the defendants acted in individual and official capacities,and therefore,the plaintiffs are suing them in both their individual and official capacities.thus we presume the plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages against the defendants in their personal capacity.see romano bible,cir stating a strong presumption in favor of a personal capacity suit where an official capacity suit for damages would be barred.accordingly,the eleventh amendment does not bar the plaintiffs claim for damages against the defendants in so far as they are being sued in their individual capacities.
the defendants also argue that they are immune because the plaintiffs are attempting to enforce pendent state law claims in federal court.the plaintiffs refer,in their first,second,and tenth claims for relief,to provisions in the california constitution that parallel applicable provisions in the united states constitution.the plaintiffs concede that they could not prevail on a claim based on a violation of state law,because,by its own terms,protects only against violations of federal law.ybarra bastian,cir.instead,the plaintiffs cite california law only where it is legitimate to do so,where there is a liberty or property interest at stake.see,paul davis,d.accordingly,the plaintiffs claims are not barred on this ground,and we need not consider the defendants arguments that the plaintiffs state law claims are novel and complex under c 
section claims 
the defendants first substantive argument is that the plaintiffs have not properly pled a claim under,because they are not proper defendants for a suit.to sustain an action under section,a plaintiff must show that the conduct complained of was committed by a person acting under color of state law and that the conduct deprived the plaintiff of a federal constitutional or statutory right.wood ostrander,cir.
all the defendants were acting under the color of california law when they engaged in the alleged unconstitutional conduct.the defendants argue,however,that their conduct did not deprive the plaintiffs of constitutional or statutory rights.
a person deprives another of a constitutional right,where that person does an affirmative act,participates in another affirmative acts,or omits to perform an act which that person is legally required to do that causes the deprivation of which complaint is made.johnson duffy,cir.indeed,the requisite causal connection can be established not only by some kind of direct personal participation in the deprivation,but also by setting in motion a series of acts by others which the actor knows or reasonably should know would cause others to inflict the constitutional injury.id.at.
in limited circumstances,a person can also be subject to liability for the acts of others.although there is no pure respondeat superior liability under,a supervisor is liable for the constitutional violations of subordinates if the supervisor participated in or directed the violations,or knew of the violations and failed to act to prevent them.taylor list,cir.
the plaintiffs proceed on two theories a that the defendants created policies and procedures that violated the plaintiffs constitutional rights and b that the defendants were willfully blind to constitutional violations committed by their subordinates.because the defendants were directors and for atascadero state hospital,the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that the constitutional violations they suffered were set in motion by the defendants policy decisions or,at the very least,that the defendants knew of these abuses and demonstrated a deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs plight.
under leer murphy,cir,the plaintiffs will need to show how the deliberate indifference or affirmative actions of each defendant caused a constitutional violation before they can seek monetary damages against any individual defendant.at this stage of pleading,however,the plaintiffs need not specifically delineate how each defendant contributed to the violation of their constitutional rights.indeed,we do not see how,prior to discovery,they could plead the individual roles of each state officer with any more specificity.taking the statements in the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,the plaintiffs may be able to state a claim against all of the named defendants,each of whom played an instrumental role in policymaking and enforcement at atascadero state hospital.therefore,we hold the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged the defendants role in the alleged constitutional violations against svps to survive this motion to dismiss.
qualified immunity 
the defendants also argued that the district court erred when it denied them qualified immunity.as the defendants have conceded,qualified immunity is only an immunity from a suit for damages,and does not provide immunity from suit for declaratory or injunctive relief.see police protective league gates,cir.the defendants argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity to the extent that the plaintiffs seek monetary damages.
in analyzing the defendants qualified immunity defense,we must determine what right has been violated whether that right was so clearly established at the time of the incident that a reasonable official would have been aware that the conduct violated constitutional bounds and whether a reasonable public official could have believed that the alleged conduct was lawful.see newell sauser,cir.
to withstand the defendants claims of qualified immunity,the plaintiffs must allege a violation of a right that was clearly established in time the alleged constitutional violations first occurred.see anderson,at.sorrels mckee,cir.to defeat qualified immunity,the right allegedly violated must be defined at the appropriate level of specificity before a court can determine if it was clearly established.wilson layne,d.
but,the plaintiffs need not establish that the defendants behavior had been previously declared unconstitutional.blueford prunty,cir.rather,if binding authority indicates that the disputed right existed,even if no case had specifically so declared,the defendants would be on notice of the right.id.at.if the occasion has not risen for our circuit to reach a question,we may draw clearly established law from other circuits.see prison legal news lehman,cir jacobs city of chicago,cir finding a violation of clearly established law where there is such a clear trend in the case law that recognition of the right is only a matter of time.
before we consider the plaintiffs claims individually to determine whether the claims were clearly established in,we address a threshold question that applies to the plaintiffs claims more generally.the defendants argue,as a broad proposition,that damages are not appropriate in this suit because the law applicable to svps is still evolving.this suit is unique,in that it is one of the first widespread class actions to challenge the conditions of detention for civilly confined svps.however,the defendants may have transgressed some clearly established boundaries.
first,civilly detained persons must be afforded more considerate treatment and conditions of confinement than criminals whose conditions of confinement are designed to punish.youngberg romeo,d see also sharp weston,cir.it follows logically,then,that the rights afforded prisoners set a floor for those that must be afforded svps,and that where the defendants violate a standard that is clearly established in the prison context,the violation is clearly established under the svp scheme,except where the california svp statutory scheme would give a reasonable official reason to believe that the body of law applicable to prisoners would not apply 
second,where there is clearly established body of law that applies to all civilly committed persons,there is no reason that the law should not apply to svps as well.for,as we have previously held 
the state can not have it both ways.if confinement of a sexually violent predator is civil for the purposes of evaluation under the ex post facto clause,that confinement is civil for the purposes of defining the rights to which the detainee is entitled while confined.civil status means civil status,with all the rights that accompany it.
jones blanas,cir.
thus,there are two bodies of law from which we might draw clearly established law for qualified immunity purposes first,where the svps claim a violation of a right that is clearly established even in the prison context,and second,where the svps claim a violation of a right that is clearly established for all civilly detained persons.
we acknowledge at the outset that it is not always clearly established how much more expansive the rights of civilly detained persons are than those of criminally detained persons.as discussed below,the rights afforded civilly detained persons are flexible enough to take into account the circumstances of detention.the law generally requires a careful balancing of the rights of individuals who are detained for treatment,not punishment,against the state interests in institutional security and the safety of those housed at the facility.see,youngberg,at.in weighing those interests,it can not be ignored that,unlike the plaintiff in youngberg who was civilly committed because of mental infirmities,svps have been civilly committed subsequent to criminal convictions and have been adjudged to pose a danger to the health and safety of others.therefore,the rights of svps may not necessarily be coexistensive with those of all other civilly detained persons 
with these threshold issues in mind,we review each of the plaintiffs claims to determine whether they have sufficiently pled a violation of clearly established rights.
first and fourteenth amendment rights 
the plaintiffs contend that the defendants retaliated against them for filing lawsuits regarding conditions at atascadero state hospital.specifically,the plaintiffs claim that,as a result of preparing this suit and others regarding conditions at atascadero,they have been subjected to reductions,harassment by atascadero personnel,and excessive room searches and seizures of property.the plaintiffs also alleged that they have been denied library access in retaliation of their bringing suit and filing complaints.
the fourteenth amendment right to access the courts survives detention.see bounds smith,d it is now established beyond doubt that prisoners have a constitutional right of access to the courts.cornett donovan,cir holding that right of access to the courts is guaranteed to people institutionalized in a state mental hospital regardless of whether they are civilly committed after criminal proceedings or civilly committed on grounds of dangerousness.similarly,punishment in retaliation for exercising one right to access the courts may constitute a first amendment violation.see rizzo dawson,cir.
we have held that the prohibition against retaliatory punishment is clearly established law in the ninth circuit,for qualified immunity purposes.pratt rowland,cir.given the facts alleged the plaintiffs may be able to prove they were punished in retaliation for exercising their first and fourteenth amendment rights to file grievances about the conditions of their confinement.accordingly,their claims should not be dismissed at the rule b stage.
the plaintiffs also allege that the defendants force them to participate in treatment that violates their first amendment rights.specifically,the plaintiffs allege that the defendants bar svps from progressing beyond phase one and obtaining higher access levels until they sign contracts admitting that they have an illness and need treatment.the decision to sign the contract is the ultimate during hearings,the contract is used against those who sign it as an admission of illness,and used against those who do not sign it as a refusal to be amenable to treatment.
the plaintiffs also allege that svps who attend but do not vocally participate in group treatment sessions are found by the defendants to be not progressing,accordingly,these svps do not advance to other phases of the program and their access levels are restricted.the plaintiffs argue that they have a first amendment right to refrain from saying that they have an illness and to refuse to participate in treatment,and that the defendants may not punish them for exercising their rights.
there may be a first amendment right not to participate in treatment,a right respected by the language of california svp act,if not in its implementation.specifically,the svp act directs 
amenability to treatment is not required for a finding that any person is a person described in section,nor is it required for treatment of that person.treatment does not mean that the treatment be successful or potentially successful,nor does it mean that the person must recognize his or her problem and willingly participate in the treatment program.
cal.welf.b emphasis added.while it may be in the plaintiffs interest to participate in treatment,and the state may create incentives to encourage such participation,t he right of freedom of thought and of religion as guaranteed by the constitution against state action includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.state bd.of educ.barnette.murphy,concurring.as is the case with prisoners,civilly committed persons retain those first amendment rights not inherently inconsistent with the circumstances of their detention.see turner safley,d.the above statutory language strongly suggests that refusal to recognize one illness or affirmatively participate in treatment is not inherently inconsistent with the purposes for which svps are detained.
granted,the plaintiffs are not actually forced to speak,but the stakes for refusing to speak are so high that the plaintiffs participation in treatment is essentially compulsory.indeed,an svp who exercised his right not to admit his illness could be detained indefinitely.he would never advance past phase one of the program and his refusal could be used against him at his hearing as a sign that he was not sufficiently rehabilitated to society.
several inmates who are criminally detained raised analogous arguments,on fifth amendment grounds,that programs that force sexual offenders to admit and discuss those offenses violate their rights against.in mckune lile,d,the supreme court held that a program did not violate an spv fifth amendment rights where it did not extend his term of incarceration or affect his eligibility for credits or parole,and the only adverse consequence was that he was moved to the less desirable area of the prison.id.at.
but mckune explicitly left open the question of whether a greater deprivation of liberty might run afoul of the constitution by essentially compelling detainees to incriminate themselves.at least one court,reading mckune,allowed an inmate to proceed past motions on first amendment grounds where the right to parole was conditioned on participation in treatment.see wolfe.dep t of,d.similarly,in this case,where the stakes for participation in treatment are so high,the deprivations involved in refusing to participate in treatment may rise to the level of compulsion that violates the first amendment.
the question at this stage,however,is not whether the right exists,but whether such a right is clearly established under the first amendment.given the volatility of the law on this point,we can not say that it is.the challenged programs are facially related to the purposes for which svps are detained,and while svps may have a right to refuse to participate in such treatment,it is not yet clear the extent to which the state can condition privileges or advancement on participation in such treatment.as such,these claims may be more appropriately considered for declaratory or injunctive relief.
thus,we hold that the plaintiffs first amendment claims were based on clearly established law insofar as they challenge retaliation for filing lawsuits.to the extent that the claim relies on a first amendment right not to participate in treatment sessions,the defendants have qualified immunity,because the law on this point is not clearly established.
fourth amendment rights 
the plaintiffs allege that defendants policies and practices subject plaintiffs to unreasonable searches,seizures,and unnecessary use of force.according to the plaintiffs,they are subjected to public strip searches,retaliatory searches of their possessions,and arbitrary seizures of their personal belongings upon arrival at atascadero.svps are also shackled during transport to atascadero and during visits with family and friends.when they refuse to participate in treatment,svps are subjected to red light alarms even when they do not pose any physical risk moreover,svps are as a means of intimidation and punishment,and for the convenience of staff.
accepting these allegations as true,the plaintiffs may be able to state a clearly established violation of their fourth amendment rights,and thus,the claims are not appropriate for dismissal at the rule b stage.the watchword of the fourth amendment in every context is reasonableness.as this court held in thompson souza,cir,the fourth amendment right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures extends to incarcerated prisoners.id.at quoting michenfelder sumner,cir.thus,this protection certainly extends to svps.
of course,the reasonableness of a particular search or seizure is determined by reference to the detention context.michenfelder,at.there are concerns that mirror those that arise in the prison context,the safety and security of guards and others in the facility,order within the facility and the efficiency of the facility operations.andrews neer,cir.but even so,qualified immunity does not protect a search or seizure that is arbitrary,retaliatory,or clearly exceeds the legitimate purpose of detention.
under this framework,we can not dismiss the plaintiffs claims.the reasonableness of a search or seizures is a inquiry that can not be determined at this stage.see,thompson,cir.it is impossible to make such a determination when the precise circumstances of the searches or seizures are not before the court and when the defendants have not yet had a chance to justify the alleged searches or seizures.we can not say,then,that the plaintiffs can not possibly state a clearly established violation based on any facts consistent with their pleadings therefore,defendants do not have a right to dismissal under rule b based on qualified immunity.
double jeopardy and ex post facto clauses 
the plaintiffs allege violations of the double jeopardy and ex post facto clauses.while the plaintiffs concede that these two clauses have punishment as an essential prerequisite and that the svp act is a civil detention statute,they claim that the svp act is punitive as applied to them.as such,the plaintiffs argue that their double jeopardy and ex post facto claims are not barred.
in upholding a law similar to california svp act,the supreme court held that a n act,found to be civil,can not be deemed punitive as applied to a single individual in violation of the double jeopardy and ex post facto clauses and provide cause for release.seling young,d.similarly,the california supreme court stressed the civil nature of a sexually violent predator commitment and rejected challenges to california svp act based on the ex post facto and double jeopardy clauses of the federal constitution.see hubbart,cal th,d.the plaintiffs claims based on the double jeopardy and ex post facto clauses of the federal constitution are foreclosed 
the plaintiffs argue that seling does not control because they are not seeking release as was the habeas petitioner in seling.this is a distinction without a difference.the court in seling made it abundantly clear that the civil nature of the svp scheme can not be altered based merely on the vagaries in implementation of the authorizing statute.id.at.accordingly,we hold that the civil nature of california svp act is not altered because of the remedy sought and we reverse the district court order denying defendants motion to dismiss the claims related to the ex post facto and double jeopardy clauses.
eighth and fourteenth amendment claims 
the plaintiffs allege in their complaint that the restrictive and denigrating conditions at the atascadero state hospital constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment.the eighth amendment has,as an essential prerequisite,the right to punish.see deshaney winnebago county of soc,d the state does not acquire the power to punish with which the eighth amendment is concerned until after it has secured a formal adjudication of guilt in accordance with due process of law.here,svps are detained for the purpose of treatment,and the state power to punish them expires at the end of their sentence.accordingly,the eighth amendment is not the proper vehicle to challenge the conditions of civil commitment.see bell wolfish,d.
the thrust of the plaintiffs claim here is that because the conditions of confinement amount to punishment,they should be permitted to argue that this punishment is cruel and unusual.once again,this punitive as applied argument is foreclosed by seling.therefore,we hold that the district court erred when it failed to dismiss the eighth amendment claim against the defendants.
of course,this is a small victory for the defendants,because the same claims for inhumane treatment and failure to protect may be raised under the fourteenth amendment.the standard applicable to svps under the fourteenth amendment is at least coextensive with that applicable to prisoners under the eighth amendment.see,munoz kolender,d,applying fourteenth amendment standards to svps because comparable standards apply to both prisoners eighth amendment cruel and unusual punishment and fourteenth amendment substantive due process analyses,with fourteenth amendment analysis borrowing from eighth amendment standards frost agnos,cir applying eighth amendment standards to evaluate pretrial detainees fourteenth amendment claims.moreover,the eighth amendment provides too little protection for those whom the state can not punish.see jones,at andrews,at.plaintiffs apparently recognize this,because their eighth amendment claims largely duplicate those raised under the substantive due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.accordingly,we consider the plaintiffs allegations that the defendants actions violate their due process rights under the fourteenth amendment.
fourteenth amendment procedural due process claims 
the plaintiffs allege a number of procedural due process violations.they allege that defendants force them to participate in the treatment program at atascadero,and based on their progression through that treatment program,subject them to privilege reductions,access level reductions,and reclassifications,and force them to take medication in situations.the plaintiffs allege that these deprivations occur without adequate notice of,or opportunity to respond to,accusations of alleged sanctionable conduct.the plaintiffs cite caselaw applicable to prisoners and argue that the procedural protections afforded to prisoners in this context should be afforded them as well.
the plaintiffs have not adequately pled the loss of clearly established due process rights.the supreme court has explained that due process claims by prisoners depend in large part on whether the prisoners have some justifiable expectation rooted in state law.montanye haymes,d see also washington harper,d.svps differ from prisoners in at least one important respect an individual who has been designated an svp has been found,under california law,to have a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others.cal.welf.a.once a jury designates someone an svp,california law requires that the svp be provided treatment for his or her diagnosed mental disorder.id.a.moreover,the svp commitment statute gives the department of mental health services the authority to forcibly medicate an svp for purposes of treatment.id.b 
the treatment program at atascadero must be consistent with current institutional standards for the treatment of sex offenders,and based on a structured treatment protocol developed by the state department of mental health.id.c.its purpose,and the purpose of the attendant changes in privileges,access level,and classification under its protocols,is not punishment,but treatment in preparation for the svp eventual release.
accordingly,the plaintiffs can not have an expectation to be free of such treatment under state svp law.the actions are,at least facially,part of the treatment plan atascadero is legally required to provide to persons that the state has deemed mentally ill.given this relevant difference between svps and prisoners,we can not say that the procedural protections provided to prisoners as they relate to forced medication and forced treatment clearly apply to svps.
moreover,there are numerous procedural safeguards afforded to an individual facing an action for civil commitment.proceedings to designate a person an svp are initiated only after a finding by two practicing psychologists or psychiatrists that the individual has a mental disorder such that he is likely to unless he receives appropriate treatment and custody.see id.d f.persons in svp proceedings have the right to counsel,the right to consult experts,the right to have the state prove their svp status beyond a reasonable doubt,and the right to a unanimous jury verdict.see id.
in addition,after initial designation,an svp is given periodic opportunities to challenge his continued need for treatment.see id.thus,svps are not subjected to atascadero treatment program without certain procedural protections,nor are they relegated to indefinite treatment without the ability to seek judicial intervention.
the plaintiffs may have liberty interests akin to those possessed by prisoners in this context,and thus may have the right to further procedural protections within the walls of atascadero.but such rights are not yet clearly established.because the plaintiffs have been designated as mentally ill and in need of treatment,a reasonable state official would have reason to believe that the law applicable to the treatment and medication of prisoners did not apply to svps.we therefore hold that defendants are entitled to qualified immunity in regards to plaintiffs procedural due process claims.accordingly,we reverse the district court holding as to the plaintiffs sixth cause of action.
fourteenth amendment substantive due process claims 
the plaintiffs contend that the defendants have violated their substantive due process rights by failing to protect them from the abuse of other detainees and employees.the plaintiffs claims can be broken down into three general categories a claims that the defendants failed to protect the plaintiffs from the abuses of other persons detained at atascadero b claims that the defendants failed to provide constitutionally adequate conditions of detention and c claims that the defendants use excessive force against them 
first,the plaintiffs claim that the defendants have turned a blind eye to the conduct of other persons detained at atascadero state hospital.specifically,the plaintiffs allege that they are intentionally exposed to feces,urine,vomit,spit,and blood in atascadero courtyards,bathrooms,hallways,dining rooms,and gymnasium,and that other detainees contaminate their food with spit and other unsanitary taint.the plaintiffs allege that they are subjected to verbal harassment,physical abuse,and sexual assaults by other patients at the hospital.they contend that they are targeted because they are sex offenders.
the patient population at atascadero state hospital comprises males who are civilly and penally committed.the individuals committed at the hospital are confined under a variety of statutes.see code covering patients not guilty by reason of insanity code covering patients incompetent to stand trial code,covering mentally disordered offenders serving their parole time cal.welf.covering mentally disordered sex offenders code covering mentally ill prisoners transferred to atascadero state hospital for psychiatric stabilization.according to the plaintiffs,their forced integration as openly labeled sexually violent predators subjects them to verbal harassment,physical abuse,and sexual assaults from the rest of the atascadero population.
the plaintiffs right to be protected and confined in a safe institution are clearly established.see youngberg,at.stating that individuals who are involuntarily civilly committed have constitutionally protected rights under the due process clause to reasonably safe conditions of confinement and freedom from unreasonable bodily restraints.the right is clearly established for civilly committed persons and prisoners alike.see farmer brennan,d neely feinstein,cir finding clearly established that patients have a constitutional right to be safe in the state institutions to which they are committed.assuming the plaintiffs can prove the allegations in their complaint and the defendants blindness to such conditions in atascadero,qualified immunity would not be appropriate on these claims.
second,the plaintiffs allege that the conditions of confinement are constitutionally they are forced to live in squalid conditions that are inhumane and pose a serious health risk.the plaintiffs have a clearly established right not to be exposed to such unsanitary conditions.see anderson county of kern,cir collecting cases in prison context youngberg,at.establishing a right to personal security for involuntarily committed persons given the plaintiffs allegations,their claims as to the unsanitary and unsafe conditions of confinement can not be dismissed under rule b.
the plaintiffs also allege several claims of excessive force,a that red light alarms are used when the plaintiffs refuse to participate in treatment,even when persons pose no threat of physical violence b that shackles are used during transportation and during visits with family and friends and,more generally,c that plaintiffs are subjected to excessive punishment and excessive use of force and physical restraints.it is that detained persons have a right to be free from excessive force.while excessive force claims by prisoners are reviewed under the eighth amendment malicious and sadistic standard,hudson mcmillian,d,the more generous fourteenth amendment standard applies to those who are civilly confined.as we previously stated 
if confinement of a sexually violent predator is civil for the purposes of evaluation under the ex post facto clause,that confinement is civil for the purposes of defining the rights to which the detainee is entitled while confined in a treatment facility.civil status means civil status,with all the fourteenth amendment rights that accompany it.
the fourteenth amendment requires that civilly committed persons not be subjected to conditions that amount to punishment,bell,at,within the bounds of professional discretion,youngberg,at.moreover,due process requires that the conditions and duration of confinement for civilly confined persons bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which persons are committed.seling,at.see also jones,at.while the nature of an svp confinement may factor in this balance of what is reasonable,it is clearly established that the substantive due process protections of the fourteenth amendment apply to svps.see andrews,at applying the fourteenth amendment objective reasonableness standard to excessive force claims brought by civilly committed svps 
we also reiterate that svps must,at a minimum,be afforded the rights afforded prisoners confined in a penal institution.thus,the eighth amendment still provides a floor for the level of protection that svps must receive under the fourteenth amendment,and because the contours of the eighth amendment are more defined,eighth amendment jurisprudence may provide helpful guidance as to the standards to be applied.under the eighth amendment,the unnecessary and wanton force standard takes into account such facts as the need for the application of force,the relationship between the need and the amount of force used,the threat perceived by the officer,any effort to temper the severity of the forceful response,and the extent of the injury inflicted,and whether the force was applied for a legitimate purpose.see hudson mcmillian,d.if plaintiffs allege conduct that sinks below protections afforded prisoners under the eighth amendment,their claim certainly states a violation of their rights under the fourteenth amendment.
the plaintiffs allege that force is used in retaliation for exercising legitimate rights and that the amount of force used is often a gross overreaction to the situation.such use of force,if proved,is not reasonable and failure to curtail such abuses can not be said to be within the defendants professional discretion.therefore,we affirm the district court denial of the motion to dismiss on these grounds.
on each of these three to protect,inadequate conditions of confinement,and excessive plaintiffs may be able to state a clearly established fourteenth amendment substantive due process violation,and we can not,at the rule b stage,dismiss these substantive due process claims.
fourteenth amendment equal protection claims 
according to the plaintiffs,they are being treated more restrictively than other civilly committed patients.they allege that their conditions are more punitive than those under which all other civilly committed persons are held.for one example,they allege that other persons are given priority in hiring for remunerative positions.
even though the plaintiffs do not constitute a suspect class,heightened scrutiny may be required where fundamental interests are at issue.see harper.state bd.of elections,d police dep t of chicago mosley,d.this court upheld application of a heightened scrutiny standard when evaluating an equal protection violation under washington state sexually violent predator statute.see young weston,cir,rev on other grounds,seling,d.while young was decided in,it rested on a firmly established principle in existence at the time of events in question that heightened scrutiny will be applied where a fundamental liberty interest is at stake.see skinner oklahoma.the plaintiffs may be able to claim violations of several clearly established fundamental rights a liberty interest in freedom from bodily restraint and personal security,youngberg,at,and a fundamental right to access the courts,as described below.accordingly,heightened scrutiny is the standard for equal protection claims implicating these fundamental rights.and the plaintiffs,in line with their allegations,may be able to show that the differential treatment between themselves and other civilly committed persons violates equal protection because such treatment does not meet heightened scrutiny.
at the same time,we can not say that it is firmly established that every condition of an svp confinement is subject to heightened scrutiny.in the prison setting,we have made clear that prison officials need latitude in deciding how to run prisons,and we have refused to subject each classification drawn by prison officials to heightened scrutiny.rather,a prisoner can not challenge the conditions of his confinement on equal protection grounds unless the discrimination against him is irrational or arbitrary.see mcginnis royster,d.that is,in so far as the plaintiffs claims rely on classifications not related to fundamental liberty interests,the defendants will have qualified immunity unless there is no rational basis for the classification.
even under the rational basis standard,we can not dismiss the plaintiffs equal protection claims at this stage.the plaintiffs pleadings raise several questionable classifications.for example,it seems arbitrary that svps should be treated more harshly than other civilly committed persons in job placement and privileges.based on the pleadings,the plaintiffs may be able to prove a violation of clearly established law congruent with the facts alleged.admittedly,at this stage,the defendants have not fully developed and presented the rationale for their actions and there may be differences between svps and other civilly committed persons that warrant differential treatment.but we leave it to the district court,on a fuller factual record,to consider whether the classifications are irrational and arbitrary.
sixth amendment right to counsel and fourteenth amendment right of access to courts 
the plaintiffs claim that they can not privately correspond with counsel,have telephone conversations with counsel,and are otherwise hindered in their ability to prepare for their probable cause and commitment hearings.
plaintiffs have a statutory right to counsel in probable cause proceedings and in commitment hearings.cal.welf,d.to protect the right to counsel,a detainee must be given a reasonable opportunity to employ and consult with counsel otherwise,the right to be heard by counsel would be of little worth.chandler fretag.while the sixth amendment,by its express language,protects those in criminal proceedings,the fourteenth amendment protects all detainees against governmental interference in their right of access to courts.see procunier martinez,d overruled on other grounds cornett donovan,cir.the right of access to courts has been found to encompass the right to talk in person and on the telephone with counsel in confidential settings,procunier,at.ching lewis,cir,and to use available law library resources,keenan hall,subject to legitimate restrictions related to the purpose and circumstances of detention,see turner,at.where such rights have been upheld in the prison context,svps must be afforded rights at least as broad.
such a fact specific inquiry can hardly be undertaken at this point,when it is not clear what the defendants have done to impede access to the courts,or why they have done so,or how the defendants actions have affected the plaintiffs right of access.nonetheless,the plaintiffs may be able to state a violation of clearly established law congruent with their allegations,and we affirm the district court order denying defendants rule b motion to dismiss as to plaintiffs tenth claim based on access to courts.
right to privacy under the fourteenth amendment 
the plaintiffs allege that the defendants policies do not allow for privacy when showering,sleeping,using the toilets,or participating in therapy sessions.it is clearly established that the fourteenth amendment protects a sphere of privacy,and the most basic subject of privacy the naked body.grummett rushen,cir.while the circumstances of institutional life demand that privacy be limited,it is clearly established that gratuitous invasions of privacy violate the fourteenth amendment.see id.again,this calls for a highly factual inquiry where the facts are not fully developed.in grummett,for example,we considered the gender of those prison officials who viewed inmates,the angle and duration of viewing,and the steps the prison had taken to minimize invasions of privacy.see id.at.such facts are simply not available to us at this stage of proceedings nonetheless,the plaintiffs may be able to state a violation of clearly established law congruent with their allegations,and as such we will not dismiss their claim under rule b.
in sum,we affirm the district court decision to deny qualified immunity on the plaintiffs first,second,seventh,eighth,ninth,and tenth causes of action to the extent noted above.we reverse in part and hold that the defendants have qualified immunity from suit on the plaintiffs ex post facto,double jeopardy,procedural due process,and eighth amendment claims.
f.the defendants belief that their conduct was lawful was not objectively reasonable 
even if the plaintiffs have alleged violations of a clearly established right,a government official is entitled to qualified immunity if he or she could have reasonably but mistakenly believed that his or her conduct did not violate a clearly established constitutional right.jackson city of bremerton,cir see also alford haner,cir.this is a limited exception,however if the law is clearly established,the immunity defense ordinarily should fail,since a reasonably competent public official should know the law governing the official conduct.harlow fitzgerald,d.
whether the defendants conduct was reasonable involves a factual analysis of the circumstances surrounding defendants actions and a determination of whether a reasonable official similarly situated would have been aware that actions violated the law,an inquiry difficult to conduct at this stage.based on the facts in front of us,however,we do not believe defendants can claim that their conduct was objectively reasonable.the defendants argue that the volatile nature of the law surrounding svps entitles them to escape liability entirely.we do not adhere to the theory that every dog is entitled to one bite.the defendants could not have been so completely unaware of the standards that would apply to their conduct as it related to svps.as explained above,svps are not entirely dissimilar from other groups of civilly committed persons.moreover,the plaintiffs complaint alleges practices that would be unconstitutional if directed at any prisoner.accordingly,defendants can not escape liability based on a reasonable but mistaken belief about the constitutionality of their conduct.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm in part and reverse in part the district court order denying the defendants second motion to dismiss under rule b.each side to bear its own costs.
my disagreement with my colleagues is limited to one critical issue.we agree that plaintiffs can not seek damages in this lawsuit against state officials in their official capacities,and that plaintiffs can not seek damages from the state either.so,what is left where the officials are concerned a lawsuit against them personally for acts and omissions alleged to have been taken in the discharge of their official duties.it is here that i part company.
the issues raised by these plaintiffs are certainly important and require our attention,but the issues can be thoroughly litigated and authoritatively decided without involving the state officials as individuals.requiring these individuals to participate in their individual capacities not only is unnecessary,but to render them personally liable for damages contravenes the very purpose of the doctrine of qualified immunity as explained by the supreme court 
p ermitting damages suits against government officials can entail substantive social costs,including the risk that fear of personal monetary liability and harassing litigation will unduly inhibit officials in the discharge of their duties.
anderson creighton,d.accordingly,the court has held that officials are immune unless the law clearly proscribed the actions they took,mitchell forsyth,d and that the unlawfulness must be apparent in the light of preexisting law.malley briggs,d.
on this record,and under these circumstances,i conclude,with all respect to my colleagues,that these officials as individuals are entitled to qualified immunity against both suit and,not later.in my view,the particulars and the contours of the alleged constitutional rights upon which the plaintiffs rely were not so clearly established at the times under scrutiny and at the level of specificity required such that a reasonable official hired by the state to cope pursuant to statutory authority with lawfully confined sexually violent predators subject to remedial treatment would have been aware that the conduct alleged violated federal constitutional bounds.given the unsettled nature of the law in this area,a reasonable official could certainly have believed otherwise.
we decide this appeal with clear analytical guidance from the supreme court 
somewhat more concretely,whether an official protected by qualified immunity may be held personally liable for an allegedly unlawful official action generally turns on the objective legal reasonableness of the action,assessed in light of the legal rules that were clearly established at the time it was taken.
the operation of this standard,however,depends substantially upon the level of generality at which the relevant legal rule is to be identified.for example,the right to due process of law is quite clearly established by the due process clause,and thus there is a sense in which any action that violates that clause no matter how unclear it may be that the particular action is a violation violates a clearly established right.much the same could be said of any other constitutional or statutory violation.but if the test of clearly established law were to be applied at this level of generality,it would bear no relationship to the objective legal reasonableness that is the touchstone of harlow.plaintiffs would be able to convert the rule of qualified immunity that our cases plainly establish into a rule of virtually unqualified liability simply by alleging violation of extremely abstract rights.harlow would be transformed from a guarantee of immunity into a rule of pleading.such an approach,in sum,would destroy the balance that our cases strike between the interests in vindication of citizens constitutional rights and in public officials effective performance of their duties,by making it impossible for officials reasonably to anticipate when their conduct may give rise to liability for damages.it should not be surprising,therefore,that our cases establish that the right the official is alleged to have violated must have been clearly established in a more particularized,and hence more relevant,sense the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.this is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful,but it is to say that in the light of law the unlawfulness must be apparent.
anderson creighton,d emphasis added alteration in original internal citations omitted.
as my colleagues acknowledge,this suit is unique,in that it is one of the first widespread class actions to challenge the conditions of detention for civilly confined svps.it is not only unique,but it requires us to answer questions never before squarely addressed in this context.this factor alone should be enough to entitle these individual defendants to dismissal.
my colleagues rely on youngberg romeo,d for the proposition that civilly detained persons must be afforded more considerate treatment and conditions of confinement than criminals whose conditions of confinement are designed to punish.this is an unremarkable quote used out of context,but it gets us nowhere in pursuit of an answer to the central question of whether we have in this lawsuit violations of clearly established rights.why because youngberg dealt with the passive confinement for their own good of mentally defective persons.in contrast,and as recently recognized by the supreme court,sexually violent predators are confined in order to protect the public from dangerous individuals with treatable as well as untreatable conditions.seling young,d.in addition,the seling court said that the case before it for decision gives us no occasion to consider how the civil nature of a confinement scheme relates to other constitutional challenges,such as due process id.at.it is little wonder,therefore,that my colleagues admit in connection with youngberg that it is not always clearly established how much more expansive the right of civilly detained persons are than those of criminally detained persons.i disagree with my colleagues claim that i t follows logically from youngberg,then,that the rights afforded prisoners set a floor for those rights that must be afforded svps,and that where defendants violate a standard that is clearly established in the prison context,the violation is clearly established under the svp scheme.certainly this logic based assertion is not a proposition clearly established and controlling at the time relevant to this lawsuit.saying that rights follow logically from one area to another is an admission that those rights have not yet been clearly established in the area to which they are being transported.prisoners have constitutional rights flowing from certain constitutional guarantees that do not apply out of the criminal context.which clearly established prisoner rights are they talking about i can not find my colleagues bold assertion anywhere in any case before this one.where is the required level of specificity required to hold these individuals personally responsible for their acts it is nowhere to be found.where is the fair warning to them as to the constitutional limits of their compulsory treatment programs expanding and extending some rights from other contexts and extrapolating others defies the salutary purpose of the doctrine of qualified immunity.
my colleagues concede that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the plaintiffs procedural due process claims under the fourteenth amendment.why because these plaintiffs are markedly different than prisoners.the plaintiffs are subject to a program mandated by state law requiring that they be treated for their diagnosed mental disorders,treatment which includes forcible medication and is subject to numerous procedural safeguards.the critical distinction recognized by my my carry over to all claims made by these plaintiffs,not just the claim to which it is selectively applied.
i find more than significant the relative newness of the civil commitment procedure at issue in this case.california sexually violent predator act was enacted in.the constitutionality of this concept was not upheld until,see kansas hendricks,d and california own courts did not begin definitively to iron out controversial statutory issues of as involuntary medication without a separate court.see in re calhoun,th,d.when did the acts complained of here occur,in the midst of grappling by appellate courts with this new modality and two years before seling.in fact,the courts have yet to clarify if and how the constitution protects sexually violent predators from various confinement and treatment modalities.context is critical to the determination of whether a constitutional right has been established.the supreme court confirmed this principle in washington harper,d,a lawsuit filed by a mentally ill state prisoner complaining against treatment with drugs against his will and without a judicial hearing.in holding that such treatment did not violate either substantive or procedural due process,the court said,the extent of a prisoner right under the clause to avoid the unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs must be defined in the context of the inmate confinement.id.at.
we read the same message in parham,d what process is constitutionally due can not be divorced from the nature of the ultimate decision that is being made.see also morrissey brewer,d d ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.
noteworthy in washington harper was a correct holding by the washington supreme court that the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.at.the case was allowed to proceed,but only to consider claims for injunctive and declaratory relief under as well as state is precisely what should happen here.it seems that we are now requiring doctors and other staff to consult not just with lawyers before they devise a procedure or treatment for a sexually violent predator,but with the courts.
the supreme court warned against this result in parham,saying,due process has never been thought to require that the neutral and detached trier of fact be law trained or a judicial or administrative officer.surely,this is the case as to medical decisions,for neither judges nor administrative hearing officers are better qualified than psychiatrists to render psychiatric judgments the mode and procedure of medical diagnostic procedures is not the business of judges.at.internal citations and quotations omitted.
the penalty for not anticipating a court ruling will be individual liability.this unfortunate situation is precisely what the doctrine of qualified immunity is designed to avoid.
it would appear that my colleagues approach to this case is at irreconcilable odds with cases from at least four other circuits,the first,fourth,sixth,and eleventh.
