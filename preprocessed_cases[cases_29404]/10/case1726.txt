as expressly authorized by its charter and by section of the government code,the county of los angeles outsourced engineering work to two firms which over the course of many years provided engineers to perform specified work for the county.the engineers were employees of the contracting firms and paid by the contracting firms,and all signed written acknowledgements that they were not employees of the county and not entitled to any of the benefits available to county employees.three of these engineers nevertheless filed this class action against the county,contending they were the county common law employees and,as such,entitled to civil service and retirement benefits under the county retirement plan.the trial court disagreed and so do we.
in,the county entered into master agreements with minisystems associates and tad resources international,the contractors,pursuant to which the county agreed to and did solicit bids from the contractors for specific work to be accomplished by telecommunications engineers and support staff for a specific period of time.in response,the contractors agreed to and did bid specific individuals engineers and support staff the contractors had hired as their own employees,and the county then executed work orders with the contractor submitting the lowest qualified bid there were many of these contracts over a period of years.in every instance,the contractors billed the county for the work performed,and the county paid the contractors,not the engineers.the master agreements made the contractors solely liable for the engineers compensation and benefits,and expressly prohibited the county from soliciting the engineers except through public hiring announcements.
john holmgren,michael sheppa,and keith johnston were hired by the contractors,and in that capacity all three performed engineering services for the county between and.holmgren,sheppa and johnston henceforth collectively holmgren each acknowledged in writing that he was not a county employee,and all were paid only by the contractors,not by the county 
in september,holmgren filed a government tort claim,et with the county,asserting that the county had improperly,inaccurately and falsely mislabeled him as a contract employee,leased employee,independent contractor,temporary employee,employee of various employment agencies,even though both factually and legally he is was a common law employee of the county.the county denied the claim.in november,holmgren on behalf of himself and others similarly situated filed this class action against the county and,in march,filed his second amended complaint,the operative pleading,petitioning for a writ of mandate and alleging four causes of of equal protection,breach of the county duty to properly designate employees,breach of statutory and beneficiary contracts,and other statutory violations 
the theme of the second amended complaint is that holmgren,although through one of the contractors and misdesignated as a contract employee,was screened,interviewed,and effectively hired by the county worked solely on county business had his salary fixed by the county was subject to the direct supervision and control of the county and used county facilities,equipment and supplies to perform county business.more specifically,he alleged that the work he performed was the same as or similar to that performed by recognized county employees with whom he worked that he was nevertheless paid lower wages and did not receive the benefits received by the county recognized workers including retirement pensions,paid vacation and sick leave,grievance procedures,and step salary increases 
the county answered,discovery ensued,and in july the trial court certified a class defined as all persons who,currently or in the past,have performed services for the county,where the performance of such services was not of a temporary less than one year,emergency or recurrent nature,who were not treated as classified county employees,contract employees,leased employees,temporary employees,independent contractors,who were not on the county classified employees payroll and who did not receive retirement or customary employee benefits under the county charter or county code,but who worked for the county as part of an integrated work force with classified county employees subject to supervision by county employees,under common law principles,and who have been paid by entities other than the county directly by the county with payments reported on irs form.excluded from this class are members of the class certified in shiell county of los angeles,and all officers and unclassified positions as defined by the county charter and county code.
based on a stipulated case management plan,stipulated facts,and some but not much additional evidence,the trial court heard and decided three threshold issues,as follows.
threshold issue asked is plaintiffs lawsuit or any of the individual causes of action alleged in their complaint,or are recoverable remedies,damages or money limited,in whole or in part,under applicable statutes of limitations or government claims act presentation requirements 
in october,the trial court,applying the period of limitations code civ,subd.a,ruled that the period of limitations began to run from the date each class member was first hired as a contractor or rehired by the county,and that the class members monetary claims were central to this litigation not merely incidental to the writ relief sought by way of mandamus and subject to the government tort claims act,thus barring claims for damages outside the claim period.
threshold issue asked in the event the plaintiffs are found to be common law employees of the county upon application of common law employment factors,are they entitled to salary,benefits and protections provided classified employees under the county charter,the county code,and the los angeles county civil service commission rules 
in may,the trial court ruled that county employment is not governed by the common law definition of employment,and that the class members were not entitled to salary benefits or protections provided to the county civil service employees.the court held that the county comprehensive civil service scheme determine s who is a civil service employee,and how one is to become a civil service employee and that compliance with the civil service system is the only way to attain civil service status,as well as its salary,benefits and protections.the court rejected holmgren claim that he and the class members had substantially complied with the requirements for entry into the civil service system,refused to rely on the common law definition of employee because the term is described by the governing statutes and rules,and confirmed the county right to decide,for economic reasons,to have certain work performed by independent contractors rather than civil service employees 
threshold issue asked in the event that plaintiffs are found to be common law employees of the county upon application of common law employment factors,are they entitled to pension benefits,or service credits affecting the calculation of such benefits under the county employees retirement law of cerl 
in august,the trial court ruled that,assuming the class members were common law employees,they were nevertheless not entitled to benefits under cerl because a it was up to the county to determine who became a civil service employee entitled to retirement benefits,and b the class members are not employees within the meaning of cerl,subd.a 
holmgren,recognizing that the trial court threshold rulings had eviscerated his action,stipulated with the county for entry of judgment on the threshold issues,and a judgment on that stipulation was entered on october.holmgren appeals.

the county charter assigns all county employment positions into one of two groups unclassified service elected county officials,heads of county agencies,and other enumerated executive positions and classified service all remaining positions.county charter.as required by the charter,the county has a formal civil service system detailed in civil service rules adopted by the board of supervisors and found in the los angeles county code for filling classified positions and fixing the salary and benefits of classified employees,and these rules define an employee as any person holding a position in the classified service of the county.los angeles county civil service commission rules,rule.the only way to become a los angeles county civil service employee is through compliance with the procedures set out in the county civil service rules,rules a.

c.a brief summary of the county employees retirement law cerl 
since,los angeles county has participated in cerl,a pension system available to california counties that elect to participate and as adopted by the county covering persons employed by the county,whose compensation is fixed by the board of supervisors of the county,and whose compensation is paid by the county.county code,ch,subd.a employee means any officer or other person employed by a county whose compensation is fixed by the board of supervisors or by statute and whose compensation is paid by the county,and any officer or other person employed by any district within the county,emphasis added.subject to a few exceptions for seasonal and employees,all classified county employees are automatically enrolled in the los angeles county employees retirement association lacera.
with these rules in mind,we turn to the issues raised on this appeal.
holmgren contends neither section nor any other section of cerl limits county employment to civil service employment,and that he and the members of the class are entitled to the same benefits as the county classified employees.in a related argument,he claims the county illegal misclassification scheme can not be used to avoid its obligation to enroll holmgren and the class members in cerl.we disagree.
the express purpose of cerl is to recognize a public obligation to county employees who become incapacitated by age or long service in public employment and its accompanying physical disabilities by making provision for retirement compensation and death benefit as additional elements of compensation,emphasis added.to these ends,section provides that a ll existing officers and employees of the county become members of their county association on the day the retirement system becomes operative,and thereafter each person entering the county employ becomes a member on the first day of the calendar month after his entrance into the service emphasis added.
to avoid the conclusion that his employer was his contractor,not the county,holmgren contends he is a common law employee of the county.in this context,he is mistaken.
the concept of common law employment originally fixed the boundaries of vicarious liability in tort actions villanazul city of los angeles cal d,and later was applied to determine an employee responsibility under laws people palma th,d.more recently,the doctrine has been applied in employment only when the relevant statutory scheme does not define employment.metropolitan water dist.superior court cal th,d,referred to by the parties as cargill,the name of the real party in interest.where as here the term is defined by the statute,the legislature definition controls and the doctrine of common law employment is irrelevant,reynolds bement cal th,d,common law doctrine does not apply when the legislature has clearly and unequivocally defined its terms estrada fedex ground package system,th,d common law test applied where governing statute did not expressly define employee for purposes of an employer obligation to indemnify the employee expenses see also eureka teacher board of education d.peralta federation of teachers peralta community college dist.cal d,balasubramanian san diego community college dist.th,d heard board of administration,d,los angeles county employees superior court,supra,th at,d.
in cargill,the statute stated only that an employee was a ny person in the employ of any contracting agency.metropolitan water district superior court,supra,cal th at,d.in our case,by contrast,section,subdivision a,and los angeles county code section quite clearly and unequivocally define a employee as a person employed by the county whose compensation is fixed by the board of supervisors and paid by the county.consistent with the statute,the county civil service rules define an employee as any person holding a position in the classified service of the county county civil service rules,rule and provide that the only way to become a los angeles county civil service employee is through compliance with the procedures set out in the civil service rules,rules a.it follows ineluctably that this is not a case in which the statute refers to employees without defining the term,that eligibility for cerl benefits is entirely dependent on the statutory definition,and that the common law doctrine does not apply in this context.
relying primarily on our decision in los angeles county employees superior court,supra,th,d lacea,holmgren contends he and the members of the class were impermissibly denied cerl benefits as part of a misclassification scheme designed to avoid the county obligations under cerl.lacea is inapposite.in that case,the judges at the compton municipal court,in implementing a series of measures,decided that newly hired courtroom clerks would be service and that existing deputy court clerks would lose their civil service status if they accepted a promotion,at,d.we affirmed a judgment in favor of the clerks,holding that the judges had no power to deny civil service status to any county employee,at,d.lacea and the other cases relied on by holmgren including powers board of public works cal,city of oakland public employees retirement system th,d villanazul city of los angeles,supra,cal d,have nothing to do with the county authority to hire independent contrac
