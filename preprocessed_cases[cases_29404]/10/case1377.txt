background 
factual background 
states require individuals to provide personal information,such as name,address,telephone number,social security number,medical information,and photograph,as a condition of obtaining a driver license or registering an automobile.see reno condon,d.in the early,congress found that the sale of this personal information to individuals and businesses had become a significant source of revenue for many states.see id.at.at.florida was one such state.
responding to privacy and safety concerns,congress enacted the dppa to regulate the disclosure and resale of an individual personal information from state motor vehicle records.the dppa generally prohibits any state dmv,or officer,employee,or contractor thereof,from knowingly disclos ing or otherwise mak ing available to any person or entity personal about any individual obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record condon,at.at quoting a alteration in original footnotes added.
the dppa prohibition against disclosure does not apply if a driver consents to the release of their personal information.as originally enacted,the dppa contained an provision which allowed individuals to request that their personal information not be released for marketing purposes.see,stat.if a driver failed to,their consent to the release of personal information was implied.however,in october congress amended the dppa to change the provision to an express consent requirement.see,stat,c,d,and e.under the amended dppa,states must obtain a driver affirmative consent to disclose the driver personal information for use in surveys,marketing,solicitations,and other restricted purposes.condon,at.at.
in addition to the express consent provision,the dppa contains a number of statutory exceptions to the general prohibition against disclosure of drivers personal information.see id.in fact,the dppa requires disclosure of personal information to ensure compliance with various federal statutes concerning motor vehicle safety,theft,and emissions.see b.the dppa also permits disclosure of personal information for a number of limited purposes.see id.one such purpose is to allow government agencies to carry out their functions.see b.under that exception,disclosure is permitted f or use by any government agency or any private person or entity acting on behalf of a federal,state,or local agency in carrying out its functions.id.
while the dppa primarily addresses the disclosure of drivers personal information,the dppa also makes it unlawful for any person knowingly to obtain or disclose personal information,from a motor vehicle record,for any use not permitted under section b of this title.a emphasis added.thus,third parties who obtain drivers personal information for other than a permissible use,are in violation of the dppa.to ensure compliance,the dppa provides a civil cause of action to drivers whose personal information has been obtained,disclosed,or used by a in violation of the dppa.see.
as mentioned previously,florida has a history of generating revenue through the sale of drivers personal information.in may,almost four years after the effective date of the dppa amendment,florida amended its public records statute to comply with the dppa express consent requirements.see.stat.aa.however,florida continued to utilize drivers personal information for advertising purposes through a newly formed partnership with the marketing company imagitas.in july,imagitas entered into a five year contract with the florida dhsmv to develop,produce,and distribute registration renewal notices to florida drivers in participating counties the registration renewal notices were mailed in official envelopes,which included public service and commercial advertising inserts.florida contract with imagitas has since ended.
in accordance with their agreement,imagitas mailed renewal notices to florida drivers whose motor vehicle registration was scheduled to expire the following month.imagitas placed public service information mandated by florida law and commercial solicitations from it in the renewal envelopes.imagitas marketed this service to advertisers as its driversource program.advertisers included ford motor company,sirius radio,home depot,and directv among others.advertising revenues were intended to offset the costs of producing and mailing registration renewals,saving florida counties from the expense after program costs and overhead were covered,any remaining profits were shared by florida and imagitas 
the entire driversource program was subject to dhsmv review and florida controlled all content within the renewal envelopes.under the terms of the contract,florida approved each advertisement in writing and retained the right to reject any ads that may conflict with the best interest of the state at the dhsmv discretion.dhsmv contract no.in addition,the terms of the contract required the advertising to be in accordance with florida statute,which authorizes state agencies to e nter into agreements with private vendors for the publication or production of such public information materials in return for the right to select,sell,and place advertising that publicizes products or services related to and harmonious with the subject matter of the publication.stat.a.
the florida dhsmv periodically furnished imagitas with both a renewal file and a registration file for the driversource program.the renewal file,which was updated monthly,contained information on only those drivers scheduled to receive a reminder notice that month.the registration file,which was updated weekly,contained information on all registered drivers within florida.together,these files allowed imagitas to generate a household view,which included detailed information about all registered drivers at a particular address.the household view allowed imagitas to selectively target advertising based not only on the vehicle that was up for renewal,but on all vehicles owned by drivers living in the same household.during negotiations with the dhsmv,imagitas maintained that the household view was absolutely critical to creating an effective and economically sustainable advertising program.neither file was released by imagitas to its and such release was expressly forbidden by its contract with the dhsmv.under the contract,florida retained full ownership of both the renewal and registration files.as such,imagitas never acquired ownership rights in any of florida data.
in addition to drivers personal information,imagitas analyzed drivers vehicle information to develop a marketing profile for each household.imagitas proprietary segmented advertising model used the vehicle identification number,the date of purchase,and the zip code in determining advertisement placement.the vehicle identification number allowed imagitas to determine the year,make,and model of each automobile,while the purchase date indicated whether the vehicle was purchased new or used.once detailed vehicle information was determined for each driver,imagitas all mailing addresses in the database so that drivers at the same mailing address were treated as a single household.each household vehicle information and zip code were then used to determine advertisement placement.
procedural background 
marvin rine,jacalyn smith,martin martinez,violet beckman,and randall heavrin,are florida drivers who received registration renewal mailings from the state of florida with enclosed advertisements and solicitations pursuant to florida contract with imagitas.in august,brought this class action against imagitas on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated.allege that,without express consent,imagitas obtained their personal information from the florida dhsmv and used that information for a purpose not permitted under the dppa.specifically,allege that imagitas used their personal information for commercial advertising purposes by inserting targeted advertisements and solicitations into the registration renewal mailings.seek statutory damages of for each class representative and class member of florida drivers whose personal information was obtained or used in violation of the dppa.
nine lawsuits were brought against imagitas in the following districts one case in the middle district of florida,one case in the southern district of florida,two cases in the district of massachusetts,one case in the district of minnesota,one case in the western district of missouri,one case in the southern district of new york,and two cases in the northern district of ohio.following our february decision in collier dickinson,cir holding that state officials can be held personally liable for dppa violations,lawsuits were brought against florida,minnesota,missouri,and ohio state officials in their personal capacity for disclosing personal information from a motor vehicle record in violation of the dppa.imagitas answered the amended complaint and thereafter sought multidistrict litigation treatment of this case and all other similar cases filed around the country.
in may,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation jpml ordered that all cases against imagitas be transferred to the middle district of florida for coordinated treatment.several months later,the jpml also transferred the cases against state officials to the middle district of florida.in all,thirteen cases have been coordinated in the middle district of florida.the district court determined that the florida cases should proceed first and ordered a discovery period to be followed by summary judgment motions.prior to the summary judgment deadline,announced that they had reached a settlement with the florida state officials after the minnesota,missouri,and ohio state officials moved to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds,voluntarily dismissed those lawsuits.
in october,imagitas filed its motion for summary judgment asserting that complaint does not establish a dppa violation.specifically,imagitas argued that the dppa does not prohibit states from sharing personal information with its own contractors,the dppa expressly permits florida disclosures to imagitas,and the dppa does not prohibit florida inclusion of solicitations within its registration renewal envelopes.imagitas also argued that interpreting the dppa to prevent florida from using its own information for advertising purposes would violate the first amendment and that imagitas is entitled to qualified immunity.
in april,the district court granted imagitas motion for summary judgment holding that its driversource program,as operated under imagitas contract with florida,does not violate the letter of the dppa.in re imagitas,wl,at.however,the district court conceded the driversource program could well be argued to violate the spirit of the dppa,which was passed to protect drivers privacy,limit dissemination of drivers personal information,and restrict mass mailings generated through the use of personal information that drivers must,by law,provide to the state.id.despite these reservations,the district court concluded that,as a state contractor,imagitas was acting on behalf of the florida dhsmv in carrying out its functions and therefore not in violation of the dppa.appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to imagitas.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing all evidence and any reasonable inferences that might be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party.see acevedo first union nat.bank,cir.under.c,a motion for summary judgment is properly granted when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.celotex catrett,d.the interpretation of a statute is a question of law subject to de novo review.see united states endotec,cir.
iii.discussion 
this appeal raises questions concerning what states and their contractors can or can not do under the dppa.specifically,is the act of mailing notices to registered vehicle owners reminding them of the need to complete an annual registration a government function if so,can the state of florida include advertisements in such a notice in an effort to generate revenue to offset the cost if such is a permissible government function,can the state of florida accomplish this through a contractor resolving these questions requires that we engage in an exercise of statutory interpretation.
as with any question of statutory interpretation,we begin by examining the text of the statute to determine whether its meaning is clear.harry marchant,cir en banc.in construing a statute we must begin,and often should end as well,with the language of the statute itself.united states steele,cir en banc quoting merritt dillard paper,cir.we do this because we presume that congress said what it meant and meant what it said.marchant,at internal quotations omitted.where the language of a statute is unambiguous,as it is here,we need not,and ought not,consider legislative history.id.at see also united states gonzales,d given the straightforward statutory command,there is no reason to resort to legislative history.harris garner,cir en banc when the import of the words congress has used is clear,we need not resort to legislative history,and we certainly should not do so to undermine the plain meaning of the statutory language.
allege that imagitas violated section a of the dppa,which states it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly to obtain or disclose personal information,from a motor vehicle record,for any use not permitted under section b of this title.a.imagitas does not dispute that it qualifies as a person under the dppa and that it knowingly obtained personal information from a motor vehicle record.imagitas obtained drivers names and addresses pursuant to its contract with the florida dhsmv.as such,the question of imagitas liability is limited to whether its use of personal information is permitted under section b.put another way,imagitas is only liable if its driversource program was not a permissible use under section b.
section b authorizes the disclosure of drivers personal information for fourteen permissible uses.see b.imagitas argues that subsection b,which permits disclosure of personal information f or use by any private person or entity acting on behalf of a federal,state,or local agency in carrying out its functions,expressly permits the driversource program.b.application of this subsection to imagitas driversource program brings us to the heart of the dispute and requires the resolution of two main issues first,whether the driversource program is carrying out a function of the florida dhsmv and second,whether imagitas is a private entity acting on behalf of the florida dhsmv.
is the driversource program carrying out a function of the florida dhsmv 
do not dispute that mailing registration renewal notices is a legitimate function of the florida dhsmv.the dispute here centers on whether the inclusion of commercial advertising in renewal envelopes is a legitimate agency function.however,the dppa does not define what it means by an agency function.because the dppa is a federal statute,its interpretation is a matter of federal law.see stein paradigm mirasol,llc,cir.when statutory terms are undef
