plaintiff henry jong appeals from a summary judgment entered against him in his action for unpaid overtime for alleged work as an hourly outpatient pharmacy manager opm for kaiser foundation health plan,and kaiser foundation hospitals collectively,kaiser.he contends the trial court erroneously held his proffered evidence insufficient to create a triable issue as to whether kaiser had actual or constructive knowledge that he was working hours in addition to those that he reported.we shall affirm the trial court judgment.
background 
jong and two other former opms brought a putative class action against kaiser alleging numerous wage and hour violations,including,as relevant to this appeal,a cause of action for the alleged failure to pay overtime compensation for hours worked off the clock.jong and each of the other two plaintiffs were employed by kaiser as opms at different kaiser pharmacies in california.on various dates between january and october,jong worked as a manager at three different pharmacies.because the defendants motion for summary judgment was granted only as to jong,we focus primarily on the facts pertinent to his employment and to the motion against him.
prior to november,jong and all outpatient pharmacy managers were classified as salaried employees,exempt from various wage and hour requirements.as a consequence of the settlement of a class action alleging that these employees had been misclassified and denied benefits to which they were entitled lopez kaiser foundation health plan,super.alameda county,no.rg,these employees were reclassified as hourly employees entitled to overtime premium compensation.plaintiffs complaint alleges that at the same time,kaiser instituted a policy that forbade the payment of overtime premium to plaintiffs and the class,while simultaneously refusing to make any adjustments to the duties and responsibilities of the class.this is significant,the complaint further alleges,because kaiser own data,including surveys of the class members produced in the lopez action,indicated that,before they were,class members were routinely working fifty hours or more per week in order to meet kaiser goals and requirements.the net effect of kaiser policy against the payment of overtime premium along with no depreciation in the nature of their job duties,since being reclassified,hourly workers,plaintiffs and the class have been,and continue to be,forced to work off the clock so as not to incur overtime premium pay in violation of kaiser policy while still maintaining compliance with kaiser lofty expectations.
following discovery,kaiser moved for summary judgment on the ground,as to this claim,that jong lacked evidence that kaiser failed to pay overtime wages for hours he worked that kaiser knew or should have known he worked.in granting the motion,the trial court fairly summarized kaiser evidence as follows kaiser evidentiary support consists in substantial part of excerpts from the jong transcript deposition.jong testified that he was aware that it was kaiser policy to pay for all hours worked and to pay for all overtime hours employees record,even if an employee should or could have obtained before working the overtime but failed to do so.he also testified that he was familiar with the applicable time keeping rules and that he knew how to use the timekeeping system.he also signed a document entitled attestation form for hourly managers and supervisors working off the clock not allowed the attestation.jong further testified that he did not know whether anyone in kaiser management was aware he was performing the work he now claims to have performed before clocking in in the morning,after clocking out at the end of the day,and at home in between his work days.jong testified that he was unable to recall the number of hours he worked and kept no written record of those hours.
in opposing the motion for summary judgment,jong argued as follows while kaiser may instruct its employees to accurately report all hours worked,plaintiff was accountable to ensure that the pharmacy stayed within the pharmacy predetermined budget.plaintiff inability to stay within budget by incurring excessive or routine overtime was deemed to be a failure to perform his job duties which could result in discipline including termination.in fact,plaintiff was reprimanded for failing to stay within budget based upon the incurrence of too much overtime.as such regardless of kaiser written policy,the circumstances were such that they placed plaintiff in the unenviable position of deciding whether to report all hours worked and face discipline for failing to stay within budget or refuse to report all hours so as to maintain his accountability for staying within budget and avoid the imposition of discipline.moreover,kaiser was aware that opms,including plaintiff,were regularly required to work substantially more than hours in a week to complete their job duties which remained the same after opms were reclassified to.in the discussion section,post,we shall discuss the evidence that jong proffered to show that kaiser was aware that he had worked hours that he did not report.
the trial court granted kaiser motion as to jong but denied the motion as to the other two named plaintiffs.the court ruled that much of jong evidence was inadmissible and that his evidence failed to show that he as distinguished from some opms in general was working off the clock.in denying the motion as to the other plaintiffs,the court found in their testimony weak evidence of conversations with their supervisors indicating awareness that they were in fact working hours that were not recorded,but jong proffered no similar evidence of conversations as to his working hours.
jong has timely appealed from the adverse judgment entered pursuant to the court ruling on the summary judgment motion,and on appeal challenges only the trial court ruling with respect to his claim for unpaid overtime compensation.
discussion 
jong cause of action is brought under labor code section,which authorizes any employee receiving less than the legal minimum wage or the legal overtime compensation applicable to the employee to recover the unpaid amount due,plus interest,attorney fees and costs.although not articulated in the statute,the parties and the trial court assumed the applicability under the labor code of certain principles that federal courts have applied in similar cases under the fair labor standards act flsa a.in forrester roth foodliner,cir,the court held that where an employer has no knowledge that an employee is engaging in overtime work and that employee fails to notify the employer or deliberately prevents the employer from acquiring knowledge of the overtime work,the employer failure to pay for the overtime hours is not a violation of.at.an employer must have an opportunity to comply with the provisions of the flsa.this is not to say that an employer may escape responsibility by negligently maintaining records required by the flsa,or by deliberately turning its back on a situation.however,where the acts of an employee prevent an employer from acquiring knowledge,here of alleged uncompensated overtime hours,the employer can not be said to have suffered or permitted the employee to work in violation of a.id.at see also,kellar summit seating,cir,brown scriptpro,llc cir.this qualification was implicitly endorsed by our supreme court in a different context.morillion royal packing cal th,d,t he words suffer and permit as used in the statute mean with the knowledge of the employer.it has been followed in at least one case in federal court brought under the provisions of the labor code.white starbucks d,to prevail on his clock claim,white must prove that starbucks had actual or constructive knowledge of his alleged work.we see no reason to question this basic premise on which all parties have proceeded.
the evidence on which jong principally relies to establish kaiser actual or at least constructive knowledge that he was working more than the hours he reported is the deposition testimony that opms gave in the lopez litigation.according to the excerpts from their depositions submitted in oppositi
