most cases in our judicial system never make it to trial.litigants often find it advantageous to secure a resolution more quickly by settling the case and negotiating a result the parties can tolerate,even though neither side can call it a total win.normally,that is the end of the story,and the parties walk away not entirely happy,but not entirely unhappy either.
in a class action,however,any settlement must be approved by the court to ensure that class counsel and the named plaintiffs do not place their own interests above those of the absent class members.in this false advertising case,we confront a class action settlement,negotiated prior to class certification,that includes cy pres distributions of money and food to unidentified charities.it also includes million in attorneys fees which breaks down to a hourly rate while offering class members a sum of at most.
after carefully reviewing the class settlement,we conclude that it must be set aside for two reasons.first,the district court did not apply the correct legal standards governing cy pres distributions and thus abused its discretion in approving the settlement.the settlement neither identifies the ultimate recipients of the cy pres awards nor sets forth any limiting restriction on those recipients,other than characterizing them as charities that feed the indigent.to the extent that we can meaningfully review such distributions where the parties fail to identify the recipients,we hold that the cy pres portions of the settlement are not sufficiently related to the plaintiff class or to the class underlying false advertising claims.second,even if the cy pres distributions did comply with our cy pres standards,the settlement would still fail because the negotiated attorneys fees are excessive.we therefore reverse the district court approval of the settlement,vacate the judgment,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
in january,kellogg,the maker of frosted mini wheats cereal,began a marketing campaign that claimed the cereal was scientifically proven to improve children cognitive functions for several hours after breakfast.obviously aimed at parents of children,kellogg advertisements allegedly included the following statements 
does your child need to pay more attention in school a recent clinical study showed that a whole grain and breakfast of frosted mini wheats helps improve children attentiveness by nearly.
kellogg recently commissioned research to measure the effect on kids of eating a breakfast of frosted mini wheat cereal.an independent research group conducted a series of standardized,cognitive tests on children ages to who ate either a breakfast of frosted mini wheats cereal or water.the result the children who ate a breakfast of frosted mini wheats cereal had a nearly improvement in attentiveness.
based upon independent clinical research,kids who ate kellogg frosted mini wheats cereal for breakfast had up to better attentiveness three hours after breakfast than kids who ate no breakfast.
according to a declaration submitted by lead counsel for the plaintiff class,counsel began investigating these marketing claims and,in april and may,drafted a class action complaint on behalf of ohio resident jon koz,alleging violations of ohio consumer protection laws.around the same time,another law firm was investigating the same marketing claims on behalf of california resident harry dennis.although koz never filed his ohio complaint,dennis filed suit in august against kellogg in the united states district court for the southern district of california,alleging violations of that state unfair competition law ucl and asserting a claim of unjust enrichment.
sometime prior to january,counsel for koz and counsel for dennis discovered they were involved in similar activities and decided to join forces.because informal settlement attempts were unsuccessful,counsel for the consumers and for kellogg participated in a mediation session with martin quinn of jams,a alternative dispute resolution firm.as a result of this mediation session and numerous other settlement discussions,the parties agreed,in principle,to settle the case.
meanwhile,the dennis lawsuit had been gathering dust.on june,the district court notified the parties of its intent to dismiss the case for lack of prosecution.koz and dennis immediately filed a joint amended class action complaint.
in their amended complaint,the named plaintiffs asserted that kellogg marketing claims regarding the effect of frosted mini wheats on children attentiveness were false,that the study upon which these results were based did not support the company claims,and that the study was not scientifically valid.the plaintiffs asserted unjust enrichment,claims under the ucl and california consumer legal remedies act clra,and claims under similar laws of other states.
over the next three months,the parties continued to work out the details of their settlement.ultimately,they agreed to settle the case on the following terms 
kellogg agreed to establish a million fund for distribution to class members on a basis.class members submitting claims would receive per box of cereal purchased,up to a maximum of any funds remaining would not revert to kellogg but would instead be donated to charities chosen by the parties and approved by the court pursuant to the cy pres doctrine.
kellogg agreed to distribute,also pursuant to the cy pres doctrine,million worth of specific kellogg food items to charities that feed the indigent.the settlement does not specify the recipient charities,nor does it indicate how this million in food will be valued at cost,retail,or by some other measure.
kellogg agreed that for three years,it would refrain from using in its advertising and on its labeling for the product any assertion to the effect that eating a bowl of kellogg frosted mini wheats cereal for breakfast is clinically shown to improve attentiveness by nearly.kellogg would still be allowed to claim that c linical studies have shown that kids who eat a filling breakfast like frosted mini wheats have an better attentiveness in school than kids who skip breakfast.
kellogg agreed to pay class counsel attorneys fees and costs not to exceed a total of million.class counsel eventually requested the full million in fees and costs 
the plaintiffs agreed to release all claims arising out of the challenged advertising.
together with notice and administrative costs approximated at,the parties value the settlement at.
on the plaintiffs motion,the district court certified the class,granted preliminary approval of the settlement,and approved the proposed class notice.because kellogg sells its products to wholesalers,not directly to consumers,there was no way to identify each member of the class.therefore,the class notice was published in parents magazine and other targeted sources based on market research about consumers who purchased the products,including websites.
two class members objected to the settlement stephanie berg and omar rivero objectors.as relevant to this appeal,the objectors argued that the settlement use of cy pres relief was improper because the only relationship between this lawsuit and feeding the indigent is that they both involve food in some way.they argued also that the cy pres distributions would benefit class counsel and kellogg,but not the class members,because class members have no idea how their funds might be used or in whose hands their monies will end up.finally,the objectors argued that the attorneys fees which represented approximately of a common fund allegedly worth over million were excessive.the district court approved the class settlement and dismissed the case with prejudice.in doing so,however,the court did not address the objectors argument that the cy pres distributions were too remote from the class members and were not sufficiently related to their ucl and clra claims.the court also approved the requested attorneys fees,stating that the fees were 
fair and reasonable in light of the results achieved,the risks of litigation,the skill required and the quality of work,the contingent nature of the fee,the burdens carried by class counsel,and the awards made in similar cases.see vizcaino microsoft,cir.accordingly,the objections are overruled.
the objectors timely appealed.
standard of review 
the settlement of a class action must be fair,adequate,and reasonable.e.we review a district court approval of a proposed class action settlement,including a proposed cy pres settlement distribution,for abuse of discretion.a court abuses its discretion when it fails to apply the correct legal standard or bases its decision on unreasonable findings of fact.nachshin aol,llc,cir internal citations omitted.
appellate review of a settlement agreement is generally extremely limited.hanlon chrysler,cir.but where,as here,class counsel negotiates a settlement agreement before the class is even certified,courts must be particularly vigilant not only for explicit collusion,but also for more subtle signs that class counsel have allowed pursuit of their own and that of certain class members to infect the negotiations.in re bluetooth headset prods.liab,cir.in such a case,settlement approval requires a higher standard of fairness and a more probing inquiry than may normally be required under rule e.hanlon,at.to survive appellate review,the district court must show it has explored comprehensively all factors,and must give a reasoned response to all objections,officers for justice civil serv.comm n,cir.
discussionathe cy pres distributions of food and unclaimed funds 
although the cy pres doctrine originated in the area of wills as a way to effectuate the testator intent in making charitable gifts,federal courts now frequently apply it in the settlement of class actions where the proof of individual claims would be burdensome or distribution of damages costly.nachshin,at quoting six mexican workers.citrus growers,cir.used in lieu of direct distribution of damages to silent class members,this alternative allows for aggregate calculation of damages,the use of summary claim procedures,and distribution of unclaimed funds to indirectly benefit the entire class.six mexican workers,at.to ensure that the settlement retains some connection to the plaintiff class and the underlying claims,however,a cy pres award must qualify as the next best distribution to giving the funds directly to class members.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
not just any worthy recipient can qualify as an appropriate cy pres beneficiary.to avoid the many nascent dangers to the fairness of the distribution process,we require that there be a driving nexus between the plaintiff class and the cy pres beneficiaries.nachshin,at.a cy pres award must be guided by the objectives of the underlying statute s and the interests of the silent class members,id.at,and must not benefit a group too remote from the plaintiff class,six mexican workers,at.thus,in addition to asking whether the class settlement,taken as a whole,is fair,reasonable,and adequate to all concerned,we must also determine whether the distribution of the approved class settlement complies with our standards governing cy pres awards.nachshin,at internal quotation marks omitted.
a review of our relevant precedent reveals that the settlement here fails to satisfy those standards.in six mexican workers arizona citrus growers,a class of undocumented mexican farm workers sued various companies for violations of the farm labor contractor registration act.at.after a bench trial,the district court found the defendants liable for over million,which we later reduced to,in statutory damages.id.at.the district court identified the inter american fund,which provided humanitarian aid in mexico,as the cy pres recipient of any unclaimed funds.id.at.
we held that the cy pres distribution was an abuse of discretion because there was no reasonable certainty that any class member would benefit from it,even though the money would go to areas where the class members may live.id.at.the choice of charity and its relation to the class members and class claims or lack thereof figured heavily in our analysis.the purpose of the statute was to compensate victims of unscrupulous employers and to deter future violations,but the inter american fund was not an organization with a substantial record of service nor is it limited in its choice of projects,and any distribution would therefore have required court supervision to ensure that the funds are distributed in accordance with the goals of the remedy.id.at.because the district court application of the cy pres doctrine was inadequate to serve the goals of the statute and protect the interests of the silent class members,we reversed the cy pres distribution.id.at.
we recently came to a similar conclusion in nachshin aol,llc.in that case,aol was accused of violating a number of statutes,including the ucl and the clra,by wrongfully inserting commercial footers into the plaintiffs outgoing emails.at.because damages would be small and distribution to the class prohibitively expensive,aol agreed,as part of a class settlement,to make substantial donations to three charities the legal aid foundation of los angeles,the federal judicial center foundation,and the los angeles and santa monica chapters of the boys and girls club of america.id.at.
we held that the cy pres distribution fail ed to target the plaintiff class,because it d id not account for the broad geographic distribution of the class.id.at.the class included over million aol users across the country,but of the donations were slated for los angeles charities.further,although the donation to the federal judicial center foundation at least conceivably benefit ed a national organization,the foundation ha d no apparent relation to the objectives of the underlying statutes,and it wa s not clear how this organization would benefit the plaintiff class.id.we noted,however,that it would not be difficult for the parties to come up with an appropriate charity if they wished to do so 
it is clear that all members of the class share two things in common they use the internet,and their claims against aol arise from a purportedly unlawful advertising campaign that exploited users outgoing messages.the parties should not have trouble selecting beneficiaries from any number of organizations that work to protect internet users from fraud,predation,and other forms of online malfeasance.
id.at.in approving the cy pres distribution to charities that had no relation to the class or to the underlying claims,the district court applied the incorrect legal standard and abused its discretion.id.at.
the cy pres award in the settlement here is likewise divorced from the concerns embodied in consumer protection laws such as the ucl and the clra.as california courts have stated,t he ucl is designed to preserve fair competition among business competitors and protect the public from nefarious and unscrupulous business practices,wells learning,d,rev in part on other grounds,cal,and the purpose of the clra is similarly to protect consumers against unfair and deceptive business practices,cal.although there is no way to identify the cy pres beneficiaries from this record,we do know that according to the settlement,any charity to receive a portion of the cy pres distributions will be one that feeds the indigent.this noble goal,however,has little or nothing to do with the purposes of the underlying lawsuit or the class of plaintiffs involved.nachshin,at.
at oral argument,kellogg counsel frequently asserted that donating food to charities who feed the indigent relates to the underlying class claims because this case is about the nutritional value of food.with respect,that is simply not true,and saying it repeatedly does not make it so.the complaint nowhere alleged that the cereal was unhealthy or lacked nutritional value.and no law allows a consumer to sue a company for selling cereal that does not improve attentiveness.the gravamen of this lawsuit is that kellogg advertised that its cereal did improve attentiveness.those alleged misrepresentations are what provided the plaintiffs with a cause of action under the ucl and the clra,not the nutritional value of frosted mini wheats.thus,appropriate cy pres recipients are not
