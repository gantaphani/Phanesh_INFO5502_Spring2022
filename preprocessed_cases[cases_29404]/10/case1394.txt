background 
on may,busby,the putative class representative,purchased a home in jefferson,alabama,using a federally related home loan.busby employed a realtysouth real estate agent who earned a sales commission based on a percentage of the purchase price.this brokerage commission,paid by the seller,was lowered from to in order to encourage the seller to accept busby offer.during the closing and settlement,realtysouth charged busby an administrative brokerage commission fee of the abc fee.the closing attorney is busby current counsel.he explained the closing documents and the statements to busby and engaged in discussions with her concerning the transactions.
procedural history 
on september,busby filed suit on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated against realtysouth alleging violations of respa.busby contended that the abc fee violated respa in that it was a fee for which no service was performed.in her class action busby sought to represent 
all individuals expressly excluding the federal judiciary and the judiciary immediate family members for the northern district of alabama,whether or not having any relationship with defendant,who have paid an abc fee to defendant pursuant to a federally related mortgage loan during the applicable limitations period whose transactions are covered and protected by respa regulations.
pl.comp.at.
on october,realtysouth filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety.the district court granted the motion to dismiss except to the extent that the complaint alleged that the abc fee was a charge for which no service had been rendered under b.on april,realtysouth filed a motion for summary judgment on the remaining claim.the motion was grounded on the assertion that there were no facts to support busby contention that no service was rendered in exchange for the abc fee.the district court denied realtysouth motion,finding that there was an issue of material fact regarding whether any services were provided in exchange for the abc fee,and realtysouth does not appeal that order.busby then filed a motion for class certification,which the district court denied on july.
the district court found that busby had demonstrated that the proposed class satisfied the numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy prongs of federal rule of civil procedure a.nonetheless,the district court found that busby had not satisfied federal rule of civil procedure b.specifically,the court found that while the legal issues of busby respa claim were identical to those that would be presented by each class member,individual issues predominated with regard to factual issues.busby appeals the denial of class certification.
ii.discussion 
respa background 
in,congress passed respa to regulate the costs consumers pay to settle their real estate transactions.the statute states 
the congress finds that significant reforms in the real estate settlement process are needed to insure that consumers throughout the nation are provided with greater and more timely information on the nature and costs of the settlement process and are protected from unnecessarily high settlement charges caused by certain abusive practices that have developed in some areas of the country.
one of the abusive practices that congress sought to eliminate through the enactment of respa was the payment of referral fees,kickbacks,and other unearned fees.sosa chase manhattan mortg,cir citing,reprinted in.congress addressed both kickbacks and unearned fees in section of respa,which provides in pertinent part 
a business referrals.no person shall give and no person shall accept any fee,kickback,or thing of value pursuant to any agreement or understanding,oral or otherwise,that business incident to or a part of a real estate settlement service involving a federally related mortgage loan shall be referred to any person.
b splitting charges.no person shall give and no person shall accept any portion,split,or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed.
while we have never addressed class treatment for a claim under section b where a plaintiff alleges no services were provided as busby alleges here,we have addressed the viability of class treatment with respect to a respa claim under a challenging yield spread premiums ysps.see heimmermann first union mort,cir.
the term yield spread premium is used in the mortgage lending industry to refer to a type of payment from a lender to a mortgage broker paid in the context of brokered loan transactions.the premium is a form of compensation that a mortgage broker,acting as the intermediary,receives from the original lender for selling an interest rate to a borrower that is above the lender par rate for which the borrower qualifies.the borrower accepts this higher rate on the loan in return for paying the broker a reduced origination fee or no fee at all.essentially,it is a tool by which a borrower may spread the origination fee over the life of the loan.
in,the department of housing and urban development hud issued a statement of policy sop emphasizing that a ysp can be a useful means to pay some or all of a borrower settlement costs as well as a legitimate tool to assist the borrower.sop,hud then set forth a test to determine the legality of a ysp.we adopted this test in heimmermann.the district court relied heavily on our analysis of ysps in heimmermann in its denial of busby motion for class certification,and,thus,we review heimmermann and the sop.
under the ysp test,we first determine whether the broker has provided goods or services of the kind typically associated with a mortgage transaction.heimmermann,at.once we have determined that the broker did actually provide services,we consider whether the total compensation paid to the broker is reasonably related to the total value of the goods or services actually provided.id.at.hud cautioned that ysps must be evaluated on a basis in the context of the specific factual circumstances applicable to each transaction.sop.at.for this reason,in heimmermann and since,we have consistently held that ysp cases are inappropriate for class review.culpepper irwin mortg,cir culpepper iv heimmermann,at.
however,the sop lays out a different framework for b claims.specifically,as to b prohibition on unearned fees,the sop states 
payments that are unearned fees occur in,but are not limited to,cases where one settlement service provider charges the consumer a fee where no,nominal,or duplicative work is done,or the fee is in excess of the reasonable value of goods or facilities provided or the services actually performed.
sop.at emphasis added.in other words,the sop states that a fee is unearned in violation of b when a fee is charged but no,nominal,or duplicative work is done in exchange for the fee or a fee is charged that is unreasonably excessive in light of the services actually performed in exchange for the fee.
class certification 
for a district court to certify a class action,the named plaintiffs must have standing,and the putative class must meet each of the requirements specified in federal rule of civil procedure a,as well as at least one of the requirements set forth in rule b.klay humana,cir 
federal rule of civil procedure a states 
prerequisites to a class action.one or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all only if the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,there are questions of law or fact common to the class,the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class,and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.
a.additionally,federal rule of civil procedure b states 
b class actions maintainable.an action may be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of subdivision a are satisfied,and in addition 
the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.the matters pertinent to the findings include a the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions b the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class c the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum d the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.
b emphasis added.the burden of proof to establish the propriety of class certification rests with the advocate of the class.valley drug geneva,cir.
on appeal,busby challenges the district court holding that she failed to satisfy rule b predominance requirement,as well as the district court alternative holding that she failed to satisfy rule b superiority requirement.realtysouth not only contests busby claim that she satisfies the predominance and superiority requirements of rule b,but further argues that we should affirm the district court on various alternative grounds that realtysouth asserts are supported by the record.specifically,realtysouth contends that busby does not meet the requirements of rule a and,and further contends that c of respa provides a defense that should apply individually to putative plaintiffs,such that class treatment is inappropriate.
we first address the requirements of rule a and and explain why the district court correctly determined that busby met those requirements.we then explain why the district court erred in determining that busby could not satisfy the predominance and superiority requirements of rule b.finally,we explain why we reject realtysouth c argument.
first,as to rule a typicality,realtysouth contends that busby does not have a typical claim because she seeks to represent both buyers and sellers who paid the abc fee.realtysouth contends that sellers received a different set of services than buyers and paid different amounts for these services.further,realtysouth contends that busby is atypical because she is more likely subject to an estoppel or related defense than other buyers or sellers as a result of negotiations during her closing resulting in the lowering of her brokerage commission from to.
a class representative must possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members in order to be typical under rule a.cooper southern,cir quoting murray auslander,cir.t ypicality measures whether a sufficient nexus exists between the claims of the named representatives and those of the class at large.id.quoting ex rel.prado bush,cir.
here,as noted by the district court,there is an issue of law common to all of the putative representatives whether the abc fees violated respa b because no services were provided,either to sellers or buyers,for whatever abc fee was paid.this claim is common to all possible plaintiffs including busby.realtysouth has not enumerated any services that were provided to either sellers or buyers in exchange for the abc fee.therefore,we find,as did the district court,that busby claim is typical of all possible plaintiffs including sellers as well as buyers like busby 
second,as to rule a adequacy,realtysouth contends that the district court erred in finding that busby was an adequate representative of the class.the requirement encompasses two separate inquiries whether any substantial conflicts of interest exist between the representatives and the class and whether the representatives will adequately prosecute the action.valley drug,at quotations omitted.
realtysouth contends that busby counsel improperly solicited busby in violation of alabama rules of professional conduct rule,and that this renders busby inadequate to represent the class.rule states 
a lawyer shall not solicit professional employment from a prospective client with whom the lawyer has no familial or current or prior professional relationship,in person or otherwise,when a significant motive for the lawyer doing so is the lawyer pecuniary gain.a lawyer shall not permit employees or agents of the lawyer to solicit on the lawyer behalf.a lawyer shall not enter into an agreement for or charge or collect a fee for professional employment obtained in violation of this rule.the term solicit includes contact in person,by telephone 
rules of conduct rule a.
the district court noted that busby counsel was the closing attorney involved in the business transactions pertaining to the purchase of her house.in this capacity,he explained the closing documents and the statements to busby and engaged in discussions concerning the transactions.the district court found this interaction sufficient to constitute a prior professional relationship satisfying rule.
realtysouth has not cited to any alabama precedent that defines what constitutes a prior professional relationship with regard to rule,and this court found none.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the former relationship between busby and her counsel constituted a prior professional relationship in satisfaction of rule.
moreover,even had it found that busby counsel conduct violated rule,the district court was not then required to find busby inadequate to represent the class.in a seventh circuit case cited by realtysouth,addressing the question of attorney misconduct in soliciting named plaintiffs in a class action,the court stated,o nly the most egregious misconduct on the part of plaintiffs lawyer could ever arguably justify denial of class status.halverson convenient food mart,cir citing flaksa little river marine const,cir.in the event that class counsel does act improperly,t he ordinary remedy is disciplinary action against the lawyer and remedial notice to class members,not denial of class certification.id.
considering the ambiguity of the statute,busby counsel violation,if any,can not be considered a major violation as busby counsel could have reasonably believed that he had a prior professional relationship with busby.therefore,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that busby was an adequate representative of the proposed class.we affirm the district court determination that busby satisfied the four elements of rule a.
busby challenges the district court determination that she failed to satisfy the predominance and superiority requirements of rule b.
predominance 
under rule b,it is not necessary that all questions of fact or law be common,but only that some questions are common and that they predominate over individual questions.klay,at internal citations and quotations omitted.
here,the district court found that while the legal issues were the same for each putative plaintiff,the determination of liability would require individual analyses of the reasonableness of the charge for services provided,rendering class treatment inappropriate.the district court reached this conclusion based on hud sop and case law,such as heimmermann,which addressed ysps under respa a.
the district court concluded that like ysp cases,the required test for whether the payment violates respa turns on whether the total compensation received here by realtyso
