discussion 
in pioneer,supra,cal th,d,the california supreme court addressed the question of whether to use an or notice for precertification discovery of potential class members in a putative class action suit.the potential class members in pioneer were individuals who had complained to pioneer that its dvd players were defective.the california supreme court concluded that under the circumstances presented,an notice was sufficient to protect the privacy rights of the dvd purchasers.pioneer,supra,cal th at,d.
