amscan holdings.party city corporation and acquisition corporation collectively party city appeal from the trial court order awarding in attorney fees and costs to class counsel after approving a settlement of coordinated cases alleging party city had violated the song beverly credit card act of,et.the settlement provided for distribution of in merchandise certificates to individuals who had used a credit card to purchase any item from a party city store in california between february,and march,and whose zip code was requested and recorded as part of the transaction.
party city contends class counsel failed to submit sufficient evidence to justify the fee award and,in particular,did not demonstrate the time expended by the six law firms involved was reasonably necessary and nonduplicative.party city also argues the trial court in camera review of class counsel billing records to support the award was fundamentally unfair and denied it due process.we agree it was improper for the court to rely upon billing information not provided to party city and which party city had no opportunity to challenge.we reverse the fee and cost award and remand the matter for a new fee hearing at which class counsel presents,and the trial court considers,only evidence made available to party city.
factual and procedural background 
the class action complaints,mediation and settlement 
civil code section section prohibits retailers from requesting or requiring as a condition of accepting a credit card as payment that the cardholder provide personal identification information that is then recorded on the credit card form or otherwise.in pineda williams sonoma stores,cal th,the supreme court held a zip code constitutes personal identification information as that phrase is used in section and requesting and recording a cardholder zip code during a credit card transaction is unlawful even if no other information is provided.
the opinion in pineda williams sonoma stores,was issued on february.on the following court day an,complaint was filed in los angeles superior court initiating montion garcia party city corporation,a putative class action alleging party city had violated section by routinely requiring customers to provide zip code information to complete credit card purchases.the proposed class consisted of all individuals in california who had used a credit card for the payment of goods purchased from party city during the period prior to the filing of the complaint.
two days later hernandez party city corporation was filed in san diego county superior court with substantially similar allegations in a page,complaint on behalf of a similarly defined statewide class.the following week concepcion amscan holdings,was filed in placer county superior court containing the same basic allegations,class definition and single cause of action for violation of section a parallel federal class action lawsuit was filed the same week in the united states district court for the central district of california,landeros party city corporation,dmg ffmx.the final complaint,shughrou amscan holdings,was filed several months later,also in placer county.
party city demurred in both hernandez and concepcion,seeking to abate the actions on the ground another,earlier filed action montion garcia was pending and also sought to dismiss or stay the federal action.on june,the district court ruled the federal case should proceed.on june,the initial three state court cases were coordinated in los angeles county superior court jccp,and party city withdrew its demurrers.on december,shughrou amscan holdings,was joined as an case to the coordinated action.
no formal discovery was conducted in the state actions prior to their settlement.however,party city made available to class counsel the written discovery produced in the federal action pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.no class certification motions were filed.
a mediation was conducted on january.one mediation brief was submitted on behalf of all plaintiffs in the four coordinated state actions and the related federal case.with the assistance of the mediator the parties reached a tentative settlement.
party city provided an initial draft of the settlement agreement the parties negotiated revised language and plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion for preliminary approval of class settlement on may.the agreement defined the settlement class as all persons who had purchased merchandise from party city stores in california using a credit card between february,and march,and whose personal information,including but not limited to a zip code,was requested and recorded in connection with the credit card transaction.during this period party city engaged in approximately credit card transactions.the agreement explained that party city discontinued collection of zip codes in early,did not combine the zip codes with any other information about the customer and did not use the zip codes to obtain additional information about the customer.the agreement provided that settlement class members who submitted a valid claim would receive a merchandise certificate not a gift card for up to off a single purchase with no minimum purchase required.party city agreed to issue a total of in certificates and to bear all costs of providing class notice,as well as all costs associated with the administration of the settlement agreement.the parties subsequently clarified that administration fees,attorney fees and costs are separate and independent of the award to the class.
the parties agreed the court could make an incentive award to each of the class representatives of.however,no agreement was reached as to the amount of attorney fees and costs to be recovered by class counsel.the settlement agreement provided,the parties have met and conferred through negotiations and agreed that class counsel shall be entitled to an award of attorneys fees and that class counsel shall file a motion with the jccp court for attorneys fees,and defendant will have the opportunity to oppose the motion as to the amount of attorneys fees sought.
the trial court preliminarily approved the class settlement on october.the order set a final approval hearing for january.
the motion for attorney fees,costs and incentive awards 
on december,class counsel filed a motion for attorney fees and costs,as well as incentive awards to the representative plaintiffs of,with a hearing date of january.the motion sought fees under both the terms of the settlement agreement and the private attorney general doctrine codified in code of civil procedure section 
class counsel requested an aggregate award of attorney fees and costs of.their moving papers,including declarations from attorneys at each of the law firms representing plaintiffs in the five lawsuits that had been filed,reflected a total of hours in prosecuting the action to date.the amount of the award was based on the lodestar method the time spent multiplied by the reasonable hourly compensation for the attorney involved without an additional multiplier.the hourly rates claimed ranged from per hour for one of the most experienced partners to per hour for several associates.an hourly rate was included for each lawyer.costs incurred through the date of the motion totaled.
in his declaration gene stonebarger of stonebarger law,apc,counsel for concepcion,used nine general categories to organize and describe the total hours of work performed by him and two associates.stonebarger stated he had personally spent hours at the rate of per hour one associate had spent hours at the rate of per hour and a second associate had spent hours at the rate of per hour 
mark van buskirk on behalf of westrup klick,llp,counsel for montion garcia,testified his firm had spent a total of hours on the cases,which he summarized in categories.no breakdown was provided by van buskirk.tim hoffman of hoffman lazear,counsel for landeros,used nine categories and specified the total time billed by each of the four firm lawyers who had worked on the matter more than hours for the firm.elaine ryan of bonnett,fairbourn,friedman balint,counsel for hernandez,reported a total of hours in six categories.the total time billed by each of the four firm lawyers was provided.ryan also explained her firm had associated with james drimmer in san diego,who spent a total of hours in six general categories of work.finally,james patterson of the patterson law group,counsel for shughrou,used eight of the nine categories identified by stonebarger and declared he had spent hours and a second firm lawyer hours prosecuting the case.stonebarger and all but one of the other declarants offered to provide their firms daily billing records for in camera review if the court requested them.
party city agreed class counsel was entitled to fair compensation but opposed the motion on the ground the fees and costs claimed were excessive,the time charges duplicative and the declarations inadequate and subject to proper evidentiary objections.party city,noting the amount sought in fees was more than the face value of the settlement itself,suggested the award be no more than,the value billed by party city counsel and approximately percent of the award to the settlement class,giving the merchandise certificates full value objections were filed to each of the declarations submitted by class counsel,primarily on grounds of lack of personal knowledge,hearsay and lack of foundation.class counsel filed a reply memorandum,arguing they had adequately supported their fee application and repeating the offer to submit detailed billing records for in camera review.no additional evidence was submitted with the reply memorandum.
the tentative ruling 
the january,hearing was continued to january.the january,proceedings were not reported.the court provided the parties with a tentative ruling that indicated the court was inclined,in part,to defer ruling on the motion for attorney fees,finding that an award of fees was not justified under code of civil procedure section and explaining,in order to determine that lodestar amount is reasonable,plaintiff s counsel to provide in camera the detail of hours expended in the litigation to assess whether the hours claimed were necessary and nonduplicative and to defer a final ruling on total costs but finding that of the costs claimed were not recoverable,could be recovered.class counsel was to submit further documentation to demonstrate the remaining sought was reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation and reasonable in amount.
with respect to the lodestar calculation the court tentative ruling stated,it is apparent that all five firms utilized skill in prosecuting the case.it is also apparent that counsel spent significant time on the case however,the hours in prosecuting this case seems to be very high there is nothing currently before the court to assess whether the time expended by the five firms involved in this case was necessary and.the block entries provided by five class counsel declarations above do nothing to remedy this issue.this is especially important here,given the fact that the five cases contained essentially the same allegations with regard to party city alleged former zip code policy under these circumstances,counsel should be prepared to submit time records for in camera review,and to justify why the time requested by class counsel is not duplicative.
a minute order entered january,reflects that the court issued its tentative ruling and called the matter for hearing.the minute order then states,parties are to file declarations on or before february.the matter was continued to february.
the supplemental declarations 
on february,additional declarations were filed by van buskirk,hoffman,stonebarger,patterson and ryan.drimmer also filed a declaration.stonebarger declared that his firm had assumed the role of lead counsel in prosecuting the action since its beginning and had taken the lead role in drafting and filing pleadings and briefs,including the petition for coordination,mediation brief,motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement,motion for attorneys fees,costs and incentive awards and reply to defendants opposition thereof,and motion for final approval of class action settlement.he also stated he had spent an additional hours and his associate an additional hours since the prior submission,bringing his firm total to hours.he included as an exhibit detailed time records for in camera review.the declaration itself contained an unredacted and detailed description of expenses incurred in connection with the case.
ryan declared,from its inception,her firm had assumed a primary role in the litigation and settlement of this case including,inter alia,the formulation of plaintiffs litigation strategy,conducting legal and factual research,drafting and editing of pleadings and submissions to the court,and preparing discovery requests.my firm also took a primary role in all settlement negotiations and the mediation before judge infante and in preparing the settlement documents.although her original declaration had reported a total of hours in six categories,the amended declaration stated hours had been billed.detailed time and cost records were provided to the court for in camera review.
drimmer,whose fee claim had originally been included in ryan declaration,provided a six category summary of his hours and explained he was primarily responsible for all client communications with plaintiff lesley hernandez.it does not appear that drimmer provided any billing records for in camera review.
patterson declaration explained he and his firm had worked closely with other plaintiffs counsel to avoid duplication of efforts.even though there are several counsel involved,my firm has a professional responsibility to our client to monitor all proceedings in the case independently of the work of other counsel we appeared by telephone at most hearings in order to minimize attorney time and travel costs.we did not duplicate research and drafting efforts.patterson stated he had spent an additional hours and his colleague at the firm an additional hours participating in the january,hearing,reviewing the ruling and preparing this declaration.detailed time and cost records were provided for in camera review.in his supplemental declaration van buskirk also provided detailed time and cost records.
finally,hoffman,counsel for plaintiff in the federal action,declared the time expended by his firm was neither duplicative nor cumulative of work done by other class counsel because my client,lourdes landeros,has a separate action pending from this action in united states district court the primary work in landeros case involved briefing an opposition to a motion to dismiss the case,which my firm was able to defeat.however,once the parties here agreed to the terms of a settlement on behalf of the class,and in the interests of judicial economy,landeros agreed to stay her federal action while this court decided whether to approve the settlement in this action.hoffman provided detailed time records for in camera review 
the final order for fees and costs 
at the continued hearing on february,van buskirk appeared in person and stonebarger,patricia syverson of bonnett,fairbourn,friedman balint ryan law firm and counsel for party city appeared by telephone.after calling the case,the court stated,this is actually a continuation of the fairness hearing.since then counsel has submitted supplemental information including time sheets and time records that have been submitted in camera to the court.everything is in order.the court approves the settlement.it is signing an order granting final approval of the class action settlement is signing an order granting the motion for attorneys fees,costs,and incentive awards as requested.so that comes to attorneys fees in the amount of incentive awards in the amount of to each named plaintiff and costs of which is what the court believes you have requested.so you getting everything you requested.
the court then discussed with class counsel appearing at the hearing a procedure for dividing the total fees awarded among the firms representing the class since the amounts identified totaled more than.at the conclusion of that discussion the court asked,anything else we need to discuss van buskirk responded,nothing further your honor.no other counsel spoke at that point.after thanking counsel,the court recessed the hearing.
the minute order for february,directed the parties to submit a revised order granting the attorney fee and costs motion.the final order granting the motion for attorney fees,costs and incentive awards was signed by the court and filed february.it provided a total of in fees and costs and set forth an allocation of fees and costs to each of the six law firms including drimmer that had represented the class.

the lodestar method for assessing reasonable attorney fees 
class counsel and party city agree the attorney fee award in this case must be grounded in the first instance on the number of hours reasonably worked multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate for each lawyer involved the lodestar figure t he fee setting inquiry in california ordinarily begins with the lodestar,the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.california courts have consistently held that a computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys fee award.plcm group,drexler,supra,cal th at accord,serrano priest cal d,fn.t he starting point of every fee award,once it is recognized that the court role in equity is to provide just compensation for the attorney,must be a calculation of the attorney services in terms of the time he has expended on the case.
of particular significance here,this initial calculation requires the court to determine the reasonable,not actual,number of hours expended by counsel entitled to an award of fees.see enpalm,llc teitler th,fn.thus,class counsel are not automatically entitled to all hours they claim in their request for fees.they must prove the hours they sought were reasonable and necessary.el escorial owners dlc plastering,th.the evidence should allow the court to consider whether the case was overstaffed,how much time the attorneys spent on particular claims,and whether the hours were reasonably expended.christian research institute alnor th.indeed,a fee request that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether.serrano unruh cal d,accord,chavez city of los angeles cal th,see also ketchum moses,supra,cal th at i n referring to reasonable compensation,we indicated that trial courts must carefully review attorney documentation of hours expended padding in the form of inefficient or duplicative efforts is not subject to compensation.
after making the lodestar calculation,the court may augment or diminish that amount based on a number of factors specific to the case before it,including the novelty and difficulty of the case,the attorneys skill in presenting the issues,the amount involved and degree of success achieved,the extent to which the case precluded the attorneys from accepting other work and the contingent nature of the work.see plcm group,drexler,supra,cal th,serrano priest,supra,cal d at.there is no rule limiting the factors that may justify an exercise of judicial discretion to increase or decrease a lodestar calculation.thayer wells fargo bank th.the purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value for the particular action.ketchum moses,supra,cal th at see center for biological diversity county of san bernardino th.
although the court may consider the amount at issue in the litigation,as well as counsel relative success in achieving the client litigation objectives in adjusting the lodestar figure,the attorney fee award need not bear any specific relationship to the dollar amount of the recovery.see taylor nabors drilling usa,lp,th,affirming attorney fee award based on lodestar figure and multiplier in action under california fair employment and housing act with jury verdict for a ppellant has not cited any authority requiring that fee awards be proportional to the amount of damages recovered harman city and county of san francisco th,rejecting in awarding fees in civil rights action any requirement of proportionality of fees sought to verdict although recognizing the court may consider plaintiff success in determining the reasonableness of fees.
as discussed,class counsel did not seek to enhance or even to recover the full amount of the lodestar figure as they had calculated it their request for an aggregate award of fees and costs totaling was approximately percent below their lodestar figure of plus costs claimed of.
party city did not waive the right to appeal the award of attorney fees or forfeit their objection to the in camera procedure used by the trial court 
paragraph of the settlement agreement recited the parties agreement that class counsel was entitled to an award of attorney fees and provided a motion for fees would be filed by class counsel with the trial court referred to as the jccp court and party city would have the opportunity to oppose the motion as to the amount of fees requested.that paragraph also stated,defendant agrees to pay the attorneys fees and costs approved by the jccp court to plaintiffs counsel within seven days after the final settlement date.paragraph defines final settlement date,in part,to be either days after notice has been served of entry of the court final approval order and judgment if no appeal or request for review is filed or made in the jccp action,or,i f any appeal or request for review is filed or made in the jccp action as a result of a timely objection,days after notice has been served that the final approval order and judgment has been affirmed.
class counsel on behalf of respondents argue,because the final settlement date is extended only if an appeal is filed as a result of a timely objection,the right to appeal any aspect of the settlement agreement was granted only to class members who had submitted a timely objection.accordingly,they assert,party city did not reserve its right to appeal from the trial court order approving the amount of attorney fees and costs awarded to class counsel.
it is fundamental that any waiver of the right to appeal must be clear and express.guseinov burns th,accord,ruiz california state auto.inter ins.bureau th,waivers of right to appeal must be clear and explicit.any doubt will be resolved against a waiver of the right to appeal.guseinov,at bischel fire ins.exchange th.i f the parties to a contract want their agreement to encompass a waiver of the right to appeal from an anticipated judicial ruling,they must say so explicitly and unambiguously they can not leave their intent to be inferred from the language of the agreement.ruiz,at.
the language relied upon by respondents fails to satisfy these demanding criteria.nothing in the settlement agreement bound party city to accept the amount of fees and costs awarded by the trial court or clearly and expressly prohibited party city from challenging the fee order by an appeal to this court.
our conclusion there has been no waiver of party city right to appeal the trial court ruling on the amount of attorney fees and costs finds strong support in both lovett carrasco th a personal injury case and ruiz california state auto.inter ins.bureau,supra,th a recent deci
