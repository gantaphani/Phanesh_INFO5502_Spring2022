the parties in this wage and hour class action litigation entered into a million settlement agreement,providing for three payments of million to approved class members.after the initial million payment was distributed among approved class members,defendant and appellant rubio restaurants,rubio realized it had not provided the names of all potential class members to the settlement administrator.one hundred forty potential class members had not received notification of the settlement.
after postjudgment briefing and status conferences,the court ruled that the class members should receive notice and be folded into the settlement agreement.later,the judge reconsidered his ruling sua sponte and vacated it.in the same minute order,the judge,citing code of civil procedure section,subdivision a a i,then recused himself from any further proceedings in the matter,in the interests of justice.
named plaintiffs kerry bartlett bartlett and justin bates bates,the respondents herein,contend the appeal must be dismissed as taken from a nonappealable order.we reject this contention.the order in question is a postjudgment order from which an appeal may be taken.code civ,subd.a.
where the merits of the appeal are concerned,rubio contends that inasmuch as the judge was disqualified from hearing the matter,he did not have the authority to reconsider and vacate his ruling with respect to the treatment of the class members.in other words,rubio wants the earlier ruling concerning those persons to stand.however,the judge did not,as rubio suggests,simultaneously disqualify himself and vacate his prior ruling.rather,the judge undertook a sequential process.first,he reconsidered his ruling with respect to the class members,and chose to vacate that ruling.second,having both ruled and unruled,so to speak,with respect to those persons,the judge chose to recuse himself in the interests of justice.he had the authority to do so and his actions were not improper just because both rulings were contained within the body of a single minute order.
a judge,when taking actions sequentially,is not required to issue a separate minute order with respect to each respective action,and to file the minute orders one at a time.more specifically,if a judge makes one ruling in a case and thereafter chooses to recuse himself or herself from taking further action,he or she is not retroactively disqualified from taking the former action solely because both rulings are contained in one minute order.if the judge were disqualified under the law at the time he or she made the first ruling,that would be another thing altogether.but when the judge is not disqualified at the time of making the first ruling,the first ruling does not become void just because the judge later disqualifies himself or herself in the interests of justice and encapsulates both rulings in one minute order.
we also reject the secondary argument of rubio that the order vacating the prior ruling about the class members must be reversed because the judge erred in his reasoning.rubio has failed to address the judge power to reconsider his own orders sua sponte and has failed to address the standard of review on appeal.the order appealed from is affirmed in its entirety.
bartlett and bates commenced wage and hour class action lawsuits against rubio in,and the lawsuits were later consolidated.a class action settlement was reached in march.under the terms of the settlement agreement,rubio agreed to pay a total of million,in three million payments.the monies were to be paid to two sets of class members,comprised of assistant managers and general managers.
in april,rubio sent the settlement administrator a list identifying potential class members.the settlement administrator then notified those persons of their rights under the settlement agreement.five hundred persons submitted valid claims,including persons who had received notice from the settlement administrator and who had not received notice but who nonetheless had learned of the settlement and had demonstrated their status as eligible class members.
in june,the court,by judgment,approved the settlement agreement.the judgment stated in part this court will have continuing jurisdiction over this matter until all obligations outlined in the settlement agreement have been complied with and thereafter if any issues pertaining to this case settlement arise.
rubio made the first million payment,and the monies were disbursed to the class members holding valid claims.the problems arose thereafter when,in december,rubio learned that it had omitted names from the list of potential class members it had delivered to the settlement administrator in april.of those persons had already identified themselves to the settlement administrator and were already participating in the settlement.the treatment of the remaining persons the settlement agreement is now at issue,albeit in a circuitous way.
the parties having been unsuccessful in reaching agreement as to how to handle the matter,rubio,in may,informed the court of the problem.it also alerted the court to the fact that the second million payment was coming due in december.the court held multiple status conferences on the matter and asked the parties for briefing.
at the september,status conference,the court ruled that the class members would be included in the settlement,and that they would be given notice of the settlement and a chance to opt out.the court also ruled that additional notice would be given to the existing participants,who would be given an opportunity to opt out,upon repayment of the money they had received.the court then ordered counsel for rubio to prepare the order,but no formal order was signed.
on october,bartlett and bates filed a motion for reconsideration,or in the alternative,a request to recuse the judge pursuant to code of civil procedure section and a request to be relieved as class counsel for the class members.the court took the motion under submission on october.
the first page of the minute order dated october,stated that the court had considered the oral and written arguments of the parties,and ruled as stated on the attached ruling.the attached ruling,constituting the second and third pages of the minute order,stated in part,under paragraph,a on its own motion sua sponte pursuant to the holding in le francois goel cal th,d,the court will reconsider the oral ruling of september.b upon reconsideration,the court ruling of september is vacated.under paragraph,the court stated the court has stricken the filed by counsel for the plaintiff as being untimely.while this court does not consider itself prejudiced against any party or attorney in this proceeding,in the interests of justice under a a i the court hereby recuses itself.the first page of the minute order,after the direction to see the attached ruling,states the court recuses itself for the following reason pursuant to a a i.this matter is transferred to department for reassignment purposes only.
rubio filed a notice of appeal from the october,minute order,challenging the portion of the order vacating the september,ruling about the treatment of the class members.it also filed a motion to augment the record on appeal.bartlett and bates filed a motion to dismiss.

motion to dismiss 
bartlett and bates assert that rubio is endeavoring to take an appeal from a nonappealable order.they characterize the appeal as being from a mere order after a status conference,not an appealable postjudgment order.we disagree.
