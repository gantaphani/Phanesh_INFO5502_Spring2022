sony electronics sony petitions for a peremptory writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate an order certifying a class in this action,which alleges that sony vaio grx series notebook computers suffer from a manufacturing defect.sony contends that the class as designated by the court is not sufficiently ascertainable to support certification.we agree that the class certified by the trial court is flawed and grant the petition.
factual and procedural background 
in may,martin hapner purchased a vaio notebook computer.he experienced repeated problems with the laptop and in july filed this action against sony in the superior court of santa cruz county.the complaint alleged that sony had marketed and distributed grx series notebook computers,knowing that the computers had defective memory chip sockets,but without disclosing such defects to consumers the complaint asserted causes of action for violation of the unfair competition law bus,et,false advertising,violations of the consumer legal remedies act,et,breach of express warranty and violations of the consumer warranty act,et.based on a stipulation of the parties,the case was subsequently transferred to the san diego county superior court.
in october,hapner filed a motion for certification of a class consisting of a ll persons or entities in the united states who purchased sony vaio grx series notebook computers but excluding sony,its affiliates,employees,officers and directors,persons or entities that distribute or sell vaio grx laptop computers and the court the excluded persons.the motion also sought to have the court designate a consisting of a ll class members who purchased the grx series notebook computers in the state of california.the motion argued that the computers suffered from a defect specifically,the inadequate soldering of connector pins located on their memory slots which prevented many of them from properly booting,starting the operating system when turned on or utilizing their memory.
in support of his motion,hapner presented evidence that the series notebooks manufactured in the spring of suffered from an annualized failure rate of percent from any cause,which was well above sony accepted failure rate of less than percent,and that to percent of the series models that were sent to sony for repair from january to july of suffered from no boot or memory problems.he also introduced an internal company memorandum by a sony engineer identifying models from the series that were affected by motherboard related issues and recommending an extension of the express warranty period for those models the memorandum identified the affected models as the,and models manufactured in the spring of,all of which had japanese motherboards,and the,and models that were manufactured in the summer of using japanese motherboards.
hapner introduced documents showing that sony ultimately characterized the memory slot problem as a design defect and that the company had its design engineering team analyze the problem.there was additional evidence that sony refused to offer repairs to owners of grx series notebooks that were still under warranty even after it issued an internal service bulletin in the summer of directing that any,or notebook returned for work be resoldered,irrespective of the reason why the computer was sent for repair.finally,hapner also introduced evidence of the problems he had had with his own notebook computer,sony response to his inquiries and the steps he took to have the computer repaired.
sony opposed the motion,contending hapner had not shown either that common issues of fact and law predominated or that there was an ascertainable class.on the first point,sony contended that there was no common soldering defect in all of the grx series notebook computers and that the symptoms of the alleged manufacturing defect could result from numerous causes other than inadequate soldering,thus making individual issues predominant over issues.it submitted evidence describing possible causes for and errors like those hapner experienced,but which resulted from circumstances other than inadequate soldering and argued that there was no evidence the and series notebook computers suffered from the alleged manufacturing defect.as to the second prerequisite for a class action,sony argued the proposed class was not ascertainable because it included persons who lacked viable claims including persons whose computers do not have any defects,persons who had their computers repaired under warranty or persons who bought their computers used,as is or in a refurbished condition.
in february,the court declined hapner request that it certify a class of all united states purchasers of vaio grx series notebook computers because of insufficient commonality of claims,but partially granted his motion,certifying the following class and subclasses 
class all persons or entities in the united states who are original purchasers of sony vaio grx notebook computers from sony or from an authorized reseller,and in which the memory connector pins for either of the two memory slots were inadequately soldered,impeding the recognition of installed memory causing boot failures,and other problems.excluded from this class are the following sony including its affiliates,employees,officers and directors persons or entities which distribute or sell sony vaio grx notebook computers the court and purchasers who had the solder points repaired by sony at no cost under the express warranty and who no longer experience boot failures and other problems related to inadequate soldering of the memory connector pins.
a for purposes of the third cause of action for violations of the consumer legal remedies act all class members who are consumers as defined by california civil code section,subdivision d.
b for purposes of the fifth cause of action for violations of the consumer warranty act all class members who purchased sony vaio grx notebook computers in the state of california,and who bought their computers primarily for personal,family,or household purposes as defined by california civil code section,subdivision a.
in its ruling,the court expressed concern regarding the manageability of the class as so defined and requested briefing from the parties on that issue.
hapner filed a brief asserting that the certified class was manageable.he contended that class members would be identifiable through sony consumer and service repair databases and additional discovery and that notice would be given by mail to the persons so identified and by publication of notice in print media designed to reach laptop purchasers.he also argued that since the action was structured as an class action,one in which class members are included in the class unless they affirmatively,it was not critical to be able to identify class members at that point in the proceedings.hapner averred that discovery would only take an additional five months and that thereafter trial could proceed on a bifurcated basis,with a liability phase which he planned to base on sony own documents,percipient witness testimony by him and sony representatives and expert testimony and a damages phase which he planned to base on expert presentation of data,including annualized failure rates,repair or replacement costs and product purchase price information.
sony brief argued that the certified class was unmanageable because the court definition of the class made class membership dependent on a determination of liability and that such a definition made it impossible to determine who was a member of the class for purposes of sending notice of the action.it also pointed out that even if notice was sent,recipients thereof would not be able to tell whether they were part of the class without having their computers dismantled and analyzed to determine if the computers suffered from inadequate soldering.
sony reported that there were two other virtually identical actions,one in superior court and one in district court,pending against it in san diego lieber sony electronics,super.san diego county,no.arabian sony electronics,and contended that michael lieber was proposing to represent a class of grx
