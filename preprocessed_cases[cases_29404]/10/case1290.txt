appellants seek reversal of the district court grant of summary judgment on their title vii and battery claims.we conclude that they have failed to make a prima facie showing of discrimination under title vii,and to offer evidence of the commission of a battery sufficient to survive summary judgment.with respect to the title vii claim,we hold in the alternative that appellees had a legitimate reason for the actions they took and that such reason was.accordingly,we affirm.
in october,mike colbern,a retired major league baseball player brought a class action on behalf of himself and other retired baseball players against major league baseball mlb claiming,in pertinent part,that mlb had violated title vii by excluding them from medical and supplemental income plans devised by mlb for former negro league players,and committed battery by subjecting them to a dangerous regimen of cortisone shots and other drugs without their informed consent.appellants are virtually all caucasian former mlb players who played in the major leagues for less than four years between and and were accordingly denied mlb pension and medical benefits 
until,when jackie robinson broke the color barrier in the major leagues,were not allowed to play major league baseball and could play only in the negro leagues,associations of professional baseball clubs composed exclusively of black players.these clubs terminated all operations in the early as a result of the absorption of into mlb,and the negro leagues ceased to exist.with the coming of racial integration to baseball,the market for a separate league for minority players evaporated.having lost their economic base,the former negro leagues were unable to offer any pension or medical benefits to their former players.in the,seeking to make partial amends for its exclusion of prior to,mlb voluntarily decided to provide certain benefits to former negro league players in,mlb created a plan that provided medical coverage to former negro league players negro league medical plan.in,it adopted a supplemental income plan that provided an annual payment of to eligible players negro league supplemental income plan.individuals who had played in the negro leagues prior to,prior to being allowed in the major leagues,were eligible for such payments for ease of reference,these two plans are referred to collectively as the negro league plans.some of the eligible players had subsequently played in the major leagues for a period of time too short to qualify them for mlb regular medical and pension plans and some had never played in the major leagues at all.
on august,appellants filed a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc charging that,in violation of title vii,mlb had arbitrarily,intentionally and unlawfully excluded them from the negro league plans on the basis of their race.the eeoc issued appellants a letter on august,and appellants brought suit in federal district court on october,joining the title vii charge with intentional battery,negligence,and claims.the intentional battery and negligence claims were wholly unrelated to any racial question but,instead,contained allegations that mlb team doctors and trainers had injected appellants with multiple cortisone shots and administered other drugs to them over the course of their careers and had deliberately failed to inform them of the potential risks associated with such treatment.
in response to appellants complaint,the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for summary judgment on january.on march,the district court held a hearing on the motion for summary judgment.at that hearing,the appellants withdrew their negligence,and claims.after hearing arguments on the remaining title vii and battery claims,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment,concluding that there were no genuine issues as to any material facts and that defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.appellants timely appealed,contending that the district court erred in granting summary judgment as to both the title vii claim and the battery claim.we have jurisdiction over the appeal under.

appellants contend that mlb provision of medical and supplemental income benefits to certain,former negro league players who played in the major leagues between for too short a period to vest in the mlb medical and pension benefits not to unlawful discrimination on the basis of race.specifically,they allege disparate treatment in the provision of these benefits in violation of title vii.to survive summary judgment on their title vii claim,appellants must first make a prima facie case of such treatment.in order to do so,appellants must show that they belonged to a protected class they were qualified for their jobs they were subjected to an adverse employment action and similarly situated employees not in their protected class received more favorable treatment.see kang lim,cir.appellants meet the first two criteria,which are not in dispute they can not satisfy the latter two criteria,however,and thus we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment as to their title vii claim see leong potter,cir holding that the district court properly granted summary judgment where plaintiff could not demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination.alternatively,we hold that mlb had a legitimate reason for adopting the two benefit plans,a reason that was.
the alleged adverse employment action on which appellants base their title vii claim is mlb failure to provide them with the same medical and supplemental income benefits that it provides to former negro league players who,like appellants,served in the major leagues during the period but did not play long enough to vest under the mlb benefits programs in effect at the time.appellants are correct that title vii prohibition on discrimination in the terms,conditions,or privileges of employment encompasses certain benefits that an employer is under no obligation to furnish by any express or implied contract.hishon king spalding,d internal quotation marks omitted a benefit,though not a contractual right of employment,may qualify as a privilege of employment under title vii.second alteration in original.in certain circumstances,voluntary medical or pension programs can be benefits,the provision of which must comply with title vii.appellants are incorrect,however,in their assertion that mlb negro league plans constitute such benefits.as hishon,the governing case in this area,and other related cases make clear,employers provision of benefits that they are under no obligation to provide can give rise to a disparate treatment claim under title vii,but only if the benefits are awarded on the basis of an employment relationship.see hishon,at.describing benefits that constitute privileges of employment and thus are subject to title those that are part and parcel of the employment relationship or comprise the incidents of employment see also judie hamilton,cir describing the benefit that is a privilege of employment subject to title vii as part and parcel of a n employee job.
although some beneficiaries of the two negro league plans may have played mlb baseball for a relatively short period of time,eligibility for benefits is not based on such former employment with mlb or on any employment relationship between mlb and the recipients.rather,to qualify for the negro league plans,a recipient need not be a former mlb player,only a former negro league player.a former negro league player who never played for an mlb team is eligible for the benefits even though he was never employed in any way by mlb or one of its clubs thus,although they resemble benefits typically conferred on the basis of an employment relationship,the negro league plans benefits are not part and parcel of the employment relationship between recipients and mlb nor are they incidents of employment of the recipient by mlb because the supplemental income payments and medical benefits mlb provides to former negro league players are not awarded on the basis of an employment relationship with mlb,but rather on the basis of participation in another entity to which mlb had no legal relationship,the receipt of these benefits can not give rise to a valid title vii claim.in other words,the fact that the appellants do not receive the same or substantially similar benefits as those provided under the negro league plans can not be considered an adverse employment action because the provision of these benefits by the mlb is not an employment action at all.appellants therefore can not satisfy the critical third prong for making a prima facie case under title vii.
similarly,in determining whether summary judgment is appropriate,we may assess independently the question whether the former players receiving the benefits are similarly situated to appellants.in order to show that the employees allegedly receiving more favorable treatment are similarly situated the fourth element necessary to establish a prima facie case under title vii,the individuals seeking relief must demonstrate,at the least,that they are similarly situated to those employees in all material respects.see aragon republic silver state disposal,cir citing with approval the second circuit opinion in mcguinness lincoln hall,cir which stated that similarly situated means that employees must be similarly situated in all material respects as explaining the minimal showing necessary to establish were similarly situated see also ercegovich goodyear tire rubber,cir holding that the plaintiff must show that the comparables are in all respects citation and internal quotation marks omitted lynn deaconess med.campus,cir requiring that employees be similarly situated in all relevant respects citation and internal quotation marks omitted.appellants have failed to demonstrate they are similarly situated in all material respects to the former negro league players they assert are receiving more favorable treatment,and thus they can not establish a prima facie case of discrimination under title vii.
appellants argue that they are similarly situated treated less favorably former negro league players who also played in the major leagues between but receive medical and supplemental income benefits under the negro league plans despite,like appellants,having served in the major leagues for too short a period to meet the vesting requirements in effect at the time for the mlb medical and pension plans.although there are indeed some similarities between appellants circumstances and that of the players to whom they compare themselves,the two groups are not similar in all material respects.unlike the beneficiaries of the negro league plans,appellants were never prevented from playing for a mlb team,and thus unable to acquire the necessary longevity,for reasons entirely independent of their ability to do the job,on account of their race.nor did appellants ever play in the negro leagues,a primary requirement for eligibility under the negro league plans.
mlb absolute ban on players before impeded those players from accumulating the necessary years of service in the major leagues to qualify for the medical and pension benefits under the terms of the mlb benefits plans in effect at the time for instance,an baseball player who had the ability to play five years of baseball at the professional level in the period would have been able to play only three seasons on a mlb team as a result of the ban the other two years would have been spent in the negro leagues and thus would not have been able to qualify for the mlb medical and pension plans under the terms in effect at the time,whereas a white player equal in all respects would have been able to play all five years on a mlb team and thus could have qualified for the medical and pension plans indeed,the motivation for mlb creation of the negro league plans was this fundamental difference in the ability of white and players who began their careers before to accumulate the necessary playing years to vest in the mlb medical and pension plans as a basic matter,in order to qualify for the benefits under the negro league plans,the players to whom the appellants seek to equate themselves must have played in the negro qualification that the appellants indisputably lack.as a result,the appellants are not similarly situated in all material respects to former negro league players who also played in the major leagues during the period and now receive medical and supplemental income benefits despite not having played for four or five years for an mlb team therefore,appellants have also failed to satisfy the fourth criterion for establishing a prima facie case under title vii,which in itself warrants the grant of summary judgment in favor of mlb.
in the alternative,we hold that mlb had a legitimate,and reason for awarding the pension and medical benefits to players who qualified under the plans,and not to appellants.that in itself would support the grant of summary judgment.see leong,at if the plaintiff in a title vii case establishes a prima facie case,the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment decision if the employer offers a nondiscriminatory reason,the burden returns to the plaintiff to show that the articulated reason is a pretext for discrimination.
the negro league plans were created to remedy specific discrimination that directly affected identifiable individuals and to compensate those individuals for injuries caused by that discrimination,specifically,for the loss of benefits by baseball loss that resulted from their inability to acquire the necessary years of playing time to qualify for mlb pension and medical benefits.the decision to provide benefits under the negro league plans only to individuals,all,who were injured by mlb policy of excluding members of their race from playing mlb baseball does not discriminate against caucasians.not only were caucasians the beneficiaries of the discriminatory policy they had every opportunity under it to acquire eligibility for the mlb benefits.appellants were never the victims of discrimination and were never deprived,during any portion of their playing years,of an opportunity to acquire the longevity necessary to become eligible for mlb benefits rather,they simply failed to do so.although the players who qualify under the negro league plans are all,it was and not caucasians who were discriminated against on the basis of their race.it is true that only players who played in the negro leagues are eligible to receive benefits under the plans.it is also true,however,that the negro leagues were formed to provide the opportunity to play professional baseball to those who were otherwise excluded because of their race.there is no evidence,and it would strain credulity and one sense of history,to suggest that appellants or any other caucasians sought entry to the negro leagues or would have been willing to play baseball in that forum.in short,the plans were adopted for the specific purpose of providing benefits to those who had been discriminated against by being denied the opportunity to play mlb baseball and to qualify for mlb benefits.
to the extent that mlb sought to remedy in part its past discriminatory conduct,it acted honorably and decently and not out of an improper or invidious motive.mlb has thus shown a legitimate,reason for its decision to provide benefits to former negro league players,a reason that is not pretextual in any respect.davis san francisco,cir holding that title vii was not violated when consent decree mandated affirmative relief to r
