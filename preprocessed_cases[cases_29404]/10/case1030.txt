appellants are a of moderately to severely disabled children who have moved to intervene in a class action brought on behalf of all disabled students in the los angeles unified school district lausd against lausd the chanda smith litigation appellants seek to intervene to challenge the legality of a new policy,adopted by lausd in as part of a renegotiation of the chanda smith parties settlement.that settlement requires a class of lausd most severely disabled students to go to the same schools as the district general,student body.lausd calls this integration appellants want their children to be schooled separately.a district court denied appellants motion to intervene.we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying appellants motion as untimely,and further erred when it found intervention unnecessary to protect appellants interest in ensuring the receipt of public education consistent with their disabilities and federal law.
summary of facts 
relevant statutory history and landscape 
we are called upon today to review only the district court denial of appellant motion to intervene,and therefore do not opine on whether the actions of lausd that prompted appellants to file their motions violated federal or state law.nevertheless,we can not ignore that at the core of this case is a fundamental disagreement as to the proper approach to education of a class of disabled children.thus the statutes upon which the present motion rests provide the basis of our analysis.
before,children with disabilities were often excluded from general public schools and required to attend separate school campuses comprised wholly or primarily of disabled children termed special education centers by lausd.c b.following claims that this allocation violated due process,see,mills bd.of educ.of the dist.of columbia,congress enacted the individuals with disabilities education act the idea.see,et.
the idea requires that a free appropriate public education a fape be made available to every disabled child a fape must be fashioned so as to accommodate an individual child disability.see id,a.to make an adequate fape,local education agencies must develop an individualized education program an iep for each disabled child.see id.d.an iep consists of a written statement setting forth the special services and aids the child needs to get a fape.see id.
the idea also has a preference for integration of disabled children in the general education schools.but such integration must be beneficial to the disabled child,given the nature and severity of his disability.this preference is found in the idea least restrictive environment lre requirement.it directs that a disabled child should attend regular classes with nondisabled children t o the maximum extent appropriate.id.a see also a i ii cal.at the same time,however,the idea endorses the removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment when the nature or severity of the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services can not be achieved satisfactorily.a see also poolaw bishop,cir in some cases,such as where the child handicap is particularly severe,it will be impossible to provide any meaningful education to the student in a mainstream environment.
consistent with this framework,california law requires educators to maintain a continuum of special education program options.see cal.this continuum include s,but is not limited to enrollment in state special schools also known as special education centers.see id.f.
b.the chanda smith litigation and outcome 
appellants seek to intervene in a class action lawsuit initiated in in the united states district court for the central district of california by chanda smith,a disabled student then enrolled in lausd.the professed purpose of that suit,brought on behalf of all similarly situated persons,was to bring the lausd special education program into compliance with federal law.the chanda smith plaintiffs sought a number of improvements in the provision of special education,including,to name a few the centralization and computerization of all students records,the provision of regular training to administrators as to their legal and professional obligations to students with disabilities,the r ecruiting and hiring of more credentialed special education personnel,and the provision of a full continuum of special education and related services to students with disabilities at sites as close to the home of such students as possible.that continuum was to include all of the following a general education classrooms with appropriate supplemental supports and services b a resource specialist program c nonpublic,nonsectarian school services and d state special schools pursuant to california education code section,among other options.this class action culminated in a consent decree negotiated between chanda smith counsel class counsel and lausd.the consent decree was framed in terms of general recommendations for improvements in areas such as those listed above,but lacked any quantifiable measurements by which to determine whether lausd should be deemed in compliance with the parties settlement.
a few years later,class counsel sought and obtained court approval of a plan that imposed more objectively quantifiable targets on lausd plan.among other things,plan called for the effective elimination of special education centers lausd appealed the district court ruling approving plan.in and while that appeal was pending,parents of children then enrolled in special education centers in lausd served class counsel with a motion to intervene.the motion to intervene asserted that plan elimination of special education centers violated the idea full continuum requirement by eliminating an important placement option for disabled children.
before that motion to intervene was filed with the district court,however,class counsel,lausd,and the intervenors submitted their dispute to mediation.class counsel agreed to withdraw plan.this mediation also led to the execution of a modified consent decree the mcd in,which reaffirmed t he parties agree ment that special education centers are part of the continuum of program options for a full continuum of special education and related services in the least restrictive environment.mcd.in lieu of eliminating special education centers,the mcd set forth an outcome.outcome required the district to increase the percentage of students with disabilities aged to,and who are to be placed in the general education setting for percent or more of the school day,from percent to percent by june,outcome also limited to percent those disabled students who were to spend more than percent of the instructional day in any of the following a special education classes at a general education facility,b a public special education center,c a school with a contract to provide special education services to lausd students non public schools,or d a private residence or hospital learning environment.the mcd also established an independent monitor to oversee the lausd progress in meeting this and other outcomes.
because outcome was directed to increasing the integration of disabled students in all four of the groups making up the percent into lausd general education classes,reduction of enrollment of disabled students in special education centers was but one of many ways lausd could achieve compliance with the mcd.indeed,lausd necessarily had to look elsewhere than to special education centers to comply with outcome not only because the mcd acknowledged the special education centers as an important part of the continuum of educational services available to disabled children,but also because enrollment in these centers accounted for a very small percentage of disabled student enrollment in lausd based on class counsel abandonment of its plan to eliminate special education centers and the language in the mcd which specifically guaranteed their retention,the parent group agreed not to intervene.
lausd initially made significant progress towards outcome.by september,placement of disabled children included in outcome in general education classes for at least percent of the school day had increased from percent to percent though it turned out that this reported progress was somewhat inflated declaration of frederick weintraub weintraub,the independent monitor.but as the pool of disabled students included in outcome who spent most or all of their day outside general education classes and schools dwindled,it became increasingly difficult for lausd to identify students for whom greater integration was possible and beneficial.
difficulties complying with outcome led to renewed negotiations in september between class counsel,the lausd,and the independent monitor,who ultimately adopted a modification to outcome termed outcome and outcome,or collectively,modified outcome.weintraub decl.modified outcome reduced the integration targets imposed by original outcome by exempting from compliance disabled students aged to and significantly reducing the percentage of students with orthopedic disabilities who were required to attend general education classes.
lausd remained unable to meet outcome,even as modified.the independent monitor ultimately concluded in its february,report that meeting modified outcome would require the arbitrary transfer of a significant number of students from special education centers to general education campuses,an approach the independent monitor had never endorsed,see,independent monitor annual report for the school year as noted in past reports,efforts to integrate special education students as required by outcome should be in the best interest of the student and not solely motivated by progress on this integration outcome.
commencing in october,yet another round of negotiations between the parties and the independent monitor ensued.this led to an amendment to the mcd memorialized in a stipulation executed september,renegotiated outcome.renegotiated outcome provided that lausd would be deemed fully compliant with modified outcome if it accomplished two new goals a a flat percent decrease in special education center enrollment by june and b integration of all s tudents with moderate to severe disabilities at schools into general education classes an average of of the instructional day and during lunch,and activities.as described in detail below,the implementation of renegotiated outcome in the school year brought substantial changes to the educational opportunities afforded children who attended or sought to attend special education centers in.by,over of lausd special education centers had been closed to enrollment to disabled children under the age of.parents of affected students were not invited to participate in the monitor negotiations,which commenced in october,supra,nor were their viewpoints solicited in the negotiation,adoption,or implementation phases of renegotiated outcome 
lausd did not start notifying parents of children affected by renegotiated outcome,or provide any information as to how it intended to accomplish renegotiated outcome dual mandates,until spring.as explained below,lausd notice varied significantly,but bore certain common themes.
appellants whose children had attended blend special education center for the blind blend were generally told during individual parent iep meetings in spring that placement at blend or any other special education center was no longer an option for their child the blend faculty and student body was being relocated in its entirety to a general education school.
about the same time,parents of children attending banneker special education center banneker were told that their school would be with avalon gardens elementary avalon gardens,a general education campus,starting in the school year.at the commencement of the school year,parents learned that this meant that students enrolled in banneker would be transported to avalon gardens for an average of percent of their instructional day for integration activities.in february after the motion to intervene at issue in this case was filed,banneker parents learned that lausd would be closing banneker altogether and relocating its student body to avalon gardens starting in the school year.see mina lee request for judicial notice lee rjn,exh.a,letter,exh.e march,letter from lausd explaining that banneker,which,among other things,had offered one of the district primary mentally retarded severe mrs programs for special education children,was being transitioned into a career transition center,a school that teaches vocational and basic living skills to young adults aged to 
notice to parents of disabled children attending lanterman special education center lanterman took the form of a field trip slip that was circulated to parents in the fall of about a year after the adoption of renegotiated outcome.the trip slip purported to seek temporary authorization to transport lanterman students to a general education school for an integration test.appellants have offered evidence that lausd used the field trip slips to justify the permanent and daily transportation of lanterman students to general education classes.
affidavits submitted by parents of children who were previously enrolled at lull special education center,lokrantz special education center,and mcbride special education center contain accounts similar to those described by blend and banneker parents.
aside from the different types of individualized notice related above,executive director of special education in lausd,sharyn howell,circulated a letter on may,to the lausd community the howell letter,announcing that modified outcome had been again renegotiated on september,and that,as a result,a reduc tion in the number of students with moderate to severe disabilities ages at segregated special education centers would occur.the howell letter indicated that four special education centers banneker,blend,mcbride,and miller would be affected in the school year.the letter further explained that all special education students would be sent to general education schools,rather than to special education centers.see aguilar decl.noting declining enrollment in several special education centers as a result of the district new policy against permitting new student enrollment see also berrios decl.stating the same.
as the howell letter indicated,was a year of great changes.even those proposed intervenors who received notice through iep meetings in spring that their children would receive integration opportunities in the coming school year were left uncertain as to the actual effects on them of renegotiated outcome.see,flores decl.many parents,particularly those for whom english is a second language,were incorrectly led to believe that the services and curriculum offered their children would remain the same despite the transfer to a new school.see,flores decl.flores decl.lee decl.chamu decl.many parents claim simply not to have appreciated the effects of the changes until their children began coming home after school with bruises and other injuries in late august and september of injuries appellants children suffered while in general education schools.see,flores decl.flores decl.hernandez decl.chamu decl.hernandez,exh.e photographs of injuries flores,exh.c photographs of injuries.parents also discovered in fall that the general education campuses to which their children and over other moderately to severely disabled children were being transferred had not been adapted,through tangible construction alterations,to provide a safe and effective learning environment,as memorialized in the independent monitor october report.see munoz rjn,exh,
these discoveries came shortly after small group meetings between stephen maseda who became counsel to the mina lee proposed intervenors,april munoz an appellant,unspecified lausd board members,howell,the independent monitor,and class counsel on august and,respectively.maseda decl.munoz decl.munoz and maseda concluded that neither lausd nor class counsel represented their interests or believed that special education centers should be a part of the continuum of special education opportunities available to disabled children in lausd.
on october,and october,and days after concluding their interests were not being represented by lausd or class counsel,respectively,two groups of parents the april munoz proposed intervenors and the mina lee proposed intervenors moved to intervene individually and on behalf of all other persons similarly situated as a matter of right,see fed.civ.proc.a,or,in the alternative,under rule b permissive intervention.appellants cases were consolidated,and the district court denied both motions on january.the court rejected appellants rule a motion to intervene as a matter of right as untimely or,alternatively,as unnecessary to protect appellants interests 
ii.legal analysis 
standard of review 
appellants appeal the denial of their motion to intervene as a matter of right pursuant to rule a.an applicant for intervention under rule a must establish four elements that the prospective intervenor motion is timely that the intervenor has a significantly protectable interest relating to the subject of the action,that the intervenor is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the intervenor ability to protect that interest and that such interest is inadequately represented by the parties to the action.freedom from religion,geithner,cir hereinafter ffrf.though the applicant bears the burden of establishing these elements,we have repeatedly instructed that the requirements for intervention are to be broadly interpreted in favor of intervention.united states alisal water,cir see also wilderness soc.forest,cir en banc noting that a liberal policy in favor of intervention serves both efficient resolution of issues and broadened access to the courts quoting united states city of los angeles,cir alteration in original.
a lower court denial of a motion to intervene is reviewed de novo,except that its timeliness determination is reviewed for abuse of discretion.alisal,at.a court abuses its discretion if it fails to apply the correct legal rule or standard.united states hinkson,cir en banc.and even i f the trial court identified the correct legal rule,we may find an abuse of discretion if the court application of that rule was illogical,implausible,or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
timeliness 
timeliness is determined by the totality of the circumstances facing intervenors,with a focus on three primary factors the stage of the proceeding at which an applicant seeks to intervene the prejudice to other parties and the reason for and length of the delay.alisal water,at.in analyzing these factors,however,courts should bear in mind that t he crucial date for assessing the timeliness of a motion to intervene is when proposed intervenors should have been aware that their interests would not be adequately protected by the existing parties.smith marsh,cir.as explained below,the district court analysis did not follow this basic principle.we accordingly hold that the court abused its discretion in finding appellants motions untimely under the totality of the circumstances of this case.
stage of the proceedings 
it is true that appellants seek to intervene in this action approximately twenty years after its commencement,and seventeen years after the adoption of the first consent decree.however,in analyzing the stage of the proceedings factor,the m ere lapse of time alone is not determinative.united states state of oregon,cir.where a change of circumstances occurs,and that change is the major reason for the motion to intervene,the stage of proceedings factor should be analyzed by reference to the change in circumstances,and not the commencement of the litigation.see id.
we previously applied this rule in state of oregon,where the state of idaho moved to intervene in litigation between the states of washington and oregon and various indian tribes,fifteen years after the commencement of that action in,and five years after a settlement had been reached in.id.at.notwithstanding the substantial lapse in time,we held that the stage of proceedings factor supported a finding of timeliness because a change of circumstance had occurred in two indian tribes had given notice of their intent to withdraw from the settlement or to renegotiate it which created the possibility of new and expanded negotiations.id.at.we concluded that this change in circumstances weighed in favor of a finding that the state of idaho august motion to intervene was timely.id.at holding that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion to intervene as untimely.
here,the district court conclusory determination that renegotiated outcome did not constitute a change in circumstances because it appears to be just another modification to the mcd aimed at further integration,was contrary to any plausible interpretation of the record.perhaps viewed as a progression towards integration,renegotiated outcome represented only another step in lausd march toward the goal of greater integration of disabled children in lausd schools attempts some successful,some not toward integration had been occurring since the adoption of the original consent decree.but the record demonstrates that renegotiated outcome caused a substantial change in the educational opportunities afforded the group of disabled students of the lausd who attended special education centers prior to namely,the group now seeking to intervene.
from to,lausd operated approximately special education centers throughout the school district,and it offered placement at those schools for children whose ieps so recommended.during that time,the placement of these students including,at times,the transfer of a student from a special education center to a general education school was conducted through assessments of individual students,by iep teams and with parental involvement and consent indeed,parents retained some influence over,and input into,their child placement,including the opportunity to object during the iep process to their child removal from a special education center see,efron decl.gliona decl,ayapana decl.
since renegotiated outcome,however,severely disabled children have been transferred en masse to general education campuses,over parental objections.at least of the special education centers have been closed to enrollment by appellants and similarly situated disabled students appellants have offered evidence that parents are not consulted in the development of their child iep.rather,they are told that placement in a special education center is no longer an option.if they disagree with a predetermined placement,their only recourse is to file an administrative appeal.see,maseda decl.lee decl.flores decl.flores decl.gliona decl,goldberg decl.starting in,lausd began conducting individual student and parent iep meetings with an attorney present.see gliona decl.gliona decl.whereas the mcd had stated that special education centers were an important part of the continuum of educational opportunities available to disabled children,lausd executive director of special education,sharyn howell,has now taken the position that special education centers are unnecessary because the district can provide all supports and services at a general education site.howell decl.
additionally,the record indicates that most,if not all,students formerly enrolled in special education centers regardless of whether their schools have been closed are now required to spend an average of percent of their instructional day in general education classes most frequently physical education,music,theater,and art classes.this curriculum change has been imposed on students whose individual ieps previously recommended placement in a special education center 
in short,if the possibility of negotiations constituted a change of circumstances in state of oregon,then lausd adoption of a flat quota requiring the reduction of special education center enrollment by percent,since it has led to an overhaul of lausd approach to educating its moderately to severely disabled students enrolled in special education centers in lausd,is all the more so a change in circumstances,at least as to appellants.
as in state of oregon,the adoption of renegotiated outcome in marked the commencement of a new stage in the chanda smith litigation.for purposes of the stage of proceedings analysis,it is critical that appellants have moved to intervene to challenge only renegotiated outcome and the manner by which it has been implemented in other words,the most current stage of the chanda smith litigation.appellants are not seeking to reopen decades of litigation.thus,it was error to measure the timeliness of appellants motions by reference to stages of litigation the change in circumstances that motivated appellants motion to intervene.see,natural resources defense council costle,cited with approval in state of oregon,at t he amount of time which has elapsed since the litigation began is not in itself the determinative test of timeliness.rather,the court should also look to the related circumstances,including the purpose for which intervention is sought first alteration in original in failing to analyze timeliness in light of the change in circumstances detailed above,the district court abused its discretion by failing to apply the correct legal rule.see hinkson,at.
our holding that renegotiated outcome constituted a change in circumstances is confined to the specific facts of this case.the systematic change in circumstances that occurred here,coupled with the fact that as discussed further below,appellants moved to intervene as soon as reasonably practicable following such change,serves to distinguish the present case from the sole authority cited by the district court,delaware valley citizens council for clean air commonwealth of pennsylvania,cir 
in sum,the stage of proceedings factor weighs in appellants favor.
prejudice to other parties 
we have previously held that prejudice to existing parties is the most important consideration in deciding whether a motion for intervention is untimely.state of oregon,at.we have also recognized that courts may find prejudice on the basis of factors for example,if granting a belated motion to intervene would threaten the delicate balance reached by existing parties after protracted negotiations,this factor may weigh against intervention.see,cty.of orange air,cir.however,we emphasized in state of oregon that the only prejudice that is relevant under this factor is that which flows from a prospective intervenor failure to intervene after he knew,or reasonably should have known,that his interests were not being adequately represented and not from the fact that including another party in the case might make resolution more difficult.at see also stallworth monsanto,cir with respect to the second factor,the district court again applied an incorrect legal standard.for the purpose of determining whether an application for intervention is timely,the relevant issue is not how much prejudice would result from allowing intervention,but rather how much prejudice would result from the intervenor failure to request intervention as soon as he knew or should have known of his interest in the case.
in state of oregon,various indian tribes and the states of washington and oregon argued that permitting the state of idaho to intervene in litigation fifteen years after the commencement of the litigation regarding the regulation of fishing would jeopardize the existing parties negotiations.at.we rejected this argument.we found no prejudice because the existing parties concerns have little to do with timeliness.they do not suggest that their problems are materially different now than they would have been had idaho sought to intervene a decade or more ago.id.at.we therefore reversed the lower court denial of the state of idaho motion to intervene.id.
as in state of oregon,the district court finding of prejudice here was untethered to any prejudice which was caused by appellants delay.the district court reasoned that permitting intervention would prolong the litigation,because it would upset the delicate balance the parties and the independent monitor have sought and achieved through careful negotiation and research in devising renegotiated outcome chronicling the lengthy negotiations of renegotiated outcome between class counsel,the independent monitor,and david rostetter,a special education expert,which culminated in renegotiated outcome.but this is merely an argument that permitting the parties who concluded they were detrimentally affected in by renegotiated outcome to participate in its negotiation and implementation would make achieving resolution more difficult,given the parties competing interests.because this would be true regardless of when the intervention occurred,it is unrelated to timeliness,and can not support a finding of prejudice under state of oregon.
the district court also cited lausd expenditure of resources in transferring special education students,programs,and resources to general education schools and campuses.that would be relevant had appellants failed to act in the face of reasonable notice from lausd of its plans to close special education centers en masse and had lausd invested significant resources in reliance on that delay.smith marsh,cir the crucial date for assessing the timeliness of a motion to intervene is when proposed intervenors should have been aware that their interests would not be adequately protected by the existing parties.
but that is not what happened here.lausd parents were excluded from the negotiations that led to the adoption of renegotiated outcome in september.and in the year between the adoption of renegotiated outcome and its initial implementation in august,appellants were consistently uninformed or misinformed as to the existence and true effects of renegotiated outcome the fifth circuit has recognized,and we agree,that existing parties can not complain about delay or prejudice caused by their own efforts to thwart the provision of meaningful notice to affected parties.see stallworth,at holding that a district court abused its discretion in finding a motion to intervene untimely where an existing party had previously prevented notice to affected parties.
that principle has particular application here,where the consequences of renegotiated outcome were uniquely within lausd knowledge and control,given that lausd was its implementing party.instead of clearly apprising affected parents as to how lausd intended to implement the changes precipitated by renegotiated outcome,lausd issued incomplete information throughout.as a result,the full extent of renegotiated outcome was not revealed until and well after appellants filing in fall of the supposedly untimely motion to intervene at issue in this appeal 
when our inquiry is properly narrowed to the prejudice attributable to appellants delay in moving to intervene after the time appellants knew,or reasonably should have known,that their interests were not being adequately represented by existing parties,the prejudice to existing parties becomes nominal at best.indeed,neither the district court nor lausd has pointed to any evidence whatsoever of additional costs or other prejudice suffered between august and october.the district court accordingly abused its discretion in concluding that this factor weighed against intervention.
reason for and length of the intervenor delay 
for the reasons already explained above,the district court erred to the extent it measured the length of appellants delay by reference to events the time at which proposed intervenors were reasonably on notice that their interests were not being adequately represented,see smith,at and certainly to the extent the court relied on events predating the change in circumstances that prompted appellants current motion to intervene.in state of oregon,for example,the changed circumstances giving rise to the motion to intervene occurred in when two of the tribes gave notice of their intent to withdraw from the plan or to renegotiate it.state of oregon,at.yet the proposed intervenors did not file until late august.id.despite at least an delay the opinion is not clear as to when in the tribes gave the notice referenced above nor when the state of idaho received that notice,we held that the reason for and length of delay factor weighed in favor of intervention.id.similarly here,appellants moved to intervene approximately one year after the change in circumstances prompting their motion but,as discussed below,only weeks after definitively learning that their interests were not adequately represented by the existing parties.
here,not only was the district court analysis contrary to law,it was contrary to the record before the court.for example,the district court concluded that appellants arguably have been on notice from the very beginning of this litigation.but how can that be true when many of the proposed intervenors children had not even been born at the inception of the litigation,let alone been born disabled 
the district court alternatively suggested that proposed intervenors have been on notice of this action since,when a group of parents served class counsel with an earlier motion to intervene.the court conclusions are logically fallacious because most of the proposed intervenors did not even have children enrolled in lausd in much less in when this litigation commenced appellants could not possibly have been on notice that their interests were not adequately represented prior to having any interest in this litigation at all.the district court analysis therefore incorrectly conflated the knowledge of an entirely different group of parents with appellants knowledge.
nor should the fact that the inclusion of special education students into the general education program has been a primary issue from the beginning of this case have placed appellants on notice that intervention was necessary to protect their interests prior to.both the consent decree and the mcd specifically required lausd to maintain special education centers throughout the district as placement options for moderately to severely disabled children.consistent with this mandate,lausd continued to operate approximately the same number of special education centers throughout the district from to.that lausd continued to offer placement in special education centers despite decades of discussions about greater integration of disabled children in the general education environment only contradicts the lower court conclusion that the same discussions should have placed appellants on notice that lausd planned to start closing special education centers en masse in and an action expressly prohibited by both the mcd and the consent decree 
in short,only the district court finding that appellants variously received some form of notice in april,may,or june of is reasonably supported by the record.even so,as discussed above,appellants had not been privy to the negotiations that led to renegotiated outcome,and the initial information promulgated by lausd as to the practical effects of renegotiated outcome was incomplete.appellants therefore convincingly urge that they did not realize until the august,meeting with class counsel that their interests were not being adequately represented by the existing parties to the chanda smith litigation.the district court even conceded that this could constitute a proper explanation for appellants delay at least until august.we have no reason to disturb the court finding in this regard.
however,the district court then proceeded to find no valid excuse for appellants additional delays of and days,respectively,between the august,meeting and the october and,filing dates of the motions to intervene.we again reject the district court analysis as contrary to law and an abuse of discretion in light of the record in this case.where as here both the first and second timeliness factors weigh in favor of intervention,we have found motions to be timely even in the face of longer delays than are present here see,state of oregon,at.
more importantly,the totality of the circumstances here demonstrates that appellants delay in filing between august and october of was justified.it bears noting,first of all,that only one appellant munoz appears to have been present at the august meetings.and in any event,the record is replete with evidence that perhaps in no small part due to the rosy language in which the changes were portrayed by lausd appellants reasonably did not appreciate the full import of renegotiated outcome,including the changes to their children curricula and learning environments,until classes actually began in august of,see,moreno decl.flores decl,buschini decl.aguilar decl.pineda decl.explaining that pineda did not realize the safety risk the new learning environment posed to pineda autistic son,until was found walking alone a mile from the school due to understaffing in classroom and the lack of special safety features at new general education campus,or until their children began coming home from school with injuries,see,flores decl,exh.c photographs of injuries flores decl.hernandez decl,exh.e photographs of injuries chamu decl.many parents initially attempted informal resolution of their disagreement with lausd as to their child placement.see,chamu decl,flores decl.buschini decl.several parents attended a meeting on september,at which they inquired about the new placement of their children.even after it became clear that intervention was necessary to protect appellants interests,it simply took time to organize and gather evidence to support appellants motions to intervene.appellants are not a sophisticated or unified body,but rather a consortium of parents of special education students.see stallworth,at explaining that the size and sophistication of the intervenor in that case,the naacp was a relevant factor in determining timeliness.at least one appellant required translation services to prepare the declaration submitted in support of one of the motions to intervene.see chamu,translator declaration.taken together,the district court conclusion that appellants had offered no valid excuse or explanation for their delay was contrary to the record and clearly erroneous.the district court therefore committed legal error in failing to find that the third timeliness factor weighs in favor of intervention.
notwithstanding our holding today,we emphasize that this factor can not be distilled into a rule.that is,a delay of or days might,under different circumstances,weigh against timeliness.we merely hold today that,in light of all the circumstances presented here,the district court abused its discretion in failing to recognize that appellants have justified their failure to move to intervene prior to.
because all three factors weigh in favor of timeliness,appellants have established the first element for intervention as a matter of right.
protectable interest 
second,appellants must show that they have a protectable interest in the chanda smith litigation.lausd does not challenge the district court finding that appellants have a protectable interest in receiving a free appropriate public education in conformity with their children ieps.see a a cal,et.we agree that this is a protectable interest and find the second element for rule a intervention to be established.
practical impairment 
third,appellants must show that they are so situated that the disposition of the action without appellants may as a practical matter impair or impede their ability to safeguard their protectable interest.as an alternative basis for denying appellants motion to intervene,the district court found that appellants would not suffer a practical impairment of their interest in receiving a fape in accordance with their ieps because the adoption of renegotiated outcome does not deprive appellants of special education centers as placement options or violate the iep assessment process.as a preliminary matter,we note that this statement is at least partly contradicted by the record a number of lausd former special education centers are no longer accepting enrollment of appellants children and similarly situated disabled students ages to.
more to the point,the district court reasoned that denying intervention would not practically impair appellants protectable interest,given the availability of individual,administrative due process proceedings for parents who disagree with lausd placement of their child.see cal,et we review the district court finding of no practical impairment to the putative class action intervenors because of the availability of individual remedies de novo,ffrf,at,and conclude that the district court erred.
courts have long recognized the benefits conferred by the class action mechanism over numerous individual actions.class actions are used to vindicate e the rights of groups of people who individually would be without effective strength to bring their opponents into court at all.amchem products,windsor,d.particularly where,as here,injunctive relief is sought,e conomic reality dictates that many challenges to lausd placement of disabled children must proceed as a class action or not at all.eisen carlisle jacquelin,d.in fact,a determination that the class action vehicle provides a superior mechanism for litigating lausd policies regarding the education of its disabled student population was already made at the commencement of the chanda smith litigation itself a class action.the denial of intervention here permits the chanda smith plaintiffs to pursue their education policy goals with the benefit of the class action mechanism,while denying appellants the same.this result does as a practical matter impair appellants ability to safeguard the interests of a of lausd students seeking retention of special education centers as placement options class counsel and lausd interest in eliminating them.the impairment is especially perverse given that appellants currently have children enrolled in lausd,while the named chanda smith plaintiffs children have long since left.
not only are individual administrative challenges a comparatively inefficient and ineffective means of achieving relief but the administrative proceedings permit appellants to challenge only the effects of renegotiated outcome on individual students not the legality of renegotiated outcome itself.see cal.due process hearings are available to resolve disagreements as to the proper placement of an individual child.a collateral challenge on renegotiated outcome is an inferior means of protecting the interests of lausd special education center population.even if appellants and every single special education student transferred to a general education campus pursuant to renegotiated outcome to date were able successfully to challenge that placement through the administrative process,and even to secure a court order requiring lausd to reopen each child special education center,renegotiated outcome would still mandate a percent reduction in the opportunity for enrollment in special education centers.thus,it would still require lausd to identify and transfer percent of the special education center student population to general education schools,in effect creating a revolving door of transfers between special and general education campuses.
of course,it is unlikely that all parents will undertake the time and monetary investment necessary to challenge lausd placement of their child.but that fact,again,leads us to conclude that the interests of the appellants seek to represent would be practically impaired if intervention is denied and parents of special education students are limited to individual challenges to lausd placement of their children.we accordingly hold that appellants interest in ensuring the availability of special education centers to lausd students to the extent consistent with iep and fape requirements would,as a practical matter,be impaired if intervention is denied and appellants are precluded from directly challenging the legality of renegotiated outcome in the chanda smith litigation.to the extent there is any doubt as to appellants establishment of this factor,our resolution of it in favor of intervention is consistent with the rule that the requirements for intervention are to be broadly interpreted in favor of intervention.alisal water,at.
inadequate representation 
there is no dispute that appellants interests are inadequately represented by the parties to this action the current parties interest in transferring students and resources from special education centers to general education campuses is diametrically opposed to appellants interest in retaining the system that was in place prior to renegotiated outcome.we have no difficulty finding this element met.trbovich united mine workers of,d noting that the fourth element of rule a intervention requires only a minimal showing that existing parties representation may be inadequate.
in sum,appellants have established all four elements of intervention as of right under rule a.
we accordingly reverse the district court denial of appellants motion to intervene and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

under plan,disabled children could comprise no more than percent of any school population.because special education centers are comprised heavily or wholly of disabled students,plan percent limitation would have effectively eliminated special education centers.the lausd objected to the plan by moving to modify stay portions of the consent decree.the district court denied lausd motion,which had the practical effect of approving plan.
notably,outcome excluded students with specific learning disabilities sld and speech and language impediments sli,the integration of whom was governed by outcome which is not at issue in the present litigation.the sld classification encompasses children with a severe discrepancy between intellectual ability and achievement in a particular area such as basic reading or mathematics due to a disorder in one or more basic psychological process,such as attention or visual processing.the sli classification encompasses children with speech impediments or language fluency issues not due to unfamiliarity with english.see iep eligibility,unified sch.dist.last visited.
in several years before the adoption of the consent decree only of the roughly students in lausd who received special education were enrolled in special education centers.by june,enrollment in special education centers had fallen to though enrollment in non public schools increased over the same time period.indeed,at least half the reduction in enrollment in special education centers from to was offset by increased enrollment in non public schools,enrollment in which increased percent between and from to.
a review of students actual class schedules revealed that administrators were overestimat ing the time disabled students were spending in general education classes in order to create the appearance that these targets were being met.see,independent monitor annual report for the school year.indeed,the independent monitor september,report noted three years of increasing overestimat ion of the number and percentage of students in the general education setting for or more of the day.the independent monitor annual report for the school year explained as noted in previous reports,a primary contributing factor to these discrepancies is that schools appear to be entering a percent of time below in special education without regard or consideration of the student actual class schedule.see also independent monitor annual report for the school year stating the same.
this would represent a reduction of approximately disabled students from schooling in special education centers,based on june enrollment statistics.
we remain unable to decipher the precise meaning of an amorphous term used by lausd in and to describe its implementation of renegotiated outcome.at times,lausd used the word in lieu of closed to refer to a special education center which has undergone the physical transfer of all its students and resources from the special education center to a general education school,with resp
