the plaintiffs,a class of indigent children who suffer from severe emotional and mental disabilities,commenced this action against idaho state officials more than three decades ago,alleging that the officials were providing them with inadequate care in violation of their constitutional and statutory rights.in the ensuing years,the parties reached agreements intended to remedy deficiencies in care,and those agreements were embodied in three consent decrees entered and monitored by the district court.
after a number of disputes had resulted in no less than four appeals to this court the district court in held a final compliance hearing to determine whether the defendants were in compliance with the terms of the decrees.the court determined that compliance would be measured by the defendants success in addressing action items that had been specified in an implementation plan that resulted from the third consent decree.because the court viewed civil contempt as the only effective method of enforcing the consent decrees,it placed the burden on the plaintiffs of establishing by clear and convincing evidence.at the conclusion of the hearing,the district court found that the defendants were not in compliance with respect to several of the action items,but that they had substantially complied with the majority of the items.the court ordered the defendants to take all steps necessary to bring themselves into substantial compliance with the action items for which they were in default,after which they could move to vacate the decrees.the defendants took the steps that they deemed necessary and moved to vacate the decrees.in,the district court found that the defendants had substantially complied with the remaining action items,and it issued an order vacating the consent decrees.
the plaintiffs appeal the order,asserting that it was error for the district court to apply the standard for civil contempt in determining whether to vacate the decrees.in applying that standard,the court required the plaintiffs to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendants had violated the terms of the decrees and that they had not done so in good faith or on the basis of a reasonable interpretation of the decrees.to be entitled to an order vacating consent decrees under federal rule of civil procedure b,however,the defendants are required to sustain the burden of establishing that they have substantially complied with the decrees or that facts or law have changed so that it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.jeff kempthorne jeff iv,quoting rule b as then phrased.the district court application of the contempt standard with the imposition of the burden of proof on the plaintiffs accordingly was error.in addition,we conclude that the district court erred in accepting the action items as the entire measure of compliance with the consent decrees.we accordingly reverse the order of the district court.
the plaintiffs further contend that the district court committed errors of fact and law in issuing protective orders barring them from taking supplemental depositions of appellee karl kurtz and two.finding no such errors,we affirm those rulings of the district court.
background and procedural history 
in august,appellant jeff,on behalf of a class of indigent idaho children suffering from severe emotional and mental disabilities,commenced this action against the governor of idaho and other state officials,alleging that the officials were providing them with inadequate care in violation of their rights under the united states constitution,the idaho constitution,and federal and state statutes the complaint sought only declaratory and injunctive relief.
in,the parties entered into a settlement agreement that offered virtually all of the injunctive relief the class members sought.the agreement provided for continuing jurisdiction by the district court for five years or until the district court was satisfied by stipulation or otherwise that the claims as alleged in the complaint have been adequately addressed.the district court entered the agreement as a consent decree in april.
by the late,after years of inaction on the part of the defendants,the plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the decree.the parties again negotiated a settlement and eventually stipulated to a supplemental agreement,which the district court entered as a second consent decree in december.the following seven years witnessed additional charges of,admissions of failure,court intervention,outside auditing,compliance reviews,and finally,in march,a motion by the plaintiffs for a finding of contempt against the defendants based on the negative findings of the most recent compliance review.the motion,however,resulted not in a formal determination by the district court but in a compliance agreement that purported to reach a full and final settlement of the motion for contempt.in december,the district court entered the agreement as a third consent decree.
for our purposes,the most significant aspect of the compliance agreement was the requirement that the defendants provide to the plaintiffs an independently produced needs assessment and compliance plan.two years later,after no more headway than a motion to dismiss,another motion for contempt,and an appeal,the district court determined that it must take a more active role in enforcing the decrees.the first step taken by the district court was to order the parties jointly to develop a new compliance plan providing a comprehensive blueprint of how the defendants would meet the requirements of the decrees.the parties submitted a proposed plan in february.after briefing and argument,the court issued a memorandum decision adopting the plan,which became known as the implementation plan.
the implementation plan comprises a foreword expressing the views of the defendants,an introduction providing an overview of the planning and oversight processes,and a recommendations section with specific recommendations drawn from the needs assessment.recommendation,for instance,states parents of children with serious emotional disturbances and children old enough to participate must be part of all system planning,management,training,and evaluation.each recommendation includes three subsections,some quite lengthy but most measuring only a paragraph or two,headed for implementation,priority action items and timelines,and desired results.in all,the implementation plan contains action items.
the district court required the defendants to file regular status reports documenting their compliance with deadlines,addressing any,and listing the measures they are taking to bring any areas of into compliance as quickly as possible.in may,the parties filed a joint report to apprise the court of the progress of the implementation plan and to provide an overview of the recommendations by category.in january,the court directed the parties to create a matrix identifying those action items with which the defendants had complied and those action items with which the defendants,according to the plaintiffs,had not complied 
matrix in hand,the district court scheduled a final compliance hearing for september.in preparation for the hearing,the court ordered the parties to file a joint stipulation of undisputed facts,categorizing the facts by action item.the parties complied and,following consideration of the stipulation,the briefs,and a bench trial of the disputed facts,the court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law addressing the issues action item by action item.
the court determined that the plaintiffs had failed to sustain their burden of proof or that the defendants had substantially complied with the majority of action items.with respect to of the action items,however,the court held that the plaintiffs had show n by clear and convincing evidence that the defendants substantially violated the consent judgment,and that the violation was not based on good faith and reasonable interpretation of the judgment.the court ordered the idaho department of health and welfare the dhw to take all steps necessary to substantially comply with the action items within days,adding that o nce the defendants are in compliance with these action items,the defendants may file a motion to vacate the consent decrees.
in june,the dhw filed affidavits of further compliance with the district court and,together with the idaho department of juvenile corrections,moved to vacate the consent decrees.the court found that the defendants had substantially complied with all the action items,and vacated the consent decrees.this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.

discussion 
we wish to make clear at the outset that we recognize and appreciate that the district judge has expended a great deal of time and effort wrestling with the attempted enforcement of these consent decrees for at least the last thirteen years,and has issued orders that helped to move the state towards the achievement of the agreed goals.we conclude,however,for the reasons that follow,that it was error for the district court to vacate the consent decrees,and we accordingly reverse the order of vacatur.
standard for determining compliance to permit vacatur of consent decrees.
the defendants moved for vacatur of the consent decrees under federal rule of civil procedure b,which permits a party to be relieved from a final judgment when the judgment has been satisfied,released or discharged.the defendants bear the burden of proving that they have met the rule requirements in this case,that they have satisfied the judgment see rufo inmates of suffolk county jail,d jeff iv,at.
the parties do not dispute that the relevant standard is substantial compliance with the requirements of the consent decrees.because consent decrees have many of the attributes of ordinary contracts and should be construed basically as contracts,united states itt cont l baking,d,the doctrine of substantial compliance,or substantial performance,may be employed.see joseph new mexico of human,cir see also ujdur thompson,idaho,idaho t he doctrine of substantial performance is not necessarily limited to any particular context and may apply to any contract.the construction and enforcement of the consent decrees,where the parties are residents of idaho and the underlying agreements were entered in that state,is governed by the contract law of idaho as well as familiar contract principles.see jeff iii,at applying idaho law.
the phrase substantial compliance is not susceptible of a mathematically precise definition.joseph,at.we have explained that substantial compliance does imply something less than a strict and literal compliance with the contract provisions but fundamentally it means that the deviation is unintentional and so minor or trivial as not substantially to defeat the object which the parties intend to accomplish.wells benz,united states,cir quoting connell higgins,cal,cal.under idaho law,substantial compliance is compliance which,despite deviation or omission,provides the important and essential benefits of the contract.ujdur,at.
thus,it was the burden of the defendants to establish that they had substantially complied with the requirements of the consent decrees,and that any deviation from literal compliance did not defeat the essential purposes of the decrees.we conclude that this burden was not placed on the defendants in the district court final compliance proceeding.
ii.the compliance hearing 
although the district court held what it described as a compliance hearing in september to determine whether the defendants were in compliance with the consent decrees,the court clearly considered the operative issue to be whether the defendants were in contempt of the consent decrees.thus,at the outset of the bench trial,the district court stated 
i want to take a minute and make sure that we all on the same page as far as the standard which the court must apply here,because i think that is very critical.this case well,first of all,let me indicate that civil contempt,which i think is really the only remedy that the court can consider here.i do know that i can award damages per se.but civil contempt consists of a party disobedience to a specific and definite court order by failure to take all reasonable steps within the party power to comply.the party should not be held in contempt if its actions appear to be based on a good faith and reasonable interpretation of the court order,and the party alleging civil contempt must demonstrate that the alleged contemnor violated the court order by clear and convincing evidence thus,as discussed above,the only issues are,has the plaintiff sic shown by clear and convincing evidence that the defendants have not substantially complied with their obligations under the consent decree.
in its findings and conclusions,the district court further explained in determining whether a party has complied with a consent decree,the court must consider what enforcement mechanisms are available.obviously,the only real sanction available to the court is to find that a party is in contempt for failing to comply with the consent decree.the district court then resolved to evaluate the evidence presented to determine whether the defendants violated the action items using the civil contempt standard.
it is clear from the above statements of the district court that all of its findings with regard to the action items were subject to the evidentiary burden and standard of proof for establishing civil contempt.rather than requiring the defendants to demonstrate substantial compliance by a preponderance of the evidence,the court required the plaintiffs to show by clear and convincing evidence that,first,the defendants had violated the action items beyond substantial compliance and,second,that the violation was not based on good faith and reasonable interpretation of the judgment.that standard was reiterated many times by the district court in its findings.the district court never stated that the defendants bore or had sustained the burden of showing substantial compliance.thus,whether the district court findings were phrased as failures of the plaintiffs to sustain their burden of proof,or as statements that the defendants had substantially complied,the findings were all the products of the civil contempt burden and standard of proof.
the district court allocation of the burden and standard of proof would have been appropriate if the only issue had been whether the defendants should be held in contempt but that framework was not appropriate for determining whether the defendants had sufficiently complied with the consent decrees so that they were entitled to have the decrees vacated.
the adherence of the district court to the burden and standard of proof for civil contempt is illustrated by the fact that,with regard to action items,and,the only finding was that the plainfiffs had failed to sustain their clear and convincing burden of proof.with regard to action items,and,the court referred to evidence in the record,but ruled only that the plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden of proof,without a finding that the defendants had substantially complied.yet the effect of these rulings was to consider the defendants to have substantially complied with all of those action items for the purposes of determining whether the consent decrees should be vacated.
some of these findings that the plaintiffs had not sustained their burden of proof were based o
