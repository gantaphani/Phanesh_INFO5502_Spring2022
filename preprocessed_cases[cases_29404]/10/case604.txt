this case turns on one discrete question of statutory permits federal courts to exercise supplemental jurisdiction in a diversity class action when one named plaintiff has a claim above the jurisdictional minimum.the district court held that confers federal subject matter jurisdiction over class members whose claims do not satisfy the amount in controversy requirement of,as long as diversity jurisdiction exists over the claims of a named plaintiff.because the plain text of authorizes supplemental jurisdiction in diversity class actions,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
louise rosmer filed an action in state court against pfizer on behalf of herself and as class representative for all persons whose spouses have been injured by the drug trovan.she alleged a loss of consortium arising from injuries to her husband caused by trovan,an antibiotic manufactured by pfizer.she sought to recover general and special damages resulting from the loss of consortium as well as punitive damages.
only claims were pled.rosmer is a resident of south carolina.pfizer is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in new york.the parties agree that rosmer individual claim exceeded.the complaint alleged,however,that some class members suffered less than in actual and punitive damages.
pfizer removed this action from state court to the united states district court for the district of south carolina,basing federal subject matter jurisdiction on and.pfizer maintained that the district court had original jurisdiction under over rosmer claims because she and pfizer were of diverse citizenship,and rosmer claims exceeded.see west supp pfizer then contended that where the district court had original jurisdiction over the named plaintiff,it had supplemental jurisdiction under over the claims of all class members regardless of whether each of their claims independently satisfied amount in controversy requirement.
rosmer moved to remand the action to state court alleging a lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction.the district court held that subject matter jurisdiction was appropriate in this case and denied rosmer motion to remand.at the same time,the court certified its order for interlocutory review under b.this court granted rosmer petition for interlocutory review,and rosmer now appeals.
in,the supreme court held that in a class action,multiple plaintiffs with separate and distinct claims must each satisfy the jurisdictional amount for diversity suits in federal courts.see zahn int l paper,d.the court concluded that any plaintiff without the jurisdictional amount must be dismissed from the case,even though others allege jurisdictionally sufficient claims.id.at.
the rule that all plaintiffs in a class action must independently satisfy the amount in controversy requirement went unchallenged until,when congress created supplemental jurisdiction with the passage of 
the supplemental jurisdiction statute was passed in response to the supreme court decision in finley united states,d.in finley,the plaintiff brought a federal tort claims act action against the united states,alleging negligence on the part of the federal aviation administration.the plaintiff then moved to amend her federal complaint to include state law claims against parties.no independent basis for federal jurisdiction existed over the state law claim against the new defendants.see finley,at.the court held that the state law claim did not belong in federal court.id.at.the court also invited congress to act,noting that w hatever we say regarding the scope of jurisdiction conferred by a particular statute can of course be changed by congress.finley,at.
the new states that federal courts have supplemental jurisdiction over cases that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy.a.thus,congress overruled the holding in finley that pendent parties do not belong in federal court.
congress did not authorize supplemental jurisdiction in all cases,however.section b states that when original jurisdiction is founded solely on section,federal courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under rule,or of the federal rules of civil procedure,or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under rule of such rules,or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under rule of such rules,when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section.b.the interpretation of a b lies at the heart of this case.
we must decide whether authorizes supplemental jurisdiction in the diversity class action context,or whether zahn survives the enactment of.other circuit courts have split on this question.compare stromberg metal works,press,cir stating that supplemental jurisdiction applies to class actions,and in re abbott,cir,aff by an equally divided court sub nom.free abbott,d per curiam same,with trimble asarco,cir holding that each member of a class who does not meet the jurisdictional amount must be dismissed from the case,meritcare paul mercury ins,cir same,and leonhardt western sugar,cir same.the supreme court has recently divided on this issue.see free abbott,d per curiam.our view,respectfully,is that confers supplemental jurisdiction in diversity class actions,so long as one named plaintiff has a claim giving a federal court original jurisdiction.
section a is a general grant of supplemental jurisdiction,stating that in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.a.section a is broadly phrased to provide for supplemental jurisdiction over claims appended to any civil action over which the court has original jurisdiction.shanaghan cahill,cir quoting a.
section a states in straightforward language that a federal court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction if those claims form part of the same case or controversy as the claim over which the district courts have original jurisdiction.a.this case unequivocally fits within the above language.the federal district court has original jurisdiction under because rosmer and pfizer are diverse and her claim is above.a accord.and since the pendent claims of the absent class members raise similar questions of law and fact to rosmer claim,they are necessarily a part of the same case or controversy.a see also.therefore,the district court has supplemental jurisdiction over the other claims.
the only exceptions to the federal court supplemental jurisdiction authority are those provided in subsections b and c or those expressly provided otherwise by federal statute.a.section c,relating to discretionary jurisdiction,is inapplicable to this case.and no federal statute speaks expressly as to whether class actions are subject to supplemental jurisdiction.accordingly,the district court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction unless prevented by one of b exceptions.
section b imposes specific limits on the use of supplemental jurisdiction in diversity cases.shanaghan,at.section b creates exceptions for claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under rule,or of the federal rules of civil procedure,or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under rule of such rules,or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under rule of such rules.a.for example,in diversity actions the rule of complete diversity would still be required in the context of rule intervention or rule joinder of necessary parties.however,nowhere in b does it exempt from the normal rules of supplemental jurisdiction persons made parties under rule.in effect,rosmer would have us rewrite the statute to insert rule into b list of exceptions.this we can not do.
rosmer nevertheless argues that the text of and zahn can be harmonized.she relies on leonhardt western sugar for the proposition that can be read literally,and unambiguously,to require each plaintiff in a class action diversity case to satisfy the zahn definition of matter in controversy and to individually meet the requirement.leonhardt,at see also trimble,at quoting leonhardt approvingly meritcare,at same.
we disagree with the leonhardt court on this issue.leonhardt relied on two main points to support its holding.first,it stated that the term original jurisdiction in a incorporated the definition of matter in controversy.thus,the statute expressly excepted claims brought under.leonhardt,at.second,leonhardt based its holding in part on the fact that original jurisdiction meant original jurisdiction over the whole action at the initiation of a complaint.the plain text of,however,cuts against both of the arguments in leonhardt.
first,the text of makes clear that original jurisdiction in a includes diversity cases.if it were otherwise,as leonhardt held,there would be absolutely no need for b at all since b only applies to cases brought under.see b in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section of this title.congress would not have had to exempt some diversity cases in subsection b if subsection a did not cover diversity claims in the first instance.
indeed,the leonhardt analysis falters because original jurisdiction would mean something different in a than it does in and b.it is a basic canon of statutory construction that identical terms within an act bear the same meaning.estate of cowart nicklos drilling,d.however,interpreting a use of original jurisdiction to cover only federal question claims can not be reconciled with grant of original jurisdiction over diversity claims.such a reading of the statute adds an exception that the language and the structure of the act can not bear.the text does not impose such a hidden barrier for diversity claims.
second,rosmer and leonhardt maintain that original jurisdiction over a civil action means that the district court must have original jurisdiction over the entire action at the initiation of the complaint.yet this reading of the statute would render the phrase over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction virtually superfluous.a.the language itself contemplates that a civil action refers to one claim in which original jurisdiction is proper.id.the other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction are properly in federal court due to grant of supplemental jurisdiction.id.
the phrase other claims can not refer only to claims added after the action has already been filed.the leonhardt court read the other claims language narrowly because b speaks to the addition of parties in an diversity action.leonhardt,at.thus,b listing of rule addressing impleaders,rule addressing necessary joinder of parties,and rule addressing intervention shows that supplemental jurisdiction would apply only to parties added to an ongoing action.see leonhardt,at.
the leonhardt court analysis on this point,however,does not persuade us.section b does not merely speak to the addition of parties.it also contains an exception for rule,which authorizes permissive joinder of parties.and permissive joinder can certainly be utilized at the beginning of the action,not just for an ongoing diversity action.see,carden arkoma,d plaintiff initially sues two different defendants of diverse citizenship united states mississippi,d joinder of six defendants at beginning of the complaint valid under rule vodusek bayliner marine,cir plaintiff initial complaint joins two different defendants under rule.thus,if leonhardt were correct,there would be no need to except rule from the grant of supplemental jurisdiction in a.
furthermore,if supplemental jurisdiction is premised on initially obtaining original jurisdiction over the whole action,the statute would not even apply to cases such as united mine workers of america gibbs,d,and finley.gibbs involved an initial complaint containing a federal claim and a pendent state law claim without an independent basis for jurisdiction.gibbs allowed federal courts to hear a state law claim that stemmed from the same common nucleus of operative facts as a federal law claim.see gibbs,at.section codified this holding.a federal court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over a pendent claim by virtue of original jurisdiction.the statute recognizes that the pendent claims like those in gibbs are part of the all other claims,not part of the original jurisdiction over the civil action.a.it does not matter whether the original jurisdiction stems from a federal question or diversity.more damaging to the leonhardt court is the fact that under its analysis,would not apply to cases such as finley,the very case that prompted the enactment of the statute in the first instance.if leonhardt were correct,there would have been no original jurisdiction in finley because the plaintiff did not have an independent jurisdictional basis for suing the party in federal court 
rosmer urges us to read distinction after distinction into the term original jurisdiction.but we refuse to squint at a so hard that we lose sight of the statute plain meaning.we do not need to read in an exception to original jurisdiction for diversity jurisdiction where none exists.indeed,in shanaghan we already held that clearly provides for the operation of supplemental jurisdiction in diversity cases.shanaghan,at.section is a broad grant of authority for supplemental jurisdiction,subject only to the express limitations in the act it does not contain unspoken limits on the statutory text.see id.at.thus,plainly does not require that all class members must independently meet the amount in controversy requirement of.
rosmer argues,however,that legislative history makes clear that congress wanted absent class members to independently satisfy the amount in controversy requirement.rosmer points to the house committee report accompanying stating that the statute is not intended to affect the jurisdictional requirements of in class actions,as those requirements were interpreted prior to finley,at,reprinted in.the report subsequently cites zahn as an example of a case not disturbed by the new supplemental jurisdiction statute.id.at.
the supreme court,however,has consistently stated that when a statute is plain on its face,a court inquiry is at an end.the legislative intent of congress is to be derived from the language and structure of the statute itself,if possible,not from the assertions of codifiers directly at odds with clear statutory language.united states lanier,d.it is the statute,and not the committee report,which is the authoritative expression of the law.city of chicago envtl.def.fund,d.a buried reference in a committee report does not supersede the plain statutory structure and text and the statutory text makes plain that where the court possesses original jurisdiction under a,other closely related claims are within its supplemental jurisdiction,unless explicitly excluded by b.
rosmer maintains,however,that since the statutory text is ambiguous,we may resort to the use of legislative history.she argues that since three other circuits and four justices of the supreme court by voting to reverse in abbott would hold that requires absent class members to independently satisfy the jurisdictional amount,the statute must be ambiguous.
we respect the views of those who take a different view of.at the same time,we can not allow the fact that other circuits have called a statute ambiguous to negate this circuit duty to interpret the text of the enactment.to hold otherwise would mean that we would automatically call a statute ambiguous because a sister circuit has interpreted a statute in a contrary manner.in effect,we would be abandoning our own duty to interpret the law.see also moskal united states,d jones brown,holding that differences in judicial interpretation of a statute do not prove the statute ambiguity.indeed,on many occasions this court has held that a statute was plain and unambiguous despite a contrary holding by a sister circuit.see,lee boeing,cir united states wildes,cir.
rosmer further maintains that is at least ambiguous as to whether the statute overrules zahn.but as we discussed in part,is not ambiguous at all.and the fifth and seventh circuits have likewise held that the statute is unambiguous.see abbott,at stromberg,at.for the reasons stated previously,we agree with those holdings.statutory analysis can not operate as a justification for permitting legislative history to trump the plain meaning of the text.
rosmer finally argues that interpreting to include supplemental jurisdiction for class actions would be an absurd result.both rosmer and pfizer present strong policy arguments as to why should or should not include class actions within its scope.rosmer maintains that federal courts should play a limited role in adjudicating state law claims in diversity actions,and should not err on the side of permitting these types of claims to be swept into the federal system.pfizer,by contrast,points out that for reasons of efficiency and economy,closely related claims should be tried in a single action.
it is not our place to balance these competing policies.for us to say which party makes a superior policy argument would betray a misunderstanding of the role of courts in our federal system.the plain text of is not so absurd that we should disregard the will of congress.see abbott,at.indeed,having class actions resolved in one forum could potentially improve judicial efficiency and cut the cost of litigation.and,of course,all supplemental claims in a class action brought into federal court will have to satisfy the requirements of rule.
a word,finally,on the position of our fine dissenting colleague.the debate over federal diversity jurisdiction has been a one,and the dissent makes no secret of which side it embraces.it extols the congressional practice of narrowing rather than expanding diversity jurisdiction.infra at.it references the proposition that the congressional purpose to limit diversity jurisdiction served the two salutary goals of limiting the rising caseload of diversity cases so that the federal courts would not be overwhelmed by state law questions and unable to resolve federal question cases promptly,and acceding to the rightful independence of state governments,which requires that federal courts scrupulously confine their own jurisdiction to the precise limits which the statute defined.infra at.repeating the refrain,the dissent asserts that i nstead of acceding to the rightful independence of state governments,by scrupulously confin ing federal diversity jurisdiction,the majority interprets in a way that allows the federal courts to determine countless local controversies,involving only state law questions.infra at.expanding diversity jurisdiction by eliminat ing zahn,which the majority apparently proposes,would be a substantial and totally unnecessary blow to the prerogatives of the states.infra at.as if its view of diversity jurisdiction were not already abundantly clear,the dissent reiterates that the majority interpretation utterly conflicts with the steadfast congressional policy of restricting,rather than expanding,diversity jurisdiction.infra at.our holding is therefore remarkable.infra at.the dissent relates the finding of the federal courts study committee that the federal courts faced a crisis because of a rapidly growing and already enormous caseload.infra at.it references approvingly the committee recommendation that to address this problem,congress severely curtail federal diversity jurisdiction.infra at.the dissent concludes by reminding us one last time that t he impact of the majority approach is staggering and totally at odds with a continuous congressional and after enactment of limit diversity jurisdiction.infra at.
it is difficult to view the dissent as anything more than an assault on federal diversity jurisdiction.there are,to be sure,legitimate arguments to be made for and against the exercise of this form of federal jurisdiction.as a set of policy prescriptions,the dissent is in many ways congenial.however,article iii rather explicitly charges congress with ordain ing and establish ing the structure of the federal courts,the boundaries of their jurisdiction,and the parameters of.see sheldon sill,how.notwithstanding the symmetrical satisfaction of leaving federal law to federal courts and state law to state courts,we can not read to reflect a view of diversity as a disfavored form of federal jurisdiction if its language will not coherently parse that way.to do so in the face of straightforward statutory mandate is to place our judicial cart before the congressional horse.
reduced to its analytical core,the dissent argues that a is essentially a federal question jurisdiction statute.in the dissent view,it must not be read to affect diversity jurisdiction in any way.if pertains predominantly to federal questions,then there is virtually no authorization for supplemental jurisdiction in diversity cases.after all,if each and every plaintiff in a diversity case must satisfy requirements of complete diversity and matter in controversy,as the dissent contends,see infra at,then there remains no supplemental jurisdiction in a diversity action for district courts to exercise.of course,the dissent must try to argue that a is basically a federal question statute in order to avoid the obvious awkwardness of the omission of rule from b list of exceptions.see ante at.with all respect to our good colleague,this view of a as fundamentally a federal question statute reflects little more than wishful judicial thinking.
this is so for two reasons,which we have earlier touched upon.first,one searches in vain for a difference in the way a treats federal question and diversity jurisdiction.the terms of the statute are equally applicable to both forms of federal jurisdiction.consider a use of the word related.supplemental claims are related to the original claim by virtue of their similarity to the original,not because the supplemental claims independently satisfy all jurisdictional requirements.supplemental jurisdiction is an efficiency concept.and supplemental claims can be as efficiently tied or related to an original diversity claim as to an original federal question.to take the statutory language,supplemental claims in a diversity case can form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution even if they lack the requisite jurisdictional amount.a.congress could so easily have distinguished between federal question and diversity jurisdiction in conferring supplemental jurisdiction under a,but it did not differentiate these two forms of federal jurisdiction in any remotely perceivable fashion.
second,by its very terms,presupposes that a applies to diversity proceedings.section a begins with the clause,except as provided in subsection b this means that the text of b withdraws from a that which would otherwise fall within its purview.and the text of b emphatically refers to diversity jurisdiction.in other words,but for the withdrawal of supplemental jurisdiction in diversity cases in b,a corresponding grant of supplemental diversity jurisdiction would exist in a.thus,a must apply to diversity cases.otherwise,there would be no need to list explicit exceptions to the exercise of supplemental diversity jurisdiction in b.it is inconceivable that b exceptions explicitly relate to,but that the section from which the exceptions are taken does not.
the dissent argues that its reading of a does not render b various prohibitions on supplemental jurisdiction unnecessary because b bars parties,after the action has commenced,from invoking supplemental jurisdiction over claims they could not have asserted,consistent with diversity jurisdiction requirements,at the outset.infra at.but nothing in a indicates that it refers only to claims brought at the beginning of the action.nothing in b indicates that it applies solely to claims brought after the action has commenced.and nothing in the text of indicates that congress has adopted the dissent proposed temporal distinction 
the dissent makes a nice conceptual distinction between the nature of federal question and diversity jurisdiction.it is certainly true that a federal court jurisdiction in federal question cases can not be destroyed by the identity or claims of other parties in an action,but that a federal court jurisdiction in a diversity case wholly turns on the identity and claims of the parties.infra at.simply to state this distinction in the abstract is insufficient.it is up to congress to transmute the distinction into a dispositive difference in the text of legislation.that is precisely what congress has not done.
much of the dissent is a pastiche of legislative history and policy prescription,with quotations from the federal courts study committee thrown in for good measure.though we see no reason to examine a legislative history in view of the straightforward reading to which the statute lends itself,it is nevertheless worth noting that the circumstances surrounding the creation of the legislative history in fact support our interpretation.the drafters of apparently realized that they failed to except class actions under rule from a grant of supplemental jurisdiction.in an attempt to rectify matters,they put together a legislative history stating that a was not intended to overrule zahn.see,at,reprinted in.three drafters noted the effort with admirable candor 
o n its face,section does not appear to forbid supplemental jurisdiction over claims of class members that do not satisfy section jurisdictional amount requirement,which would overrule zahn there is a disclaimer of intent to accomplish this result in the legislative history it would have been better had the statute dealt explicitly with this problem,and the legislative history was an attempt to correct the oversight.
thomas rowe,stephen burbank,thomas mengler,compounding or creating confusion about supplemental jurisdiction a reply to professor freer,emory.in reading the clear language of the statute in the same way that the esteemed drafters of a do,we reach the conclusion they concede to be inescapable.
we have no idea whether,as the drafters intimate,congress made a mistake or oversight here.it is not implausible to believe that the legislature desired a single class action,even one in diversity,to be resolved in a single judicial setting.additionally,congress may have,rightly or wrongly,imputed a bias in state court against certain defendants which it sought to counteract by fortifying diversity jurisdiction.the point is that congress can take such steps.and in exercising its constitutional prerogatives,congress is even free to incur the displeasure of the bench.mistake or not,we know that it is not our job to correct what congress has done.the illegitimacy of the judiciary usurping such a legislative function,either overtly or through strained statutory construction,is.
it seems appropriate in conclusion to repair to the simplicity of the statute.louise rosmer is of diverse citizenship and her claim exceeds the amount in controversy requirement of.consequently,federal courts have original jurisdiction over it.likewise,due to,federal courts have supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of all class members whose claims do not exceed.section a permits supplemental jurisdiction over the other related claims,and b does not except class actions from a application.
the straightforward nature of the statutory interpretation here is paralleled by the straightforward route through which congress can amend the statute.if congress wishes to exempt diversity class actions from supplemental jurisdiction,it need do nothing more than insert the words rule into b list of exceptions.see finley,at.for us to do so,however,would betray a fundamental principle fidelity to language lies at the heart of the rule of law.for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is 
because unambiguously preserves the rule of zahn international paper company,d,i respectfully dissent.
section a provides in relevant part 
except as provided in subsections b and c or as expressly provided otherwise by federal statute,in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.
emphasis added.thus,clearly grants federal courts supplemental jurisdiction over certain claims that are outside the courts original jurisdiction.
just as clearly,however,only grants supplemental jurisdiction where there is first a civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction.id.no original jurisdiction exists here.in diversity cases,like the one at hand,federal courts only have original jurisdiction when the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of and the controversy is between citizens of different states.a supp.ii.thus,in diversity cases a federal court can not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim unless it first has original jurisdiction over a civil action between citizens of different states in which the matter in controversy exceeds.
section does not itself state whether each plaintiff in a diversity case must be a citizen of a different state from each defendant,or if only one plaintiff need be of diverse citizenship.nor does state whether each plaintiff in a diversity suit must have a claim in which at least is in controversy,or if all of the plaintiffs claims may be aggregated to reach the jurisdictional amount,or if only one plaintiff need satisfy the matter in controversy requirement.
since the earliest years of the republic,however,the supreme court has interpreted the diversity jurisdiction statute to require complete diversity of citizenship of each plaintiff from each defendant.see strawbridge curtiss,cranch.moreover,it has long been the rule that each plaintiff in a diversity suit must independently satisfy the diversity statute jurisdictional amount in controversy.see clark paul gray.when several plaintiffs assert separate and distinct demands in a single suit,the amount involved in each separate controversy must be of the requisite amount to be within the jurisdiction of the district court pinel pinel.same troy bank whitehead.same.the court has reasoned that two requirements diversity and matter in controversy are jurisdictional,and the statute grant of original jurisdiction to federal courts depends upon each and every plaintiff satisfying each of those requirements.
the supreme court has also held that dual requirements generally apply in class actions.thus,in supreme tribe of cauble,the court concluded that mandates that each named plaintiff must be completely diverse from each named defendant,although unnamed plaintiffs need not be diverse.in snyder harris,d,and zahn,the court applied the matter in controversy requirement even more strictly,holding that this requirement applied to both named and unnamed parties.
in snyder,the court concluded that where no members of the plaintiff class possessed a claim meeting the matter in controversy requirement they could not aggregate their claims and so a federal court had no jurisdiction over such a class action.id.at.the court relied on the congressional practice of narrowing rather than expanding diversity jurisdiction.it noted that since the first judiciary act in congress has repeatedly increased the amount necessary to meet the matter in controversy requirement and,when doing so,the matter in controversy rule against a background of judicial interpretation that restrictively construed it.snyder,at.indeed,as the snyder court explained,congress had accepted restrictive judicial interpretation of for so long that this interpretation had to be recognized as more than a formula.id 
in zahn,the supreme court considered whether snyder applied to class actions like the one at issue here,in which only the named plaintiff satisfied the matter in controversy requirement.see zahn,at.in determining whether each plaintiff in the class,named or unnamed,needed to satisfy the matter in controversy requirement of in order for a federal court to exercise jurisdiction,the court looked to its previous interpretations of for both class actions and actions.see id.at.relying on its long standing construction of the matter in controversy requirement of,the zahn court concluded that e ach plaintiff in a rule b class action must satisfy the jurisdictional amount,and any plaintiff who does not must be dismissed from the case.id.at.in other words,one plaintiff may not ride in on another coattails.zahn,at.
in so concluding,the court made clear that its holding was premised upon its construction of matter in controversy requirement.id.at.th e doctrine is based upon this court interpretation of the statutory phrase matter in controversy.quoting snyder,at.the zahn court found that the language of was best interpreted to require every class member to satisfy that requirement thus,it held,when a plaintiff files a class action in federal court,each member of the class must allege a claim in which the matter in controversy exceeds in order for a federal court to have jurisdiction over the action.see zahn,at.
in summary,the supreme court has definitively interpreted requirements in strawbridge,snyder important to this.the court has not in any way limited the holding it declared less than thirty years ago in zahn.nor has congress amended to overrule zahn.this requires us to find that the rule established in zahn stands and governs this case.before the district court could take advantage of grant of supplemental jurisdiction,it first must have possessed jurisdiction over the action under.however,because not every member of the class in this class action satisf ies the jurisdictional amount,zahn,at,the district court possessed no original jurisdiction over the action under,and so could not exercise supplemental jurisdiction under.
nevertheless,pfizer maintains,and the majority holds,that when,in,congress enacted the supplemental jurisdiction statute,it legislatively overruled zahn.nothing in remotely suggests that this statute eliminates or modifies any of the requirements for original diversity jurisdiction that the supreme court has long held mandated by.rather,without in any way qualifying or limiting requirement,specifically refers to as a possible basis for the original jurisdiction necessary to any supplemental jurisdiction.see b.the majority holding that congress chose as a vehicle to overrule zahn,a case interpreting,is therefore puzzling.
to accomplish this incongruous result,the majority must look past the supreme court clear and definitive interpretations of and break off the claims of some plaintiffs from those of the other plaintiffs in the class.this approach essentially queries whether any of the plaintiffs in the class could they foregone a class a proper diversity suit in federal court against the named defendants.if the district court would have had original jurisdiction over such a hypothetical suit,the majority would allow to provide supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining class members.this approach puts the proverbial cart before the horse.in a class action,no federal jurisdiction exists at all unless and until the requirements of,including those set forth in zahn,have been satisfied.
this is not to say that requires a district court to assess original jurisdiction over the whole action at the initiation of a complaint in every case,regardless of the claims set forth in the complaint.ante at describing the rationale in leonhardt western sugar,cir.however,a district court surely must examine a complaint in which the asserted basis of federal jurisdiction is diversity of citizenship to determine whether the complaint meets jurisdictional prerequisites.moreover,following this is,after all,the established means of assessing diversity not render superfluous the language in a giving courts supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction.ante at quoting a.that statutory language retains important meaning it permits supplemental jurisdiction over claims in cases and,subject to the limitations in b,over additional claims in diversity cases after a proper diversity complaint has been filed.
nor does retaining the zahn rule affect the holdings in united mine workers of america gibbs,d,and finley united states,d.ante at.gibbs is a federal question case and finley was brought under the federal tort claims act.neither is a diversity case.the distinction between federal question cases or,for that matter,any case with a federal jurisdictional basis other than and diversity cases is critical.federal question cases do indeed involve one federal claim creating jurisdiction,which is viewed independently from other claims in the complaint that are premised upon supplemental jurisdiction.this is because a federal court jurisdiction in federal question cases can not be destroyed by the identity or claims of other parties in an action.in contrast,a federal court jurisdiction in a diversity case wholly turns on the identity and claims of the parties.
furthermore,the linchpin of the majority statutory on the prohibitions listed in b fatally undermines,rather than supports,the majority holding.
section b provides 
in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section of this title,the district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection a over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under rule,or of the federal rules of civil procedure,or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under rule of such rules,or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under rule of such rules,when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section.
the majority maintains that because nowhere in b does it exempt from the normal rules of supplemental jurisdiction persons made parties under rule,a court would have to rewrite the statute to insert rule into b list of exceptions to retain zahn.ante at.but this is certainly not the case if original jurisdiction in a is given its natural meaning in diversity cases,that meaning is the one authoritatively determined by the supreme court in strawbridge,snyder,zahn.indeed,the omission of rule from b list is hardly surprising given that the diversity jurisdiction requirements,as articulated in these cases,was codified in the original jurisdiction requirement of a.moreover,this reading of a does not render b various prohibitions on supplemental jurisdiction unnecessary because b bars parties,after the action has commenced,from invoking supplemental jurisdiction over claims they could not have asserted,consistent with diversity jurisdiction requirements,at the outset 
on the other hand,if the majority were correct and a did not recognize the diversity jurisdiction requirements authoritatively set forth by the supreme court in strawbridge,zahn,then b limited use of rule to prevent district courts from exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the permissive joinder of claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties,claims against wreak havoc.the majority contends that,if one plaintiff satisfies the requirements of,the district court possesses original jurisdiction under that statute and so may exercise supplemental jurisdiction under over related claims.if the majority were correct,then would permit a plaintiff meeting jurisdictional requirements to use rule to join as a plaintiff any party who possesses a related claim even if that plaintiff destroyed complete diversity.
the majority approach strips b of all logic.to take that approach,we must believe that congress fashioned a statute that carefully preserves limitations on diversity jurisdiction after an action has been filed by barring plaintiffs from using rules,and to join claims against defendants and by barring plaintiffs from joining or intervening in an ongoing diversity action under rules and,yet permits persons whose claims would defeat diversity to join an action at the outset by allowing a plaintiff to use rule to join a diversity action at its commencement.furthermore,if t
