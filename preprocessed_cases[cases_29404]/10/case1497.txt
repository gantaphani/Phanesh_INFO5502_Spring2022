this case presents the question whether a federal district court has jurisdiction to issue a declaratory judgment as to the government liability for breach of contract solely in order to create a predicate for suit to recover damages in the court of federal claims.we hold that district courts do not have such jurisdiction because the court of federal claims has exclusive jurisdiction under the tucker act,to adjudicate breach of contract claims for money damages in excess of,and congress has not waived sovereign immunity for such suits in district courts.
here,the united states district court for the southern district of texas,and on appeal the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit,lacked jurisdiction to issue such a predicate judgment,and the predicate judgment was void.it follows that the court of federal claims was not bound by this earlier judgment.
on the merits,we affirm the court of federal claims grant of summary judgment.we agree that the contract between the government and the appellants was unenforceable against the government because of a material breach by the appellants predating the government alleged breach.
background 
the national housing act was designed to assist private industry in providing housing for low and moderate income families and displaced families.a.it authorized the department of housing and urban development hud to insure mortgages used to construct certain housing.id.b.owners of such properties were also entitled to certain tax benefits.see chancellor manor united states.in return for this mortgage insurance and tax benefits along with various other benefits,landlords agreed to be regulated or supervised by the secretary under a regulatory agreement.d west supp.
the appellants,christopher village,and its managing general partner,wilshire investments,owned a federally subsidized housing complex known as mockingbird run apartments mockingbird run.mockingbird run was built in with an insured mortgage obtained under the national housing act,id.in accordance with national housing act requirements,the appellants entered into a standard regulatory agreement with hud concerning mockingbird run the regulatory agreement.the regulatory agreement required the appellants to maintain the mortgaged premises in good repair and condition.regulatory agreement app.at.see also b.the agreement authorized hud to regulate rents.regulatory agreement f app.at the rent charged for each unit shall not exceed the upper limit of the range shown for such type of unit on the rental schedule approved in writing by the commissioner of hud see also t he investor shall not charge or collect rents for any dwellings in the project in excess of the appropriate rents therefor as shown in the latest rent schedule approved pursuant to this section.according to hud regulations,rent schedules were meant to compensate for any increase in operating and maintenance costs over which owners have no effective control b.the regulatory agreement also stated that the landlord could not increase the amount of the gross monthly dwelling income for all units unless such increase is approved by the commissioner.regulatory agreement g app.at see also b.
the appellants also entered into a housing assistance payment contract the hap contract with hud pursuant to the united states housing act.app.at.that act authorized hud to enter into contracts with landlords to subsidize rental payments of tenants living in private,housing.see cisneros alpine ridge group,d.under the hap contract,the appellants received assistance payments in an amount calculated to make up the difference between the tenant contribution and the contract rent agreed upon by the landlord and hud.see id.internal quotations omitted.like the regulatory agreement,the hap contract regulated the appellants management of mockingbird run,prohibiting the appellants from charg ing any family an amount in excess of the set allowable rents and requiring the appellants to maintain and operate the contract units and related facilities so as to provide decent,safe and sanitary housing as defined by hud.app.at.
by,the physical condition of mockingbird run had substantially deteriorated,necessitating approximately million worth of repairs.finding that the appellants had allowed the complex to deteriorate in violation of the regulatory agreement and the hap contract,hud informed the appellants in april of that their failure to refurbish the property could lead to a default of the regulatory agreement and loss of the hap contract rent subsidies.
thereafter,on june,the appellants requested a percent rent increase from hud,claiming that the current rent revenue was inadequate to cover operating costs as well as maintenance and repairs.hud sent the appellants a letter on august,explaining that the regulatory agreement and hap contract imposed an absolute obligation on the appellants to maintain the property.the letter did not decide the appellants rent increase request,but it instead demanded that the appellants deposit approximately million in escrow to fund mockingbird run needed repairs.the appellants did not deposit the million.on september,hud sent the appellants a second letter explaining that it would not entertain the appellants request for a rent increase unless they deposited the million in escrow as the august letter demanded.the appellants again refused to pay the million,and on september,hud informed the appellants that they had violated the regulatory agreement by not maintaining the mortgaged premises in good repair and condition and that hud would proceed without further notice to take whatever remedies are appropriate.christopher,retsinas,cir internal quotations omitted.on november,the federal national mortgage association,the original lender,assigned the note and mortgage to hud,and hud assumed control of the property as a mortgagee in possession on december.id.explaining that once the federal national mortgage association assigned the note to hud,hud had the same remedial rights as the original lender see a see also united states antioch,cir stating in determining when to foreclose following a default,hud has very broad discretion in order to achieve national housing objectives.
in october of the appellants brought suit in the united states district court for the southern district of texas against hud,the secretary of hud,and the director of multifamily housing management of the houston area office of hud,seeking mandamus,injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to the administrative procedure act,apa.christopher,cuomo,no.civ,wl.arguing that hud illegally demanded million in escrow and illegally refused to consider its request for a rent increase,the appellants sought mandamus and injunctive relief to prevent hud from foreclosing on the mockingbird run property.the appellants also sought a declaratory judgment that their obligation to maintain the property was contingent upon receiving adequate rent revenue and that they were under no duty to make repairs unless they received adequate rent increases.in march of the district court granted summary judgment in favor of hud on all counts,holding that hud decisions whether to grant rent increases were unreviewable and that the appellants had an absolute responsibility to properly maintain the property irrespective of rent increases.id.at.
the appellants appealed to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit.while the case was pending in the fifth circuit,hud sold the property in a foreclosure sale,and it was razed.christopher,at.the fifth circuit held that hud foreclosure sale and transfer effectively mooted the appellants request for an injunction and mandamus because of the court inability to fashion adequate relief since the request for relief involve d a transfer of the property that amount ed to an impossible request for the court to fulfill.id.at internal quotations omitted.nonetheless,the fifth circuit held that the request for a declaratory judgment still present ed a live dispute because the appellants could use the declaration as a predicate for a damages action against hud in the court of federal claims.id.at.
on the merits,the fifth circuit agreed with the district court that hud decisions regarding requests for rent increases were indeed unreviewable under the apa because congress committed to hud full discretion in determining whether to grant or deny a rent increase request.id.however,the fifth circuit found that both the regulatory agreement and hud own regulations required hud at least to entertain a rent increase request.id.at citing regulatory agreement g,stating that hud will at any time entertain a written request for a rent increase and b,stating that in response to a request for a rent increase,hud shall approve a rental schedule or shall deny the increase stating the reasons therefor.the court held that hud violated its contractual and regulatory duty to consider the rent request thereby render ing suspect hud other actions.id.the fifth circuit further stated that the appellants duty to properly maintain mockingbird run was not absolute and that the appellants cost of operating and maintaining the property,in addition to the cost of complying with the regulatory agreement,must be paid for out of the regulated rental revenues.id.at.although the fifth circuit found that hud could understandably refuse to provide financial assistance to an owner that has misappropriated funds,mismanaged the property,taken a profit instead of maintaining the property,or been negligent in its management in some other regard,the court held that there was no evidence establishing that any of these things had occurred.id.at.
the fifth circuit accordingly reversed the district court grant of summary judgment.it found that hud acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it refused to abide by its legal obligation to consider a rental increase request from a owner and instead demanded a million cash infusion and then declared the property in default for those very reasons.id.at.the court ordered that u pon remand,the district court should issue the appellants requested declaratory judgment.id.hud did not seek further review of the fifth circuit decision.neither,apparently,did the appellants seek a declaratory judgment from the district court as provided by the fifth circuit.
on september,the appellants filed an action in the court of federal claims for breach of contract,seeking certification of a class of similarly situated entities.appellants contended that they were entitled to a finding of liability against hud as a matter of law because the fifth circuit ruling barred the government from relitigating the issue of breach of contract under the doctrine of res judicata.
initially,the court of federal claims denied the appellants motion for class certification on october,finding that the appellants did not satisfy the quinault requirements for certification,see quinault allottee ass united states,christopher,united states.in particular,the court of federal claims found that common questions of law did not predominate over individual factual questions of class members that the appellants claim was not sufficiently typical of the class and that the claims of individual class members were not necessarily too small to be pursued individually.christopher.at.
in,while the damages action was pending in the court of federal claims,criminal litigation regarding a fraudulent insurance scheme related to hud projects was settled in the united states district court for the northern district of california.this litigation involved the management assistance group,magi,a company that shared a president and sole shareholder with wilshire and was a limited partner of christopher village.the settlement of this criminal litigation on march,was effectuated through a plea agreement the plea agreement.in the plea agreement magi pled guilty to engaging in an illegal insurance kickback scheme,which involved mockingbird run as well as other hud projects.although neither wilshire nor christopher village was a party to this plea agreement,wilshire was a party to both the consent agreement and the administrative agreement,which,while not admitting any wrongdoing by wilshire,barred future government claims against wilshire.
hud required magi to procure insurance for its affiliated properties,including mockingbird run.magi admitted that it required illegal kickbacks from the insurance company that covered its affiliated properties in order to retain its insurance business.the insurance company in turn inflated the true costs of insurance for these properties,and it invoiced magi affiliated properties,including mockingbird run,for the kickback costs as well as the actual insurance costs.these inflated insurance charges were then included as an expense item in documentation that the appellants subsequently submitted to hud in,and in order to justify rent increase requests for mockingbird run.see generally hud housing handbook multifamily asset management and project servicing,chapter processing budgeted rent increases and fees for commercial space services in insured,direct loan and hud project doc,available at http.the appellants also submitted a certification as to purchasing practices and reasonableness of expenses with each of these requests,in which the appellants certified that a mounts paid to individuals or companies having an with the owner or the management agent were not excess of the costs that would have been incurred in making purchases on the open market.app.at.hud granted the appellants rent increases in and for mockingbird run.
subsequent to these events,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment,and the court of federal claims entered summary judgment in favor of the government.christopher,united states.the government claimed that the magi plea evidenced a prior material breach by the appellants,thereby excusing the government of liability for any later breach that hud may have committed by refusing to consider the rent requests.the appellants,however,argued that they were entitled to a judgment of liability as a matter of law because res judicata required the court of federal claims to accept the fifth circuit liability holding.
the court rejected the appellants argument that it was bound by the fifth circuit decision,reasoning that neither res judicata nor collateral estoppel prohibited it from considering the government prior breach defense.the court concluded that res judicata presumes that the first court had jurisdiction over the claim and the fifth circuit clearly recognized that it was up to this court to rule on the contract question.id.at.the court of federal claims further explained that a lthough collateral estoppel bars the government from challenging hud breach for failure to consider the appellants rent increase request,collateral estoppel does not bar the government from defending that breach based on prior material breach because the fifth circuit did not decide the issue.id.at.on the merits,the court found that the appellants committed a prior material breach that protected the government against liability for hud subsequent assumed breach because the appellants had not provided any evidence to rebut the fact that mockingbird run apartments were involved in the magi scheme and that wilshire investments,the general partner in the christopher village limited partnership,was part of the fraud.id.at.the court concluded that the fraudulent conduct of magi and wilshire,in connection with the rent requests for the mockingbird run apartments,constitutes a prior material breach of the hud contracts which justifies hud termination of the plaintiffs contract for default.id.at.the court held that this prior material breach excused hud assumed subsequent breach,even though the government was not aware of the facts at the time of the foreclosure at issue in this litigation.id.at.finally,the court held that there was no settlement bar to the government defense of prior material breach.id.at.

discussion 
we review the court of federal claims grant of summary judgment without deference.agwiak united states.
appellants argue first that the fifth circuit decision is res judicata and precludes the government from challenging its liability for breach.appellants br.at.appellants therefore contend that the fifth circuit decision entitles them to judgment as a matter of law on the breach of contract claim.we disagree.
initially,we must determine whether the fifth circuit had jurisdiction to issue a judgment as a predicate to a suit in the court of federal claims.see restatement second of judgments,at see also id.at.as we recently reaffirmed in fieldturf,southwest recreational,in circumstances such as these,the court of appeals jurisdiction is dependent on the district court jurisdiction.see.accordingly,the fifth circuit had jurisdiction to issue this predicate judgment only if a district court would have had jurisdiction to issue such an order.
in order for a district court to have properly had jurisdiction,the government must have waived sovereign immunity to suit.as the supreme court recently noted in united states white mountain apache tribe,d,j urisdiction over any suit against the government requires a clear statement from the united states waiving sovereign immunity together with a claim falling within the terms of the waiver.see also united states mitchell,d it is axiomatic that the united states may not be sued without its consent and that the existence of consent is a prerequisite for jurisdiction.united states sherwood.the terms of the sovereign consent to be sued in any court define that court jurisdiction to entertain the suit.consol.edison united states,to invoke the jurisdiction of a federal court for relief from monetary obligations imposed by a federal agency,a litigant must show that the united states has waived sovereign immunity.the apa has broaden ed the avenues for judicial review of agency action by eliminating the defense of sovereign immunity in cases covered by its provisions.bowen,d see also darby cisneros,d.but the waiver of sovereign immunity under the apa is limited.see,bowen,at.
the apa waives sovereign immunity for suits to set aside agency action found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,a,when the suit calls for relief other than money damages,id,but only if there is no other adequate remedy,id.emphasis added.this limits the government waiver of sovereign immunity to situations in which no other adequate remedy exists.bowen,at.here,the necessary waiver of sovereign immunity existed as to the appellants claim for injunctive relief because no other adequate remedy existed to prevent the foreclosure and sale.thus,there is no question that the district court for the southern district of texas properly had jurisdiction over the original action to enjoin foreclosure by the government.but,as the fifth circuit correctly held,the claim that originally formed the basis for this jurisdiction under the apa,namely the request to enjoin hud foreclosure and sale,became moot when hud foreclosed on and sold mockingbird run.christopher,at.at that point,the appellants sole claim was for a declaratory judgment as to the legality of hud actions,and jurisdiction over this claim turned on whether the apa waived the united states sovereign immunity to suit for such a declaratory judgment.this depended on whether suit in the court of federal claims for money damages constituted an adequate remedy under section of the apa.
we held in consolidated edison that a litigant ability to sue the government for money damages in the court of federal claims is an adequate remedy that precludes an apa waiver of sovereign immunity in other courts.at.the plaintiff in consolidated edison sued the government in the united states district court for the southern district of new york under the apa for declaratory and injunctive relief,alleging that the special assessments imposed by the energy policy act of epact violated due process and constituted a taking under the fifth amendment.id.at.the government moved to have the case transferred to the court of federal claims,but the district court denied the transfer.id.at.the plaintiff appealed this denial of transfer to our court pursuant to d a,which gives our court exclusive jurisdiction over an appeal from a district court denial of a motion to transfer to the court of federal claims.we held that the district court lacked jurisdiction under section of the apa because e very legal issue that the plaintiff sought to resolve in this district court case could have been decided in a suit before the court of federal claims and a refund of the epact payments could have provide d an adequate remedy for the plaintiff.id.at emphasis added.we further emphasized in consolidated edison that,a party may not circumvent the claims court exclusive jurisdiction by framing a complaint in the district court as one seeking injunctive,declaratory or mandatory relief where the thrust of the suit is to obtain money from the united states.id.quoting rogers ink,cir see also kanemoto reno,r elief available for the plaintiff claims in the court of federal claims is adequate and the plaintiff can not escape this conclusion merely by framing her claim for relief in declaratory or injunctive terms.
our sister circuits have come to the same conclusion.see,deaf smith county grain processors,glickman,t he tucker waives sovereign immunity and provides the united states court of federal claims claims court with jurisdiction over certain claims for monetary relief from the federal government,see an adequate remedy in the claims court,which would preclude district court jurisdiction under of the apa.randall united states,cir r eview under the apa is available only for final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court this limitation has been interpreted to preclude review under the apa when a plaintiff has an adequate remedy by suit under the tucker act therefore,to determine whether plaintiff suit is cognizable under the apa,the court must first examine whether he has an available remedy under the tucker act.emphasis in original marshall leasing,united states,cir a party may not avoid the court of federal claims jurisdiction by framing an action against the federal government that appears to seek only equitable relief when the party real effort is to obtain damages in excess of rogers,at a party may not circumvent the claims courts exclusive jurisdiction by framing a complaint in the district court as one seeking injunctive,declaratory or mandatory relief where the thrust of the suit is to obtain money from the united states.
the fifth circuit itself has repeatedly emphasized the limited nature of the apa waiver of sovereign immunity where there is an adequate remedy in the court of federal claims.for example,in warner cox,cir,the fifth circuit held that it did not have jurisdiction to grant an injunction compelling the navy to make certain contractual payments.id.at.despite the contractor argument that his sole claim below was for review of administrative errors committed in the process of the navy refusing his payments,the court found that n one of the substantive claims presented to the court below concerned anything but the payment of money id.at.the fifth circuit reasoned 
t he apa does not provide for review under such circumstances.specifically exempted from review is agency action for which there is some other adequate remedy in a court.suit under the tucker act in the court of claims has been held such an adequate remedy congress judgment seems to be that tucker act relief is adequate and to that judgment we defer.
id.as such,the fifth circuit remanded with instructions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction,stating,w e are in court of claims country where we do not belong.id.at.
in drake panama canal commission,cir,the fifth circuit refused to entertain an apa claim for mandamus relief to require the panama canal commission to pay certain survivor compensation.the fifth circuit held that because the substance of the complaints at issue is a claim for money damages,appellant case is not one covered by section,and,hence,sovereign immunity has not been waived.as a result,the apa does not afford jurisdiction over appellants suit.id.at.more recently in department of justice,cir,the fifth circuit stressed that when the substance of the complaint at issue is a claim for money damages,the case is not one covered by,and hence,sovereign immunity has not been waived and the court does not have jurisdiction to entertain it.id.at citation omitted.because the fifth circuit lacked jurisdiction to award relief,the appeal should have been dismissed.see city of erie pap,d church of scientology united states,d.
there is no question that the appellants here could have originally sued the united states in the court of federal claims to recover for breach of contract.indeed,that is the very premise of the fifth circuit predicate decision.under these circumstances we must conclude that the fifth circuit lacked jurisdiction over the action for declaratory judgment because the apa did not waive the united states sovereign immunity for such a suit in district courts.
however,the fact that a court did not have jurisdiction over a suit in which it issued a decision does not automatically strip that decision of preclusive effect.in most circumstances a judgment may not be collaterally attacked on the ground that the original tribunal lacked subject matter jurisdiction,even if the issue of subject matter jurisdiction has not been litigated in the first action.see,ins.of,compagnie des bauxites de guinee,d explaining that principles of res judicata apply to issues of subject matter jurisdiction,and that a party that has had an opportunity to litigate the question of subject matter jurisdiction may not reopen that question in a collateral attack upon adverse judgment underwriters assurance life accident health ins.guar.ass n,d chicot county drainage dist.baxter state bank.swift united states.the restatement similarly notes that a court judgment precludes the parties from litigating the question of the court subject matter jurisdiction on collateral review.restatement second of judgments.the restatement,however,also recognizes exceptions to this rule,including when a llowing the judgment to stand would substantially infringe the authority of another tribunal or agency of government.id.see in re bulldog trucking,productive transp,cir sterling united states,cir.
kalb feuerstein,involved just the type of situation described in the restatement exception.see restatement second of judgments,note on cmt.d at citing kalb see also blinder,robinson.in kalb the appellant was a farmer who had filed a petition in the bankruptcy court for composition and extension of time to pay his debts under the act,s,stat.formerly codified at s repealed.kalb,at.the act was designed to provide relief for,and it explicitly prohibited other courts from instituting or continuing foreclosure proceedings against a farmer who filed a petition under the act in the bankruptcy court.id.at.quoting the act,n p nevertheless in violation of the act automatic stay,the wisconsin county court entered a mortgage foreclosure proceeding against the appellant confirmed the sheriff sale of his property and ordered the appellant dispossessed.id.at.the farmer did not directly appeal the wisconsin county court decision.instead,he instituted a separate action in the circuit court of walworth county,wisconsin for restoration of possession.id.he argued that once he filed his petition in the bankruptcy court,the act automatically stayed proceedings in the wisconsin county court,and the wisconsin county court therefore did not have jurisdiction to proceed with the foreclosure proceeding.id.at.the wisconsin supreme court rejected this argument,holding that it need not consider whether the act imposed an automatic stay on state court proceedings because n o appeal having been taken,no showing having been made in the state court,an order of sale having been confirmed and the purchaser put in possession,the plaintiff is in no position to claim that the order is void.id.at.quoting language from the wisconsin supreme court.
the united states supreme court reversed.the court found that considerations as to whether the issue of jurisdiction was actually contested in the county court,or whether it could have been contested,are not applicable.id.at.the court detailed the history of congress decision to grant bankruptcy courts exclusive jurisdiction in cases,and it concluded that,congress manifested its intention that the issue of jurisdiction in the foreclosing court need not be contested or even raised.id.the court held that the wisconsin county court action was not merely erroneous but was beyond its power,void,and subject to collateral attack.id.at.the kalb holding would appear to apply equally to congress decision to grant exclusive jurisdiction to other courts,such as the court of federal claims,and thereby render void a judgment that treads upon that exclusive jurisdiction.
the supreme court decision in united states united states fidelity guaranty,is even more closely on point.in fidelity guaranty,a coal company was involved in a bankruptcy proceeding in the united states district court for the western district of missouri,and the united states,as a trustee for the choctaw and chickasaw nations the nations,filed a claim for lease royalties.id.at.the coal company responded with a for credits against the nations.the missouri district court granted the nations claim in part and allowed the in full,decreeing an overall balance in favor of the coal company.id.the government did not appeal this decision.however,the government had filed a separate action in the united states district court for the eastern district of oklahoma against the coal company surety for the same royalties involved in the missouri proceeding.id.in the supreme court the government conceded that its claim for royalties was decided in the previous action,but it argued that the affirmative judgment on the should not be enforced because the missouri district court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate a claim for affirmative relief against the nations because of sovereign immunity,and the affirmative judgment was therefore not entitled to preclusive effect.id.at.the oklahoma district court and the tenth circuit held that the missouri decision on the was preclusive and that the government could not collaterally attack the judgment.id.the supreme court reversed.the court explained that a against the nations was comparable to a claim against the united states and was barred by sovereign immunity unless brought in the appropriate court,and congress had not waived the nations sovereign immunity in the missouri district court.id.at.accordingly,the court held that the earlier missouri judgment was void because against the indian nations are justiciable only in those courts where congress has consented to their consideration,id.at,namely a united states court in the indian territory,id.at.quoting the act of april,stat.finally,the court held that the missouri district court judgment on the was subject to collateral attack because it was void and was not entitled to preclusive effect.id.at.the court explained 
consent alone gives jurisdiction to adjudge against a sovereign.absent that consent,the attempted exercise of judicial power is void.the failure of officials to seek review can not give force to this exercise of judicial power.public policy forbids suit unless consent is given,as clearly as public policy makes jurisdiction exclusive by declaration of the legislative body.
in durfee duke,d,the supreme court cited both kalb and fidelity guaranty for the proposition that the doctrine of sovereign immunity may in some contexts be controlling and allow a party to collaterally attack the jurisdiction of a court,thereby overriding the res judicata effect of the court decision.id.at.the seventh circuit,in united states county of cook,cir,noted that fidelity guaranty permits the united states to ignore proceedings instituted against it in the wrong court because such decisions are void.id.at.likewise,our court concluded in international air response united states,that fidelity guaranty teaches to override the res judicata effect of a prior opinion when its issuing court lack of jurisdiction directly implicat es issues of sovereign immunity.see id.at.
respect for the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of federal claims is no less important than respect for the exclusive jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts in kalb or that of the indian territory courts in fidelity guaranty.the history of the court of federal claims jurisdiction over suits under the tucker act emphasizes the importance that congress ascribed to the exclusive nature of that jurisdiction.in,congress amended the court of federal claims jurisdiction to include jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the united states founded either upon the constitution,or any act of congress or any regulation of an executive department,or upon any express or implied contract with the united states,or for liquidated or unliquidated damages not sounding in tort.this provision has come to be known as the tucker act the act also included a provision known as the little tucker act that gave district courts concurrent jurisdiction with the court of claims over suits against the government in certain instances.stat.codified as amended at as the supreme court has held,the obvious implication of these acts is that congress intended the court of federal claims to have 
exclusive jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the united states for money damages exceeding that is founded either upon the constitution,or any act of congress or any regulation of an executive department,or upon any express or implied contract with the united states,or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort unless congress has withdrawn the tucker act grant of jurisdiction in the relevant statute.
see eastern enters.apfel,d internal quotations omitted see also clinton goldsmith,d under the tucker act,the court of federal claims has exclusive jurisdiction over nontort claims against the government for greater than.
in the light of this history,we see no basis for distinguishing the supreme court decisions in kalb or fidelity guaranty.although we are reluctant to conclude that one of our sister circuits has acted beyond its jurisdiction,we find that it plainly did so here.the fifth circuit ruling,like the ones at issue in kalb and fidelity guaranty,did not merely exceed the court jurisdiction,it directly implicat ed issues of sovereign immunity and is therefore void.see int l air response,at.because the fifth circuit judgment is void,it is not entitled to preclusive effect,despite the fact that the court jurisdiction was not challenged on direct review.see restatement second of judgments,at see also id.at.we accordingly reject the appellants argument that the fifth circuit decision conclusively determined the government liability.the fifth circuit judgment is void as to the contract issues that could have been decided and also as to those contract issues actually decided.
we turn now to the question whether the court of federal claims correctly granted summary judgment in favor of the government on the appellants contract claim.the court of federal claims correctly declined to afford res judicata effect to the fifth circuit decision,but it erred in ascribing collateral estoppel effect to the contract issues decided by the fifth circuit.those issues should have been decided de novo by the court of federal claims.however,while we doubt the correctness of the fifth circuit decision that the government breached in refusing to consider the appellants rent increase request,we are reluctant to address the question of the government breach on the current record.the government did not move for summary judgment on that ground.see christopher.at.rather,the government moved for summary judgment on the ground that,even assuming a government breach in,the government was not liable because the appellants committed prior material breaches in,and by submitting false data to hud in connection with mockingbird run.id.the court of federal claims,agreeing with the government,held that the magi plea agreement established that the appellants had submitted false claims for rent increases to the government in violation of hud regulations and specific terms of the hap contract with the appellants,which prohibited the submittal of,any false statements or misrepresentations to hud in connection with hud mortgage insurance,loan processing or administration of the contract.id.at quoting hap contract app.at.
when a party to a contract is sued for its breach it may ordinarily defend on the ground that there existed,at the time of the breach,a legal excuse for nonperformance coll.point boat united states.see also sun studs,ata equip.leasing.in resolving disputes among parties who each claim that the other has breached,courts will o ften impose liability on the party that committed the first material breach.allen farnsworth,farnsworth on contracts,at emphasis in original.the restatement explains that this doctrine of first material breach,or prior material breach,is based on the principle that where performances are to be exchanged under an exchange of promises,each party is entitled to the assurance that he will not be called upon to perform his remaining duties if there has already been an uncured material failure of performance by the other party.restatement second of contracts,cmt.b.a later breach is justified by the other party prior failure.see also sun studs,at citing this provision of the restatement in a discussion of the doctrine of prior material breach.
the appellants urge that magi plea agreement can not establish a prior material breach by the appellants because neither christopher village nor its general partner wilshire was a party to the plea agreement because the government has not established that the appellants intended to defraud hud when they submitted inflated rent requests because any breach that the appellants may have committed through these false submissions was immaterial and because,even if these false submissions constituted a material breach by the appellants,the government was unaware of them at the time hud breached.
we think that the documentation submitted by the government on its motion for summary judgment did not support the court of federal claims finding that wilshire investments,the general partner in the christopher village limited partnership,was part of the magi fraud.christopher.at.nonetheless,although it is true that the plea agreement did not directly implicate christopher village or wilshire in the fraud,the existence of the false statements concerning mockingbird run is undisputed.on summary judgment the appellants conceded that false data concerning insurance premiums were submitted to the government in connection with the mockingbird run rent increase requests,and that these requests caused the government to make unjustified payments to the appellants.id.at the plaintiffs do not dispute that they submitted false certifications in support of their rent increase requests and that plaintiffs used hud funds to pay for,at least in part,insurance costs.the appellants reiterated this concession at oral argument in our court.it is also clear that the appellants violated both the regulatory agreement and the hap contract by submitting these inflated rent increase requests,contrary to contract provisions that prohibited the submission of false statements or misrepresentations to hud in connection with hud mortgage insurance,hap contract app.at 
while the government has not established that christopher village and wilshire specifically intended to defraud hud,proof of fraudulent intent by wilshire or christopher village is not necessary to establish the appellants breach in this case.the appellants contrary contentions are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the government prior material breach defense.the appellants claim that the plaintiff intent to defraud must be proven under,a statute providing that a plaintiff fraud can cause a forfeiture of its claim against the government this statute,however,is not the basis for the government argument,and the government never mentioned the statute in its brief.the court of federal claims did not hold,and t
