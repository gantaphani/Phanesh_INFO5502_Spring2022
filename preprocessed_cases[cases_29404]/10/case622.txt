elton taylor taylor appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of united parcel service,ups,dismissing taylor claims of discriminatory and retaliatory failure to promote and discriminatory and retaliatory pay disparity.we vacate and remand.
background 
taylor worked for ups in louisiana from until his retirement in.prior to filing this suit on march,taylor,an,was a member of a class action lawsuit filed june,alleging race discrimination in employment by ups.morgan united parcel service of america,d,aff,cir,cert.denied,d.specifically,taylor was a member of the pay and promotion class and gave deposition testimony on behalf of the class.all claims in that class action were dismissed via summary judgment on june,and the eighth circuit affirmed on august.
while the morgan dismissal awaited final determination on appeal,taylor filed a title vii charge on january,with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.on march,he filed suit in the district court under,louisiana state law,and title vii of the civil rights act of,et,alleging that ups had denied him promotion on the basis of race and retaliation since at least,denied him equal pay on the basis of race and retaliation since november,and provided a hostile work environment.the biggest difference between the claims asserted in the morgan class action and this suit is taylor addition of the retaliation claims,which allegedly are related to his participation in morgan.
ups structure in the united states consists of various regions across the country,which are then subdivided into districts.each district contains several divisions,which in turn contain centers that are responsible for delivery and pickup of packages.center managers report to division managers,who report to the district manager in their district.ups maintains approximately centers in the gulf south district,which includes louisiana.
during taylor tenure at ups he worked in a variety of positions within the gulf south district.in june,he was promoted to center manager,which calls for salary grade on the ups pay scale.taylor provided summary judgment evidence through his expert,rody borg,that he was paid less than other grade white managers as a group,less than other black managers as a group,and,most significantly,less than two specific white managers with like tenure and evaluations.
furthermore,taylor claims that he was denied promotion from center manager to division manager,a grade position.to be promoted to the position of division manager,a center manager must be placed on the ups gulf south district ready now list.decisions about whom to place on the ready now list are made at the discretion of ups managers at the gulf south district.ultimately,taylor attributes his comparatively lower pay and his denial of a division manager promotion to race discrimination and retaliation by ups for his testimony in the morgan class action.
in april,ups filed its first motion for summary judgment,seeking to dismiss all of taylor claims.in early,the district court denied the motion with respect to taylor discriminatory and retaliatory pay disparity claims but granted the motion as to his promotion and hostile work environment claims.taylor united parcel service,d.a central part of the court analysis concerned the statutes of limitations for the various claims and the extent to which the morgan class action tolled the statute of limitations on those claims.id.at.the district court found that tolling ceased on taylor claims in,when the eastern district of missouri dismissed the morgan class claims,rather than in,when the eighth circuit affirmed that dismissal.id.on that basis,taking into account the ordinary limitation period for promotion claims under and state law,as well as the applicable limitation period for his title vii claims,the district court dismissed all of taylor promotion claims arising before march one year prior to filing this suit without further discussion.id.
the district court next considered the three remaining promotion claims,those that arose on or after march.applying the modified mcdonnell douglas framework the district court found that taylor had failed to make out a prima facie case of discrimination with respect to two of those promotion claims because the employees promoted in taylor place were also.id.at.as to the third promotion,the district court found that taylor had failed to rebut ups explanation that he was not promoted because he was not on the ready now list for promotion and thus had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding discrimination.id.at.the district court thus dismissed all of taylor discriminatory promotion claims.
for the retaliatory promotion claims,the district court found that taylor had failed to establish any causal link between his alleged protected activity such as his involvement in the morgan class action in and and ups failure to promote him in the period from march to the filing of this suit.id.at.specifically,the court found that taylor presented no summary judgment evidence that the relevant ups decision makers knew of his involvement with the morgan class action,and taylor otherwise presented no evidence of causation.id.at.the district court found that the time between his involvement in the morgan action and his claims for the period beginning march was simply too long to independently support an inference of causation.id.accordingly,the district court dismissed all of his retaliatory failure to promote claims.
finally,the district court found that taylor had failed to present proper evidence to support a hostile work environment claim,so it dismissed that claim as well.id.at.in light of those dismissals,only the discriminatory and retaliatory pay claims remained.as explained in part of this opinion,given the statute of limitations applicable to those claims,the district court found that they had been tolled during the entire morgan class action and so were potentially viable back to march.id.at.in its ruling,the district court found that genuine issues of material fact remained as to the pay claims and denied ups motion for summary judgment with respect to them.id.at.
ups filed a second motion for summary judgment in february,seeking the dismissal of the pay claims.in granting this motion,the district court concluded that taylor had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding discriminatory or retaliatory pay disparity because the only evidence he presented to prove his claim was the testimony of his proffered expert,borg.the district court characterized borg testimony as based solely on statistics and regression analysis,which it found insufficient.taylor united parcel service,wl,at.accordingly,the district court granted ups motion and dismissed taylor remaining claims.
on appeal,taylor challenges the district court orders granting summary judgment with respect to his promotion and pay disparity claims he does not challenge the dismissal of his hostile work environment claim.
ii.jurisdiction 
the district court had federal question jurisdiction over this suit pursuant to and.we have jurisdiction over the district court final judgment dismissing all of taylor claims pursuant to.
iii.standard of review 
we review the district court rulings on summary judgment motions de novo,employing the same analysis as the district court.allstate ins.disability servs.of the southwest,cir.pursuant to.c,summary judgment should be rendered if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
iv.statutes of limitations and tolling 
a.the consequences of the tolling period selection 
the most important question before us is the extent to which the morgan class action tolled the statute of limitations governing taylor claims.the district court correctly determined that taylor vii promotion claims are subject to a statute of limitations,taylor bunge,cir.ann,while his vii pay disparity claims are subject to a statute of limitations,white bfi waste services,llc,cir.thus,those are the key periods we examine.
ups argues,as the district court found,that taylor claims were tolled only from june,when the morgan suit was filed to june,the date the eastern district of missouri dismissed the class claims in morgan.taylor argues that his claims were tolled from june,to august,the date the eighth circuit affirmed that dismissal.because taylor did not file his individual suit until,the tolling period choice controls the timeliness of taylor suit on a number of his claims.
for the promotion claims governed by a statute of limitations,if we accept ups argument and permit tolling only from to,the statute of limitations for all claims during that period expired,at the latest,in,one year after tolling ended.if ups and the district court are correct,taylor suit was only timely to assert his claims for discrimination that occurred within the period prior to filing suit,from march forward.on the other hand,if,as taylor contends,tolling is permitted until,when the eighth circuit affirmed the morgan dismissal,then taylor suit was filed within the tolling period and his suit may timely assert promotion claims from as early as,one year prior to the filing of the morgan class action.because taylor suit actually does assert promotion claims dating back to the,the choice of tolling periods is crucial to his promotion claims.
taylor pay disparity claims are subject to a statute of limitations,and taylor suit was filed within four years of the morgan district court dismissal.thus,whether tolling ended in or in,taylor may assert claims predating the filing of morgan in.based on the date,the district court found that taylor could assert pay claims arising on or after march.d at.to determine the earliest claims taylor could timely assert,we count back four years from,when the morgan class action was filed.thus,in theory,taylor could assert claims dating back to.although taylor complaint asserts pay disparity claims from november,taylor concedes on appeal that his pay claims are only from through.thus,we consider only taylor pay disparity claims from forward.
selection of the tolling period 
having determined the consequences of the tolling period selections,we turn now to the proper selection of that period.the primary issue presented is whether the morgan class action tolled prescription until,when the district court dismissed the class claims on the merits,or,when the eighth circuit affirmed the dismissal.we start from the bedrock premise that a party who sues on a cause of action tolls the statute of limitations during the entire prosecution of the action,including the prosecution of any appeal otherwise,a plaintiff could not count on an appeal to protect his or her rights ups does not argue that the claims of an individual plaintiff,or a named plaintiff in a class action,are not tolled during the pendency of an appeal.
furthermore,the supreme court has made it clear that members of a certified class are to be treated essentially as named are bound by the resulting they are adequately represented by the class representative and the other requirements of.are met.see,matsushita indus.epstein,d.
the purpose of rule would be subverted by requiring a class member who learns of a pending suit involving a class of which he is a part to monitor that litigation to make certain that his interests are being protected this is not his is the responsibility of the class representative to protect the interests of all class members.
gonzales cassidy,cir.that responsibility does not end at the district court because i t is axiomatic that an appeal is a significant element in the judicial process.id 
the same result does not flow for members of a putative class that has not been certified.as indicated above,the district court found that the certified class action in morgan only tolled the statute of limitations until,when the eastern district of missouri dismissed the class claims in morgan,rather than in,when the eighth circuit affirmed the dismissal.as we explain below,we are satisfied the district court erred in reaching this conclusion because it did not recognize the distinction between putative members of an uncertified class and members of a certified class in determining the application of tolling principles.
we begin with american pipe construction utah,d,and crown,cork seal parker,d,the two most prominent supreme court cases concerning tolling in connection with the denial of class certification.in american pipe,the state of utah timely filed a civil action against american pipe,seeking class action status and describing the putative class the suit was filed days before the applicable statute of limitations ran.at.the district court eventually determined that although the action met the rule a factors,it failed to meet rule a numerosity requirement accordingly,the court entered an order denying class certification under rule c.id.at.eight days after entry of the order,more than former putative class members filed motions to intervene in the action as plaintiffs.id.at.the district court denied their motions,reasoning that the filing of the purported class action had not tolled the statute of limitations with respect to putative class members because the class was never certified.id.after the ninth circuit affirmed,the supreme court granted certiorari.
in a matter of first impression,the supreme court closely examined the text and history of rule,id.at,and determined that,consistent with federal class action procedure commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action.id.at.applying this rule,the court explained that the statute of limitations period,which had been tolled days prior to its expiration by the filing of the suit,resumed when the district court denied certification.id.at.because the motions to intervene were filed eight days after entry of the denial order,they were timely,and the former putative class members could intervene to assert their rights.id.
in crown,cork seal,the respondent,parker,was a putative class member in an employment discrimination class action,which was filed in september.at.at the same time,parker was pursuing an eeoc charge,and the eeoc sent him a notice of his right to sue on november,giving him days to file suit.id.at.thus,he received the notice while he was a member of a putative class,but before the district court had made a class certification decision.
in may,the named plaintiffs in the purported class action filed a motion for class certification,which the court denied in september for failure to meet the rule requirements of typicality,adequate representation,and numerosity that action continued as an action with only the named plaintiffs as parties.id.parker did not intervene in the action but instead filed his own action,within days after the denial of class certification but nearly two years after receiving the eeoc notice.id.at.
the only issue presented on appeal was whether the class action tolled the statute of limitations for parker even though he filed an individual suit instead of intervening in the existing suit after class certification had been denied the supreme court held that t he filing of a class action tolls the statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class,not just as to intervenors.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.parker entire limitation period triggered by the eeoc notice was tolled by the purported class action because he received the notice while the action was pending.id.at.tolling did not resume until class certification was denied,and parker individual suit was filed within days of that denial thus,it was timely.id.
therefore,it is clear from these cases that if the district court denies class certification under rule,tolling of the statute of limitations ends.our opinion in calderon presidio valley farmers,cir,makes it clear that an appeal of the denial of class certification does not extend the tolling period.there,the district court had previously denied class certification,and when the plaintiffs appeal of that ruling reached us,we remanded the case and specifically invited the district court to reconsider its denial of class certification.at.in the meantime,after the denial of certification but before the appeal was decided,the statute of limitations ran.id.at.
on remand,the district court certified a class that included former putative class members.on appeal the second time,we determined that tolling had ended for the former putative class members claims when the district court initially denied class certification.id.because those claimants had failed to protect their rights by intervening or filing suit after the denial of certification,the statute of limitations expired in the interim,and the district court new certification order could not revive those claims.id.calderon therefore establishes that the denial of certification ends the tolling period without regard to any appeal from that decision.calderon does not control the instant case,however,because it did not involve the merits dismissal of the claims of a certified class,as this case does.
fortunately,the third circuit in edwards boeing vertol,cir,vacated on other grounds,d,considered a case with facts identical in principle to today case.the appellant,edwards,was an employee of the defendant,boeing vertol.at.he was also a class member but not a named plaintiff in a class action,croker boeing vertol division,filed september,asserting employment discrimination claims against boeing vertol arising on or after september.id.the croker district court certified the class on august,but on june,following the liability portion of a bifurcated trial,the district court dismissed the claims of class members,including edwards,on the merits.croker boeing vertol division.critically,however,the croker district in the morgan class not deny class certification.see id.the third circuit,sitting en banc,affirmed the dismissal of the class claims on september.see croker boeing vertol div,cir en banc 
while the class action was pending,edwards filed an individual eeoc charge on november,received a notice of his right to sue in,and filed an individual suit in december.edwards,at.edwards argued that his claims,arising as early as september,had been tolled by the croker action,but the district court refused to consider any claims arising before may,days prior to the filing of his eeoc charge.id.at 
on appeal,the third circuit found that the croker action had tolled the running of the statute of limitations on edwards claims until the merits dismissal was affirmed on appeal.although american pipe and crown,cork seal were not controlling,the court relied on the principles established in those cases to determine when tolling ends for the claims of a certified class member 
reliance on the pendency of a certified class action is more reasonable than the reliance on an uncertified class action which those cases approve.the certification of the class should discourage,rather than encourage,the proliferation of filings of individual actions consistency with the policies reiterated in crown,cork seal requires that the tolling of the statute of limitations continue until a final adverse determination of class claims.that occurred in this case on september.
id.at footnote omitted.
in concluding that tolling continued until september,when the district court judgment was affirmed on appeal,the edwards court followed the general rule that tolling continues until the judgment in the case becomes final or until a final adverse determination is made.if the judgment is appealed,this occurs when the appeal is decided if no appeal is taken,the judgment becomes final when the time for appeal ends.edwards,as a member of a certified class,was given the same rights as a named plaintiff with respect to tolling since edwards filed his complaint before the croker case was finally determined in favor of boeing vertol,he should be able to prove any acts of discrimination against him which he could have proved had he been a named party in that action.id.
the result reached by edwards is not inconsistent with american pipe,crown,cork seal,or calderon.in those cases,the district court refusal to certify the class was tantamount to a declaration that only the named plaintiffs were parties to the suit.thus,those cases logically concluded that after the district court denial of certification,the putative class members had no reason to assume that their rights were being protected.stated differently,they were notified that they were no longer parties to the suit and they should have realized that they were obliged to file individual suits or intervene in the class action.this conclusion follows from the limited inquiry under rule regarding class certification 
the analysis under rule must focus on the requirements of the rule,and if findings made in connection with those requirements overlap findings that will have to be made on the merits,such overlap is only coincidental.the findings made for resolving a class action certification motion serve the court only in its determination of whether the requirements of rule have been demonstrated.
bell ascendant solutions,cir.
when a class is certified,however,the district court has necessarily determined that all of the rule factors are met.from that point forward,unless the district court later decertifies the class for failure to satisfy the rule factors,members of the certified class may continue to rely on the class representative to protect their interests throughout the entire prosecution of the suit,including appeal.a contrary rule would require certified class members to immediately intervene or file individual suits in the event of a merits dismissal of the class action in the district court.such a rule would not work to prevent needless multiplicity of actions,crown,cork seal,at,and would ignore the intended benefit of representation of a class of claimants.see edwards,at.
applying the above principles to the case before us,we find a clear answer to the tolling question.the morgan district court granted conditional certification on october,and modified the classes on april,all under rule the court never denied certification.see morgan,d at.the court june,order granting summary judgment was on the merits and did not consider certification under rule,although ups had moved,in the alternative,for decertification of the class id.at.on appeal,the eighth circuit august,opinion addressed the merits of the class claims and did not mention the rule factors.see morgan.
in sum,because the morgan district court did not deny class certification,american pipe,crown,cork seal,and calderon are inapposite.because taylor remained a member of a certified class while morgan was on appeal,he was entitled to assume that the class representatives continued to represent him and protect his interests in appealing the order dismissing the class claims on the merits.this is consistent with the general rule that all members of a certified class enjoy the same rights as individually named plaintiffs in the suit.thus,we conclude that taylor claims were tolled until august,when the eighth circuit affirmed the district court order in morgan.this action by the court of appeals was the final adverse determination of the claims of the certified class of which taylor was a member.
title vii claims 
the district court found that taylor was required to file any title vii charges of discriminatory conduct within days of the alleged unlawful conduct.taylor,d at citing e.taylor filed his eeoc charge on january,so the district court,calculating days prior to the eeoc charge,found that all of taylor title vii claims arising prior to march,were.id.however,filing a timely charge of discrimination with the eeoc is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court,but a requirement that,like a statute of limitations,is subject to waiver,estoppel,and equitable tolling.zipes trans world airlines,d.in light of our determination that taylor other claims were timely,the district court should examine on remand whether taylor title vii claims were also timely.
conclusion 
because taylor claims were tolled until augu
