matthew hart sued fci lender services,fci,his mortgage loan servicer and a debt collector,seeking damages under the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa or the act,et,on behalf of himself and others similarly situated.hart asserts that fci violated the act by sending him two written communications that failed to comply with fdcpa requirements that debt collectors timely provide certain notices to debtors.the first of the communications is a letter advising hart that fci had assumed mortgage servicing responsibilities related to hart mortgage loan.the second is a payment statement that fci sent hart some months later.the act notice obligations are triggered by a debt collector initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt.
the united states district court for the western district of new york charles siragusa,judge granted fci motion to dismiss hart amended complaint for failure to state a claim,ruling principally that the letter,which the court viewed as primarily a informational notice sent pursuant to the real estate settlement procedures act respa,was not also a communication sent in connection with the collection of any debt under the fdcpa.see hart fci lender,cv,wl.the district court also ruled that hart failed to allege adequately or otherwise that fci violated the fdcpa by mailing the payment statement.finally,the district court denied hart leave to file a second amended complaint.on appeal,hart challenges all three rulings.
construing the fdcpa in light of its remedial purposes,we agree with hart that he has adequately alleged that fci sent the letter in connection with the collection of a debt,thereby triggering the fdcpa initial notice requirements.we accordingly vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings,without addressing hart alternative arguments that the later payment statement triggered those requirements and that he should have been given a further opportunity to amend his complaint.
background 
we draw this narrative from the allegations of hart first amended complaint,see app,including the documents attached to the amended complaint as exhibits,see.c.we accept hart factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.see ashcroft iqbal.
hart,a mortgagor,filed suit under the act seeking damages from fci,a corporation offering a full spectrum of loan servicing,collection and foreclosure services locally or nationally.am.compl.as an integral part of its business,fci regularly collects payments on non performing loans that is,loans that are in default.id.hart case rests primarily on a letter sent to him by fci in july the letter,after fci assumed loan servicing obligations for hart mortgage loan from gmac mortgage,llc gmac,the prior servicer.hart was in default on his mortgage loan when fci assumed servicing responsibilities.
the text of the letter requires our close scrutiny.entitled transfer of servicing letter and dated,it consists of one and pages on fci letterhead in the format of a signed letter,and two numbered pages of attachments.app.in the body of the letter,fci notifies hart that fci has become his mortgage loan servicer the text begins,please be advised that effective june,the servicing of your mortgage loan with gmac mortgage,llc,secured by a deed of on real property,has been assigned to fci lender services,app.it informs hart that his loan number has been changed and instructs that b eginning june,you should mail your payments,including all past due payments,to fci lender services,id.the letter provides relevant timing,payment,and correspondence particulars about the transfer.
the body of the letter also refers expressly to consumer rights conferred by section of respa.congress enacted respa to protect consumers from certain abusive practices that had developed in some areas of the country with respect to the settlement process used for residential real estate purchases and sales.a.respa obligates a new servicer of certain types of mortgage loans timely to notify the borrower of the change in servicer and to provide certain other information regarding the transfer.see id.c.reflecting as none dispute fci effort to meet its obligations under respa,the letter body identifies the effective date of the servicing transfer,provides phone numbers for both fci and gmac,and further details hart rights under respa regarding for example the timeliness of payments sent during the transfer period and how a consumer may dispute aspects of his account.
the letter third page the first page of the attachment plays a pivotal role here.entitled important notices please read,it contains the following language,in the following format insofar as reproducible here

app.sic the attachment is not separately signed,and it follows the signature line appearing on the second page of the main body of the letter.see app.
on february,hart filed this suit against fci as a putative class action,alleging that fci violated the fdcpa by sending the letter and,inter alia,failing to identify the current creditor and misstat ing the debtor rights,compl.information that the act requires a debt collector to provide within five days of an initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt.hart sought an award of statutory damages in an amended complaint filed some months later,hart added allegations that his mortgage was in default when it was transferred to fci for servicing and that fci regularly and as an integral part of its business collected debts,both factors that he contended rendered fci a debt collector under the act.hart attached as an exhibit to the amended complaint both the letter and a december,payment statement the payment statement sent by fci to hart and showing amounts of,as well as the principal balance of hart loan and late charges due.see app.
fci moved under.b to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim,arguing principally that as a matter of law the letter was not fci initial communication in connection with the collection of any debt under the fdcpa.the district court accepted that argument and granted fci motion to dismiss.see hart,wl,at.in light of deadlines imposed by a scheduling order entered in the interim the district court concluded further that hart was not entitled to amend his complaint a second time to add allegations that the payment statement,too,gave rise to notice obligations under the act.see id.at.
hart timely appealed.
discussion 
hart maintains that the letter was sent in connection with the collection of a debt.in the alternative,he contends that the amended complaint plausibly established that the payment statement triggered fci notice obligations and that the district court abused its discretion in denying him leave to further amend his complaint to add new allegations relating to the payment statement.fci responds,in essence,that the letter was intended merely to comply with respa by providing certain information that is,it was not aimed at collect ing a debt and thus did not trigger the fdcpa notice requirements hart failed to plead adequately that the payment statement served as a predicate for an fdcpa violation and the district court acted within the fair scope of its discretion in denying hart a second opportunity to amend his complaint.
we review de novo a district court grant of a defendant motion to dismiss.see city of pontiac emps.ret.mbia,cir.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.iqbal,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in passing the fdcpa,congress aimed to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors,to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged,and to promote consistent state action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.e.a particular goal was to address the recurring problem of debt collectors dunning the wrong person or attempting to collect debts which the consumer has already paid.jacobson healthcare fin,cir quoting,at,as reprinted in u.
section of title in which the act is codified is entitled validation of debts and requires a debt collector to furnish a written notice conveying certain information the notice to a consumer debtor upon the debt collector initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt.a when an initial communication triggers the act notice obligations,the debt collector must either include a notice in that communication or send a separate written notice to the debtor within the following five days,unless by that time the debtor has already paid the debt.see id.the required contents of the notice relate both to the particular debt and to the consumer rights under the act the notice must state the amount of the debt and the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed and must inform the consumer of her right to dispute the debt validity and to enforce these and other provisions,the fdcpa grants a private right of action to a consumer who receives a communication that violates the act.jacobson,at see.
fci concedes for purposes of this appeal that it is a debt collector covered by the act.further,the parties agree that the letter was fci initial communication with hart the parties disagree,however,as to whether that initial communication was in connection with the collection of any debt,so as to give rise to notice obligations the statute offers no definition for the phrase.
the letter 
fci urges that,rather than seeking to compel hart to pay his debt,the letter was intended only to provide information so as to comply with respa.accordingly,fci argues,the letter was not sent in connection with the collection of hart debt,and fci had no obligation to provide the complete recitation of information required by.
the district court accepted this construction of both the act and the letter.examining the letter,which it denominated the or respa letter,the court reasoned that 
the letter did not attempt to induce hart to make payment,but rather,it assumes that he will be making payments and directs where he should send them.the notice is informational in nature,and does not reference an amount owed or threaten to take any action if payment is not made t he document itself establishes that it was not sent in order to induce hart to make a payment.
hart,wl,at emphasis in original.the court acknowledged that the third page of the letter included certain required fdcpa notifications including the language this is an attempt to collect upon a debt,see id.at but the court did not refer to that material in its analysis,see id.at.
this court has never addressed the scope of the fdcpa in connection with the collection of any debt language.we here conclude that whether a communication is in connection with the collection of a debt is a question of fact to be determined by reference to an objective standard.thus,in determining at the motion to dismiss stage whether the letter triggers the act notice provisions,we must view the communication objectively,asking whether hart has plausibly alleged that a consumer receiving the communication could reasonably interpret it as being sent in connection with the collection of a debt,rather than inquiring into the sender subjective purpose.see,ruth triumph,cir t he proper standard for assessing whether a communication is in connection with the collection of any debt is an objective one.grden leikin ingber winters pc,cir affirming award of summary judgment to defendant where a reasonable jury could not find that the communication was in connection with the collection of a debt.such an inquiry is consistent with the fdcpa goal of protecting consumers if a consumer receiving a letter could reasonably understand it to be a communication in connection with the collection of a debt,then the consumer is entitled to the protections congress has mandated for such communications.an objective standard that determines the apparent purpose of a communication with an eye towards a consumer understanding also aligns with our teaching that the fdcpa is remedial in nature,and its terms must be construed in liberal fashion if the underlying congressional purpose is to be effectuated.vincent v.the money store,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the parties dispute the extent to which a communication to be deemed made in connection with the collection of any debt must be designed to induce the debtor payment.fci,citing standards adopted by the sixth and seventh circuits,argues that such a communication must attempt to induce the borrower to pay,not just convey information about the debt.appellee br.see gburek litton loan servicing lp,cir ruling that the fdcpa does not apply to every communication between a debt collector and a debtor,but that a communication made to induce a debtor to settle her debt will trigger the statute protections emphasis in original see also grden,at holding that,for the fdcpa notice provision to apply,an animating purpose of the communication must be to induce payment by the debtor.hart,in turn,points out that a district court in our circuit,in tocco real time resolutions,d,recently construed the phrase far more flexibly when it rejected the dichotomy and reasoned that in connection with is synonymous with the phrases related to,associated with,and with respect to,and does not necessitate any inducement element.id.at.
we need not delineate the outer bounds of the phrase in connection with the collection of any debt,however,because we have no difficulty in concluding that an attempt to collect a debt which we believe the letter was qualifies as a communication in connection with the collection of any debt.indeed,we see few types of communications as more obviously in connection with the collection of debts than attempts to collect debts.see,caceres mccalla raymer,llc,cir concluding that a letter was an attempt to collect a debt and therefore a communication in connection with the collection of a debt.moreover,in passing the fdcpa,congress identified abusive collection attempts as primary motivations for the act passage.see,at.accordingly,we think that treating an attempt to collect a debt as a communication in connection with the collection of any debt easily accords with the plain meaning of the broad statutory language,as well as with the act remedial purpose of halting abusive collection practices and giving debtors adequate information about their rights and obligations 
hart has sufficiently alleged that the letter viewed objectively is an attempt to collect a debt.the letter references hart particular debt,directs hart to mail his payments,including all past due payments,to fci lender services,at a specified address,and refers to the fdcpa by name.app.more critically,it warns hart that he must dispute the d
