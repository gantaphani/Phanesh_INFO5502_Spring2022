a judge of the court called for a vote on whether to rehear the matter en banc.on such vote,a majority of the active judges failed to vote in favor of en banc rehearing but a small minority of active judges has dissented from the majority denial of en banc rehearing.
as we stated in our initial order the order,when we interpret a statute,our purpose is always to discern the intent of congress.amalgamated transit union local laidlaw transit,cir citation omitted.and in pursuing that end,we recognized the supreme court teaching that there is a strong presumption that congress has expressed its intent in the language it chose.id.citing ins,d.the dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc the dissent,however,would turn that presumption into an irrebuttable one.it would do so by ignoring the substantial body of both supreme court and circuit case law on which the order interpretation of c is grounded.the dissent pretends that the entire office of statutory interpretation is comprehended within the plain meaning rule but the law,plainly,is not as the dissent would have it.
a quarter century ago,we recognized that the plain meaning rule 
does not require a court to operate under an artificially induced sense of amnesia about the purpose of legislation,or to turn a blind eye towards significant evidence of congressional intent in the legislative history i t is no talismanic invocation of an exclusively privileged status for apparently unambiguous statutory language.rather,it is a recognition of the practical principle that evidence is sometimes so good in the first place to which one turns that it is unnecessary to look further.

finally,the dissent asserts that we justified our decision by claiming that the statute was illogical.dissent at.this is a misreading of our order.we did not point out the illogic of the statute to justify our decision,but as further evidence in our search for congress intent.the dissent does not even acknowledge the primary purpose of statutory ascertain and to effectuate the intent of than to scoff at it.dissent at if congress intended something different,let congress fix it.the dissent would woodenly apply the plain meaning rule to the exclusion of all other rules of statutory interpretation.but the dissent unduly narrow view of the office of statutory interpretation comports with neither the teaching of the supreme court nor the law of our circuit.
the sua sponte call for en banc rehearing is denied.
is less more to lawyers,unlike philosophers,the question may appear facetious,but the answer has implications.section a of the class action fairness act of cafa,a,stat,creates c,which provides for a permissive appeal when the district court refuses to accept a class action removed from state court.see bush cheaptickets,cir.specifically,section c provides 
a court of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the state court from which it was removed if application is made to the court of appeals not less than days after entry of the order.

amalgamated transit union local and individuals,filed suit against laidlaw transit services,and first transit,in the san diego county superior court.the appellants are current and former employees of the appellees and allege that the appellees violated california meal and rest period laws.on june,appellees removed the action to the united states district court for the southern district of california,pursuant to.appellants moved to remand the action to state court.on october,the district court entered an order holding that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the suit as a class action under d b and d a and denying the motion to remand.
the appellants filed a petition for permission to appeal to this court days after the district court order denying remand,a period that was,plainly,not less than days after entry of the district court order.c.nevertheless,the panel found appellants petition untimely.the panel declared section c entirely illogical because section c as written creates a waiting period of seven days before which an appeal is too early.amalgamated,at.though troubled that,in contrast to most statutory construction cases where we are usually asked to construe the meaning of an ambiguous phrase or word,we are here faced with the task of striking a word passed on by both houses of congress and approved by the president,and replacing it with a word of the exact opposite meaning,the panel did just that.id.at.the panel confession was forthright 
we have construed the statute to require a procedural framework that is not readily apparent from the statutory text or its legislative history,and have changed the statutory deadline for seeking to appeal to the opposite of what the plain language of the statute says.under our interpretation,plaintiffs timely notice of appeal is ineffectual and their subsequent petition for permission to appeal was filed too late.

the text of c is unmistakably clear,and the panel should have applied the statute as written.in its decision,the panel conceded that the language of section c is unambiguous.amalgamated,at.once it recognized that the statute is unambiguous,the panel should have stopped,for it is a paramount principle of statutory construction that w here a statute language is plain and admits of no more than one meaning the duty of interpretation does not arise,and the rules which are to aid doubtful meanings need no discussion.carson harbor,unocal,cir en banc quoting caminetti united states.accord lamie,d noting that the statute is awkward,and even ungrammatical but that does not make it ambiguous.
despite the fact that section c is clear and,therefore,the duty of interpretation did not arise,the panel nevertheless relied on legislative history to trump the statutory language.see amalgamated,at.after finding that the statute itself was not good evidence of congress intent,the panel simply substituted the legislative history for the statute itself.but g oing behind the plain language of a statute in search of a possibly contrary congressional
