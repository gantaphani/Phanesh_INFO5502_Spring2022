various individual and business retail natural gas customers in the state of kansas plaintiffs,appeal the dismissal of their class action complaint for lack of jurisdiction under.b.the three named defendants kansas gas service company kgs,greeley gas company greeley,and utilicorp united,utilicorp collectively,defendants,are local natural gas public utilities operating within the state of kansas.plaintiffs complaint asserted claims arising under the natural gas policy act of,ngpa and based on alleged deprivations of their property without due process or just compensation.the complaint sought,inter alia,a declaratory judgment that plaintiffs have a property interest in certain refunds that defendants have received from various interstate natural gas pipelines and that the refunds should therefore be distributed to plaintiffs and other similarly situated retail natural gas customers.the district court dismissed the action on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction under the johnson act or and this appeal followed.our jurisdiction arises under,and we affirm.
background 
plaintiffs allege that they were retail natural gas customers of defendants or their predecessors in interest between and.during this time the ngpa set statutory price ceilings for sales of natural gas by natural gas producers to interstate natural gas pipelines despite these price ceilings,the ngpa authorized producers to sell gas for amounts exceeding the price limits in order to recover the cost of any state severance,production,or similar tax,fee,or other levy imposed on the production of natural gas.repealed effective aplee.at.because,in,the federal power commission,the predecessor to the federal energy regulatory commission ferc,qualified kansas ad valorem taxes as a recoverable production tax,producers of natural gas from that time forward charged them to their interstate pipeline customers.the interstate pipelines,in turn,added those amounts to the price of natural gas charged to ldcs including the defendants in this action,which in turn passed the costs through to their retail customers via purchased gas adjustment clauses or cost of gas riders collectively,pga clauses in their filed rate tariffs 
in,more than a decade after natural gas producers first started charging interstate pipelines to recover the cost of kansas ad valorem taxes,a complaint was filed before the ferc challenging the legality of the charges on the ground that the taxes did not constitute a production,severance or similar tax,and that the rates charged therefore violated the ngpa to the extent that they exceeded the act prescribed price ceilings.sun exploration prod,wl,at.after initially upholding the legality of the charges,and after several years of litigation including multiple appeals to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit,the ferc concluded that the taxes at issue should be treated as property taxes rather than severance taxes,and that the prices charged therefore violated the ngpa.colorado interstate gas,wl,at.consequently,the ferc ordered the natural gas producers to refund the overcharge amounts to their interstate pipeline customers,and the interstate pipelines to pass through the refunds to the affected ldcs.id.at.the district of columbia circuit affirmed the ferc holding and ordered the producers to refund the taxes included in the rates charged to interstate pipelines between and.public serv.of colorado ferc.
subsequent to the ferc orders,the kansas corporation commission kcc which under kansas law is charged with regulating the rates and charges of natural gas ldcs,see.stat.ann.to a docket to determine how the refunds should be distributed by the ldcs to their numerous retail customers.in,the kcc approved each defendant refund distribution plan.each plan proposed to allocate a portion of the refunded amounts to a energy assistance program with the remainder to be refunded to specified categories of retail customers.
on january,the kcc issued an order directing kgs to release a portion of the refund amounts in its possession for use in its approved assistance program,with the remainder to be immediately distributed to current sales customers through its pga clause.by the end of january,however,it had become apparent that many residential natural gas customers would face significant hardships due to the combination of winter temperatures and substantially higher natural gas prices based in part on these changed circumstances,the kcc issued an order on february,granting reconsideration of the january order and setting a hearing to further discuss distribution of the refunds.aplee.at.
following a series of hearings,orders,and petitions for reconsideration by various concerned parties,the kcc issued an order on may,the may order substantially modifying the manner in which the refunds were to be distributed.the kcc found that residential gas users as a class were impacted more severely than other classes of users by the combination of colder temperatures and higher gas costs.accordingly,the kcc ordered the refund amounts possessed or soon to be possessed by by this time totaled over million be distributed to qualified residential natural gas customers in defendants respective service areas with a family income at or below percent of the federal poverty level.aplee.at.the kcc stated that the maximum amount of any individual refund would be the difference between the customer and heating season natural gas bills and that each eligible customer should receive his or her refund via a bill credit to the customer account in that amount.the kcc further ordered defendants to submit separate distribution plans tailored to the needs of their individual customers within the limits set forth in the may order.
following submission of defendants plans,several intervenors,including the midwest gas users association mgua,an unincorporated association of large natural gas customers whose members included some of the industrial plaintiffs named in this action,filed petitions for reconsideration of the may order.before the kcc ruled on the intervenors petitions,mgua filed a civil action in kansas district court which unsuccessfully sought a temporary restraining order enjoining implementation of the kcc orders.on june,plaintiffs filed the instant action through the same attorneys that represented mgua.the kcc denied the interveners petitions for reconsideration on june,and on july approved with some modifications defendants previously submitted distribution plans.
plaintiffs complaint in the present action sought a declaratory judgment that they have a property interest in the refunds defendants have received and that the refund amounts should therefore be distributed to them and other similarly situated retail customers,the placement of all refund amounts in a constructive trust pending resolution of plaintiffs claims,and an order directing the refunds to be distributed to plaintiffs and other retail customers by virtue of their status as third party beneficiaries of the transactions giving rise to the refunds.at.defendants moved to dismiss on the ground that the district court lacked jurisdiction under,which precludes federal courts from retaining jurisdiction over any suit seeking to enjoin,suspend or otherwise restrain the operation of any order affecting rates chargeable by a public utility and made by a state administrative agency,where four additional requirements are satisfied.the district court granted defendants motion and dismissed the action,holding that the kcc orders at issue were order s affecting rates,and that each of the conditions enumerated in were satisfied.this appeal followed.
discussion 
originally enacted in,the johnson act,provides that 
the district courts shall not enjoin,suspend or restrain the operation of,or compliance with,any order affecting rates chargeable by a public utility and made by a state administrative agency or a body of a state political subdivision,where 
jurisdiction is based solely on diversity of citizenship or repugnance of the order to the federal constitution and,
the order does not interfere with interstate commerce and,
the order has been made after reasonable notice and hearing and,
a plain,speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such state.
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in dismissing their claims under because the kcc orders at issue do not affect rates the johnson act fourth requirement is not met because there is no state remedy in kansas for addressing the wrongs of which plaintiffs complain,aplt.br.at and to the extent plaintiffs have asserted a property right claim arising from a state utility matter,such is well within the jurisdiction grant of under the supreme court recent opinion in verizon maryland,public serv.comm of maryland,d.aplt.br.at

order affecting rates 
in the present action the district court concluded that the kcc orders were orders affecting rates because the kcc itself so characterized the orders and because the rates that qualified natural gas customers would pay for gas would necessarily be less as a result of the orders.at.plaintiffs strenuously contend,however,that the orders did not affect rates because 
there was no change made or sought to tariffs and there was no increase or decrease ordered or sought in the rates that the defendants charge their customers there was merely a mechanism established outside the rates and tariffs to credit select low income customers bills the rates for utility service were not modified at all.
aplt.br.at.
it may be the case,as plaintiffs argue,that the challenged orders did not specifically call for a rate increase or decrease,and n ot one rate in the ldc tariff books will change.aplt.br.at.however,does not require that an order result in a direct rate or tariff modification before it will operate to deprive a federal court of jurisdiction.on the contrary,the proscriptive language contained in clearly requires only that the challenged order or orders affect rates.it makes no difference that the aspect of the orders of which plaintiffs complain,distribution of refunds in the form of a bill credit do not themselves directly involve a rate charged by an ldc or listed in its filed tariff.as we noted in tennyson,the johnson act proscribes federal interference not with a rate simpliciter but with any order affecting rates.at see also national teleinformation network,michigan public serv.comm n,holding that because the phrase order affecting rates does not contemplate the breakdown of a rate affecting order into constituent rate and elements,prohibition on federal interference with such orders should not be selectively applied to only the elements of an order that affect rates.after thoroughly reviewing the kcc orders and the entire record on appeal,we conclude for the reasons that follow that the kcc orders qualify as orders affecting rates under.
consideration of how the refunds would have been distributed in the absence of the challenged orders makes it clear that the kcc orders affected rates for purposes of.in addition to permitting defendants to pass the cost of gas through to retail customers,defendants respective pga clauses each provided that any supplier refunds received must be distributed to defendants current sales customers.aplee.at.furthermore,each clause provided that the kcc could,on a basis,exercise its discretion to alter the manner in which any supplier refunds are distributed.aplee.at.describing how a refund distribution under the unmodified terms of the pga clauses would operate,the kcc stated in its may order that the clauses 
each provide a specific treatment of refunds which would require the refund to be reflected as a reduction in the cost of gas during a period of time which generally would be months.for instance,in kgs tariff a supplier refund factor is calculated and the company shall include the supplier refund factor as a negative adjustment to the cost of gas purchased by the company to meet sales service requirements.all other tariffs examined reach the same result with slightly different language.
aplee.at.however,instead of leaving defendants tariffs to operate on their primary terms which would have spread the refunds to all current sales customers,aplee.at,the kcc exercised its authority to modify the default distribution scheme so as to channel the refund amounts to qualified retail customers.had the kcc not elected to alter the manner in which the refunds would be distributed under the pga clauses,defendants cost of gas would have decreased due to the negative adjustment,which would have translated into a decrease in the per unit price of gas paid by defendants retail customers consequently,the kcc orders which modified the default scheme were clearly orders affecting rates under.
furthermore,the kcc orders affected rates because the may order specifically provided that all refund amounts not needed to meet assistance program requirements must be passed through to existing sales customers pursuant to the procedures set forth under defendants existing pga clauses.see aplee.at.as noted above,such a refund would operate by decreasing the ldc cost of gas,which in turn would decrease the price of gas purchased by retail customers.just as the may order affected rates because it modified the operation of a refund distribution scheme that would have resulted in a reduction of the price of natural gas paid by current sales customers,it also affected rates because it ordered compliance with that default scheme upon the happening of a triggering event.accordingly,we hold that the challenged orders constituted orders affecting rates under.
the four johnson act conditions 
our conclusion that the kcc orders affected rates does not end our inquiry into whether the district court properly determined that it lacked jurisdiction over plaintiffs case.as noted above,deprives a district court of jurisdiction over a suit challenging any order affecting rates only where the section four additional requirements are met.on appeal,plaintiffs do not challenge the district court conclusion that the kcc orders did not interfere with interstate commerce,and that the orders were issued after reasonable notice and hearings.see.at.rather,plaintiffs contend that even if the kcc orders at issue affected rates,is nonetheless inapplicable because jurisdiction was not based solely on diversity of citizenship or a constitutional violation,and plaintiffs have asserted a federal issue for which no adequate state remedy exists.
as to plaintiffs inadequate state remedy argument,we note that plaintiffs failed to raise this argument before the district court.in their memorandum in opposition to defendants motion to dismiss,plaintiffs argued only that the johnson act was inapplicable because the orders at issue did not affect rates,jurisdiction was not based solely on diversity or repugnance of the orders to the constitution,and the order was issued without adequate notice.we have repeatedly
