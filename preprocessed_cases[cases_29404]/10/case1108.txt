emily diaz,the owner of a home warranty plan from first american home buyers protection corporation,filed a class action complaint alleging that first american refused to make timely repairs,used substandard contractors and wrongfully denied claims.she asserted state law claims for unfair competition,misrepresentation,concealment,breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the district court dismissed diaz unfair competition and concealment claims under federal rule of civil procedure b.following denial of class certification,first american made an offer of judgment on diaz remaining individual claims pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.when diaz did not accept the offer,first american moved to dismiss these claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.agreeing that first american unaccepted rule offer rendered diaz remaining claims moot,the district court dismissed the claims under federal rule of civil procedure b,entering judgment in favor of neither party.diaz appealed.
we vacate the district court dismissal of diaz remaining individual claims.we hold that an unaccepted rule offer that would fully satisfy a plaintiff claim is insufficient to render the claim moot.see mccauley trans union,cir.diaz remaining claims,therefore,were not made moot by her refusal to accept first american rule offer,even assuming that the offer would have fully satisfied her claims.accordingly,we vacate the rule b dismissal of diaz claims for misrepresentation,breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
background 
emily diaz brought this class action against first american home buyers protection corporation on behalf of a putative nationwide class consisting of all persons who made a claim under a home warranty plan obtained from first american after march.after first american removed the action to federal court,the district court issued a series of orders dismissing diaz claims for concealment,false promise,unfair competition and violation of the california consumer legal remedies act under rule b.in september,the district court entered an order denying diaz motion for class certification.
a short time thereafter,first american made an offer of judgment to diaz on her remaining individual claims for misrepresentation,breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing pursuant to rule.first american offered to allow judgment to be entered against it and in favor of diaz in the total amount of,plus costs allowed under rule the offer further provided that,i f this offer is not accepted,this offer shall have no effect,be null and void,and be deemed withdrawn,and shall not be presented,admitted,or used for any purpose in any case or proceeding against first american.diaz had until october,to accept the offer.she did not do so.
first american then filed a motion to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.first american argued that the district court should dismiss this action pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure because the action is moot in light of plaintiff refusal to accept a rule offer of judgment for full satisfaction of the amount she could possibly recover at trial.citing decisions by the seventh and fourth circuits,see thorogood sears,roebuck,cir greisz household bank illinois,cir rand monsanto,f d,cir zimmerman bell,cir,first american argued that w here,as here,a plaintiff rejects a rule offer of judgment for the full amount of relief,the district court loses subject matter jurisdiction and must dismiss the action with prejudice.under these decisions,o nce the defendant offers to satisfy the plaintiff entire demand,there is no dispute over which to litigate,and a plaintiff who refuses to acknowledge this loses outright,under.b,because he has no remaining stake.rand,at citation omitted.
in ruling on first american motion,the district court agreed with first american that the rule offer would have fully satisfied diaz remaining individual claims.with respect to monetary relief,first american offer provided the full amount of relief she is entitled to individually.the court recognized that the rule offer did not provide for injunctive or declaratory relief,each of which diaz had sought in her complaint.but the court found that diaz was not entitled to either of these forms of relief.the court deemed diaz request for an injunction not appropriate because she has been offered,and declined,an adequate remedy at law and she no longer holds a home warranty plan with first american.similarly,the court found that diaz claim for declaratory relief was duplicative of her breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant claims and superfluous given that she no longer had a home warranty plan with first american.
having determined that first american offer would have provided diaz complete relief on her remaining individual claims,the court went on to hold that the unaccepted offer was sufficient to render those claims moot.like first american,in the absence of ninth circuit authority the court reached this conclusion by relying on decisions of the seventh and fourth circuits,citing thorogood,at,greisz,at,zimmerman,at,and rand,at.having determined that the claims were moot,the court granted first american motion and dismissed the claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the court initially entered judgment against diaz,but subsequently vacated that judgment and declined to enter judgment or award costs for either party.diaz appealed.
standard of review 
we apply a de novo standard for reviewing a district court decision on subject matter jurisdiction,and,concomitantly apply that standard in reviewing questions of mootness.sample johnson,cir citation omitted.
discussion 
diaz argues that the district court erred by dismissing her remaining individual claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction following her refusal to accept first american rule offer of judgment.she maintains that these claims were not moot,because an unaccepted rule offer does not render a claim moot,even if the offer would have fully satisfied the plaintiff claim even if such an offer does moot a claim,first american offer did not provide complete relief and her remaining claims were not moot because she retained a personal stake in appealing the denial of class certification.we agree with diaz first argument and therefore do not reach her second and third contentions.
diaz first argument requires us to decide whether an unaccepted rule offer that would have fully satisfied a plaintiff claim is sufficient to render the claim moot.the supreme court has yet to address this issue.see genesis healthcare symczyk,while the courts of appeals disagree whether an unaccepted offer that fully satisfies a plaintiff claim is sufficient to render the claim moot,we do not reach this question,or resolve the split,because the issue is not properly before us.footnote omitted.nor have we squarely addressed the issue.in pitts terrible herbst,cir,we held that an unaccepted rule offer of judgment for the full amount of the named plaintiff individual claim and made before the named plaintiff files a motion for class certification does not moot a class action emphasis added,but we did not squarely address whether the offer mooted the plaintiff individual claim.we assumed that an unaccepted offer for complete relief will moot a claim,but we neither held that to be the case nor analyzed the issue.see id.at.in gcb communications,south communications,cir,we noted that a case will become moot when an opposing party has agreed to everything the other party has demanded,but we did not address the effects of an unaccepted rule offer,an issue not presented in that case.we therefore treat this as an open question in this circuit.
other circuits are divided on the question.the seventh circuit holds that an unaccepted rule offer for complete relief will moot a plaintiff claim and that the plaintiff loses outright.see rand monsanto,cir once the defendant offers to satisfy the plaintiff entire demand,there is no dispute over which to litigate,and a plainti
