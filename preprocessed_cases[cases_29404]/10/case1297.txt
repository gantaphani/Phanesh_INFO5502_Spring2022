we grant a writ of mandamus to prevent disclosure of communications by prospective clients to their lawyers.
plaintiffs sued smithkline beecham corporation,which does business as glaxosmithkline.they claim injury from paxil,a medication manufactured by smithkline.plaintiffs did not initiate contact with their lawyers by walking into the law office.instead,the law firm posted a questionnaire on the internet,seeking information about potential class members for a class action the law firm contemplated the district court ordered plaintiffs to produce the four plaintiffs answers to the questionnaire plaintiffs seek,and we grant,a writ of mandamus vacating the district court order compelling production 
the law firm that now represents the plaintiffs posted a questionnaire relating to the antidepressant paxil on the internet.although the firm in its briefs calls the questionnaire an intake questionnaire,it did not call it that on the net.the law firm presentation on the web does not say that those who answer the questionnaire are submitting themselves to the firm as potential clients.
the questionnaire is entitled paxil withdrawal litigation initial contact.its introduction,in boldface,says that its purpose is to gather information.the subject of the information is potential class members,but responses are requested,not only from potential class members,but also from loved ones who would presumably include siblings,parents of adult children,and others who knew of another person paxil use,but who could not be plaintiffs in a lawsuit for damages from paxil 
the questionnaire asks for extensive information about use of paxil and symptoms.at the end,it suggests that you do not sign nor return a form that glaxosmithkline might send requesting an authorization for release of medical records.then,in order to cause the questionnaire to be emailed to the law firm,the person filling it out has to check a yes box.the yes box acknowledges that the questionnaire does not constitute a request for legal advice and that i am not forming an attorney client relationship by submitting this information.
the law firm,as it has acknowledged,was careful to avoid committing itself to an relationship.it might and did receive many thousands of responses,and did not want to leave itself open to suits for malpractice to those who answered,such as for letting the statutes of limitations run.
more important than what the law firm intended is what the clients thought.here,there is ambiguity.on the one hand,the form can be filled out by a loved one rather than by the potential client,and the person sending it in has to acknowledge that he is not requesting legal advice and is not forming an attorney client relationship by sending it in.the form also states that the person will not have retained an attorney until he signs a fee agreement and that local counsel may be contacted for referral of this matter.the form states that its purpose is to gather information about potential class members,not to consider accepting them as clients.on the other hand,the stated purpose of gathering information about potential class members suggests that the firm is indeed trolling for clients.
the manufacturer sought the four plaintiffs questionnaires in discovery to juxtapose against what they are now claiming in discovery to determine whether or not the two fit and whether there any information that provides for fertile at trial.the plaintiffs opposed production on the basis of the privilege.no privilege relating to confidential medical disclosures is asserted,no doubt because the nature of the claims,damages from paxil withdrawal,would make the medical information disclosed in the questionnaires discoverable,if the same questions were put fully to plaintiffs in interrogatories or depositions.
the district court concluded that the privilege did not apply because the disclaimer established that the communications were not confidential and that checking the yes box waived the privilege.the district court acknowledged that under california law the privilege applied to communications with an attorney by a prospective client with a view to employing the attorney.although the district court did not label any part of its decision findings of fact,its decision states that the law firm posted the questionnaire online to find potential clients,that the four individuals submitted answers because they were seeking legal representation,and that as a result of submitting the questionnaires they obtained representation by the law firm.
what tipped the district court in favor of disclosure was the checked yes box disclaimer that included i agree that the above does not constitute a request for legal advice and that i am not forming an attorney client relationship by submitting this information.the district court concluded that the plaintiffs attorneys could not assert the privilege against the defendants when they insisted on a disclaimer of confidentiality to protect themselves.
plaintiffs seek a writ of mandamus because once the information is out of the bag,you ca stuff it back in.defendant opposes the writ,arguing that the disclaimers on the questionnaire establish that by submitting answers,the plaintiffs were not seeking legal advice,and were not assured that their answers would be confidential.
mandamus is a drastic remedy limited to extraordinary situations.the writ may be denied even where,on an appeal or petition for review,we would conclude that the petitioner was correct.we apply the bauman factors in exercising our discretion whether to grant the writ 
the party seeking the writ has no other adequate means,such as a direct appeal,to attain the relief he or she desires.the petitioner will be damaged or prejudiced in a way not correctable on appeal.the district court order is clearly erroneous as a matter of law.the district court order is an error,or manifests a persistent disregard of the federal rules.the district court order raises new and important problems,or issues of law of first impression 
like all tests,this one gives an appearance of more precision than it really has,but it nevertheless furnishes useful guidance.
the first and second factors are satisfied,because once the questionnaires are disclosed to the defendant,the disclosure can not be undone,by appeal or otherwise.but that does not distinguish this case from the myriad discovery disputes for which we do not grant interlocutory relief.there is nothing to support the fourth factor,error,or persistent disregard of the rules.
the third and fifth factors are determinative in this case,particularly the fifth.as required by the fifth factor,the problem is new and important.part of the importance is that,although only four questionnaires are before us,thousands more are waiting in the wings because this is a consolidated multidistrict litigation with thousands of plaintiffs.of even greater salience is the fundamental importance of the privilege to our adversarial system of justice.what is new about the case is attorneys trolling for clients on the internet and obtaining there the kind of detailed information from large numbers of people that used to be provided only when a potential client physically came into a lawyer office.two things had to happen to bring this about the change in law in the that permitted attorney advertising and the sufficiently widespread use of the internet,within the past five or ten years,that makes internet advertising worthwhile.
of course,these reasons for granting the writ justify it only if the district court order is clearly erroneous as a matter of law.we conclude that it is.
the first determination the district court made was whether,absent consideration of the disclaimer,the questionnaires were submitted in the course of an relationship and thus ordinarily protected under california privilege.concluding that they were,the district court next considered whether the disclaimer at the bottom of the questionnaire acted as a waiver of the protections afforded under the privilege.this second step is where the district court clearly erred.
in considering the first step,the district court said that t he fo
