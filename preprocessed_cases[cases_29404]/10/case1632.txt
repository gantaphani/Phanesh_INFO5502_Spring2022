introduction 
defendants,thomas bundy,misty sanchez,kevin prevost and david godina,appeal from an order vacating partial arbitration awards against plaintiffs,countrywide financial corporation and full spectrum lending.judge elizabeth white vacated the partial arbitration awards on the ground the arbitrator committed a number of legal errors.because of the unambiguous choice of law language in the agreements to arbitrate,we conclude we must apply the vacatur provisions applicable before a united states district court in a case subject to the federal arbitration act.et when we apply the vacatur provisions of the federal arbitration act,we conclude no grounds permitted the partial awards to be vacated.although it is uncertain whether the manifest disregard of the law vacatur rule remains extant,we apply it and the federal excess of powers standard of judicial review to the partial awards.thus,we reverse the order vacating the partial arbitration awards.we do not address the parties other contentions including their statute of limitations analysis.
ii.procedural history 
overview of the two arbitration demands 
on august,defendants filed two separate arbitration demands on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated before the american arbitration the arbitration and the godina arbitration.both arbitration demands were filed against countrywide financial corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary,full spectrum lending,which was formed in.full spectrum lending,primarily handled the loans of countrywide financial corporation.but full spectrum lending,also handled prime quality loans.the arbitration was brought on behalf of account executive s employed at all full spectrum lending branches whose principal function was the sale of loan products.the godina arbitration was bought on behalf of specified call center employees.the two arbitration cases were ultimately consolidated.
the arbitration demand sought classwide arbitration of claims for unpaid wages including incentive compensation,waiting penalties,costs and attorney fees pursuant to labor code section et,business and professions code section et,and common law principles.additionally,the arbitration demand alleged defendants failed to pay incentive compensation earned on loans originated and closed in california on a basis as required by labor code section and upon termination of employment pursuant labor code sections and.the precise nature of the alleged forfeiture of wages will be discussed later.
according to the arbitration demand plaintiffs employed bundy between april and november as an account executive at full spectrum lending,classified as a non exempt employee under federal and state wage and hour laws,bundy was to be paid plus incentive compensation annually and bundy was to receive monthly and quarterly incentive bonuses based on the number of loans funded during the relevant pay period.according to the arbitration demand,bundy was not paid as required by labor code section.in addition,bundy did not receive his monthly incentive compensation for november through.further,he did not receive quarterly incentive compensation and quarterly compensation for loans funded between july and november.when bundy left plaintiffs employ,he was owed at least in incentive compensation.
as to sanchez,the arbitration demand alleged she was employed by plaintiffs as an account executive between may and may.prior to january,sanchez was unlawfully classified as an exempt employee.under the terms of her employment agreement she was to be paid for her first two months of employment for her third month and per month thereafter.in addition,she was to receive monthly and quarterly incentive compensation.throughout her employment,sanchez did not receive compensation to which she was entitled in violation of labor code section.further,when she left plaintiffs employ,sanchez did not receive monthly and quarterly incentive compensation for april through may,and january through may,respectively.
prevost was a full spectrum lending,account executive between august and may.classified as an exempt employee,he was to be paid annually plus monthly and quarterly incentive bonuses.throughout his term of employment,prevost was not paid as required by labor code section.and upon the termination of his employment,prevost was not paid his monthly and quarterly incentive compensation between april,through may,and january through may,respectively.
the arbitration claims were brought in the individual capacities of bundy,sanchez and prevost and as members of a class of plaintiffs former and present employees.the class members were not paid monthly and quarterly incentive compensation during the four years prior to the filing of the arbitration demand.all account executives were provided a copy of plaintiffs incentive plan.under the terms of the incentive plan,account executives were required to forfeit any monthly and quarterly bonuses earned in the last partial months and quarters respectively of their employment.the arbitration demand alleges account executives have no power to negotiate different provisions.
the alleged class is,all persons other than officers,directors or controlling persons of plaintiffs who were employed by plaintiffs,were paid according to the plan and therefore were not properly paid within the time frame set forth in california labor code.the arbitration demand refers to this class as the claimant class.additionally,the arbitration demand seeks to represent the following subclass,persons,other than officers,directors,or controlling persons of plaintiffs who were employed by plaintiffs,were paid according to the plan,and left the employment of plaintiffs,but were not paid incentive compensation earned on loans that funded during their employment.
the godina arbitration demand alleges many of the same matters in terms of plaintiffs operations.godina was an account executive at the full spectrum lending.call center in rosemead,california between december,and december.godina was to be paid per year plus incentive compensation.the amount of incentive compensation payable to employees was calculated on funded loans under specified circumstances.the incentive compensation was to be paid on a monthly and quarterly basis.prior to january,godina was improperly classified as an exempt employee.since january,godina was classified as a employee under federal and state wage and hour laws.
according to his arbitration demand,plaintiffs failed to compensate godina as required by labor code section.and upon his discharge,godina was not paid his monthly incentive compensation for loans funded from november through december.moreover,godina did not receive quarterly incentive compensation for loans that funded july through december.when godina left plaintiffs employ,he was owed in excess of in incentive compensation.
godina also brought his arbitration demand on behalf of similarly situated call center employees who had not been paid their monthly or quarterly incentive compensation in compliance with labor code section.moreover,godina filed the arbitration demand on behalf of former employees who were not paid their monthly and quarterly incentive compensation in the last full and partial months and quarters respectively,of employment while employed by plaintiffs.as in the case of the arbitration demand,the forfeiture clause in godina employment agreement required he and other class members retain employment with plaintiffs in order to receive all incentive compensation due to employees.apart from the different employee groups,the two potential classes in the godina arbitration demand are the same as those alleged in the arbitration demand.the claims and relief sought in the godina arbitration demand are the same being pursued in the arbitration.
in their arbitration demands,defendants seek class certification on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated regarding fellow employees incentive compensation clauses contained in their employment agreements.the continuing tenure provision required an employee to work throughout what was designated as the plan month and the entire following month in order to receive the monthly incentive payment.under the terms of the plan,an employee,who leaves defendants employment either voluntarily or involuntarily before the last day of the month following the plan month,will not receive any portion of the monthly incentive payment.defendants allege plaintiffs failed to pay earned commission wages to those employees and this constituted an unfair business practice in violation of business and professions code section the continuing tenure requirement was an unconscionable forfeiture of wages,untimely withholding of wages,and,therefore,was unenforceable under california law.defendants arbitration demands seek the right to proceed as classwide arbitrations recovery of compensatory damages recovery of penalties for violations of labor code section payment of restitution pursuant to business and professions code section recovery for unjust enrichment disgorgement declaratory and injunctive relief a declaration the forfeiture provision violates labor code sections through and is unenforceable pursuant to labor code section an interest award and attorney fees.
proceedings before the arbitrator 
before the arbitrator,the parties stipulated,t here was no clause construction issue to be litigated in may,plaintiffs sought summary judgment against the defendants based on two separate settlements which had been reached in two class action lawsuits.the first action which plaintiffs asserted barred the claims brought here was a settlement in zamora countrywide financial,los angeles superior court,case no.the zamora class action.the zamora class action was filed on april.the zamora class action only involved former account executives who were terminated and claims for forfeiture of the last months of commissions waiting time penalties attorneys fees and costs.the second class action,which plaintiffs asserted barred the claims brought here,was a lawsuit resolved in the united states district for the northern district of texas,walker countrywide credit,industries,case the walker federal class action.the walker federal class action was filed in and settled in.the walker federal class action involved overtime claims.by contrast,this case involves plan and forfeiture issues.there were no plan or forfeiture claims in the walker federal class action.
in an interim award on november,the arbitrator rejected plaintiffs contention that collateral estoppel principles barred godina from proceeding with the present class action.additionally,in the november,interim award,the arbitrator ruled the issues in the walker federal class action case were not identical to those in the and godina arbitration demands.the november,interim arbitration award states the walker settlement documents do not include a specific reference to claims for unpaid bonuses,nor does the motion for final approval and final judgment,and of greatest importance,nor do the notices served on the walker class members.the settlement discussions did not involve any claims for or settlement of claims for unpaid bonuses.the claims and the claimants in the godina and bundy,et class actions differ substantially from those in the walker case,both in numbers and in the description of their claims.the mere recital,as in the release signed on behalf of the walker claimants,that the protection of the civil code section is waived,or that the release covers unknown claims,is not controlling,especially given the ample evidence to the contrary.
on november,the arbitrator issued an order in response to plaintiffs request for clarification of the november,interim award.the november,clarification order states n o further formal clarification of the interim order is required.nevertheless,it is emphasized that the interim award found that all members of class claimants of the zamora action who received lawful notice,or participated in the fairness proceedings,or received a settlement payment in that case are barred from pursuing those same claims in the godina and bundy,sanchez and prevost cases,except for claims based on california labor code section.that being the case,it is observed that any claimants in the godina and bundy,et,cases who are pursuing the same claims as lawfully settled in the zamora case that were members of the zamora class will have the burden of proving they were not given lawful notice in the zamora case and did not participate in the fairness proceedings or receive a settlement payment in that case.it is also emphasized that the settlement and release in the walker case is not a bar by res judicata or collateral estoppel to the claimants in the godina and bundy,et,cases pursuing the claims against plaintiffs as stated in their complaints or claims filed with the american arbitration association.
on march,the arbitrator issued an interim award which granted plaintiffs december request for summary adjudication that private litigants may not recover the penalties provided for by labor code section.the arbitrator denied plaintiffs request to summarily adjudicate that defendants could not pursue claims predicated on labor code violations when proceeding under business and professions code section.but,the arbitrator dismissed all penalty claims.
on october,the arbitrator issued a partial final award re class certification which granted defendants class certification motions in their entirety in both cases.the october,interim award addressed the issues relating to both arbitration demands.the arbitrator noted the parties had stipulated in april that the issues raised by the two arbitration demands were arbitrable.the arbitrator explained defendants request the certification of a class consisting of all persons,including current and former employees other than officers,directors or controlling persons of plaintiffs,who were employed by the plaintiffs and who were paid according to the plaintiffs incentive plan and subject to that plan forfeiture provision and who were not properly paid within the time mandated by california labor code section.defendants also move for the certification of a of all persons,including current and former employees,other than officers,directors,or controlling persons of plaintiffs,who were employed by plaintiffs and who were entitled to be paid according to the plan,and who left the employment of the plaintiffs,but were not paid the incentive compensation claimed by them to have been earned pursuant to the plan on loans funded during their employment.the combined class and include all persons employed in or who were to receive,as part of the plan bonus provisions,payments in addition to their regular salary based on loans sold to customers,whether there were account executives,team managers or branch managers or any of the numerous variations of those titles that plaintiffs attached to those who were the beneficiaries of the plan and subject to its forfeiture provisions between august,and the present,whether currently employed or who left plaintiffs employ and were not paid the incentive earned pursuant to the plan.
as previously noted,on november,while ruling on the summary judgment motions,the arbitrator returned an interim award which restricted the classes in the two arbitrations because of the release in the zamora class action.in the october,partial final award,the arbitrator referenced the prior november,ruling stating,although there may be some exceptions based on specific evidence of full and timely payment or participation in a prior legal action involving the same claims against the plaintiffs subject to the arbitrator rulings on plaintiffs motions for summary judgment herein,finding that the settlement agreements in the zamora and walker cases did not bar the claims herein made,there is sufficient evidence to conclude that there are issues pertaining to the putative classes that are common to all of their members.
the arbitrator found defendants were plaintiffs employees who were paid a salary and bonus pursuant to the incentive plan.the claims in this case were solely for or untimely payment brought pursuant to labor code sections and.the bonuses were owed pursuant to the plan and forfeiture provisions for three types of work by class members for loans directly negotiated by the employee where the employee supervised or assisted in the successful sale of the loan or where the payment of the bonus was premised on the employee own sales or those of others such as branch managers and team leaders.
the arbitrator found that the employment contracts were presented on a take it or leave it basis and there was no evidence any agreements were changed in any way.the arbitrator recited the forfeiture provision,which appeared in all of the employment agreements in one way or another unless otherwise provided for herein or in the incentive plan as a condition precedent to eligibility for any portion of an incentive,an eligible employee must be employed in active status from the initial eligibility date for the particular incentive through the last day of the month following the month for which the incentive is calculated,except in the case of the annual incentive which requires the eligibly employee to be in active status until the earlier of i the date on which the annual incentive is paid or ii the day following the end of the annual incentive period or such other period.the incentive payment shall be referred to herein as the commission or the bonus.
the arbitrator found,as required by the american arbitration association supplementary rules for class arbitrations,rule,that the number of class members,both current and former employees of plaintiff,exceeds there were common issues of law and fact defendants claims were typical of those of other class members defendants were prepared to protect the members of the two classes and the parties were all subject to the same or similar arbitration provisions.the arbitrator rejected plaintiffs argument that not all class members were subject to the same arbitration provision on the ground there was no substantial evidence that the members of the putative classes had different arbitration provisions.rather,the arbitrator found,t here is ample evidence that the members of the putative classes were all subject to the same or similar arbitration provision,just as they were subject to the same of similar incentive plan,terms,and forfeiture provision.the arbitrator certified the class as to all of defendants remaining claims.as noted,the arbitrator had earlier dismissed defendants requests for labor code section penalties.defendants were designated as representatives for their respective classes.the arbitrator retained the option of decertification if the issues proved unmanageable.as required by the american arbitration association supplementary rules for class arbitrations,rule,the award was stayed for days to allow any party to challenge it.we will later detail the evidence before the arbitrator as it relates to the specific claims on appeal.
c.the petitions to vacate the interim arbitration awards 
on november,plaintiffs filed their petition to vacate or modify the interim arbitration awards.the grounds for the petition were not all the potential class members signed the same arbitration agreement many class members had already released their claims the arbitrator improperly found that godina was an adequate class representative and labor code section does not provide a private right of action.on december,plaintiffs filed an amended petition to vacate or modify the interim arbitration awards on the grounds the arbitrator erroneously included parties in the class who had either not consented to arbitration at all or before the american arbitration association included individuals who released their claims in the walker federal and zamora class actions concluded godina would be an adequate class representative because it had been determined that he had conclusively released all his claims in the zamora class action which raised the identical issues in this case and determined class members have a private right of action to directly seek damages for alleged violations of labor code section.
related case controversy 
as noted,the original petition to vacate the arbitration awards was filed on november.two days after the initial petition was filed,on november,plaintiffs filed a related case notice.plaintiffs asserted the present litigation,which seeks to vacate or modify the interim awards,was related to the zamora class action.defendants opposed designation of the present case as related to the zamora class action,stating the present case involves a petition to vacate an arbitrator interim award and is assigned to the honorable elizabeth white.the case indentified in the subject notice ronald zamora countrywide financial corp,which was previously pending before the honorable james dunn,is a closed case that has been closed since february.nothing is pending before judge dunn,and the present action will not require duplication of judicial resources if heard by judge white.defendants took the position the case should be transferred to the honorable victoria chaney.on december,judge dunn found the two cases were not related.
order granting the amended petition to vacate or modify the arbitration awards 
in a written order filed march,judge white granted the amended petition to vacate the partial arbitration awards.judge white order found that the arbitrator had committed all the legal errors asserted by plaintiffs in the amended petition to vacate.this timely appeal followed.
iii.discussion 
standard of judicial choice of law decision 
defendants argue judge white was required to utilize the vacatur provisions of the federal arbitration act in passing on the amended petition to vacate the partial awards.we agree.when determining whether to vacate an arbitrator award,california state courts do not apply the federal arbitration act vacatur provisions.cable connection,directv,cal th,siegel prudential ins.of america th.as will be noted though,the parties have unambiguously agreed to enforcement of the awards under the federal arbitration act and we enforce their choice of law determination.
the introduction to the relevant arbitration agreement states in part,t he company and the employee have entered into this mutual agreement to arbitrate claims in order to establish and gain the benefits of a speedy,impartial and dispute resolution process.paragraph in the arbitration agreement signed by sanchez and bundy states t he company and the employee hereby consent to the resolution by arbitration of all claims or controversies arising out of,relating to or associated with the employee employment with the company the purpose and effect of this agreement is to substitute arbitration,instead of a federal or state court,as the exclusive forum for the resolution of the covered claims.the parties responsibilities and legal remedies available under any substantive law applicable to a covered claim shall be enforced in any arbitration conducted pursuant to this agreement.other versions of the arbitration agreement contain similar language with no material differences.paragraph of all of the arbitration agreements,including the version executed by sanchez and bundy states governing law.the parties agree that the company is engaged in transactions involving interstate commerce.except as provided in this agreement,the federal arbitration act shall govern the interpretation,enforcement and all proceedings pursuant to this agreement.all arbitrations covered by this agreement shall be adjudicated in accordance with the state or federal law which would be applied by a united states district court sitting at the place of the hearing,including applicable statute of limitations.paragraph of the arbitration agreement signed by bundy and sanchez states,the arbitrator decision shall be final and binding upon the parties except that both parties shall have the right to appeal to an appropriate court with jurisdiction errors of law in the decision rendered by the arbitrator.plaintiffs rely on this language in paragraph and argue we may review the arbitrator partial awards for errors of law.italics added.
under the california arbitration act,the parties can contractually agree to expand the scope of judicial review of the merits of an award.cable connection,directtv,supra,cal th at,moncharsh heily blase cal th.in cable connection,directtv,supra,cal th at page,our supreme court held that the parties may alter the normal rules which proscribe judicial review for arbitrator error we adhere to our holding in moncharsh,recognizing that contractual limitations may alter the usual scope of review.the california rule is that the parties may obtain judicial review of the merits by express agreement.there is a statutory as well as a contractual basis for this rule one of the grounds for review of an arbitration award is that t he arbitrators exceeded their powers,subd.a,subd.b.here,the parties agreed that t he arbitrators shall not have the power to commit errors of law or legal reasoning,and the award may be vacated or corrected on appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error.this contract provision is enforceable under state law,and we reverse the contrary ruling of the court of appeal.in our case,the parties explicitly agreed to have an arbitration award adjudicated in accordance with the state or federal law which would be applied by a united states district court which does not include the right to review of the merits of the award in the manner asserted by plaintiffs.as they are entitled,the parties expressly and unambiguously agreed to adjudication of the award in a fashion different from that which would occur in superior court.cable connection,directtv,supra,cal th at page see gueyffier ann summers,cal th,christensen smith th.here,the parties unambiguously agreed that any award would be reviewed as it would be by a federal district judge applying the federal arbitration act.accordingly,we review the partial awards in this case utilizing the vacatur provisions of federal arbitration act which would be applied by a united states district court judge.
one last point on the choice of law issue warrants comment.we are reviewing arbitration agreements executed prior to the holding in hall street associates mattel,that no enhanced merits based judicial review may be conducted in a united states district court under the federal arbitration act pursuant to the litigants stipulation.in executing the arbitration agreements,the parties assumed merits based review was an option in cases subject to review in federal court.when the parties executed the arbitration agreements before us,there was authority,now abrogated by the hall street associates,decision,which allowed for expanded merits based federal court review of an award pursuant the litigants agreement.roadway package system,kayser cir,fn.gateway,mci telecomm.cir.there was also authority for the proposition no enhanced merits based judicial review was available in a case subject to the federal arbitration act.kyocera trade services,cir,worth tyler cir,k t,zurich ins.cir.it was not until hall street associates,that the issue of whether litigants could expand the limited scope of the federal court vacatur power was resolved once and for all.when the arbitration agreements were executed,the presence of the legally uncertain language allowing for enhanced merits based review of an award did not then create any question as to whether there was a clear unambiguous choice of law decision to require application of the federal arbitration act vacatur provisions.
what we do not address is whether an unambiguous choice of law decision could be made by the contracting parties if an arbitration agreement,like the ones before us,is signed after the hall street associates,decision was filed,march.under those circumstances,the issue would be more difficult as then the contracting parties would have elected a vacatur provision now expressly unavailable under the federal arbitration act.and as noted,vacatur review for errors of law or substantial evidence is available under the california arbitration act with the parties express and unambiguous consent.pearson dental supplies,superior court cal th,fn.cable connection,directtv,supra,cal th at pp,fn.the issue becomes more complex when the arbitration agreement requires review under the federal arbitration act,as here permits review for errors of law,as here and it was entered into after march,something that did not occur here.under those circumstances,a party seeking review under the federal arbitration act would have a more difficult time contending the parties expressly and unambiguously agreed not to require use of vacatur review under the california arbitration act.as noted,under the california arbitration act,the parties may agree to expanded merits based review.id.at gueyffier ann summers,supra,cal th at.this factual scenario is not before us and we express no view on it.
standards of judicial review under the federal arbitration act 
when the arbitrator exceeds his or her powers 
in federal court,there is one certain relevant statutory provision and a possible second way in which the merits of an arbitration award can be attacked.the relevant certain method for challenging the merits of an arbitration award,albeit extremely limited,is in title united states code section a which provides in part in any of the following cases the united states court in and for the district wherein the award was made may make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration where the arbitrators exceeded their powers the united states supreme court has described this narrow scope of judicial review it is not enough for petitioners to show that the panel committed an even a serious error.citations.it is only when an arbitrator strays from interpretation and application of the agreement and effectively dispense s his own brand of industrial justice that his decision may be unenforceable.citations.animalfeeds int l,see united paperworkers int l union misco,united steelworkers of america enterprise wheel car.even gross,painfully clear or obvious errors are insufficient to permit vacatur under title united states code section a which is the relevant statutory vacatur provision.halim great gatsby auction gallery,cir,bull hn information systems,hutson,dirussa dean witter reynolds cir.
when the arbitrator award is returned in manifest disregard of the law 
it is less clear in federal court that an arbitration award can be attacked because the arbitrator has acted in manifest disregard of the law.at one point,there was supreme court authority for the proposition that in federal court an award may be vacated if it is made in manifest disregard of the law.first options of chicago,kaplan,parties bound by arbitrator decision not in manifest disregard of the law express mcmahon,judicial review is still substantially limited to the four grounds listed in of the arbitration act and to the concept of manifest disregard of the law mitsubishi motors soler,dis.opn.of stevens,arbitration awards are only reviewable for manifest disregard of the law,wilko swan,overruled on other grounds in rodriguez de quijas express,the interpretations of the law by the arbitrators in contrast to manifest disregard are not subject,in the federal courts,to judicial review for error in interpretation.
however,in hall street associates mattel,supra,at pages,the united states supreme court considered whether an arbitration provision may be vacated when the litigants agree in writing the district court may vacate an award when it is not supported by substantial evidence or when the arbitrator legal conclusions are erroneous.in evaluating that issue,the supreme court adverted to the argument of hall street associates that since wilko swan,supra,at pages expandable judicial review authority has been accepted as the controlling law.but in hall street associates,the supreme court held that issue of the scope of judicial review of arbitration award was not before it in wilko.rather,the issue in wilko was whether section of the securities act of voided an agreement to arbitrate.wilko swan,supra,at.and in hall street associates l.mattel,supra,at page,the supreme court noted the wilko holding concerning the effect of section of the securities act of was later overruled in rodriguez de quijas express,supra,at page.the supreme court explained although it is true that the court discussion includes some language arguably favoring hall street position,arguable is as far as it goes.the wilko court was explaining that arbitration would undercut the securities act buyer protections when it remarked citing faa that p ower to vacate an arbitration award is limited,at,and went on to say that the interpretations of the law by the arbitrators in contrast to manifest disregard of the law are not subject,in the federal courts,to judicial review for error in interpretation,at.hall street reads this statement as recognizing manifest disregard of the law as a further ground for vacatur on top of those listed in,and some circuits have read it the same way.citations.hall street sees this supposed addition to as the camel nose if judges can add grounds to vacate or modify,so can contracting parties.hall street associates mattel,supra,at.
the supreme court then proceeded to explain that wilko could not be read as asserted by hall street associates but this is too much for wilko to bear.quite apart from its leap from a supposed judicial expansion by interpretation to a private expansion by contract,hall street overlooks the fact that the statement it relies on expressly rejects just what hall street asks for here,general review for an arbitrator legal errors.then there is the vagueness of wilko phrasing.maybe the term manifest disregard was meant to name a new ground for review,but maybe it merely referred to the grounds collectively,rather than adding to them.see,mitsubishi motors soler,arbitration awards are only reviewable for manifest disregard of the law,stavborg national metal converters,circ.or,as some courts have thought,manifest disregard may have been shorthand for a or a,the paragraphs authorizing vacatur when the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct or exceeded their powers.see,kyocera,supra,at.we,when speaking as a court,have merely taken the wilko language as we found it,without embellishment,see first options of chicago,kaplan,supra,at and now that its meaning is implicated,we see no reason to accord it the significance that hall street urges.hall street associates,l.mattel,supra,at.
thus,in hall street associates,the supreme court cast doubt on whether the manifest disregard of the law rule remains viable.but later in the opinion,the supreme court explained in holding that and provide exclusive regimes for the review provided by the statute,we do not purport to say that they exclude more searching review based on authority outside the statute as well.the faa is not the only way into court for parties wanting review of arbitration awards they may contemplate enforcement under state statutory or common law,for example,where judicial review of different scope is arguable.but here we speak only to the scope of the expeditious judicial review under,and,deciding nothing about other possible avenues for judicial enforcement of arbitration awards.hall street associates,mattel,supra,at.
the last time the united states supreme court addressed the manifest disregard of the law issue was in animalfeeds int l,supra,at page.at page.in,the district court judge vacated the award because it was made in manifest disregard of the law.the court of appeals concluded otherwise.id.at.at.the supreme court declined to address the effect of hall street associates,on the award.animalfeeds int l,supra,at.at we do not decide whether manifest disregard survives our decision in hall street associates,as an independent ground for review or as a judicial gloss on the enumerated grounds for vacatur set forth at.
after the supreme court issued its opinion in hall street associates,some federal courts of appeal have declined to decide whether the manifest disregard of the law standard remains legally viable.kashner davidson securities mscisz cir.some courts have held the manifest disregard of the law standard is no longer an independent legal standard for review of arbitration awards.frazier citifinancial,llc cir,citigroup global markets bacon cir,see nicholas kbr,cir,fn.other courts of appeal have held that the manifest disregard of the law standard remains viable,not as an independent ground for vacatur,but as a judicial gloss or shorthand for setting aside an award under the federal arbitration title united states code section a.comedy club,improv west cir,sa animalfeeds intern.cir,overruled on another ground in animalfeeds int l,supra,at.at.the sixth circuit stated the manifest disregard of the law doctrine survives the analysis in hall street associates l.see citigroup global markets,bacon,supra,at.
obviously,the extent to which the manifest disregard of the law standard survives hall street associates is uncertain.we need not address the issue of whether the manifest disregard of the law standard of review survives hall street associates in whole,as a judicial gloss on the statutorily enumerated grounds,or not at all.rather,we will evaluate the interim awards under both title united states code section a and the manifest disregard of the law test the course chosen by the supreme court in animalfeeds int l,supra,at page.at page.
the most prevalent manifest disregard of the law test contains two elements.the first element is the arbitrator must know the governing rule of law and refuse to apply it or ignore it.the second element is that the law ignored by the arbitrator is,explicit,and clearly applicable to the case.porzig dresdner,kleinwort,benson,north america llc cir,kashner davidson securities mscisz cir,collins horton,cir,kergosien ocean energy,cir,overruled on another point in citigroup global markets bacon,supra,at electronic data systems donelson cir.one court articulates the rule as arising when the arbitrator knew the applicable law but expressly willfully disregarded or ignored it.asociación de empleados del estado libre asociado de puerto rico unión internacional de trabajadores de la industria de automoviles cir.the seventh circuit limits the manifest disregard of the law situation to an order requiring the parties to violate the law one that does not adhere to the legal principles specified by the contract.halim great gatsby auction gallery,supra,at george watts son,tiffany cir.the eighth,ninth,tenth and eleventh circuits define manifest disregard of the law as when the arbitrator identifies the applicable,governing law and then ignores it.frazier citifinancial,llc,supra,at bosack soward cir,dma intern.qwest communications,cir,mcgrann first albany cir,st john mercy medical center delfino cir.
the second circuit has characterized the manifest disregard of the law as involving extreme situations.telenor mobile communications as storm llc cir,examples of manifest disregard therefore tend to be extreme,such as explicitly reject ing controlling precedent or otherwise reaching a decision that strains credulity or lacks even a barely colorable justification.mere factual or legal errors are insufficient to permit vacatur using the manifest disregard of the law standard rather,there must be more than error or misunderstanding with respect to factual matters or the law.dma intern.qwest communications,supra,at telnor mobile communications as storm llc,supra,at asociación de empleados del estado libre asociado de puerto rico unión internacional de trabajadores de la industria de automoviles,supra,at mccarthy citigroup global markets cir,overruled on a different point in hall street associates llc mattel,supra,at.
none of the reasons advanced by plaintiffs for vacating the partial awards could be applied by a united states district court 
the arbitrator decision to allow the classes to seek restitution and equitable relief pursuant to business and professions code section 
the arbitration demands seek restitution and equitable relief pursuant to business and professions code section.both arbitration demands allege at all times pertinent to this claim and demand for class arbitration,plaintiffs failed to comply with the california labor code et and business and professions code et in that claimants,as well as all those current and former employees similarly situated to claimants throughout california,originated and closed loans but were not properly paid the incentive compensation earned on those loans on a basis as provided by labor code,or upon the termination of their employment with plaintiffs as provided by labor code and.in addition,defendants sought the imposition of penalties pursuant to labor code section also,the requested business and professions code section relief,which included injunctive relief and disgorgement requests,was premised on violations of labor code sections though.further,defendants sought restitution premised upon labor code sections through and business and professions code section.the arbitrator granted plaintiffs summary adjudication motion in part and dismissed defendants labor code section penalty claims.but the arbitrator ruled defendants could pursue their business and professions code section unfair competition claims including seeking injunctive relief pursuant to business and professions code section the arbitrator ruled defendants could base their business and professions code section unfair competition claims on violations of labor code section.judge white vacated the arbitrator ruling stating the court finds that the arbitrator exceeded his powers in granting class certification by issuing a ruling and certifying a class for a california labor code section claim,notwithstanding the fact that section does not provide for a private right of action.
defendants argue the arbitrator determination as to their business and professions code section claims could not be set aside by a federal district court.we agree.business and professions code section states,as used in this chapter,unfair competition shall mean and include any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising and any act prohibited by chapter commencing with section of part of division of the business and professions code.in bank of the west superior court cal th,our supreme court explained the unfair business practices act defines unfair competition as any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising.the legislature intended this sweeping language to include anything that can be properly called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.citation.in drafting the act,the legislature deliberately traded the attributes of tort law for speed and administrative simplicity.see also stop youth addiction,lucky stores,cal th,hernandez atlantic finance d.business and professions code section borrows violations of federal,state or local law and treats them as unlawful practices which are independently actionable.state farm fire casualty superior court th,see gregory albertson,th,community assisting recovery,aegis security ins.th.given the statutory basis of defendants claims,any unfairness theory they assert must be tethered to some declared legislative policy.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,durrell sharp healthcare th.and the reach of business and professions code section extends to wage and salary based labor code violations.cortez purolator air filtration products cal th,wrongful withholding of wages in violation of,hudgins neiman marcus group,th,wrongful retention of commissions in violation of,people los angeles palm,d,unpaid minimum wages in violation of.

thus,business and professions code section provides an independent basis for potential liability apart from labor code section.and the arbitrator expressly dismissed all of defendants penalty claims.there is no independent labor code section claim pending in this case.rather,defendants are asserting claims for restitution which are expressly provided for by the unfair competition law.bus,cortez purolator air filtration products,supra,cal th at.finally,the sole issue raised by plaintiffs is that the labor code section claims can not be pursued.there are a myriad of defenses which remain to be litigated.thus,a federal district court judge could not lawfully set aside the arbitrator ruling on defendants business and professions code section unfair competition claims.a animalfeeds int l,supra,at.at halim great gatsby auction gallery,supra,at porzig dresdner,kleinwort,benson,north america llc,supra,at.
the arbitrator decision concerning those claims resolved in the walker federal and zamora class actions.
on november,the arbitrator returned an interim award concerning the classes.the arbitrator ruled godina was not given lawful notice of the zamora class action and was not a party thereto godina did not have standing to appeal judge dunn ruling denying the motion to vacate the judgment and therefore neither res judicata nor collateral estoppel principles apply to godina claims.and the arbitrator ruled the factual and legal issues alleged in godina arbitration demand were not identical to those in the zamora class action.
the arbitrator similarly found that the resolution of the zamora class action did not entirely bar the claims posited in the arbitration demand.the arbitrator stated bundy,sanchez and prevost were specifically excluded from the zamora settlement as individuals.they had filed their demand for arbitration on august.their claim defines the class as all employees whose principal function is the sale of loan products and who are subject to the forfeiture provision.that definition is more expansive than the account executive class definition found in the zamora claim.the bundy,et.demand for arbitration also included claims under california labor code section for all persons other than officers,directors,and controlling persons employed by countrywide who were not properly paid pursuant to section and all those who left the employment of countrywide and were not paid pursuant to the incentive compensation plan.the claimants are described as those designated as account executives or by any other title.the zamora claim included branch and c all c enter executives,but limited the class to those countrywide employees who had terminated their employment at a branch between april,and june,or at a c all c enter between january,and june.the bundy,et class includes employees who terminated their employment during time periods other than those in the zamora case.the godina class claims are equally more expansive than those found in zamora.the testimony of countrywide most knowledgeable,establishes that there are several incentive plans,not merely one,and that all positions are eligible to earn an incentive,thereby expanding the potential size of the classes in both the godina and bundy,et class actions.there is a contested issue of fact as to whether the class descriptions in both the godina and bundy,et cases are the same as those stated in the zamora case.based on the claims,exhibits and declarations in both cases,as submitted in this motion,it is found that the godina and bundy,et claims and claimants are substantially more extensive than those in the zamora case.although further evidence on this subject may be introduced at the certification hearing,the zamora class appears to have grossly those employees with the same potential claims.it is clear that,as to the claims made in the zamora case,those class members who were actually given notice are barred from making those same claims again in either the godina or bundy,et cases.the motions for summary judgment are denied,except as to the zamora class members who received lawful notice or otherwise participated in the fairness proceedings and settlement,and who seek to assert those same claims in the present actions.
as to the walker federal class action,the arbitrator found the settlement documents,final approval motion,settlement negotiations and judgment did not specifically refer to unpaid bonuses the waiver of unpaid claims pursuant to civil code section was not controlling and the claims in the present arbitration demands were broader than in the walker federal class action.judge white ruled the court finds that the arbitrator exceeded his powers in granting class certification by improperly including in the class those individuals who already fully and finally released their claims against countrywide in two class action zamora countrywide financial and walker countrywide and permitting godina to make a collateral attack on the zamora judgment,even though he had no proper jurisdiction over godina or his claims,based on the fact that judge dunn specifically ruled that godina was provided the requisite proper notice of the zamora settlement and was a member of the zamora class who had fully and finally released his claims against countrywide 
defendants argue a federal district court would be barred under title united states code section a and the manifest disregard of the law rule from vacating the arbitrator award as it relates to the limited preclusive effects of the walker federal and zamora class actions.we agree.as to the arbitration,they were expressly excluded from the zamora class action settlement.the zamora class action judgment was entered on february.further,the zamora class action only extended to all full spectrum lending account executives while the arbitrator reasonably could conclude the class as certified in this case is materially broader.in the october,partial award,the arbitrator described the class as certified,the combined class and include all persons employed in or who were to receive,as part of the incentive plan bonus provisions,payments in addition to their regular salary based on loans sold to customers,whether they were account executives,team managers or branch managers or any of the numerous variations of those titles that respondents attached to those who were beneficiaries of the plan and subject to its forfeiture provisions between august,and the present,whether currently employed or who left respondents employ and were not paid the incentive pursuant to the plan.the arbitrator found the definition of the class in the arbitration was broader than that in the zamora class action.in denying plaintiffs summary judgment motion,the arbitrator explicitly excluded from the and the godina arbitration classes all of plaintiffs employees who were actually given notice of the zamora class action settlement.as can be noted,the zamora class action extended to a narrower group of employees than those described in the present case.
as to the walker federal class action,the two classes are different than those in the and the godina arbitrations.the walker federal class action judgment was entered on august.the arbitration demand was dated august.the godina arbitration demand was likewise dated august.in other words,the walker federal class action and the and the godina arbitrations involve different time frames.further,the walker federal class action extended only to account executives who were employed during varying specific time frames depending on their place of employment.
the relevant rule of law concerning the application of res judicata is as follows but where the second action between the same parties is upon a different cause or demand,the principle of res judicata is applied much more narrowly.in this situation,the judgment in the prior action operates as an estoppel,not as to matters which might have been litigated and determined,but only as to those matters in issue or points controverted,upon the determination of which the finding or verdict was rendered.citations.since the cause of action involved in the second proceeding is not swallowed by the judgment in the prior suit,the parties are free to litigate points which were not at issue in the first proceeding,even though such points might have been tendered and decided at that time.but matters which were actually litigated and determined in the first proceeding can not later be relitigated.commissioner sunnen,see taylor sturgell,s,under the doctrine of claim preclusion,a final judgment forecloses successive litigation of the very same claim,whether or not relitigation of the claim raises the same issues as the earlier suit united states munsingwear,the general principle announced in numerous cases is that a right,question,or fact distinctly put in issue,and directly determined by a court of competent jurisdiction,as a ground of recovery,can not be disputed in a subsequent suit between the same parties or their privies and even if the second suit is for a different cause of action,the right,question or fact once so determined must,as between the same parties or their privies,be taken as conclusively established,so long as the judgment in the first suit remains unmodified.
here,the walker federal class action did not involve the very same claims posited in the and the godina arbitrations.also,the very same claims in defendants demands were not actually litigated in terms of the time period,the scope of the classes and the relief sought in the walker federal class action.nakash superior court d,res judicata was never intended to be used as a vehicle for forever immunizing any party in a continuing business relationship from liability for continuous or recurrent breaches of contract,conspiracy directed toward such breaches,or for continuous or recurrent tortious misconduct rest d judgments,com.d.
plaintiffs present separate arguments concerning the effect of the zamora class action on the godina arbitration.they reason that godina can not act as an adequate class representative because his claims are barred by the settlement of the zamora class action.the arbitrator found the zamora class action was filed on april,the godina class arbitration demand was filed on august,and the godina class arbitration demand was served on plaintiffs counsel office on august.the evidence adduced by plaintiffs before the arbitrator indicated godina was mailed a claim and opt out form in the zamora class action on november,at winnetka avenue,unit,winnetka,california.the arbitrator november,interim award states it is found as a matter of fact,undisputed by plaintiffs,that godina,while still employed by plaintiffs,purchased a residence at bircher street,granada hills,california in august,resided there for five months before his employment with plaintiffs ended and for months prior to the notice of settlement,and throughout the zamora litigation.furthermore,he financed the purchase of his home through countrywide,and in countrywide noted this residence as being his address on the treasury form mortgage interest statement issued to him.the arbitrator further found there were irregularities in the class notification and documentation process in the zamora class action.
also,the arbitrator found godina was never notified of the settlement of the zamora class action neither judge dunn nor counsel for the plaintiffs in the zamora class action were notified of the godina arbitration and neither judge dunn nor the attorneys for the zamora class action plaintiffs were notified of the godina arbitration demand.in addition,no notification was made by plaintiffs to the arbitrator on october.finally,the arbitrator found that on october,plaintiffs made a request for a continuance to respond to defendants arbitration demands and set a scheduling conference on january.this was done without notifying the arbitrator of the zamora class action settlement.january,the date selected for the arbitration scheduling conference,was three days after the last day to file an objection to the settlement in the zamora class action.
the arbitrator ruling is supported by godina declaration and other portions of the evidentiary record.godina declared he never received the notice of the zamora class action settlement.when the zamora class action settlement notice was mailed to the winnetka apartment address,godina lived in his granada hills residence on bircher street.as noted,plaintiffs evidence admitted the notice was sent to the winnetka apartment address.and godina declared plaintiffs were well aware of his residence address because he secured his mortgage from countrywide home loans.the arbitrator could reasonably find that notice of the settlement was not given to godina in a fashion reasonably calculated to apprise interested parties of the opportunity to object.this is particularly true given the fact there is evidence plaintiffs were aware of godina address and did not serve the settlement notice on his residence.moreover,plaintiffs,well aware of godina existing arbitration demand,failed to apprise judge dunn of its existence.no notice was given to godina counsel of the zamora class action settlement.and plaintiffs counsel failed to advise the arbitrator of the existence of the zamora class action settlement until after it was consummated.under these circumstances,godina would not be bound by the zamora class action settlement.phillips petroleum shutts,hypertouch,superior court th.we need not discuss the arbitrator finding that the class representative in the zamora class action did not adequately represent the interests of the class.if true,this provides a separate ground for refusing to accord res judicata effect to the settlement of the zamora class action.phillips petroleum shutts,supra,at hansberry lee.
finally,plaintiffs argue that godina is bound by judge dunn oral april,and may,rulings.in so ruling,judge dunn denied godina motion to set aside the judgment concluding the zamora class action.to begin with,the arbitrator could reasonably conclude that godina was never provided with proper notice and judge dunn ruling changes nothing in that respect.the judgment in the zamora class action was entered on february.all judge dunn did on april,was to deny godina motion to vacate the february,judgment.no legal authority allowed judge dunn on april,to vacate the february,judgment.in fact,judge dunn ruled godina had no standing and was not properly before the court.and judge dunn indicated the issue of the validity of the judgment,as it related to godina,was a matter that could be presented to the arbitrator.judge dunn ruling had no preclusive effect on the arbitrator.thus,a federal district court judge could not lawfully set aside the arbitrator res judicata findings.a animalfeeds int l,supra,at.at halim great gatsby auction gallery,supra,at porzig dresdner,kleinwort,benson,north america llc,supra,at.
the issue of plaintiffs employees who did not agree to arbitration before the american arbitration association 
plaintiffs presented evidence to the arbitrator that there were three arbitration agreements.as noted,the first arbitration agreement was allegedly initially used in the second half of but has a date on the bottom of both pages which indicates it was revised in as signed by bundy and sanchez,bears the may revision date was relied upon in the underlying arbitrations brought by bundy,sanchez,prevost and godina and provided for arbitration before the national arbitration forum,american arbitration association,or judicial arbitration and mediation service.a second arbitration agreement was dated december,and permits arbitration before the american arbitration association.a third undated arbitration agreement did not provide for arbitration before the american arbitration association but otherwise paralleled the other agreements.this third agreement provided for arbitration only before the national arbitration forum.unlike the first and second agreements,the second document does not have a revision date at the bottom of a page.judge white found the court finds that the arbitrator exceeded his powers in granting class certification by improperly certifying in the class those individuals who have not consented to the jurisdiction of the american arbitration association 
we agree with defendants that judge white stated ground was not a basis for setting aside the partial award.defendants presented evidence to the arbitrator that all employees were required to agree to arbitration.before the arbitrator,plaintiffs presented no evidence of a single class member who did not sign an agreement vesting potential arbitral jurisdiction in the american arbitration association.the arbitration agreements signed by bundy and sanchez which permit arbitration before the american arbitration association were revised effective march.as noted,plaintiffs also presented evidence of a december,agreement.the december,agreement provides specified claims could be arbitrated before the american arbitration association.plaintiffs also provided an unsigned arbitration agreement which is undated.the undated agreement provided for arbitration only before the national arbitration forum.yet,plaintiffs never presented evidence any class members were signatories to the undated agreement.plaintiffs failure to do so can give rise to the logical inference that no class member executed the undated agreement which stated the national arbitration forum was the exclusive potential alternative dispute resolution provider.interstate circuit united states,mammoth oil united states.given this state of the record,the arbitrator decision concerning the agreements to arbitrate before the american arbitration association could not lawfully be set aside by a federal district court judge.a animalfeeds int l,supra,at.at halim great gatsby auction gallery,supra,at porzig dresdner,kleinwort,benson,north america llc,supra,at.
finally,there is no merit to plaintiffs arguments that the present record supports the conclusion they did not agree to classwide arbitration.they never claimed in the trial court they had not consented to classwide arbitration.they never argued to the arbitrator they objected to classwide arbitration.and the present record indicates plaintiffs in fact agreed to classwide arbitration at the commencement of the proceedings.the present record thus indicates they consented to classwide arbitration and,in any event,the issue has been forfeited because it was not presented to the arbitrator and judge white.animalfeeds int l supra,at.at consent metals dempsey pipe supply cir,fn.f
