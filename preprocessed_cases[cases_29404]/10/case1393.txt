in this case,we must determine whether the district court acted properly in concluding that the group of plaintiffs alleging claims against appellee southern farm bureau life insurance company southern farm in proceedings in barred by the doctrine of res judicata from bringing their action,due to a consumer class action settlement in an earlier suit against southern farm.after the appellants brought their complaints in mississippi state court in october,southern farm filed a motion to enforce final judgment in the middle district of georgia.southern farm argued that the settlement,release,and judgment that had been entered by the district court in an earlier consumer class which the appellants were class the appellants pending claims.the district court agreed,and,accordingly,it enjoined the appellants from further prosecuting their claims in mississippi.this appeal followed.upon review,we conclude that the notice afforded the appellants in the class action settlement satisfied the constitutional requirements of due process and the claims that the appellants have brought against southern farm in mississippi plainly fall within the scope of the earlier class action settlement and release,and,therefore,they are barred by the doctrine of res judicata.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
a.the adams class action and settlement 
in january,walter adams brought an action,on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated,against southern farm in the middle district of georgia the adams class action.the adams complaint was generally based on the allegation that southern farm had engaged in fraudulent and deceptive conduct in connection with the marketing and sale of flexible premium and universal life insurance policies to its customers the complaint alleged that,beginning in,southern farm had engaged in a scheme to 
fraudulently induc e existing policyholders to replace their existing policies in order to purchase new policies,without adequately informing the policyholders that by doing so they would lose substantial cash values,pay new and significant commission charges,and,if they lived beyond a certain age,pay significantly greater premiums,be forced to accept less insurance or have their insurance lapse.
more specifically,the adams complaint alleged that southern farm had engaged in a number of deceptive and misleading sales tactics in selling flexible premium and universal life policies,including,among others misrepresenting the benefits of the new policies failing to provide an adequate explanation of concepts such as the policy cash value and the premium required by the policy and employing performance projections based on unreasonable explanations concerning interest rates and misrepresenting omitting adequate explanation of the consequences of less favorable performance.id.at,the complaint asserted counts for breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,negligence,breach of contract,and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.adams sought relief for himself and all other class members similarly situated.
southern farm denied the allegations of the adams class action.following discovery,the parties entered into a stipulation of settlement.for purposes of the settlement,the proposed class was defined as those persons and entities who currently own,or have owned,one or more flexible premium or universal life insurance policies issued between january,and march,by southern farm to replace other life insurance policies,exh.at.after the district court approved the proposed settlement and preliminarily certified the class for settlement purposes,a class notice was sent to each reasonably identifiable class member in may of.a total of class notices were sent out,via first class mail,to each class member last known address.in addition to the mailings,southern farm created a telephone number to field inquiries about the adams class action it published notice in usa today and it posted information about the adams class action and the settlement on the southern farm website.
the class all of the appellants pages in length,and was written in a q a type format.the notice indicated that it had been sent because the recipient was believed to be included the class of current and former flexible premium or universal life insurance policyowners who were eligible to participate in the proposed settlement,exh.at.the opening pages of the notice stated that the adams class action involv ed claims about how flexible premium and universal life insurance policies have been sold and how those policies have performed.id.more specifically,in a section entitled description of the lawsuit,the notice advised that the adams class action concerned allegations that southern farm had made misrepresentations or omissions of fact in connection with the sale of flexible premium and universal life insurance policies,including,among other allegations 
misleading policyowners to believe that only a single or fixed,limited number of premium payments would be required to keep a policy in force,and that the promised death benefits and increasing or stable cash values would continue to exist,without the policymaker making any further premium payments 
misleading policy owners to believe that interest rates illustrated at the time the policies were sold to class members were reasonable,and that such rates were not likely to change,or would not change in an amount sufficient to cause the policies to perform differently than was represented at the time of sale.
the notice stated that two forms of relief were available to class members who participated in the adams class action settlement general relief,and special adjudication relief.for the former,class members were eligible for a premium credit towards the purchase of any southern farm life insurance policy or annuity,to be used within months of the final settlement.as to the latter,class members who believed that southern farm had made direct misrepresentations to them concerning the operation and performance of their policy the number,amount,and frequency of premium payments would affect the cash value or the ability to keep the policy in force based on a fixed number or amount of premium payments were entitled to elect special adjudication relief.special adjudication relief consisted of an individualized review by southern farm claim review team,and,if eligible,special relief in the form of an enhancement of the cash value of the claimant existing policy.id.at.
the notice also stated that putative class members would be automatically included in the proposed settlement with southern farm,unless they took the affirmative step of opting out.the notice advised that a settlement hearing had been proposed for july,and stated that once the proposed settlement had been approved by the district court,each class member would receive a second notice offering them an opportunity to participate in the settlement.
pertinent to the present appeal,the class notice stated that all class members who failed to opt out or object to the settlement would be bound by the orders and judgments entered by the court,whether favorable or unfavorable to the class,and that class members would not be able to maintain,continue,or commence any other claim,lawsuit,or proceeding against southern farm relating to any flexible premium or universal life policy.id.at.section of the class notice,entitled dismissal and release of claims,stated in bold that once the adams class action was settled,the claims alleged against southern farm would be dismissed and n one of those claims could thereafter be asserted by class members who remain ed in the class in any other lawsuit or proceeding.id.at.section stated that class members who participated in the settlement would release southern farm from liability for known and unknown claims relating to the p olicies,and section detailed that,upon approval of the settlement,the district court would enter a permanent injunction,barring any class member from filing,prosecuting,or participating in any lawsuit based on or relating to the claims and causes of action or the facts and circumstances relating thereto.id.at.
finally,appended to the class notice was an five page document entitled release and waiver,which had been flagged in the q a section of the class notice the text of the class notice indicated,in bold y ou should read the release very carefully,because it will affect your rights if you remain in the class.id.at.the release stated,in pertinent part,that all class members who were not excluded from the class would be barred from now or hereafter institut ing,maintain ing,or assert ing against southern farm any causes of action that have been,could have been,may be,or could be,alleged or asserted now or in the future by plaintiff or any class member against southern farm in any other court action on the basis of,connected with,arising out of,or related to,in whole or in part,the released transactions id.at.this included any future causes of action based on 
any or all of the acts,omissions,facts,matters,transactions,or occurrences that have been,could have been,or were directly or indirectly alleged,asserted,described,set forth,or referred to in the adams class action 
any or all of the acts,omissions,facts,matters,transactions,or occurrences,sales presentations,illustrations,or any oral or written statements or representations allegedly made in connection with or indirectly or directly relating to the released transactions,including,without limitations,any acts,omissions,facts,matters,transactions,occurrences,or oral or written statements relating to

the last page of the release stated that the class members acknowledge that they may hereafter discover claims presently unknown or unsuspected,or facts in addition to or different from those which they now know or believe to be true with respect to the matters released herein.id.at.nevertheless,the release indicated that participating class members agreed to release southern farm from all claims which exist,hereafter may exist,or might have existed whether or not previously or currently asserted in any action.id.
in august,a fairness hearing was held in connection with the proposed adams class action settlement.the district court found that class certification was proper under,that the notice that had been provided to the class was adequate,comprehensive,and timely,at,and that the proposed settlement was fair,adequate,and reasonable.in light of those findings,the district court entered a final order and judgment,in which it adopted and incorporated by reference the terms of both the settlement and the release.the court also entered a permanent injunction barr ing and enjoin ing all class members who had not opted out of the settlement from filing,commencing,prosecuting,intervening in,or participating in as class members or otherwise any lawsuit in any jurisdiction based on or relating to the claims and causes of action,or the facts and circumstances relating thereto,in this action the released transactions at.the court retained jurisdiction as to all matters concerning the enforcement of the class action settlement as well as the court final order and judgment.
after the district court issued its final order,a second notice,entitled notice of approval of settlement and opportunity to elect relief was sent to all members of the class,advising them of the terms of the final settlement and the types of relief that were available to them.the second notice advised its recipient class members that,regardless of whether they elected to pursue to proposed relief,they would be bound by all of the terms of the settlement agreement,including being precluded from pursing any claims or matters covered by the settlement agreement in any pending or future lawsuits or other proceedings,exh.at.the second notice also made clear that,under the terms of the settlement,all class members who did not opt out of the adams class action were permanently enjoined from commencing any lawsuit in any jurisdiction based on or relating to the claims and causes of action or the facts and circumstances thereto in the class action lawsuit or in the released transactions.id.at.as with the first notice,it is not disputed that the appellants received this notice.none of the appellants,however,opted to pursue the relief provided in the adams class action settlement.
b.the appellants mississippi claims 
in october,over six years after entry of the district court final order and judgment in the adams class action,the appellants filed two separate actions against southern farm in mississippi state court the two complaints were nearly identical to each other.both alleged that southern farm had engaged in deceptive and fraudulent practices in recommending replacement life insurance products such as flexible premium and universal life insurance policies,without disclosing that the premiums for these policies could increase over time.specifically,the appellants complaints alleged that southern farm had marketed its replacement polices as having level limited premiums,without disclosing that the premium payments might increase if the interest rates assumed by southern farm models did not remain as high over time as projected.see jourdan,br.of appellants,exh.at.
the jourdan and craig complaints also alleged that southern farm had failed to explain key concepts such as cash value and how it would affect their policies,and that southern farm had failed to explain how the cash value of the appellants policies would go down if interest rates fell in the future thereby resulting in higher premium payments.the gravamen of the appellants complaints was the general allegation that southern farm had fraudulently and deceptively suggested to its customers that the premium payment would be level in amount limited in number,and that this suggestion had prompted the appellants to purchase replacement policies without being informed of the actual risks of those policies.see id.at.both complaints alleged a total of against southern farm,including,inter alia,fraudulent misrepresentation,breach of contract,negligence,fraud,and breach of fiduciary duty.
in december,southern farm filed a motion to enforce final judgment with the district court,seeking to permanently enjoin the appellants from prosecuting the jourdan and craig actions pending in mississippi.southern farm contended that the district court had authority under the all writs act,a to enjoin the appellants actions,and contended that the pending actions were plainly violative of the settlement,release,and judgment that had been entered by the district court in the adams class action.southern farm asserted that the appellants were members of the class that they had each been afforded notice of the adams class action and that none of them had taken steps to opt out of the adams class action.
moreover,southern farm contended that the claims being asserted in the jourdan and craig complaints were nearly identical to the claims that had been settled and released by state farm in the adams class action,based,as they were,on southern farm allegedly deceptive practices in connection with the sale of flexible premium and universal life insurance policies.southern farm argued that issues such as the amount and number of premiums that would be required with the policies the failure to disclose the relationship between interest rates,the cash value,and the premium payment and misrepresentations about how the policies would perform had all been litigated,settled,and released in the adams class action.noting the myriad similarities between the allegations of the adams class action and those of the jourdan and craig complaints,southern farm argued that the appellants actions were plainly barred by the terms of the settlement,release,and judgment that had been entered by the district court.
the district court agreed.after first finding the notice that had been provided to the appellants in the adams class action was adequate,thorough,and comported with both the requirements of due process and the requirements of rule,the court concluded that the claims the appellants had brought in mississippi arose out of the same universal life policies and r eplacement t ransactions that were the subject of the class action settlement approved by the court in.at.specifically,the court found that the jourdan and craig complaints had alleged a scheme to defraud insurance policyholders by convincing them to switch to replacement policies by misrepresenting the amount and number of premiums that would be required and by failing to disclose the effect that interest rates might have on the cash value of the policy.observing that all of these allegations mirrored those of the adams class action,the court concluded that they were barred by the settlement and release that had been entered into by southern farm and had been approved by the district court via the court final order and judgment.accordingly,the court issued an order permanently enjoining the appellants from further prosecuting their actions against southern farm in mississippi.this appeal followed.
ii.standard of review 
in reviewing the district court decision to grant an injunction,including an injunction under the all writs act,we apply an standard.klay united healthgroup,cir citation omitted.a district court abuses its discretion if it applies an incorrect legal standard,follows improper procedures in making the determination,or makes findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.martin automobili lamborghini exclusive,cir per curiam citation and quotation omitted.in making these assessments in the context of a decision to grant an injunction,we review the district court factual determinations for clear error,and its purely legal determinations de novo.klay,at citations omitted.
iii.discussion 
the appellants argument on appeal is essentially.first,they contend that the original class notice that was afforded to them in connection with the adams class action was constitutionally inadequate.second,they contend that the type of claims asserted in their actions in upon increasing premium distinguishable from the claims against southern farm that were settled and released in the adams class action.because,they contend,their increasing premium actions do not fall within the scope of the adams class action settlement and release,they assert that the doctrine of res judicata should not preclude them from prosecuting those actions in mississippi.we address each contention in turn.
whether the notice in the adams class action comported with due process 
although the ultimate question in this case is whether the adams class action settlement and release should have a res judicata effect on the appellants present actions,we have stated that res judicata can only be applied to an action if it is first shown that doing so would be consistent with due process.twigg sears roebuck,cir.the appellants argue on appeal that the adams class action notice was constitutionally inadequate,and that,consequently,permitting the adams class action to have a res judicata effect would not be consistent with due process.id.at.thus,at the outset,we address whether the notice that was provided to appellants in the adams class action comported with due process.
c lass actions,as other cases,are subject to the requirements of due process.id.at.the essence of due process is that deprivation of life,liberty,or property by adjudication be preceded by notice and opportunity for a hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.in re nissan motor.antitrust,cir citation and quotations omitted emphasis added.see also in re am.life.ins.sales practices,cir stating,in the context of a class action,that t he most important element of due process is adequate notice.our predecessor circuit has stated that t o satisfy this principle,it is not only necessary that the notice reach the parties affected but that it convey the required information.nissan,at citations omitted.the notice sent to class members must inform them whether claims like theirs were litigated in the earlier action.twigg,at.in addition,the class members substantive claims must be adequately described and the notice must also contain information reasonably necessary to make a decision to remain a class member and be bound by the final judgment.nissan,at.in reviewing the class notice to determine whether it satisfies these requirements,we look solely to the language of the notices and the manner of their distribution.twigg,at.
as to the substance of the class notice,the notice in the adams class all of the appellants a telephone number on both its first and second pages,along with the contact information for southern farm.page one of the notice indicated that the recipient was receiving this information because,according to southern farm records,you are a member of the class of current and former flexible premium or universal life insurance policyowners eligible to participated in the proposed settlement,exh.at.it directed recipients to p lease read all of the enclosed materials carefully to understand your rights under the proposed settlement and the decisions you need to make,id.at,and it encouraged them to call the toll free telephone number provided if they had questions.
the notice was written in a generally understandable,q a type format.it advised recipients that the adams class action involv ed claims about how flexible premium and universal life insurance policies have been sold and how those policies have performed.id.at.more specifically,the notice advised its recipients that the earlier adams class action been based on allegations that southern farm had made misrepresentations or omissions of fact in connection with the sale of flexible premium and universal life insurance policies.id.at.
in addition to setting forth the two types of specific relief available to class members,the notice stated that recipient class members would be automatically included in the proposed settlement with southern farm,unless they took the affirmative step of opting out.it also informed recipients that a fairness hearing had been scheduled for july to assess the fairness of the proposed settlement.the notice indicated that once the proposed settlement had been approved by the district court,each class member would receive a second notice offering him or her an opportunity to participate in the settlement.finally,the notice stated that all class members who failed to opt out of the settlement would be bound by all orders and judgments entered by the court,whether favorable or unfavorable to the class,and that class members would not be able to maintain,continue,or commence any other claim,lawsuit or proceeding against southern farm relating to any flexible premium or universal life policy if they decide d to remain in the class.id.at.appended to the notice was the aforementioned release and waiver,which was identified as being critical.id.at.recipients were urged to read the release very carefully.id.
as to the method of distribution employed,southern farm sent these notices to all identified class members last known address,via first class mail.each notice that was subsequently returned to sender was further investigated by southern farm in an attempt to obtain the correct address,and,where possible,a second notice was sent to the corrected address.in addition to these mailings,the company also created a toll free telephone number to field inquiries about the adams class action it published notice in usa today and it posted information about the adams class action its website.
the district court found that the notice provided to the appellants in this case was adequate and thorough,and that it comported with both the requirements of rule and of due process we agree.first,the notice was thorough,consisting as it did of of explanatory text.twigg,at finding a notice with a vague,one sentence description of the type of claim involved,to be violative of due process.second,the language of the notice was clear and comprehensible,and it adequately described both the substantive claims at issue in the adams class action and the information reasonably necessary to make a decision to remain a class member and be bound by the final judgment,such as the relief available,the steps necessary to opt out,and the implications of remaining a member of the class.see nissan,at.finally,we find,as the district court did,that the steps taken by southern farm in distributing the multiple first class mailings and publication in a national well as providing a telephone number,website,and mailing address to field queries from class members,constituted the best notice practicable under the circumstances.see.c.
the appellants argue that their case is analogous to twigg,in which we concluded that the notice afforded class members was insufficient because it did not adequately describe the type of claim involved in the earlier class action.twigg,at.in twigg,the notice had a pithy,one sentence the class action involved unnecessary improper repairs performed by the defendant,id.at,that is,repairs that were performed that were not needed.the appellant action in a later suit,however,was based on services for which he had paid,but which had not been performed.id.at.because we found that the notice in the earlier action had failed to advise the appellant whether claims like his were being litigated or had been settled in the earlier action,we concluded that permitting res judicata to bar the appellant present claims would be inconsistent with due process.id.at.
the appellants seek to analogize their case to twigg,because the notice in the adams class action failed to mention the type of claim that they contend is involved in their case,that is,a claim based on an undisclosed increasing premium.relying on twigg,the appellants assert that it would violate due process to apply the terms of the adams class action including its release to their action involving increased premiums.as they explain,n owhere in the adams class action notice does it address increasing premiums nor does it state that the class members premiums increase.br.of appellants at.
twigg is inapposite,however,because the notice contained in the adams class action described in great depth the type of claims that were being litigated and settled in that case,and,unlike in twigg,that description included the type of claims appellants are now seeking to bring.specifically,the adams notice stated that the adams class action involved misrepresentations or omissions of fact in connection with the sale of flexible premium life insurance policies,exh.at.this notice included allegations that southern farm had both misled policy owners about the number of premium payments that would be required to keep the policy in force and had indicated that its interest rate projections would not change in such a way to affect the performance of the policy.more specifically,the special adjudication portion of the notice informed class members that they were entitled to special relief if they believed southern farm had misrepresented the manner in which the number,amount,and frequency of premium payments would affect the cash value of their policies.id.at emphasis added.
this description informed the appellants of the types of claims being litigated in the adams action,and,in addition,it made clear that the appellants essentially are based on fraud in connection with the premiums to be paid on their policies and a failure to disclose the impact of declining interest rates on the cash value of those be subject to the adams class action settlement.the fact that the notice did not specifically use the phrase increasing premium there is such a not render the notice constitutionally suspect for due process purposes,as the wording of the notice was sufficient to encompass appellants increasing of action.see,in re am.life,at finding no due process modal billing practices were never specifically at issue but where the notice was clearly broad enough to encompass such practices and concluding that t here is no impropriety in including in a settlement a description of claims that is somewhat broader than those that have been specifically pleaded.we conclude that the notice afforded the appellants in the adams class action constituted the best notice practicable and comported with the requirements of due process,and that the appellants reliance on twigg is misplaced.
whether the settlement in the adams class action bars appellants claims 
having determined that the notice afforded to the appellants in the adams class action was adequate,we now must assess whether the settlement,release,and judgment entered in that earlier action should have a res judicata effect on the appellants actions that is,the jourdan and craig complaints currently pending in mississippi.res judicata,or claim preclusion,will prohibit a party from a claim where a judgment on the merits involving the same claim and the same parties exists from a prior action.the principles of claim preclusion apply to judgments in class actions as in other cases.twigg,at citation omitted.in order for claim preclusion to apply,four elements are required a final judgment on the merits rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction identity of the parties identity of the causes of action.id.at citation omitted.the first three elements are not disputed in the present case and therefore our analysis centers on whether the cause of action alleged by the appellants is identical to the cause of action that was settled in the earlier adams class action.in determining whether the causes of action are identical,we have indicated that the analysis centers on whether the primary right and duty are the same.manning city of auburn,cir citations omitted.claim preclusion applies not only to the precise legal theory presented in the previous litigation,but to all legal theories and claims arising out of the same operative nucleus of fact.id.at citation and quotations omitted.
the appellants argue that their present actions involve increasing premium insurance is,claims based on southern farm failure to disclose that their policy premiums might increase in the event interest rates turned out to be lower than those projected.they contend that this is a different operative nucleus of fact than the claims asserted in the adams class action,which,they argue,involved vanishing premium policies,that is,where the policy holder expected the premium to disappear once the cash value was large enough to cover the required premiums.the appellants assert that there is a factual distinction between premiums that would suddenly increase without warning and premiums that failed to disappear after a period of time,such that claim preclusion should not apply.
we disagree.first,although the appellants attempt to construe their claims as being based on increasing premium policies,it is clear that the policies involved in their case were flexible premium to those that were the subject of the adams class were only increasing in the sense that the premium required to cover the policies might be greater if interest rates took an unforeseen downward turn.the adams class action notice,which was incorporated into the district court final order and judgment,alleged an overarching scheme of fraud and deception by southern farm in connection with the sale of these flexible premium types of policies,a broad nucleus of fact that would encompass the fraud claims now being alleged by the appellants.see in re prudential ins.america sales practice,cir the named plaintiffs all have claims arising from the fraudulent scheme perpetrated by prudential.that overarching scheme is the linchpin of the complaint,regardless whether each class member alleges a churning claim,a vanishing premium claim,an investment plan claim,or some other injury see also in re am.life,at finding that a class action settlement clearly encompassed the plaintiff new claims alleging fraud in the sale of insurance policies,even though the settlement did not specifically mention modal billing practices.
moreover,the notice stated that the adams class action involved,among othe
