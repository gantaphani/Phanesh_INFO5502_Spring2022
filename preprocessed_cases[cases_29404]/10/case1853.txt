plaintiff homeowners appeal the denial of their motion for class certification in this action against a developer and general contractor for the cost of repairing or replacing defective concrete foundations under their homes.we hold a class action may be maintained as to the claims for breach of express and implied warranty.therefore,we reverse the trial court order in part and remand the cause with directions.
facts and proceedings below 
plaintiffs hicks and gonzales purchased and continue to own homes built and sold by defendant kaufman and broad home corporation and its subsidiaries hereafter kaufman.plaintiffs allege the concrete slab foundations under their homes are inherently defective because kaufman constructed them using fibermesh,a polypropylene product,instead of welded wire mesh.
the parties agree fibermesh does not cause concrete slab foundations to crack.cracking is caused by loss of moisture as the concrete dries and by other occurrences such as soil erosion and seismic activity.it is also undisputed neither welded wire mesh nor fibermesh will prevent cracks from occurring in a concrete slab foundation.plaintiffs allege,however,welded wire mesh will restrict those cracks to a hairline width and thus maintain the integrity of the slab.slabs built with fibermesh,on the other hand,exhibit predominantly wider cracks which split the foundation into pieces and permit moisture,dirt and insects to intrude into the house,cause bumps in the flooring,and do not resist horizontal and vertical ground movement as well as slabs built with welded wire mesh.plaintiff hicks alleges,for example,her daughter bedroom has become uninhabitable due to the dirt and insects entering through cracks in the foundation.
in their complaint,plaintiffs allege causes of action for strict liability,negligence and breach of express and implied warranty on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated.the class is defined in relevant part as all persons or entities who own one or more homes in specified kaufman developments which were constructed and marketed by kaufman in which fibermesh,a polypropylene product,was utilized in the concrete foundation slabs as a substitute for,welded wire mesh with manifested damage or defect due to the fibermesh substitution.the complaint seeks compensatory damages associated with the repair replacement of the concrete foundations of plaintiffs and class members homes.it does not seek compensation for plaintiffs or the class for personal injury or property damage caused by the use of fibermesh in the foundations 
after kaufman answered the complaint,plaintiffs moved for an order certifying the case as a class action.
the trial court denied class certification and dismissed the class allegations on two grounds the members of the putative class were not reasonably ascertainable,and the causes of action lacked common issues of fact.plaintiffs filed a timely appeal.
we concur in the trial court ruling with respect to the tort causes of action because the elements of liability and causation can not be established without individualized proof as to each of the purported class members.we conclude,however,a manageable class action may be maintained as to the causes of action for breach of express and implied warranty because the class is ascertainable and common questions of law and fact predominate with only the amount of damages subject to individualized proof.
discussion 
i.the class is ascertainable with respect to each cause of action.
our supreme court has held two requirements must be met to sustain a class action.the first is existence of an ascertainable class,and the second is a community of interest in the questions of law and fact involved.although courts sometimes treat these two requirements as if they were one they are better examined separately because they serve separate purposes.
ascertainability is required in order to give notice to putative class members as to whom the judgment in the action will be res judicata common questions of law and fact are required in order to assure the interests of the litigants and the court are furthered by permitting the suit to proceed as a class action rather than in a multiplicity of separate suits.
in the present case,the trial court concluded class membership under any of plaintiffs causes of action can not be ascertained without an individualized analysis of each putative class member concrete slabs because manifest damage to a slab must exist as a precondition for class membership.
the trial court applied an improper criterion in determining ascertainability of the class.manifest damage to a slab is not a precondition for class membership.it is,if anything,an element in the proof of kaufman liability and relates to the existence of common questions of law and fact,not ascertainability of the class the court reasoning is circular because it makes ascertainability depend on the outcome of the litigation on the merits our supreme court has held,however,courts may not consider the merits of the claim at the certification stage 
block major league baseball illustrates the difference between ascertainability and commonality for purposes of class certification block and four other former major league players brought a class action suit alleging defendants had violated their statutory and common law right of publicity by using their names,voices,signatures and photographs in various commercial products without consent or compensation.the class was defined as all major league baseball players who played major league baseball before,or,if they are now deceased,their heirs or beneficiaries.the appellate court held the complaint defined an ascertainable class,approximately men or their heirs and beneficiaries who played major league baseball prior to but affirmed denial of class certification given the numerous complex issues the trial court would be required to evaluate for each member of the class if the action were certified.the court found the class ascertainable even though it was not defined as former major league players whose voices,likenesses,defendants used without their consent or compensation.rather,the court properly treated the lack of consent or compensation as an ultimate fact each class member would have to prove to establish liability.
as explained in the leading treatise on class actions,ascertainability can be better achieved by defining the class in terms of objective characteristics and common transactional facts making the ultimate identification of class members possible when that identification becomes necessary.the class certification order and notice to the class are the proper places to explain the relationship between the defined class and the legal claims being made in the case 
in the present case the complaint defined the class as homeowners whose homes contained fibermesh foundations with manifested damage or defect due to the fibermesh substitution this definition is flawed for the reasons stated above,but the flaw is not fatal.a class is still ascertainable even if the definition pleads ultimate facts or conclusions of law.for example,in wilner sunset life ins.the class was defined as persons who owned policies issued by defendant which were purchased as a result of deceptive or fraudulent sales practices described herein and were thereby harmed.the court held this definition describes the class sufficiently to make it ascertainable.in slaven bp america,an oil spill case,the court certified a class defined as persons having an interest in real or personal property who have suffered or will suffer economic damage as a result of the oil spill the ensuing effort.furthermore,if necessary to preserve the case as a class action,the court itself can and should redefine the class where the evidence before it shows such a redefined class would be ascertainable 
the class in the case before us is ascertainable.it consists of the owners of homes in specified developments constructed and marketed by kaufman in which fibermesh was utilized in the concrete foundation slabs.as such,the class is precise,objective,and can be determined from public records and kaufman own records,at least with respect to the california marquis development 
we conclude,therefore,an ascertainable class exists with respect to all of the causes of action in the complaint.
ii.common questions of law and fact predominate with respect to the causes of action for breach of warranty.
a class may be certified when common questions of law and fact predominate over individualized questions as a general rule if the defendant liability can be determined by facts common to all members of the class,a class will be certified even if the members must individually prove their damages in order to determine whether common questions of fact predominate the trial court must examine the issues framed by the pleadings and the law applicable to the causes of action alleged 
here,the trial court denied certification on the ground common factual issues do not predominate.the court concluded plaintiffs failed to present any evidence of common manifest damage and neither liability nor causation can be established without individualized analysis of each putative class member concrete slabs.again,the court applied improper criteria.
kaufman expressly warranted its homes will be free from any defect resulting in or causing tangible damage to the foundation of the home which materially diminishes the structural integrity and performance of the home for a period of ten years commercial code section,subdivision c establishes an implied warranty goods sold a re fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used and section establishes an implied warranty the goods shall be fit for the purpose for which they are required.
plaintiffs contend that to prove breach of the express and implied home warranties they only need to prove fibermesh is an inherently defective product the use of which is substantially certain to lead to foundation failure.in support of their contention,plaintiffs submitted a declaration from their expert,charles laines.after reciting his qualifications and experience as a structural engineer laines testified i have inspected and investigated the performance of both wire mesh and fibermesh in holding concrete together after it cracks.without exception,the wire mesh has held cracks closely together and they rarely exceed hairline proportion.fibermesh allows the cracks to separate,causing a loss of the interlock of the aggregate and in effect creating multiple slab pieces from what was to have been one slab s lab replacement is necessary to correct the problem,regardless of the condition of the slab at the present time.whether any particular slab has actually yet cracked,and or the width of any particular crack at the present time,are not material factors.the fact that a slab has not yet cracked which would be not mean that environmental factors will not later cause a crack.if a crack has not yet separated,environmental factors will later likely cause separation.
kaufman of course disputes laines expert opinion a concrete foundation containing fibermesh is inherently defective because it will eventually fail.but even assuming laines is correct,kaufman contends,a cause of action for breach of warranty will not lie if the allegedly defective product is presently performing.thus,in order to prove kaufman breached its warranties,each class member would have to produce evidence his or her fibermesh foundation has cracked or split in a way which would not have occurred if the foundation had been constructed using welded wire mesh.producing this proof would require taking and analyzing core samples from the foundations of all class members homes,which plaintiffs themselves allege number in the thousands.
the question before us is whether malfunction is an element of a cause of action for breach of warranty.california courts appear to have reached contrary answers to this question.however,as we shall demonstrate,these cases are reconcilable.for the reasons we explain below,we conclude proof of breach of warranty does not require proof the product has malfunctioned but only that it contains an inherent defect which is substantially certain to result in malfunction during the useful life of the product.the question whether an inherently defective product is presently functioning as warranted goes to the remedy for the breach,not proof of the breach itself.
plaintiffs rely on anthony general motors,a class action seeking replacement of defective truck wheels in anthony,as in the case before us,the trial court ruled the plaintiffs suit could not be maintained as a class action.the issue in anthony,as in the case before us,was whether breach of the defendant warranty could be established solely by evidence of a common inherent defect in the product the court of appeal concluded the existence of a common inherent defect was a question of fact common to the class which,if established,would support recovery on a breach of warranty theory.it was unnecessary to produce individualized evidence any plaintiff or class member had suffered wheel failure or personal injury or property damage as a result of wheel failure 
in reaching its decision,the court in anthony explained t he gravamen of plaintiffs case is the contention that all wheels of the type involved contain an inherent defect which may cause them to fail at some time,even if loaded within the limits of the defendant representations and even if maintained and driven with due care.it is patent from the record before us that that issue is one which will require an elaborate and probably protracted trial.it is exactly the sort of common issue for which class actions were designed.if,as we read the record,plaintiffs are correct that all of the wheels are inherently suspect,the recovery expressly sought herein of the wheels will not turn on the conduct of any individual purchaser.
our supreme court recent decision in aas superior court also lends support to plaintiffs argument the cost of repairing latent construction defects can be recovered under a breach of warranty theory without proof the defects have resulted in property damage 
the plaintiffs in aas were owners of homes is a subdivision in san diego county.plaintiffs alleged their homes suffered from a variety of construction defects affecting virtually all components and aspects of their construction.they sued the developer and general contractor and many of the subcontractors asserting causes of action for negligence,strict liability,and breach of express and implied warranty.plaintiffs sought,among other things,the cost of repairing the alleged defects 
in pretrial proceedings,defendants brought motions in limine applicable to all causes of action to exclude evidence of any construction defect which had not yet caused property damage.the trial court granted defendants motions as to the tort claims only and the court of appeal denied writ relief 
by the time the case reached the supreme court the plaintiffs no longer contended strict liability provided a remedy for defects which had not caused property damage,defects causing only economic loss.thus,the court defined the issue as whether the plaintiffs could recover in negligence from the entities that built their homes a money judgment representing the cost to repair,or the diminished value attributable to,construction defects that have not caused property damage.the court held in actions for negligence in home construction,a manufacturer liability is limited to damages for injury to person or property no recovery is allowed for economic loss alone in so ruling,the court distinguished its earlier decision in on the ground the plaintiffs in aas had not demonstrated the foreseeability,appreciable harm and moral blame required to establish tort liability under 
because the trial court had not precluded the plaintiffs in aas from introducing evidence of economic damages in support of their breach of warranty claims,the supreme court had no occasion to address the specific issue raised in the cause before us.the court did,however,contrast the kind of damages recoverable in product liability cases based on negligence from those based on breach of warranty.as a general rule,tort law provides a remedy for construction defects that cause property damage or personal injury b ut the difference between price paid and value received and deviations from standards of quality that have not resulted in property damage or personal injury,are primarily the domain of contract and warranty law rather than of negligence responding to plaintiffs argument they could make the cost of repairs ascertainable within the meaning of by voluntarily repairing the defects and obtaining a receipt for the money spent,the court stated this confuses the measurement of alleged damages with the ability of particular facts to support a tort action.to say that one house needs repairs costing a certain amount is not necessarily to say that one has suffered the type of harm cognizable in tort,as opposed to contract.
the plaintiffs in aas appear to have been in the same situation as the plaintiffs in the cause before us insofar as they,like the plaintiffs here,suffered economic loss but,as yet,no actual property damage.the trial court in aas denied the defendants motion to exclude evidence of economic loss as to the plaintiffs breach of warranty claims and the defendants did not challenge that ruling.nevertheless,the supreme court discussion of the differences in damages recoverable in negligence versus breach of warranty clearly suggests the court would have upheld the trial court ruling with respect to the breach of warranty causes of action.
kaufman relies on khan shiley,an action by the recipient of a mechanical heart valve seeking damages for emotional distress caused by her fear the valve would fail khan complaint alleged,a n extraordinary number of defendants valves have malfunctioned causing death or other serious injury and damages to those persons in whom the valves were implanted and their spouses.khan conceded her valve has not yet malfunctioned but alleged the valve is defective and likely to malfunction at any moment the trial court granted defendants motion for summary judgment and khan appealed.the court of appeal framed the issue as whether the owner of a product,functioning as intended but containing an inherent defect which may cause the product to fail in the future,has an action against the manufacturer.
affirming the judgment for defendants in khan,the court noted khan possible theories of recovery included strict liability in tort,negligence and breach of warranty but n o matter which theory is utilized where a plaintiff alleges a product is defective,proof that the product has malfunctioned is essential to establish liability for an injury caused by the defect.here,the court concluded,khan alleged emotional injuries are not a basis for recovery absent a ground for imposing liability pursuant to a recognized cause of action.so long as the valve continues to function,no cause of action exists under any products liability theory.kaufman places great emphasis on the comprehensive language of the last quoted sentence.however,as we proceed to explain,that sentence does not accurately reflect the holding in khan nor the state of the law on breach of warranty claims.
because of the sweeping language in khan,proclaiming s o long as the valve continues to function,no cause of action exists under any products liability theory,it might appear anthony and khan were addressing the same malfunction is an element of a cause of action for breach of that they reached contrary conclusions,anthony holding malfunction is not an element of the cause of action and khan holding that it is.in reality the two cases did not address the same issue.anthony addressed the issue whether a product containing a design defect must fail to perform as warranted before the plaintiff can recover economic damages under breach of warranty for its repair or replacement khan addressed the issue whether a product containing a design defect must fail to perform as warranted before the plaintiff can recover damages under breach of warranty for an injury caused by the defect in this instance,the patient emotional distress attributable to living with a defective artificial heart valve.
the parties stipulated in khan the plaintiff heart valve has not yet malfunctioned and she was not seeking damages for the cost of replacing the valve but for emotional distress brought on by worrying the valve would fail the court properly concluded plaintiff could not recover for her personal injury because the essential element of causation was missing.khan alleged injury was not caused by any defect in the valve.rather,it was caused,if at all,by the knowledge the valve may,at some future time,fracture.in other words,the primary right alleged to have been violated in khan was not the right to take a product free from defect but the right to be free from emotional distress caused by worry the defect would result in physical injury.the court held,khan alleged emotional injuries are not the basis for recovery under a recognized cause of action.
in anthony,the situation was reversed.there the plaintiffs did not seek to recover for physical injury or property damage caused by the defect in the truck wheels.rather,they sought to recover the cost of replacing the defective wheels.the primary right alleged to have been violated in anthony,as in the case before us,was the right to take a product free from defect.the defect did not cause the plaintiffs injury the defect was the injury.
kaufman also relies on american suzuki motor superior court,a class action with some similarities to the present case there the plaintiffs alleged the design of the samurai,a sport utility vehicle manufactured by defendant,create d an unacceptable risk of a deadly accident when driven under reasonably anticipated and foreseeable driving conditions under the theory of breach of implied warranty plaintiffs sought to recover for themselves and all other owners of the vehicle the cost of repairing the inherent safety defect in the samurai.like the plaintiffs in the present case,the plaintiffs in american suzuki did not allege they had suffered any property damage or personal injuries as a result of the alleged design defect but relied on the declaration of an expert who testified the samurai had a rollover design defect which rendered it unsafe the court of appeal granted defendant petition for a writ of mandate decertifying the class.
the issue framed by the court in american suzuki was whether the plaintiffs could state a cause of action for breach of implied warranty where they have suffered no personal injury or property damage from a vehicle they claim is defectively designed,and it is impliedly conceded that their vehicles the date of fit for their ordinary purpose.the court concluded from the evidence that because only a small percentage of the samurais had been involved in rollover accidents the samurai was not defective as a matter of law and therefore the plaintiffs could not state a cause of action for breach of implied warranty 
american suzuki and feinstein are distinguishable from the case at bench.those implied warranty cases were not decided on the ground a defect must have resulted in the product malfunctioning in order to give rise to a suit for breach of warranty.rather,they were decided on the ground that since there was no history of the products failing they were not,as a matter of law,defective foundations,however,are not like cars or tires.cars and tires have a limited useful life.at the end of their lives they,and whatever defect they may have contained,wind up on a scrap heap.if the defect has not manifested itself in that time span,the buyer has received what he bargained for a foundation useful life,however,is indefinite.some houses continue to provide shelter for centuries.and,in contrast to the cars and tires in american suzuki and feinstein,plaintiffs in the case at bench presented expert testimony based on observations and analysis showing foundations containing fibermesh will someday most likely crack badly and cause problems such as insect and vermin infestation,bumps in the floor and premature wearing of carpeting and damage to vinyl floor coverings and ceramic tile.
we conclude,therefore
