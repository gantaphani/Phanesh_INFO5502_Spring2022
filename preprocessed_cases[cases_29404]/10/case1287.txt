we are called upon to decide the extent to which the federal courts are open or closed by the eleventh amendment of the constitution to persons who claim a state has improperly taken their property under a state escheat system.the answer,as in many legal questions it depends.it depends on whether the property at issue is an individual property or a state property,and whether the relief requested is prospective or retrospective.
appellants agnes suever,et collectively,the class appeal the district court order granting the motion of appellees kathleen connell,richard chivaro,steve westly,and george deleon collectively,the controller to dismiss the class action without leave to amend.the class complaint alleges that,to mitigate the state mounting debt,the controller improperly seized and retained the class property under the california unclaimed property law upl,et.the district court held that the eleventh amendment barred the class complaint in its entirety because the complaint alleged only that the class was entitled to monetary damages as compensation from state funds for state officials past constitutional violations and fail ed to allege state officials ongoing violation of federal law or to seek relief properly characterized as prospective that would warrant an exception to state sovereign immunity under ex parte young.
the district court erred because it overlooked that part of what the class requests is the return of its own property,not compensation from state funds for property permanently taken from it.in a case related to the present one,this court recently held that the eleventh amendment does not bar a request for the return of a plaintiff property if the complaint alleges that state officials acted either ultra vires or unconstitutionally.taylor westly,cir.because,like the complaint in taylor,the complaint here alleges that state officials seized and retained the class property through ultra vires and unconstitutional acts,the eleventh amendment does not bar the class from suing to obtain its property back from the controller.
beyond the return of its property,the class requests some forms of relief that are permissibly prospective,whereas other requested forms of relief may impermissibly require retrospective compensation from state funds.we leave it to the district court upon remand to determine which claims the eleventh amendment bars and which claims it does not.
accordingly,we vacate the district court order dismissing the class action and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
