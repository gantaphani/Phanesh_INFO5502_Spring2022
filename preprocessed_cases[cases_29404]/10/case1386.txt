appellees,migrant farm workers workers,brought this class action against produce,and green stripe,under the migrant and seasonal agricultural worker protection act awpa et,alleging that because controlled the workers housing,was required to ensure that the housing met awpa standards and was certified compliant.appellees also allege that because provided housing to the workers,is liable for failing to provide statutorily required notices to the workers.
after conducting a bench trial the district court determined that controlled and provided the housing to the workers,thus was liable for failing to comply with awpa housing provisions.for the reasons explained herein,we hold that the district court erred in its determination that controlled the housing within the meaning of the awpa.however,we affirm the district judge determination that provided housing.accordingly,we remand this action to the district court for a determination of the proper damage award based on violation of the awpa notice requirements.
is a major producer of grape tomatoes.in and,approximately harvest workers were recruited and transported to the jennings,florida area by farm labor contractors or crew leaders to harvest tomatoes on north florida farm.due to the nature of the job and the fact that limited housing was available,crew leaders customarily procured housing for the workers.the crew leaders were paid a commission based on the harvest.the crew leaders were not compensated for time spent performing housing duties.
contracted with ajay gandhi gandhi,the owner of a motel in nearby jasper,florida,to provide rooms for the workers.gandhi,through his company ckg group,in turn contracted with hospitality investments for additional rooms for the workers at howard johnson and best western.gandhi negotiated reduced daily room rates with the motels and then billed at a higher rate for each room.the crew leaders would contact gandhi directly to arrange for the necessary number of rooms for their workers.during the harvest season,workers constituted a substantial majority of the guests at all three motels.
the motel rooms were typically registered under the names of the crew leaders gandhi.the room keys were issued to the crew leaders who in turn made the room assignments and decided which worker would have responsibility for the room key.the crew leader generally collected per week in rent from each worker.if less than per week was collected per room,recouped the resulting shortfall from the crew leader.the remainder of the charge for each room,which was the majority of the room charge,was subsidized by.
the crew leaders were directed by the farm manager to assign no more than four people to each room,which was the occupancy limit set by howard johnson and best western however,in order to build a cushion against rent collection shortfalls,some crew leaders assigned five or more workers to a room,forcing some of the workers to sleep on the floor.
the motels were not equipped with sufficient laundry facilities for the workers.moreover,there were generally no cooking facilities and many employees did not have regular access to a refrigerator.as a result,workers purchased their meals from mobile food wagons set up in the parking lots of the motels.workers often paid per day for meals,considerably more than if they had access to kitchen facilities.
the motel management generally afforded the crew leaders full access to the workers rooms.while did not promulgate any of the motel occupancy rules,the crew leaders helped enforce the motels rules and policies including monitoring occupancy levels in each room,enforcing curfew,requiring workers to place their shoes outside of their rooms,so that dirt would not be tracked into the rooms,monitoring workers use of outside gas grills,removing excessive amounts of trash accumulated at the motels and restricting excessive noise.at least one of the motels required the crew leaders to execute a hotel waiver delineating their responsibilities for the behavior of their crew members.in addition,some crew leaders were given in house crew sheets containing a daily room count that the hotel relied upon for its administrative billing process.
in a written disclosure prepared for distribution to the workers,it was noted that the hotel rent would be per week.while this notice was generally distributed to the workers,at least one crew leader conceded that he did not deliver this written disclosure to his workers.moreover,during the and harvest seasons,did not post in a conspicuous place at the motels or present to its employees a written statement of the terms and conditions of occupancy of the motels.
iii.standard of review 
we review factual findings made by a district court after a bench trial for clear error,which is a highly deferential standard of review.holton city of thomasville sch,cir.a.we review conclusions of law made by a district judge following a bench trial de novo.thornburg gingles,d quoting bose consumers union,d review for clear error does not inhibit an appellate court power to correct errors of law,including those that may infect a mixed finding of law and fact,or a finding of fact that is predicated on a misunderstanding of the governing rule of law.thus,the district court interpretation of the terms controlled and provided as used in awpa is reviewed de novo.see pine straw,cir whether plaintiffs raking,gathering,baling,and loading of pine straw for commercial sale is agricultural employment within the purview of the awpa concerns a question of law and is reviewed de novo.
iv.discussion 
in construing a statute,o ur ultimate goal is to give effect to congressional intent.morantenavarro at quoting curtis richardson,cir construing the awpa.we are primarily guided in our statutory analysis of the awpa by the plain meaning of the statute language,counseled by the department of labor interpretations,at citing curtis richardson,cir see also chevron,natural res.def.council,d c onsiderable weight should be accorded to an executive department construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer and the principle of deference to administrative interpretations.if the statute language is not plain,we rely on the legislative history of the awpa.united states fields,cir in the absence of any plain meaning of the statutory language,we look to the legislative history of the statute to determine whether congress provided any guidance concerning its intent.
the precedent act to awpa was the farm labor contractor registration act of,codified as amended at et flcra repealed.the flcra was the first major federal effort to improve the conditions for agricultural laborers,at.in,congress substituted the awpa for the flcra because the flcra had failed to aid exploited agricultural laborers,yet was hampering agricultural employers with its onerous registration requirements.id.at citation omitted.the awpa was an effort to remove the restraints on commerce caused by activities detrimental to migrant and seasonal agricultural workers to require farm labor contractors to register under this act and to assure necessary protections for migrant and seasonal agricultural workers,agricultural associations,and agricultural employers.a.we have recognized that awpa is a remedial statute and should be construed broadly to effect its humanitarian purpose,at,at.
at issue in this case are two provisions of the awpa which address protections related to migrant workers housing.the first provision requires each person who owns or controls a facility that is used as housing for migrant farm workers,to ensure that the facility complies with federal and state health and safety standards and to post the certification of compliance at the site.a b.also at issue is a provision that requires that each farm labor contractor,agricultural employer or agricultural association which provides housing to migrant farm workers post or present to such worker a statement of the terms and conditions of the occupancy.c.
before we delve into the statutory interpretation of these provisions of the awpa,we must address the threshold issue of whether the crew leaders were acting as age
