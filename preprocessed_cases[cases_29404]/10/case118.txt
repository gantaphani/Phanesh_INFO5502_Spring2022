a recent amendment to the civil rules permits courts of appeals,in their discretion,to entertain interlocutory appeals from orders granting or denying class certification.see.f.to this point,no court has addressed the criteria that should guide the exercise of discretion in permitting or declining to permit interlocutory appeals with respect to defendant classes.this petition for leave to appeal from a class certification order requires us to plunge into that abyss.
we approach this task by reshaping the criteria that we have established for allowing interlocutory appeals in cases involving plaintiff classes.see waste mgmt.holdings,mowbray,cir.after formulating the criteria that will pertain to interlocutory appeals involving defendant classes,we apply them here and grant the instant petition.
that brings us to the merits of the class certification order.the district court advanced two bases for certifying a class.see tilley tjx,upon close perscrutation,we reject both grounds.specifically,we conclude that the district court i erred as a matter of law in employing rule b as a vehicle for certifying a defendant class,and ii abused its discretion in determining that the possibility of stare decisis,standing alone,was a sufficient justification for class certification under rule b b.consequently,we vacate the class certification order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the factual predicate of this case is fairly straightforward.gerardine tilley is a graphic artist who created and published a wallpaper design entitled harbortown border.she obtained a copyright for the design on september.see.on december,she brought suit in federal district court against the petitioners,dennis east international,and tjx companies,for damages and injunctive relief.her complaint alleged that dennis east,an importer,copied her design without leave and then advertised and sold home decor items bearing the replica to approximately retailers throughout the united states including tjx.
in time,tilley moved for certification of a defendant retailer class.the district court certified the proposed class under.b b for both damages and equitable relief,and,in the alternative,under.b for injunctive relief only.tilley,at.in the process,the court designated tjx as the class representative.id.at.
the petitioners timely sought leave from this court to appeal the class certification order pursuant to rule f.drawing upon the standards articulated in mowbray,at,they argued that the certification order warranted immediate review because it raised important and unsettled issues of law,including i the appropriateness of certifying a defendant class under rule b,ii the appropriateness of class certification under rule b b based solely on the possibility that the litigation could have a stare decisis effect on subsequent actions,and iii the constitutionality,absent class members,of certifying a mandatory defendant class in an action that includes claims for money damages.the petitioners also argued for immediate review on the theory that class certification had so raised the ante that they faced irresistible pressure to settle.
motivated in part by the unresolved issue of whether the mowbray criteria apply to petitions seeking interlocutory review of orders certifying defendant classes,we directed the parties to brief both the rule f issues and the merits.we heard oral argument on september,and took the matter under advisement.
ii.leave to appeal 
we begin with the threshold question of whether to entertain the appeal on an interlocutory basis.in mounting this inquiry,we regard the interests and circumstances of dennis east as only marginally relevant.dennis east is not a member of the proposed class,and the class certification order has no direct effect on tilley claim against it which remains separate and distinct from her claim against the class.see tilley,at.given these facts,dennis its counsel conceded at oral argument in this standing to challenge class certification.dopp htp,cir explaining that when an order is aimed specifically at others,the fact that it has an indirect or incidental effect on the putative appellant does not confer standing to appeal chg int l,cir holding that a defendant may not appeal the dismissal of claims against a codefendant because it is not a party to those claims a n indirect financial stake in another party claims is insufficient to create standing on appeal.
nevertheless,dennis east lack of standing does not frustrate the joint petition party with impeccable standing to appeal the class certification itself a petitioner.so long as one petitioner has standing,the proceeding may go forward without any consideration of the standing of.see watt energy action educ,d arlington heights metro.hous.dev,d buckley valeo,d per curiam.
having cleared that hurdle,we move to a determination of what criteria govern the granting of rule f petitions for interlocutory review of orders certifying or refusing to certify defendant classes.in mowbray,this court described three categories of cases in which interlocutory review of certification orders anent plaintiff classes would be appropriate 
first,an appeal ordinarily should be permitted when a denial of class status effectively ends the case because,say,the named plaintiff claim is not of a sufficient magnitude to warrant the costs of litigation.second,an appeal ordinarily should be permitted when the grant of class status raises the stakes of the litigation so substantially that the defendant likely will feel irresistible pressure to settle.third,an appeal ordinarily should be permitted when it will lead to clarification of a fundamental issue of law.
at.in addition,we left room for the possibility that special circumstances or the need to avoid manifest injustice might expand this list.id.at.
defendant classes are a relatively rare breed,and no court of appeals has had the opportunity to consider whether the same set of standards should apply to petitions for leave to appeal orders certifying or refusing to certify defendant classes.structurally,there are arguments to be made on both sides of this question.on the one hand,rule generally treats plaintiff and defendant classes the same it authorizes class members to sue or be sued as representative parties it requires class actions to satisfy the four prerequisites of numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequate representation regardless of whether the action involves a plaintiff class or a defendant class and it conditions all certifications on the class ability to come within one of the niches carved out by rule b.this equality of treatment arguably favors use of the same criteria for permitting interlocutory review of all class certification decisions.
on the other hand,defendant classes possess some salient features that distinguish them from plaintiff classes.for one thing,a plaintiff who initiates a suit aimed at the certification of a defendant class has a clear incentive to select a weak that adversary likely will be chosen to represent the defendant class.for another thing,courts have found the due process interests of absent members of defendant classes deserving of special solicitude.see,pabst brewing corrao,cir see also alba conte herbert newberg,newberg on class actions,at ed.it is these particularities that prevent us from mechanically applying the mowbray criteria to appeals involving defendant classes.instead,we test those criteria to determine whether they should be retained,retained with modifications,or discarded in dealing with defendant classes.
in our judgment,the logic underlying the first mowbray it is appropriate to exercise appellate jurisdiction when a denial of class status effectively ends the case because,say,the cost of litigation far outweighs the value of the plaintiff individual itself to defendant classes as well.when a defendant class is involved,interlocutory review is warranted if certification has been denied and the plaintiff claim would only be worth pursuing as against the class.this may occur,for example,when the aggregate value of the plaintiff claims against all potential defendants justifies a single class action,but the distilled value of claims against individual defendants does not justify the cost of separate actions 
skipping over the second mowbray criterion for a moment,it is readily evident that the third an interlocutory appeal may be allowed when it will lead to the resolution of fundamental and unsettled issues of be transplanted root and branch for use in actions involving defendant classes.that the proposed class comprises defendants rather than plaintiffs does not lessen the desirability of clarifying significant legal issues that might otherwise escape effective review.in much the same vein,reserving the right to grant leave to appeal when special circumstances exist or the prospect of manifest injustice looms,see mowbray,at,is equally appropriate in cases involving defendant classes.
we now return to the more unwieldy transplantation of the second mowbray criterion.with regard to plaintiff classes,we explained that an appeal ordinarily should be permitted when the grant of class status raises the stakes of the litigation so substantially that the defendant likely will feel irresistible pressure to settle.id.at.it seems clear,however,that when the spotlight shines on a defendant class,this category loses much of its luster.unlike an action involving a plaintiff class in which the defendant potential liability increases dramatically upon the granting of class certification,the named defendant individual liability generally remains constant in a class action involving a defendant class.moreover,after certification of a defendant class,the original predicament presumably will be representative of the class,see.a will face the same claims and mount the same defenses as in an individual suit.indeed,the defendant may incur reduced costs if certification prompts class members to help fund a common defense.
we do not mean to close the door completely on the utility of mowbray second criterion in actions involving defendant classes.in the unlikely event that certification places inexorable settlement pressure on a particular class of defendants,the special injustice exception is sufficiently flexible to afford relief.in the case at hand,however,no such showing has been made.
to be sure,the petitioners argue that the certification order places pressure on them to settle in two ways i it exposes dennis east to indemnity and breach of warranty claims expected to be brought by each of the retailers,and ii it risks increasing litigation expenses to the point that defense costs would exceed the sum of dennis east assets and available insurance.what the petitioners fail to explain,however,is why dennis east is a relevant party in this analysis.as noted above,dennis east is not a member of the class certified by the district court,and the court designated tjx,not dennis east,as the class representative.the plaintiff claim against dennis east remains separate from her claim against the class,and,accordingly,any increased pressure that dennis east might face is inconsequential.
to recapitulate,interlocutory appeals of class certification orders in cases involving defendant classes are warranted when one of three circumstances exists i denial of certification effectively disposes of the litigation because the plaintiff claim would only be worth pursuing as against a full class of defendants or ii an interlocutory appeal would clarify an important and unsettled legal issue that would likely escape effective review or iii an interlocutory appeal is a desirable vehicle either for addressing special circumstances or for avoiding manifest injustice.we remind those who seek interlocutory review pursuant to the first criterion limned above that such petitioners also must demonstrate that the district court ruling on class certification is problematic.see supra note.
the circumstances here are special and,thus,satisfy the test.entertaining an appeal here and now will clarify important and unsettled legal issues.what is more,the parties,at our invitation,have fully briefed the merits,and postponing a decision would be wasteful.accordingly,we grant the petition for leave to appeal and proceed to the merits.
iii.the merits 
we review orders granting or denying class certification for abuse of discretion.mowbray,at.an abuse of discretion occurs when a district court adopts an incorrect legal rule,relies upon an improper factor in making a discretionary decision,neglects a significant factor relevant to that decision,or considers only the proper factors but makes a clear error of judgment in weighing them.id.
defendant classes under rule b.
this appeal presents us with the occasion to address,for the first time,whether rule b contemplates the certification of defendant classes.the petitioners argue that defendant class actions lie outside the purview of that provision.in general,we agree 
rule b provides for class certification when 
the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class,thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.
b.this language is quite clear the party opposing the class means the opposing party in the litigation in ordinary circumstances,it will be the alleged has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class,thereby making certification of a plaintiff class appropriate.in cases involving defendant classes,there will be no single act or refusal to act on the part of the plaintiff the party opposing the class that makes injunctive or declaratory relief appropriate.rather,it will be the members of the putative allegedly have acted in the same tortious or unlawful way here,by selling infringing articles.the language of rule b leaves no room for such a circumstance to ground certification of a defendant class.for this reason,defendant classes generally lie outside the contemplation of rule b.
we need not rely solely on direct textual support for this interpretation.three other sources fortify our position.first,the drafting history of rule b makes no reference to defendant classes,using only examples involving plaintiff classes to illustrate how the rule is designed to operate.see.b advisory committee note.second,most of the major treatises agree that the language of the rule is clear and that the better view is to restrict its applicability to plaintiff classes seeking injunctive relief.charles wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,at ed.supp accord james moore et,moore federal practice,at ed far from courts of appeals that actually have discussed the applicability of rule b to defendant classes share this view.see henson lincoln township,cir thompson bd.of,cir paxman campbell,cir per curiam see also greenhouse greco,cir suggesting in dictum that rule b is not an appropriate basis for the certification of a defendant class 
tilley attempts to parry this thrust by reliance on the decision in marcera chinlund,cir,vacated on other grounds sub nom.lombard marcera,d,in which the second circuit approved without discussion the certification of a defendant class under rule b.but the marcera court decision rested on thin support a case decided under the version of rule and without any mention of rule b a district court decision that relegated its summary discussion of this matter to a footnote and two law review notes one of which concludes that rule b can not be used as a vehicle for certifying a defendant class.see id.at citing,inter alia,val.perhaps more importantly,the case is easily distinguishable.the conclusion that rule b was an appropriate vehicle for certification of a defendant class was limited to suits for injunctive relief against a class of local public officials.id.emphasis supplied.whether or not such a class fits within the contours of the matter on which we take no class in this case is not so composed.we hold,therefore,that the district court erred in certifying a defendant class under rule b.
stare decisis.
we now turn to the district court decision to certify a class under rule b b.this too presents an unsettled legal i
