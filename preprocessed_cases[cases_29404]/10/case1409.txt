this appeal asks whether florida law requires insurers,hartford accident and indemnity company,hartford casualty insurance company,and twin city fire insurance company collectively,hartford,to defend their insured,donald beaver,against a class action suit in which the class has not yet been certified by the state court and the only potentially covered claims are by putative class members.the district court granted summary judgment to hartford,ruling that the duty to defend under florida law would not arise pursuant to a general liability policy unless and until a class has been certified.after thorough review of florida law,we disagree and accordingly reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the relevant facts are these the appellant,donald beaver,was the sole shareholder,owner,director and officer of brian center corporation and brian center management corporation during the relevant period the appellees,hartford,issued a general liability policy to the defendants with effective coverage dates from november,to november.the terms of the hartford policy insure the defendants against damages from bodily injury that occur during the policy period.the policy also provides that hartford has both the right and the duty to defend any suit seeking covered damages 
in,two plaintiffs,hazel garrison and the estate of cary ayres,filed a putative class action suit the underlying action in the circuit court of the thirteenth judicial circuit in hillsborough county,florida,against the defendants.the defendants operated numerous nursing home facilities across the south.the complaint alleged that ayres resided at one of the nursing homes in tampa,florida from june,until his death on december,and that garrison resided in the same nursing home from october,to november.the operative complaint in the underlying action the underlying complaint broadly charged that beaver and brian center defendants breached fiduciary duties owed to the nursing home residents by failing to provide necessary care,services,and supplies required for their health and lca defendants,after merging with brian center defendants in march,also breached their fiduciary duties to the residents and beaver as officer and director of the nursing home corporations,assumed duties to provide residents with adequate care and services,and negligently breached those duties in causing garrison bodily injury.
hartford accordingly assumed the defense of the underlying action but reserved its right to contest coverage.hartford then commenced this action on july,in the united states district court for the middle district of florida,seeking a declaratory judgment that there was no coverage or duty to defend the underlying action.after some delays caused by bankruptcy proceedings,on january,hartford moved for summary judgment.then,on august,hartford informed the district court that ayres had settled and was withdrawing as a plaintiff in the underlying action.the case proceeded with garrison as the sole named plaintiff.
the district court granted hartford motion for summary judgment,ruling that the underlying complaint did not trigger a duty to defend because the facts in the complaint,on their face,fail to bring garrison claims within coverage of hartford policy.hartford later moved for clarification,asking whether the district court meant that hartford did not have a duty to defend the underlying action based on claims by putative class members rather than by garrison.on june,the district court granted hartford motion for clarification,concluding that hartford did not have a duty to defend the underlying action.the district court noted the absence of controlling florida precedent,but held 
that hartford does not have a duty to defend against the class action allegations contained in the state court complaint until such time as that class is certified pursuant to florida rule of civil procedure.
the plain language of rule strongly suggests that a class must be certified before a claim may be maintained on its behalf.without class certification,there is no class action claim to defend against.the court is also persuaded by the reasoning of the federal cases holding that the claims of potential class members can not be aggregated to satisfy the amount in controversy requirement.for example,the ninth circuit in gibson chrysler,cir,noted that a class action,when filed,includes only the claims of the named plaintiff or plaintiffs.the claims of unnamed class members are added to the action later,when the action is certified as a class under rule.
beaver,alone among the defendants,filed this appeal from the district court ruling.
we are by florida law in deciding this diversity case.see erie tompkins.the case presents an open question of florida law,but despite the absence of state law deciding the exact issue before us,florida law yields the conclusion that a duty to defend exists here.
our starting point is the florida supreme court decision in jones florida ins.guar.ass n,so d,which succinctly outlined the general parameters of an insurer duty to defend 
it is well settled that an insurer duty to defend its insured against a legal action arises when the complaint alleges facts that fairly and potentially bring the suit within policy coverage.the duty to defend must be determined from the allegations in the complaint.
the duty to defend is of greater breadth than the insurer duty to indemnify,and the insurer must defend even if the allegations in the complaint are factually incorrect or meritless.indeed,when the actual facts are inconsistent with the allegations in the complaint,the allegations in the complaint control in determining the insurer duty to defend.any doubts regarding the duty to defend must be resolved in favor of the insured.
id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
these basic principles have been in florida.see,state farm fire cas.ctc dev,so d,acknowledging that the duty to defend is controlled by the allegations in the complaint against the insured union fire ins.lenox liquors,so d,same biltmore constr.owners ins,so d,dca same sunshine birds supplies,united states fid.guar,so d,dca the allegations of the complaint govern the duty to defend even if they may be factually incorrect or without merit,or where there has been a suggestion made that the purported negligent allegations are really allegations of intentional acts in disguise w here a complaint alleges facts that are partially within and partially outside the coverage of an insured policy,the insurer is not only obligated to defend,but must defend that entire suit.citations omitted irvine prudential prop.cas.ins,so d,dca the duty is determined solely by the allegations against the insured,not by the actual facts,nor the insured version of the facts.grissom commercial union ins,so d,dca all doubts as to whether a duty to defend exists in a particular case must be resolved against the insurer and in favor of the insured.so long as the complaint alleges facts that create potential coverage under the policy,the insurer must defend the suit.baron oil nationwide mut.fire ins,so d,dca t he duty to defend continues even though it is ultimately determined that the alleged cause of action is groundless and no liability is found within the policy provisions defining coverage.if the allegations of the complaint leave any doubt regarding the duty to defend,the question must be resolved in favor of the insured requiring the insurer to defend.
thus,the central inquiry in a duty to defend case is whether the complaint alleges facts that fairly and potentially bring the suit within policy coverage.jones,so d at.since the parties agree that hartford faces potential liability only if a class is certified,we are obliged to ask whether the underlying complaint alleges facts that fairly and potentially support class certification.
florida rule of civil procedure sets forth state law enumerating the prerequisites for class certification 
before any claim or defense may be maintained on behalf of a class by one party or more suing or being sued as the representative of all the members of a class,the court shall first conclude that the members of the class are so numerous that separate joinder of each member is impracticable,the claim or defense of the representative party raises questions of law or fact common to the questions of law or fact raised by the claim or defense of each member of the class,the claim or defense of the representative party is typical of the claim or defense of each member of the class,and the representative party can fairly and adequately protect and represent the interests of each member of the class.
civ.a.see also chase manhattan mortg.porcher,so d,dca the movant for class certification bears the burden of establishing all the requirements of florida rule of civil procedure.
fully eight pages of the underlying complaint detail the factual allegations supporting class certification.the substance of those allegations are the class is too numerous for separate joinder,as the class will likely include upward of individuals who are geographically dispersed throughout florida,north carolina,south carolina,virginia,and georgia questions of law and fact that are common to the class predominate over individual questions the terms of the contracts between nursing home residents and the nursing homes the care,services,and supplies to which putative class members were entitled the decrease in the quality of care putative class members actually received the value of the care,services and supplies to which putative class members were entitled the putative class members need for a safe and sanitary environment,personal attendance and custodial care,and access to appropriate health care the pattern of understaffing the nursing homes facts supporting defendants denials and affirmative defenses the law of negligence and fiduciary duty and the proper measure of damages the named plaintiff claims are typical of class members claims thus,for example,the named plaintiff and all putative class members were residents of the nursing homes,entered similar contracts with the nursing homes,paid defendants in exchange for certain care,services and supplies,were owed the same duty of care by defendants,and received the same inadequate treatment and the named plaintiff is committed to prosecuting this action and will adequately represent and protect the interests of the class,as evidenced by her retention of attorneys who are experienced in complex litigation,especially nursing home litigation.
the factual averments bearing on class certification are detailed and extensive.thus,we are satisfied that the underlying complaint alleges facts that fairly and potentially bring the suit within policy coverage,jones,so d at.nothing in florida law even remotely suggests that the potential for coverage created by a class action is qualitatively different from the potential for coverage created by an individual action.florida courts have uniformly said that a suit alleging facts that fairly and potentially bring the suit within policy coverage triggers an insurer duty to defend.that standard is readily met in this case.
hartford,nevertheless,offers two reasons why its duty to defend should remain inchoate unless and until a state court has certified the class first,absent class members simply are not a part of the lawsuit until a class is certified,and therefore no duty can arise to defend against claims by and second,claims by putative class members are too remote and speculative to trigger the duty to defend.we are unpersuaded.
as a doctrinal matter,hartford argument lacks meaningful support in florida law.hartford cites several.civ.a before any claim or defense may be maintained on behalf of a class the court shall first conclude that class certification is appropriate gibson chrysler,cir holding that the value of unnamed class members claims can not satisfy the requirement of lutz protective life ins,d,holding that the claims of unnamed class members can not be used in computing the amount in controversy for the unremarkable proposition that absent class members are not part of a lawsuit until certification.but these authorities are not remotely persuasive here because they concern procedural and jurisdictional matters completely unrelated to florida law and conflict with a florida supreme court case,johnson plantation general,so d,holding that putative class members claims can be aggregated to meet jurisdictional requirements.indeed,hartford cites no authority suggesting that the general rule enunciated in the duty to defend arises when the complaint alleges facts that fairly and potentially bring the suit within policy somehow inapplicable here.the only case we or the parties have located that is directly on point rejected the very argument hartford asserts here,holding instead that allegations of personal injury against putative class members actually triggered an insurer duty to defend,notwithstanding that the class had not yet been certified.see lenscrafters,liberty mut.fire ins,wl.
nor does hartford successfully distinguish lenscrafters by noting that it was decided under california law,which imposes the duty to defend in cases where the complaint might be amended to include a potentially covered claim.the lenscrafters court did not rely on the possibility of amendment to conclude that claims by putative class members could trigger the duty to defend it relied on the fact that the complaint alleged putative class members suffered bodily injury,which was potentially within policy coverage.id.at.
second,hartford would have us ignore this basic truth about class action litigation the fight over class certification is often the whole ball game.indeed,the centrality of certification to the outcome of litigation prompted enactment of federal rule of civil procedure f,which allows for interlocutory appeal of class certification orders.see.f advisory committee notes accompanying amendments observing that a n order denying certification may confront the plaintiff with a situation in which the only sure path to appellate review is by proceeding to final judgment on the merits of an individual claim that,standing alone,is far smaller than the costs of litigation while a n order granting certification may force a defendant to settle rather than incur the costs of defending a class action and run the risk of potentially ruinous liability.the federal courts,too,have frequently acknowledged the high stakes involved in class certification decisions.see,coopers lybrand livesay,d certification of a large class may so increase the defendant potential damages liability and litigation costs that he may find it economically prudent to settle and to abandon a meritorious defense.ex rel.prado bush,cir e ven ordinary class certification decisions by their very nature may radically reshape a lawsuit and significantly alter the calculation of the parties see also in re diet drugs prod.liab,cir orders granting class certification may expose defendants to enormous liability while orders denying certification may effectively eviscerate the plaintiffs ability to recover.in re visa antitrust,cir the effect of certification on parties leverage in settlement negotiations is a fact of life for class action litigants.the overwhelming importance of class certification to the ultimate resolution of the case militates strongly against leaving the insured without a defense until after a decision on class certification.
moreover,hartford has failed to acknowledge that the broad language found in the policy unambiguously says that the right and duty to defend are triggered by the same of a suit alleging covered if there were no duty to defend,there also would be no right to defend thus,the rule hartford advocates would not only deny an insured the defense it contracted for,but also would lock insurers out of the litigation until after the critically important issue of class certification had been decided.although the insurer right to defend is not at issue in this clearly wants hartford to assume the other cases where the insurer faces probable class certification and potentially enormous liability,it would lack the right to defend the suit and protect its interests until after a critically
