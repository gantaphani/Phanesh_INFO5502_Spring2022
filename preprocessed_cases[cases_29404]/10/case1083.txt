as a central part of its business,fedex ground package system,fedex,contracts with drivers to deliver packages to its customers.the drivers must wear fedex uniforms,drive vehicles,and groom themselves according to fedex appearance standards.fedex tells its drivers what packages to deliver,on what days,and at what times.although drivers may operate multiple delivery routes and hire third parties to help perform their work,they may do so only with fedex consent.
fedex contends its drivers are independent contractors under california law.plaintiffs,a class of fedex drivers in california,contend they are employees.we agree with plaintiffs.
background 
factual background 
named plaintiffs represent a class comprising approximately individuals who were delivery drivers for fedex in california between and.plaintiff class members worked for fedex two operating divisions,fedex ground and fedex home delivery.fedex ground deals primarily with deliveries,while fedex home delivery deals primarily with residential deliveries.the differences between the two divisions do not matter to this appeal.
fedex characterizes its drivers as independent contractors.fedex operating agreement oa governs its relationship with the drivers.the oa background statement provides 
t his agreement will set forth the mutual business objectives of the two parties but the manner and means of reaching these results are within the discretion of the driver,and no officer or employee of fedex shall have the authority to impose any term or condition on the driver which is contrary to this understanding.
a provision of the oa titled discretion of contractor to determine method and means of meeting business objectives,states 
n o officer,agent or employee of fedex shall have the authority to direct the driver as to the manner or means employed for example,no officer,agent or employee of fedex shall have the authority to prescribe hours of work,whether or when the driver is to take breaks,what route the driver is to follow,or other details of performance.
fedex relationship with its drivers also is governed by various policies and procedures prescribed by fedex.
job requirements 
the oa requires fedex drivers to pick up and deliver packages within their assigned primary service area s.drivers must deliver packages every day that fedex is open for business,and must deliver every package they are assigned each day.they must deliver each package within a specific window of time negotiated between fedex and its customers.after each delivery,drivers must use an electronic scanner to send data about the delivery to fedex.fedex does not require drivers to follow specific delivery routes.however,fedex tells its managers to design and recommend to its drivers routes that will reduce travel time and minimize expenses and maximize earnings and service.
fedex does not expressly dictate working hours,but it structures drivers workloads to ensure that they work between and hours every working day.if a driver manager determines that the driver has more work than he or she can reasonably be expected to handle in a to hour day,the manager may reassign part of the driver workload to other drivers.drivers are compensated according to a somewhat complex formula that includes perday and components.drivers are expected to arrive at their delivery terminals each morning,and they are not supposed to leave the terminal until all of their packages are available for.fedex instructs managers to make sure that drivers properly fill out their paperwork and prepare their packages for delivery.each terminal sets a time by which all drivers must return at the end of the day.if drivers want their trucks loaded by fedex,they must leave their trucks at the terminal overnight.
the oa gives fedex the authority to reconfigure a driver service area upon five days written notice.drivers have the right to propose a plan to avoid reconfiguration,using means satisfactory to fedex.fedex may,in its sole discretion,reject a plan that does not provide reasonable means to continue the driver service area.should a driver service area be reconfigured in such a way that the driver gains customers,fedex may reduce that driver pay to compensate other drivers who lost customers in the reconfiguration.
fedex trains its drivers on how best to perform their job and to interact with customers.the oa provides that,during the first days of the contract term,fedex shall familiarize drivers with various quality service procedures developed by fedex.the oa requires drivers to conduct themselves with integrity and honesty,in a professional manner,and with proper decorum at all times.they must f oster the professional image and good reputation of fedex.
a driver managers may conduct up to four performance evaluations each year,to verify that the driver is meeting the standards of customer service required by the oa.managers are supposed to observe and record small details about each step of a delivery,including whether a driver uses a dolly or cart to move packages,demonstrates a sense of urgency,and p laces his or her keys on the pinky finger of his or her hand after locking the delivery vehicle.after finishing a evaluation,managers are supposed to give immediate feedback to drivers about the quality of their work.fedex contends in this litigation that this feedback constitutes mere recommendations that drivers are free either to follow or disregard.
drivers must follow fedex safe driving standards.these standards prohibit many illegal acts,such as d riving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs and u sing a motor vehicle in the commission of a felony.they also forbid some legal conduct,including d riving a motor vehicle in a speed exhibition,contest or drag race and c arrying passengers not authorized by fedex.
the oa allows drivers to operate more than one vehicle and route,but only with the consent of fedex and only if consistent with the capacity of the driver terminal.drivers may also hire third parties to help perform their work.helpers must be qualified pursuant to applicable federal,state and municipal safety standards and fedex safe driving standards.they must be fully trained and must conform fully with the oa.drivers in good standing under the oa may assign their rights and obligations to replacement drivers,but any such replacement must be acceptable to fedex.
drivers enter into the oa for an initial term of one,two,or three years.at the end of the initial term,the oa provides for automatic renewal for successive terms if neither party provides notice of their intent not to renew.the oa may be terminated by the parties mutual agreement for cause,including a breach of any provision of the oa if fedex stops doing business or reduces operations in all or part of the driver service area or upon thirty days written notice by the driver.the oa requires drivers to submit claims for wrongful termination to arbitration.
equipment and appearance requirements 
fedex requires its drivers to provide their own vehicles.vehicles must not only meet all applicable federal,state and municipal laws and regulations,but also must be specifically approved by fedex.the oa allows fedex to dictate the identifying colors,logos,numbers,marks and insignia of the vehicles.all vehicles must be painted fedex white,a specific shade of sherwin williams paint,or its equivalent.they must be marked with the fedex logo,and maintained in a clean and presentable fashion free of body damage and extraneous markings.fedex requires vehicles to have specific dimensions,and all vehicles must also contain shelves with specific dimensions.fedex requires that a typical package van have 
two shelves per side,full length of the body.they should be,deep with a to pitch and a front lip not to exceed height.top shelf to bottom of roof or roof bow should be minimum.the lower shelf lip to the bottom of the top shelf should be.aluminum is the preferred material,however marine grade plywood is acceptable.
managers may refuse to let drivers work if their vehicles do not meet these requirements.
drivers must provide maintenance at their own expense and must bear all costs and expenses incidental to operation of the vehicle.drivers authorize fedex to pay for vehicle licensing,taxes,and fees,and to deduct these costs from the drivers pay.the oa gives fedex 
such exclusive possession,use,and control of the vehicle as required by applicable regulations,but fedex shall have no right or authority to operate the vehicle for any purpose except for incidental yard movement and positioning unless the vehicle is driven either by the driver or by an operator engaged by the driver.
the oa requires that while vehicles are in the service of fedex,they must be used exclusively for the carriage of the goods of fedex and for no other purpose.drivers may use their vehicles for other commercial or personal purposes when they are not in the service of fedex,but only if all identifying numbers,marks,logos and insignia are removed or covered up.
fedex offers a business support package,which provides drivers with uniforms,scanners,and other necessary equipment.fedex deducts the cost of the equipment from drivers pay.purchase of the package is ostensibly optional,but more than percent of drivers purchase it.the scanners that drivers must use to send delivery information to fedex are not readily available from any other source.
the oa requires drivers to comply with personalappearance standards and wear a fedex uniform maintained in good condition.the required uniform includes a uniform shirt with the fedex logo,uniform pants or shorts,dark shoes and socks,and,if the driver chooses to wear a jacket or cap,a uniform jacket and cap with the fedex logo.drivers must keep their personal appearance consistent with reasonable standards of good order as promulgated from time to time by fedex.drivers must be clean shaven,hair neat and trimmed,free of body odor.managers may refuse to let drivers work if they are improperly dressed or groomed.
procedural history 
this appeal involves a class action originally filed in the california superior court in december on behalf of a class of california fedex drivers,asserting claims for employment expenses and unpaid wages under the california labor code on the ground that fedex had improperly classified the drivers as independent contractors.plaintiffs also brought claims under the federal family and medical leave act fmla,which similarly turned on the drivers employment status.fedex removed to the northern district of california based on diversity.
between and,similar cases were filed against fedex in approximately forty states.the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation consolidated these fedex cases for multidistrict litigation mdl proceedings in the district court for the northern district of indiana the mdl court.plaintiffs moved for class certification.they represented to the mdl court that their claims would rely only on common proof applicable to members of the class as whole.the mdl court certified a class for plaintiffs claims under california law.it declined to certify plaintiffs proposed national fmla class.
plaintiffs in all the mdl cases moved for partial summary judgment,seeking to establish their status as employees as a matter of law.in most cases,including this one,fedex for summary judgment.the mdl court denied nearly all of the mdl plaintiffs motions for summary judgment and granted nearly all of fedex motions,holding that plaintiffs were independent contractors as a matter of law in each state where employment status is governed by agency principles.
the mdl court remanded this case to the district court to resolve the drivers claims under the fmla.those claims were settled,and the district court entered final judgment.plaintiffs timely appealed,challenging the mdl court grant of summary judgment to fedex on the employment status issue.fedex conditionally,arguing that if we reverse the mdl court grant of summary judgment to fedex,we should also reverse the mdl court class certification decision.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court decision whether to grant summary judgment,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party.fichman media,cir.a grant of summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.albino baca,cir en banc quoting.a.
iii.discussion 
summary judgment on employment status 
the mdl court granted summary judgment to fedex,holding that plaintiffs are independent contractors as a matter of law.to reach that conclusion,the mdl court purported to apply the common law test from borello sons,department of industrial relations,cal,but ultimately focused on the entrepreneurial opportunities fedex afforded to plaintiffs.the mdl court explained the right to control,though a primary consideration,is dispositive what is dispositive here is the drivers ability to own and operate distinct businesses,own multiple routes,and profit accordingly.plaintiffs argue that,at a minimum,summary judgment for fedex was inappropriate.they argue further that the district court should have granted their motion for summary judgment because they are employees as a matter of law.we agree that plaintiffs are employees as a matter of law.accordingly,we reverse the mdl court and remand to the district court with instructions to enter summary judgment for plaintiffs on the question of employment status.
the parties agree that california law controls this dispute.the parties further agree that determinations of employment status under california law are governed by the test set forth in borello.even if one or two of the individual factors might suggest an independent contractor relationship,summary judgment is nevertheless proper when all the factors weighed and considered as a whole establish an employment and not an independent contractor relationship.arnold mut.of omaha ins,d.
we conclude that summary judgment for plaintiffs is appropriate in this case.the facts are largely undisputed.fedex and plaintiffs agree that their working relationship is controlled by the oa and fedex policies and procedures.they dispute only the extent to which those documents give fedex the right to control its drivers.in california,the meaning of a contract such as the oa is a question of law,unless it is ambiguous and there is conflicting extrinsic evidence from which a jury could resolve the ambiguity in favor of either party.scheenstra cal.dairies,d.here,much of the oa is not ambiguous.to the extent it is ambiguous,the extrinsic evidence supports a conclusion that fedex has the right to control its drivers.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to fedex,we conclude that plaintiffs are employees.
right to control test 
california test requires courts to weigh a number of factors the principal test of an employment relationship is whether the person to whom service is rendered has the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result desired.borello,at quoting tieberg unemployment,cal alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.california courts also consider several secondary indicia of the nature of a service relationship.id.the right to terminate at will,without cause,is s trong evidence in support of an employment relationship.id.quoting tieberg,at internal quotation marks omitted.additional factors include 
a whether the one performing services is engaged in a distinct occupation or business b the kind of occupation,with reference to whether,in the locality,the work is usually done under the direction of the principal or by a specialist without supervision c the skill required in the particular occupation d whether the principal or the worker supplies the instrumentalities,tools,and the place of work for the person doing the work e the length of time for which the services are to be performed f the method of payment,whether by the time or by the job g whether or not the work is a part of the regular business of the principal and h whether or not the parties believe they are creating the relationship of employeremployee.
id.these factors g enerally can not be applied mechanically as separate tests they are intertwined and their weight depends often on particular combinations.id.at quoting germann workers comp.appeals,internal quotation marks omitted.
manner and means 
fedex argues that the oa creates an independentcontractor relationship.california law is clear that t he label placed by the parties on their relationship is not dispositive,and subterfuges are not countenanced.id.at.what matters is what the contract,in actual effect,allows or requires.see,empire star mines cal.emp t comm n,cal if the employer has the authority to exercise control,whether or not that right is exercised with respect to all details,an relationship exists,overruled on other grounds by people sims,cal.the oa and fedex policies and procedures unambiguously allow fedex to exercise a great deal of control over the manner in which its drivers do their jobs.therefore,this factor strongly favors plaintiffs.
first,fedex can and does control the appearance of its drivers and their vehicles.fedex controls its drivers clothing from their hats down to their shoes and socks.it requires drivers to be clean shaven,hair neat and trimmed,and free of body odor.fedex detailed appearance requirements clearly constitute control over its drivers.see ruiz affinity logistics,wl,at cir.june,finding right to control under california law where a delivery company controlled every exquisite detail of the drivers appearance,including the color of their socks and the style of their hair huggins fedex ground package,cir holding,under missouri law,that fedex appearance requirements show the extent of fedex control over drivers work.
fedex requires drivers to paint their vehicles a specific shade of white,mark them with the distinctive fedex logo,and to keep their vehicles clean and presentable and free of body damage and extraneous markings.these requirements go well beyond those imposed by federal regulations.see.fedex dictates the vehicles dimensions,including the dimensions of their package shelves and the materials from which the shelves are made.managers may prevent drivers from working if they are improperly dressed or groomed,or if their vehicles do not meet specifications.
second,fedex can and does control the times its drivers can work.although the oa does not allow fedex to set specific working hours down to the last minute,it is clear from the oa that fedex has a great deal of control over drivers hours.fedex structures drivers workloads so that they have to work to hours every working day.fedex argues that,because drivers can hire helpers to do their work for them,they are free to complete a full day work in less than hours.but managers may adjust drivers workloads to ensure that they never have more or less work than can be done in to hours.drivers are not supposed to leave their terminals in the morning until all of their packages are available,and they must return to the terminals no later than a specified time.if drivers want their vehicles loaded,they must leave them at the terminal overnight.the combined effect of these requirements is substantially to define and constrain the hours that fedex drivers can work.
third,fedex can and does control aspects of how and when drivers deliver their packages.it assigns each driver a specific service area,which it may,in its sole discretion,reconfigure.it tells drivers what packages they must deliver and when.it negotiates the delivery window for packages directly with its customers.the oa requires drivers to comply with standards of service,including requirements to f oster the professional image and good reputation of fedex and to conduct all business activities with proper decorum at all times.
fedex notes that there are details of its drivers work that it does not control.for instance,it does not require drivers to follow specific routes or to deliver packages in a specific order.taking the evidence in the light most favorable to fedex,it does not require drivers to follow managers recommendations after evaluations.but the test does not require absolute control.employee status may still be found where a certain amount of freedom is inherent in the work.air couriers int l emp t dev.dep t,d,see also id.at upholding trial court finding that there was no inconsistency between employee status and the driver discretion on when to take breaks or vacation.fedex lack of control over some parts of its drivers jobs does not counteract the extensive control it does exercise.
fedex argues that it controls its drivers only with respect to the results it seeks,not the manner and means in which drivers achieve those results.see millsap fed.express,if control may be exercised only as to the result of the work and not the means by which it is accomplished,an independent contractor relationship is established.we agree with fedex that results,reasonably understood,refers in this context to timely and professional delivery of packages.some but not all of fedex requirements go to the results of its drivers work so understood.most obviously,no reasonable jury could find that the results sought by fedex includes detailed specifications as to the delivery driver fashion choices and grooming.see ruiz,wl,at.and no reasonable jury could find that the results fedex seeks include having all of its vehicles containing shelves built to exactly the same specifications.other aspects of fedex control such as limiting drivers to a specific service area with specific delivery locations also are not merely control of results under california law.
notably,in estrada fedex ground package system,d,the california court of appeal affirmed a trial court determination,following a bench trial,that a class of fedex drivers,working under the same oa as plaintiffs in this case during an overlapping time period,were employees based on fedex control over every exquisite detail of the drivers performance.id.at.fedex attempts to distinguish estrada on two grounds.first,the trial court in estrada specifically excluded drivers from the class,deciding the question of employment status only with respect to drivers,whereas here,while limited to drivers who personally drive full time for fedex,the class includes a number of drivers who operate more than one route.second,fedex contends that estrada involved a fundamentally different evidentiary record.however,the oa grants fedex identical rights to control both and drivers.and while estrada reliance on specific factual findings by the trial court means that estrada is not dispositive here,the estrada court reasoning is nonetheless apposite.
fedex argues that the oa gives drivers flexibility and entrepreneurial opportunities that no employee has.however,in borello,the california supreme court reasoned that a business entity may not avoid its statutory obligations by carving up its production process into minute steps,then asserting that it lacks control over the exact means by which one such step is performed by the responsible workers.at.there,borello sons,a commercial produce grower,hired agricultural laborers under written sharefarmer agreements.the agreements recited that the parties deemed themselves principal and independent contractor rather than employer and employee.id.at.
the sharefarmers agreed to harvest the crop,assisted by members of their families.they could contract for the amount of land they wish ed to harvest on a,firstserved basis.id.at.the sharefarmers were totally responsible for the care of the plants in their assigned plots during the harvest period.id.internal quotation marks omitted.they were required to furnish their own tools and their own transportation to and from the field.the method and manner of accomplishing the harvest was left solely to the sharefarmers,though they agreed to utilize accepted agricultural practices in order to provide for the maximum harvest.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the sharefarmers set their own hours.they were free to decide when to pick the crop in order to maximize the profit.profit incentive was the only guaranty of performance and quality control.id.borello had no right to discharge a sharefarmer or his workers during the harvest,and no recourse if the harvesters abandon ed the field.id.although the sharefarmers had significant autonomy over the harvest itself,the california supreme court reasoned that borello retained all necessary control over the harvest portion of its operations,and held that the sharefarmers were employees as a matter of law.id.at,emphasis in original.
california courts have since applied borello all necessary control test and found employee status in several cases involving delivery drivers.for example,in jkh enterprises,department of industrial relations,d,drivers,who had acknowledged their independent contractor status in writing prior to their engagement with jkh,performed courier work,using their own vehicles to pick up items from jkh customers and delivering the packages to designated locations.
other than to satisfy the general assurances given by jkh to its customers that their packages w ould reach the appropriate local destination within two to four hours from,the drivers were not governed by particular rules and they d id not receive direction from jkh about how to perform the delivery task or what driving routes to take.
id.at.the california court of appeal found that,because jkh retained all necessary control over the drivers,substantial evidence supported a finding of an employee relationship.id.at.similarly,in air couriers,the court of appeal affirmed a trial court finding of employee status based on its conclusion that an employer retained all necessary control over courier drivers.d at.
fedex argues that jkh enterprises and air couriers are distinguishable on the ground that those cases involved california workers compensation laws and thus involved a statutory presumption of employee status that does not apply here.but california courts have recognized that the burden of proof is on the party attacking the employment relationship,bemis people,in a range of cases outside of the workers compensation context.see,robinson george,cal faigin signature grp.holdings,d,lujan minagar,d,see also narayan egl,cir holding that once drivers had established a prima facie case of employment status by coming forward with evidence that they provided services for the company,the burden shifted to the company to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the drivers were independent contractors.
the borello court noted that the test for determining employee status must be applied with deference to the purposes of the protective legislation.at.but the california supreme court does not read borello to apply only in the context of workers compensation claims.in fact,in borello itself,the court stated that its ruling in that case had implications beyond workers compensation laws.id.at.recently,in ayala antelope valley newspapers,cal,the california supreme court recognized the applicability of borello all necessary control test in a determination of employment status in a suit for wage and hour protections.id.at.and in ruiz,we applied borello all necessary control test where a plaintiff raised a number of claims unrelated to workers compensation,including claims for failure to pay sick leave,vacation,holiday,and severance wages.wl,at.
in contrast to the facts in jkh enterprises and air couriers,in arnold an insurance company nonexclusive insurance agent used her own judgment in determining whom she would solicit for applications for the company products,the time,place,and manner in which she would solicit,and the amount of time she spent soliciting for the company products.d at the california court of appeal held on these facts that the agent was an independent contractor.id.at.similarly,the california court of appeal held in state compensation insurance fund brown,d,that truck drivers were independent contractors where they had complete control over their working conditions and the manner in which a load is transported including whether or not to hire assistants,and were entirely free to accept or reject an assignment without reprisal.id.at see also millsap.at holding that a driver was an independent contractor where he used his own car to deliver packages,was paid on a per route basis,and o ther than to say be careful or to give him directions to a particular location,the company did not instruct the driver as to how to make the deliveries or how to drive his car.
fedex treats its drivers more like the drivers in jkh enterprises and air couriers than like the insurance agent in arnold and the drivers in brown and millsap.indeed,in many respects fedex exercises greater control over its drivers than was exercised over the drivers in jkh enterprises and air couriers.fedex requires its drivers to load and unload packages at fedex terminals every working day.such regular schedules are consistent with employee status and reflect employer control.air couriers,d at.fedex assigns each driver a specified service area and tells drivers where in their service area to deliver packages.fedex drivers have no control over which packages they deliver.fedex obtain s the clients in need of the service and provid es the workers to conduct it,jkh,d at.drivers deliver packages to fedex customers,not to their own customers.fedex set s the rates charged to customers,bill s the customers,and collect s payment.air couriers,d at see also toyota motor sales,superior ct,finding a driver to be an employee where the company determined what would be delivered,when and to whom and what price would be charged.fedex pays the drivers on a regular schedule.see air couriers,d at jkh,d at.
according to fedex,its drivers entrepreneurial opportunities the ability to take on multiple routes and vehicles and to hire helpers are inconsistent with employee status.fedex relies not on california law for this argument,but on the circuit decision in fedex home delivery national labor relations board.in fedex home delivery,a divided panel of the circuit reversed an agency decision that fedex drivers were employees.id.at.the majority shift ed the emphasis away from the unwieldy control inquiry,asking instead whether the putative independent contractors have significant entrepreneurial opportunity for gain or loss.id.at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.it held that the evidence favoring a finding the drivers are employees was clearly outweighed by evidence of entrepreneurial opportunity.id.at.
the circuit decision in fedex home delivery,even if correct,has no bearing on this case.there is no indication that california has replaced its longstanding test with the new test developed by the circuit.instead,california cases indicate that entrepreneurial opportunities do not undermine a finding of employee status.in arzate bridge terminal transport,d,the california court of appeal reversed a trial court grant of summary judgment to the defendant where,as here,the plaintiffs drove their own trucks and paid the related expenses,and could have leased more than one truck to defendant and hired other drivers.id.at.the court found that these opportunities did not override other factors in california analysis such that the drivers were independent contractors as a matter of law.id.in narayan,we concluded that,where drivers retained the right to employ others to assist in performing their contractual obligations,but the company had to approve all helpers,this was indicative of control of the details of the drivers performance under california law.at.and in ruiz,we found that drivers were employees where the company retained ultimate discretion to approve or disapprove of those helpers and additional drivers.wl,at.a pproval was largely based upon neutral factors,such as background checks required under federal regulations,but the drivers nonetheless did not have an unrestricted right to choose these persons,which is an important right that would normally inure to a contractor.id.alterations in original quoting borello,at.further,any additional drivers were subject to the same degree of control exerted by affinity over the drivers generally.id.
the entrepreneurial opportunities available to fedex drivers are equivalent to those in narayan and ruiz.the oa allows drivers to operate more than one vehicle or route only if fedex consents,and only if doing so is consistent with the capacity of th
