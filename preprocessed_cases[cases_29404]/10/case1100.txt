the district court dismissed eldee k rental properties,llc complaint against directv,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.because the district court correctly determined that eldee k action was a local action under california law,and therefore had to be brought in connecticut where the real property at issue is located,we affirm the district court dismissal of this action.
eldee k rental properties,llc,is a limited liability company organized under the laws of connecticut.it owns a residential apartment building in hartford,connecticut.
in may,eldee k filed a complaint against directv,a direct broadcast satellite television provider,alleging that directv has a policy of installing satellite reception equipment in common areas of apartment buildings and other multiple dwelling units such as the building exterior walls or rooftop without the landlord consent.according to the complaint,directv requires prospective subscribers who reside in multiple dwelling units to complete an installation form authorizing the installation of equipment in common areas.a tenant can either complete part of the form by obtaining the landlord signature,or part of the form by certifying that the landlord has verbally authorized the installation or that the lease does not require landlord consent the complaint alleges that directv permanently installed equipment at eldee k apartment building,including by drilling holes in the exterior of the building,without obtaining eldee k consent.beyond alleging that directv drilled holes in the building exterior,the complaint did not identify the specific common areas on its property where the installation took place.
based on these allegations,eldee k sought to certify a class of all landlords who own and lease residential multiple dwelling units in the united states on which directv installed equipment based on part of its installation form.eldee k brought three causes of action against directv.first,eldee k alleged that directv violated california unfair competition law ucl,cal.bus,which makes a person who engages in unfair competition subject to an injunction and other civil penalties.the complaint alleged that directv use of part of the installation form was an unfair business act that violated the policies embodied in california penal code m,which makes e ntering and occupying real property or structures of any kind without the consent of the owner a misdemeanor criminal offense.through this claim,eldee k sought to enjoin directv from using part of the installation form.
eldee k second and third causes of action were for negligence.eldee k alleged that directv negligently breached a legal duty not to install its equipment in common areas of apartment buildings owned by the putative class without the landlord consent.eldee k sought declaratory and injunctive relief in count ii to prohibit directv use of its part policy.in its third count,eldee k sought damages for the conduct.
directv moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over eldee k claims under the local action doctrine,which vests exclusive jurisdiction over specified types of actions involving real property in the forum where that property is located.directv argued that eldee k claims are local in nature,and therefore must be brought in connecticut,the state where the property is located.
the district court agreed.it read eldee k complaint to focus on directv unauthorized entry onto property pursuant to part of the installation form.because the key harm in the complaint related to trespass on real property situated in connecticut,the district court held that the local action doctrine deprived it of jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim.the district court therefore dismissed it with prejudice under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.eldee k timely appealed.
we have jurisdiction to review eldee k appeal under.we review de novo district court dismissals of actions based on rule b.viewtech,united states,cir.
to determine whether the district court correctly applied the local action doctrine in this context,it is helpful to review the history and current status of this longstanding rule.
the local action doctrine has an ancient heritage.according to legal historians,the distinction between local and transitory actions began to arise in england during the and centuries.see william wicker,the development of the distinction between local and transitory actions.before the century,jurors relied on their personal knowledge of a dispute to decide cases.witnesses,as we use them today,played no role in court.see id.at livingston jefferson,fed.cas,op.of marshall.for this reason,a plaintiff had to plead the location of the dispute,and at least some members of every jury had to be drawn from that location.see wicker,supra,at.after witnesses began to testify during the century,courts started to relax the rules requiring jurors to come from the vicinity of the dispute.see id.at.
the old rules were maintained,however,for actions directly operating on real estate or personal actions closely connected with real property,and courts still required plaintiffs to plead and prove the location where these causes of action arose.see id.at.such actions were referred to as local actions and were required to be brought in the county where the real estate was located,while actions for which the plaintiff did not need to identify the location of the dispute were called transitory actions and could be brought in any county in england.see id.at.by the late century,leading jurists had observed that these distinctions were outmoded,see,mostyn fabrigas,cowp,op.of lord mansfield quoted in wicker,supra,at,but they nevertheless persisted as part of english common law.
the distinction between local and transitory actions was recognized as part of american common law in the leading case of livingston jefferson.in this case,chief justice john marshall,sitting as a circuit judge in virginia,held that a federal court in virginia lacked subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate an action against former president thomas jefferson to recover damages for trespass on real estate in louisiana.see fed.cas.at.although chief justice marshall expressed skepticism about the value of the local action doctrine,see id.at,he acknowledged that american law had incorporated the ancient rules of english common law,including the rule that actions are deemed transitory,where transactions on which they are founded,might have taken place anywhere but are local where their cause is in its nature necessarily local,id.at.
the supreme court subsequently confirmed that federal law incorporates the local action doctrine.as the court explained,t he distinction between local and transitory actions is as old as actions themselves,and no one has ever supposed that laws which prescribed generally where one should be sued,included such suits as were local in their character,either by statute or the common law,unless it was expressly so declared.casey adams.accordingly,the court interpreted a federal statute allowing a national bank to be sued in any jurisdiction where the bank is located as pertaining to transitory actions only,because actions that are local in character must be brought where the thing on which they are founded is situated.id.in a subsequent opinion,the supreme court confirmed that a federal court lacked jurisdiction over a local action involving real property situated in a different state.see ellenwood marietta chair co.in ellenwood,the court considered an action brought in a federal circuit court in the southern district of ohio against an ohio corporation for trespass on land situated in west virginia.id.at.the court sua sponte dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction,because an action for trespass upon land,like an action to recover the title or the possession of the land itself,is a local action,and can only be brought within the state in which the land lies.id.at.because the entire cause of action was local,the court concluded that the federal court had no jurisdiction of the cause of action,and for this reason,if for no other,rightly ordered the case to be stricken from its docket,although no question of jurisdiction had been made by demurrer or plea.id.at.
the supreme court has sometimes applied this doctrine narrowly.in stone united states,for instance,the court held that,where the gravamen of an action is conversion of lumber and the complaint demanded the value of the personal property taken,rather than stating a claim for trespass that sought damages for the harm to the land caused by the trespass,as in ellenwood,then the action was transitory and the local action doctrine was not applicable.but the supreme court has not overruled the doctrine,and has referenced it in cases decided after ellenwood.see,philadelphia stimson,holding that a district of columbia court had jurisdiction over a dispute regarding the federal government statutory authority to encroach on the plaintiff property in pennsylvania because,among other reasons,the action was not to restrain trespass as in ellenwood dull blackman,noting that a dispute was a local action and had to be litigated in the state where the land was situated,though a dispute that did not operate directly upon the lands could be brought in a different state.
we have also recognized the continued applicability of the local action doctrine in determining the jurisdiction of federal courts.see,united states byrne,cir observing that the federal district courts jurisdiction over actions concerning real property is generally coterminous with the states political boundaries,and holding that the court jurisdiction in that case was properly exercised in the state where the land is situated because the action was local josevig kennecott copper james howarth,cir discussing whether the action was local or transitory,and acknowledging that the district court had jurisdiction over the action unless the suit was local in nature columbia river packers ass mcgowan,cir holding that a district court in washington lacked jurisdiction to enjoin a trespass and abate a nuisance where the injury and conduct occurred in oregon.
to the extent they have reached the issue,other circuit courts generally agree that the local action doctrine is jurisdictional in nature,and not merely a rule of venue that can be waived.see bigio coca cola,cir assuming the local action doctrine is jurisdictional hayes gulf oil,cir recognizing that federal and state courts lack jurisdiction over the subject matter of claims to land located outside the state in which the court sits see also charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure noting that a majority of federal courts have concluded that the local action doctrine is a rule of subject matter jurisdiction.those circuit courts that have discussed the local action doctrine as a matter of venue have not directly resolved the question whether the doctrine also constrains the jurisdiction of federal courts.see raphael musicus,safeway stores,cir applying the local action doctrine as a matter of venue without directly addressing jurisdictional issues.because the supreme court has indicated a marked desire to curtail federal courts jurisdictional rulings,reed elsevier.muchnick,internal quotation marks omitted,we do not read these decisions as providing guidance as to whether the local action doctrine is jurisdictional in nature.
our conclusion that the local action doctrine is jurisdictional is not free from doubt.the supreme court has recently clarified that rules are not jurisdictional because o nly congress may determine a lower federal court jurisdiction.bowles russell,quoting kontrick ryan,internal quotation marks omitted.but congress has not directly spoken on whether federal courts jurisdiction is constrained by the local action doctrine,even though it historically acknowledged the existence of such a jurisdictional limitation.see act of may,ch,stat,providing,with respect to the service of process,that in all cases of a local nature at law or in equity where the land or other of a fixed character lies partly in one district and partly in another district,within the same state,the plaintiff may bring his action or suit in the circuit or district court of either district,and the court shall have jurisdiction to hear and decide the same as fully as if the land or other were wholly within the district for which such court is constituted.
eldee k points out that congress has recently amended the federal venue statutes to eliminate use of the local action doctrine in venue decisions.see a except as otherwise provided by law the proper venue for a civil action shall be determined without regard to whether the action is local or transitory in nature.while a is not directly applicable here because eldee k action was filed before its effective date of january,stat,eldee k argues that if congress has concluded that the local action doctrine does not affect a federal court venue,a fortiori the doctrine should not affect a federal court jurisdiction.although such an inference is reasonable,inference alone is insufficient to overrule supreme court precedent.venue and subject matter jurisdiction are distinct concepts,and congress rejection of the local action doctrine in the venue context does not overrule the supreme court prior determination that the local action doctrine is jurisdictional.we are bound by ellenwood until either the supreme court rules otherwise,agostini felton,or congress enacts an applicable jurisdictional statute.
because california law governs whether this action is local or transitory in nature,see huntington attrill,we now review california law on this issue.
like most states,california adopted the common law distinction between local and transitory actions.see ophir silver mining,cal,we could not without disregarding the law which we have made for ourselves,as well as the long course of decisions in england and the united states,hold that an action for damages to realty situated in the state of nevada can be maintained in the courts of california.indeed,from,during the earliest days of its statehood,california limited its courts to hearing local actions that arose in the county in which the subject of the action or some part thereof,is situated,subject to the power of the court to change the place of trial.henry labatt,the california practice act,ed.providing the text of section of an act to regulate proceedings in civil cases in the courts of justice in this state,commonly known as the practice act,which passed on april.about years later,california enshrined the local action doctrine in its state constitution,requiring that all actions for recovery of the possession of,quieting the title to,or for the enforcement of liens upon real estate,shall be commenced in the county in which the real estate,or any part thereof,affected by such action or actions is situated.cal.const.art.vi.california has retained a version of section of the practice act to this day,see although it repealed the constitutional provision in.
california courts drew on common law concepts to determine which sorts of actions were local in nature for purposes of implementing these provisions.see,samuel allen,cal,relying on common law principles that an action for damages from breach of a mortgage contract is an action for money due,and is not therefore a local action le breton,cal,adopting the common law principle that an action against a trustee to enforce a trust on real property is not local.
under california law,there are three broad categories of local actions actions to recover or determine rights or interests in real property actions to remedy injuries to real property and actions to foreclose on liens and mortgages on real property.see a see also grocers fruit growing union kern cnty.land,cal,concluding that an action for the specific performance of a contract to convey land was an action for the determination of a right or interest in real property and thus local ophir,cal.at holding that an action to enjoin injuries to real property through trespasses was local.all other actions are transitory.see golden cross mining milling spiers,cal.
