directv,moved to dismiss or stay this class action litigation and to compel arbitration.the superior court denied the motion.directv argues that the motion should have been granted under the united states supreme court decision in at t mobility llc concepcion.concepcion.we conclude that under the terms of the parties arbitration agreement,the motion was correctly denied.we therefore affirm.
background 
on september,amy imburgia filed a class action complaint against directv,alleging claims for unjust enrichment,declaratory relief,false advertising,and violation of the consumer legal remedies act clra,et,the unfair competition law ucl bus,et,and civil code section,subdivision d.imburgia claims were based on allegations that directv has improperly charged early termination fees to its customers.kathy greiner filed a similar class action complaint one day after imburgia,and imburgia and greiner hereafter plaintiffs jointly filed a first amended complaint on march.plaintiffs lawsuit proceeded at the same time as a multidistrict litigation proceeding in federal court involving similar claims.directv moved to stay plaintiffs state court action pending the outcome of the multidistrict litigation,but the superior court denied the motion.
plaintiffs subsequently moved for class certification.on april,the superior court granted the motion in part and denied it in part,certifying a class as to one of plaintiffs theories but denying certification as to others.
on april,the united states supreme court decided concepcion,which held that the federal arbitration act faa et preempts the rule of discover bank superior court cal th discover bank.discover bank held that under certain circumstances,class action waivers in consumer contracts are unconscionable and hence unenforceable.id.at.
on may,less than one month after the court decided concepcion,directv moved to stay or dismiss plaintiffs action,decertify the class,and compel arbitration of plaintiffs claims.directv explained that it had not moved to compel arbitration earlier because,in an unrelated case several years before plaintiffs filed this litigation,the court of appeal had held that the arbitration provision in directv customer agreement was unenforceable under discover bank.see cohen directv,th.until concepcion held that the faa preempts the rule of discover bank,directv consequently believed that a motion to compel arbitration would be futile.
the relevant arbitration provision is contained in section of directv customer agreement.section provides that any legal or equitable claim relating to this agreement,any addendum,or your service will first be addressed through an informal process and,if the claim is not resolved informally,then any claim either of us asserts will be resolved only by binding arbitration under jams rules.under the heading special rules,section of the agreement provides as follows neither you nor we shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims in arbitration by or against other individuals or entities,or arbitrate any claim as a representative member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity.accordingly,you and we agree that the jams class action procedures do not apply to our arbitration.if,however,the law of your state would find this agreement to dispense with class arbitration procedures unenforceable,then this entire section is unenforceable.
section of the customer agreement contains provisions addressing several miscellaneous matters,including the following provision concerning applicable law the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement shall be governed by the rules and regulations of the federal communications commission,other applicable federal laws,and the laws of the state and local area where service is provided to you.this agreement is subject to modification if required by such laws.notwithstanding the foregoing,section shall be governed by the federal arbitration act.
plaintiffs opposed the motion to compel arbitration on numerous grounds.the superior court denied the motion,and directv timely appealed.
standard of review 
on appeal from the denial of a motion to compel arbitration,we review the arbitration agreement de novo to determine whether it is legally enforceable,applying general principles of california contract law.citations.kleveland chicago title ins.th.baker osborne development th.we review the superior court ruling,not its reasoning,and we consequently may affirm on the basis of any valid legal theory,regardless of whether the superior court relied on it.see,perlin fountain view management,th.
discussion 
in addition to stating that the parties waive their rights to bring class claims,section of the customer agreement states that if the law of your state would find this agreement to dispense with class arbitration procedures unenforceable,then this entire section is unenforceable.plaintiffs argue that the law of california would find the class action waiver unenforceable because,for example,the clra expressly precludes waiver of the right to bring a class action under the clra,subd.a.plaintiffs conclude that the parties entire arbitration agreement is unenforceable,pursuant to the agreement express terms,because the law of plaintiffs state would find the class action waiver unenforceable.we agree.
as all parties point out,the faa requires courts to enforce privately negotiated agreements to arbitrate,like other contracts,in accordance with their terms.volt info.sciences leland stanford,volt.the faa broad policy of enforcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms applies even to agreements to arbitrate under different rules than those set forth in the faa itself.id.at.thus,if parties have agreed to abide by state rules of arbitration,enforcing those rules according to the terms of the agreement is fully consistent with the goals of the faa,even if application of the state rules would yield a different result from application of the faa.see also cable connection,directv,cal th,cable connection best interiors,millie severson,th,even if the faa applies because the contract affects interstate commerce the parties may agree that california law governs their agreement to arbitrate.consequently,although it is impossible for parties to opt out of faa coverage in its entirety because it is the faa itself that authorizes parties to choose different rules in the first place,it is in other respects permissible for the parties to opt out of the faa default rules.ario v.the underwriting members of syndicate at lloyds for the year of account cir,ario.in particular,a choice of law provision in an arbitration agreement is,in general,enforceable to the same extent as a choice of law provision in any other contract.see generally nedlloyd lines superior court cal th,articulating the standard for enforcement of contractual choice of law provisions under california law.we have previously held that the parties to a contract may choose the law under which the enforceability of a class action waiver is to be determined.discover bank superior court th.
under the foregoing principles,if section of directv customer agreement had said that the enforceability of the class action waiver shall be determined under the law of your state to the extent that it is not preempted by the faa,then that provision would have been enforceable.likewise,if section had said that the enforceability of the class action waiver shall be determined under the law of your state without considering the preemptive effect,if any,of the faa,then that provision would have been enforceable as well.no party argues to the contrary 
section of the customer agreement is not,however,as explicit as either of those hypothetical examples.the question before us,then,is how to interpret section choice of law concerning enforceability of the class action waiver.where section requires us to consider whether the law of your state would find this agreement to dispense with class arbitration procedures unenforceable,does it mean the law of your state to the extent it is not preempted by the faa,or the law of your state without considering the preemptive effect,if any,of the faa pl
