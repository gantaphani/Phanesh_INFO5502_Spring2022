opinion of the court 
this case involves a putative conflict between an.b damages class action based on state statutory wage and overtime laws that parallel the federal fair labor standards act flsa and a separately filed collective action under b of the flsa.both suits allege violations arising from the same conduct or occurrence by the same defendant.at issue is whether federal jurisdiction over the rule class action based solely on diversity under the class action fairness act cafa,u.d,is inherently incompatible with jurisdiction over the flsa action,and whether the flsa preempts state laws that parallel its protections.
plaintiff james fisher and former plaintiff robert were assistant store managers at rite aid stores in maryland and ohio respectively.in june,both joined a nationwide action under b of the flsa in the middle district of pennsylvania.craig rite aid,et,cv jej.the suit sought back pay for alleged misclassification of assistant managers as under of the flsa.

plaintiffs appealed.both actions share the same legal issue and present no meaningful factual differences.we discuss them together 
b provides a private right of action to recover for violations of the flsa,including a suit by one or more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated.in,congress amended this provision to require that a plaintiff in a flsa suit give his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.portal to portal act of,ch,a,stat,codified at b.because the purpose of this amendment and its implications for federal class actions based on state law are in dispute,we consider its history in detail.
congress enacted the flsa in.fair labor standards act of,ch,stat.codified at.the law sought to protect workers,particularly workers,by establishing federal minimum wage,maximum hour,and overtime guarantees that could not be avoided through contract.symczyk genesis healthcare,cir quoting brooklyn sav.bank.as originally enacted,the law provided for enforcement by the secretary of labor or through private actions that could be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction by any one or more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated,or such employee or employees may designate an agent or representative to maintain such action for and in behalf of all employees similarly situated.flsa,b,stat.at.
from to,the supreme court decided three cases determining that travel time constituted work within the meaning of the flsa and therefore contributed to the maximum working hours for the calculation of overtime.coal,iron,muscoda local,jewell ridge coal local,united mine workers of,anderson clemens pottery.while the first two cases were limited to underground mining,the third extended the concept of pay to a large factory,determining that the time necessarily spent by the employees in walking to work on the employer premises was working time within the scope of the flsa.anderson,at.
workers responded to the clemens decision by initiating thousands of b flsa suits seeking back pay for violations nearly all the suits filed under b were brought by unions these suits were representative in the sense that,as authorized by the statute,they were initiated by union officials as representatives of the employees,the real parties in interest.but despite the broad language allowing suits on behalf of those similarly situated,these were not class actions analogous to suits under modern rule,which did not exist at the time instead,case law on b held that plaintiffs must affirmatively join in a representative action to recover,analogizing such suits to spurious class actions available under rule a at the time those filing suits shared this understanding.see hearings at statement of cio counsel lee pressman testifying that in his view,a suit under the law,if you recover,the judgment runs only to the extent that there are individual plaintiffs that is,individual men who signed authorization cards see also marc linder,class struggle at the door the origins of the portal to portal act of,buff.but one court suggested that the flsa might permit plaintiffs to join after judgment had been reached a procedure that later became termed intervention,where plaintiffs could sit out an action,choosing to opt in and be bound by the judgment only after a favorable outcome pentland dravo,cir.
congress responded to the clemens decision and the flood of lawsuits by enacting the portal to portal act of,ch,stat.the law sought to staunch the proliferation of suits and remedy what congress perceived to be wholly unexpected liabilities,immense in amount and retroactive in operation by statutorily reversing judicial interpretations of the flsa.id.in an effort to address the threat of excessive and needless litigation and champertous practices,section of the law banned what it termed representative actions.it amended b to read 
action to recover such liability may be maintained in any court of competent jurisdiction by any one or more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated.no employee shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.
id.a codified at b.as the supreme court later characterized this modification,in part responding to excessive litigation spawned by plaintiffs lacking a personal interest in the outcome,the representative action by plaintiffs not themselves possessing claims was abolished,and the requirement that an employee file a written consent was added.hoffman la roche,sperling.
the sperling court cited legislative history that further illuminates the meaning of the provision.senator donnell,chairman of the drafting subcommittee,offered an exposition of a and its purported remedy of the deficiencies of b during senate debates.cong.rec.he observed that b had allowed two types of actions.first,a suit by one or more employees,for himself and all other employees similarly situated.that i shall call for the purpose of identification a collective action,a suit brought by one collectively for himself and others in this case an employee can sue for himself and other employees.we have no objection to that.id.what senator donnell objected to was the second class of actions,which he deemed a representative action,as distinguished from a collective action.id.in these cases,an agent or representative who may not be an employee of the company at all can be designated by the employee or employees to maintain an action on behalf of all employees similarly situated.id.he characterized this class of cases as those in which an outsider,perhaps someone who is desirous of stirring up litigation without being an employee at all,is permitted to be the plaintiff in the case.id.senator donnell went on to explain the purpose of the requirement that each employee give his consent in writing to become a plaintiff.this,he argued,was a 
wholesome provision,for it is certainly unwholesome to allow an individual to come into court alleging that he is suing on behalf of persons and actually not have a solitary person behind him,and then later on have men join in the suit,which was not brought in good faith,was not brought by a party in interest,and was not brought with the actual consent or agency of the individuals for whom an ostensible plaintiff filed the suit.
these statements,taken together with the historical context,elucidate the congressional purpose behind b.first,the primary concern of congress was representative actions as senator donnell defined them,and of the sort that had dominated the litigation that is,instances where union leaders allegedly stirred up litigation without a personal stake in the case.as a contemporary commentator stated,the banning of representative actions for unpaid wages is an obvious device to prevent the maintenance of employee suits by labor unions.note,fair labor standards under the portal to portal act,chi.
second,congress intended the requirement of written consent to bar plaintiffs from joining a collective action well after it had begun,particularly when the original statute of limitations had run and when those opting in would not be bound by an adverse decision.these requirements abrogated the pentland decision and foreclosed the possibility of intervention in flsa actions.see fair labor standards under the portal to portal act,supra,at.
in sum,the enforcement scheme in the portal to portal act largely codified the existing rules governing spurious class actions,with special provisions intended to redress the problem of representative actions brought by unions under earlier provisions of the flsa and the problem of intervention.absent from the debates was any mention of class actions an unsurprising fact,since the flsa had not been interpreted to permit such suits.the flsa did not become relevant to class actions until after the revision of rule and the creation of modern rule b in.during that process,the advisory committee on civil rules disclaimed any intention for the new rule to affect b.advisory committee note,reprinted in.the effect of this grandfathering was to convert what had been an affirmative grant beyond the limited provisions of rule into a limitation upon the affirmative permission for representative actions that already exists in rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.that is to say,were it not for this provision of b the representative action could be brought even without the prior consent of similarly situated employees.sperling,at scalia,dissenting emphasis removed.

b provides 
an action to recover the liability prescribed in either of the preceding sentences for failure to pay statutorily required overtime or wages under the flsa may be maintained against any employer including a public agency in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction by any one or more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated.no employee shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.
courts have concluded that the plain language of this provision bars class actions to enforce the provisions of the flsa under the principle that,where congress has provided a detailed remedy,other remedies are unavailable.see,kendall city of chesapeake,cir lusardi lechner,cir lervill inflight motion pictures.this limitation applies to other federal laws that incorporate the flsa enforcement mechanism,primarily the age discrimination in employment act,b.lachapelle owens illinois,cir.
the concept of inherent incompatibility seeks to extend this logic to state claims.it arose in the context of flsa and state law class actions where the federal court was asked to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims that paralleled the claims under the flsa.some district courts have reasoned that the contrast between an and procedure bars the federal courts from hearing such hybrid or combined actions.see,ellis edward jones,d otto pocono health,d,moeck gray supply,wl,in this case,the district court applied this reasoning to an independent class action based on state law claims brought under federal diversity jurisdiction.
the concept of inherent incompatibility has not fared well at the appellate level.four courts of appeals have rejected its application to flsa and class actions.shahriar smith wollensky rest,cir w e agree with the seventh circuit that the conflict between the procedure under the flsa and the procedure under rule is not a proper reason to decline jurisdiction.ervin os rest,cir there is ample evidence that a combined action is consistent with the regime congress has established in the flsa.wang chinese daily news,cir,vacated on other grounds.we follow lindsay in concluding that it was within the district court discretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claim in this case.lindsay gov t emps.ins,while there is unquestionably a difference between and procedures,we doubt that a mere procedural difference can curtail section jurisdictional sweep.
the most thorough examination of the issue appears in ervin there,the seventh circuit rejected the lower court conclusion that the action should be dismissed because of inherent incompatibility,suggesting that the district court had jumped too quickly to congressional intent.ervin,at.examining the text of b,the court found nothing that suggests that the flsa is not amenable to claims for related relief in the same federal proceeding,especially since the flsa contains an express savings clause.id.nor did the congressional purpose contradict this conclusion,since the portal to portal act was designed to eliminate lawsuits by third parties typically union leaders on behalf of a disinterested employee in other words,someone who would not otherwise have participated in the federal lawsuit.id.at.an employee who does not opt in to the federal class would receive only the relief that is prescribed under the law governing her part of the case,which would simply represent the adjudication of state law claims implicit in the concept of supplemental jurisdiction.id.
we agree that the plain text of b provides no support for the concept of inherent incompatibility.the provision specifically applies only to actions for violations of the provisions of section or section of this title for unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation,as well as claims for injunctive relief for retaliation in violation of a.u.b.moreover,while the law requires each plaintiff to opt in to a suit in writing,by its plain terms this requirement extends only to any such action namely,suits brought under b.neither b nor any other flsa provision addresses causes of action for relief under state employment law.the references to state law in the flsa manifest only congressional intent not to preempt state standards.r,a,b.
in the absence of a clear textual mandate,those courts endorsing the concept of inherent incompatibility have reasoned from congressional intent.the district court here stated 
it is clear that congress labored to create an scheme when it created section b specifically to alleviate the fear that absent individuals would not have their rights litigated without their input or knowledge.to allow a section b action to proceed accompanied by a rule state law class action claim would essentially nullify congress intent in crafting section b and eviscerate the purpose of section b requirement.
fisher,d at alteration in original quoting otto,d at knepper,d at.a similar discussion appeared in ellis,which involved a rule action based in part on the omfwsa filed alongside an flsa suit.in determining that the two suits were inherently incompatible,the court examined the h istory and policy of flsa actions and rule actions in detail,stressing b purpose of limiting private flsa plaintiffs to employees who asserted claims in their own right and freeing employers of the burden of representative actions.ellis,d at quoting sperling,at.in support,it cited senator donnell statement,discussed at length above,objecting to suits brought without the actual consent or agency of the individuals for whom an ostensible plaintiff filed the suit.id.quoting cong.rec.emphasis removed.
as an initial matter,we question the implementation of perceived congressional intent absent any clear textual or doctrinal basis.t he authoritative statement is the statutory text,not the legislative history extrinsic materials have a role in statutory interpretation only to the extent they shed a reliable light on the enacting legislature understanding of otherwise ambiguous terms.exxon mobil allapattah,see also fogleman mercy,cir noting that,in the event of a conflict between a statute plain meaning and its general policy objectives,the conflict should be resolved in favor of the statute plain meaning.as discussed,we do not find b ambiguous it explicitly limits its scope to the provisions of the flsa,and does not address relief.because reliance on the remarks of legislators not to supplement,but to supplant the duly enacted statutory text circumvent s the article i process,exxon mobil,at,we do not need to go beyond the plain text in interpreting b.
but even if we regarded b as ambiguous if we entertained the possibility that the phrase any such action encompasses actions based on claims that paralleled the protections provided by the we are unconvinced by rite aid view of the legislative purpose of the portal to portal act.there was some concern that plaintiffs could be bound by a decision in a case where they had neither input n or knowledge.but the full legislative record casts doubt on the contention that b was intended to eliminat e representative,actions.fisher,d at knepper,d at.the historical evidence establishes that congress created the scheme primarily as a check against the power of unions,whose representatives had allegedly manufactured litigation in which they had no personal stake,and as a bar against intervention by plaintiffs who would not be bound by an adverse judgment.neither purpose speaks to the propriety of an class action,especially since modern rule actions did not exist at the time and had not occurred under the earlier flsa enforcement scheme accordingly,we disagree that certifying an class based on state employment law contravenes the congressional purpose behind the portal to portal act.
moreover,this approach to congressional intent assumes that the only relevant congressional purpose in this case is that expressed in enacting the portal to portal act.but a countervailing congressional purpose can be found in the class action fairness act,which provides federal jurisdiction over class actions that satisfy its requirements.rite aid correctly notes that cafa does not grant jurisdiction in all cases,providing judges discretionary jurisdiction in some instances,d,and barring jurisdiction in others,d but the requirements that must be satisfied before these subsections apply demonstrate that congress did not intend courts to invoke an extratextual supplement outside those exceptions to decline otherwise available jurisdiction.see.river water conservation dist.united states,when there are statutes clearly defining the jurisdiction of the courts,the force and effect of such provisions should not be disturbed by a mere implication quoting rosencrans united states.
rite aid also argues our decision in de asencio tyson foods,cir,supports the concept of inherent incompatibility.in de asencio,we determined that the trial court had abused its discretion by exercising supplemental jurisdiction over an class action based on pennsylvania wage law filed together with an class action under the flsa.id.at.we grounded our decision in the requirements of c,particularly the provisions that the district court may decline jurisdiction over a claim when it raises a novel or complex issue of state law or when it substantially predominates over the federal claim.id.we concluded that the presence of two novel issues,along with the inordinate size of the class,did not satisfy this standard and led us to conclude that supplemental jurisdiction was unavailable because the federal action is an appendage to the more comprehensive state action.id.
as this account suggests,de asencio is distinguishable,as the seventh,ninth,and circuits have all concluded.ervin,at de asencio represents only a application of rules,not a rigid rule about the use of supplemental jurisdiction in cases combining an flsa count with a class action.wang,at lindsay,at.unlike the state law claims at issue in de asencio,there is no suggestion that the claims under the mwhl and the omfwsa are novel or complex rite aid principal objection is that these state claims are too similar to federal claims with which the federal courts are well familiar.nor does this case present an instance of supplemental jurisdiction,where there is statutory authority to decline jurisdiction in the factual circumstances of de asencio here,independent jurisdiction exists over plaintiffs claims under cafa,which provides no statutory basis for declining jurisdiction in this instance.for these reasons,we do not believe de asencio supports dismissal 
in sum,we disagree with the conclusion that jurisdiction over an class action based on claims that parallel the flsa is inherently incompatible with the flsa procedure.nothing in the plain text of b addresses the procedure for claims,nor,in our view,does the provision legislative history establish a clear congressional intent to bar actions based on state law.we join the second,seventh,ninth,and circuits in ruling that this purported inherent incompatibility does not defeat otherwise available federal jurisdiction.
we next consider whether the flsa preempts the mwhl and the omfwsa.the district court concluded that it does not.rite aid disputes this conclusion and urges affirmance of the dismissal on this ground.
under the supremacy clause,state law that interferes with or is contrary to federal law is preempted.kurns chesterton,cir quoting free.bland.state law may be preempted by express congressional language,by implication from the depth and breadth of a congressional scheme that occupies the legislative field,or by implication because of a conflict with a congressional enactment.lorillard tobacco reilly.two fundamental principles guide our preemption analysis.first,t he purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in every case.wyeth levine,quoting medtronic,lohr.second,when congress has acted in a field which the states have traditionally occupied,we presume that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.id.
the flsa contains a savings clause,which states,no provision of this chapter or of any order thereunder shall excuse noncompliance with any federal or state law or municipal ordinance establishing a minimum wage higher than the minimum wage established under this chapter or a maximum work week lower than the maximum workweek established under this chapter.a.because the overtime provisions of the mwhl and the omfwsa establish the same,rather than higher,protections than the flsa,they are not expressly preserved by this provision.nevertheless,the savings clause is relevant to the question of preemption.express preemption is improper here,as the statute plain language evinces a clear intent to preserve rather than supplant state law.moreover,as the district court noted,the presence of the savings clause undermines any suggestion that congress intended to occupy the field of wage and hour regulation.
rite aid urges that the state laws here constitute an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress,gade solid wastes mgmt.ass n,and are impliedly preempted under the principles of conflict preemption.but this proposition is counterintuitive,since it suggests that state enforcement of standards that are identical with those established in the flsa would somehow conflict with congressional purpose.this would be especially odd where congress explicitly contemplated dual enforcement of the flsa.moreover,a finding of preemption here would bar enforcement of all state wage and hour laws that did not exceed the standards of the flsa,a significant intrusion on state authority and a reversal of the traditional presumption against preemption,which is particularly strong given states lengthy history of regulating employees wages and hours.see cal.div.of labor standards enforcement dillingham,presuming that erisa did not preempt a state wage law in light of the state lengthy history of wage regulation see also daniel dorris,comment,fair labor standards act preemption of state wage and hour law claims,chi,arguing that the lengthy and ongoing history of state regulation of wage and hour regulations requires the application of the presumption against preemption to the flsa.for these reasons,we do not believe the state laws at issue here are impliedly preempted as an obstacle to congress purpose.
rite aid offers a more refined version of their preemption argument when they suggest that,while the flsa does not preempt the substantive provisions at issue,the enforcement of the mwhl and the omfwsa through class actions conflicts with congress intent in enacting b and should stand preempted.this argument largely recapitulates the concept of inherent incompatibility,which we have already rejected.the argument fails here because of a flaw in rite aid reasoning namely,that the procedure at issue is provided not by state law,but under cafa,d.because federal law can not preempt another federal law,and a statute from can not impliedly repeal a law from,preemption is inapplicable.
the cases cited by rite aid do not alter this conclusion.in anderson sara lee,cir,the court of appeals for the fourth circuit ruled that plaintiffs claims under north carolina contract,negligence,and fraud laws were preempted by the flsa.but anderson is readily distinguishable because none of the state laws at issue created the substantive rights that had been allegedly violated.instead,the court noted,the plaintiffs rely on the flsa for their rights,and invoke state law only as the source of remedies for the alleged flsa violations.anderson,at.the court sensibly declined to allow the plaintiffs to use state laws to enforce the substantive provisions of the flsa,analogizing their decision to an earlier holding that plaintiffs could not enforce their flsa rights through a action.id.at citing kendall.by contrast,plaintiffs here do not seek to enforce rights conferred under the flsa through remedies they seek instead to enforce rights granted by independent state employment laws through a federal remedy.see martinez hernandez butterball,llc,d,holding that plaintiffs claims under state statutory minimum wage and overtime laws are not preempted under the flsa because unlike anderson plaintiffs are not merely using state law to enforce their rights under the flsa.we can not conclude that plaintiffs are doing an end run around the requirements of the flsa simply because state legislatures made the policy decision to track federal standards in enacting their own labor laws 
in sum,there is no evidence that congress intended the flsa to preempt the mwhl and the omfwsa.we will affirm the district court judgment that the state laws at issue are not preempted.
the rules enabling act grants the supreme court the power to create federal rules of practice and procedure with the restriction that these rules shall not abridge,enlarge,or modify any substantive right.b.rite aid urges affirmance on the alternate ground that certification of a rule class action violates this prohibition because it would abridge the substantive right not to be sued in a representative action.
the ellis court endorsed this position in the context of inherent incompatibility.it reasoned that rule is procedural because it merely provides a mechanism whereby rights and duties of classes of plaintiffs and defendants may be enforced,but that the flsa provision creates two principal substantive rights the right of employers not to be sued in representative actions,and the right of employees not to have their rights litigated without their knowledge and express consent.ellis,d at footnote omitted.certification under rule of state law claims identical to those in the flsa action would annihilate both of these intended results because it would subject employers to representative actions and subject employees to the preclusive effects of a decision made without their individual agency or input.id.at.in this context,therefore,rule would operate to abridge a substantive right,in violation of the rules enabling act.id.
ellis is the minority view.every other court to examine the issue has concluded that the rules enabling act does not bar certification of an class action based on state claims paralleling the flsa.see,butler directsat usa,llc,d,espenscheid directsat usa,llc,d.cohen gerson lehrman,d,damassia duane reade,lehman legg mason,d,neary metro.prop.cas.ins,d.this skepticism is well founded.assuming for the sake of argument the proposition that b confers rights to employers not to be sued in representative actions and to employees not to have their rights litigated without their consent,those rights would extend only to actions under the flsa and are not abridged or modified by the certification of a law class under rule.damassia,at.but even if we construed the provisions as in direct conflict,the rights conferred under b are procedural under precedent,since they relate to the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them,hanna plumer,and therefore would be properly displaced by rule,burlington woods.
but whatever our view of the merits of the rules enabling act argument,rite aid claim can not survive the supreme court recent decision in shady grove or
