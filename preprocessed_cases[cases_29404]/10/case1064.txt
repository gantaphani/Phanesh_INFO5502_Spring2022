in this consolidated class action,the plaintiffs appellants plaintiffs represent a class of investors that purchased stock in apollo group,between may,and october,the class period.the plaintiffs allege that the defendants appellees defendants,apollo,a education company,and apollo officers and directors,violated section b of the securities and exchange act and sec rule.according to the plaintiffs,the defendants made false and misleading statements of material fact regarding apollo enrollment and revenue growth,financial condition,organizational values,and business focus.the plaintiffs also allege that,during the class period,certain individual defendants traded on inside information related to the false and misleading statements of material fact.finally,the plaintiffs allege that certain officers and directors of apollo are liable as controlling persons for the misstatements and omissions of their supervisees.the district court dismissed the plaintiffs amended complaint for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b.we affirm the decision of the district court for four reasons.
first,the material misrepresentations the plaintiffs alleged in counts i,iii,and iv of the amended complaint are not objectively false misstatements,but are examples of lawful business puffing.even if the plaintiffs adequately alleged a misstatement or omission,they did not adequately plead scienter or loss causation,both of which are independent bases on which to affirm the district court decision.
second,count ii contains largely conclusory allegations that apollo improperly recorded student revenue.the plaintiffs do not show how apollo accounting numbers were incorrect or misstated.apollo also disclosed to its investors information concerning the collection of revenue and tuition,which negates the plaintiffs misstatement and omission theory.
third,the plaintiffs allegations that the defendants are guilty of insider trading fail to state a claim because the alleged information to which the defendants had access is the same information at issue in counts i,ii,iii,and iv of the amended complaint.
fourth,the plaintiffs can not establish control person liability because their control person claim relies on the faulty allegations made in the other counts.
factual and procedural background 
defendant apollo group is an company that owns and operates postsecondary education institutions,and is one of the largest private education providers in the united states.the majority of apollo revenue comes from its subsidiary,the university of phoenix.the remaining defendants are individuals who served as apollo officers and directors during the class period,between may,and october.the plaintiffs represent a class of investors who purchased apollo stock during the class period.
counts i,ii,iii,and iv of the plaintiffs amended complaint allege that,during the class period,the defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning apollo enrollment and revenue growth,financial condition,organizational values,and business focus in violation of section b of the securities and exchange act and sec rule.these alleged misstatements appeared in apollo filings with the sec,press releases,and conference calls and interviews.the plaintiffs also allege that the defendants failed to disclose material facts necessary to make the statements not misleading.
in counts v and vii of their amended complaint,the plaintiffs allege that individual defendants john sperling,peter sperling,joseph,and william pepicello committed insider trading by trading on information related to the allegedly false and misleading disclosures that apollo made to its investors.
finally,in count vi,the plaintiffs allege that,during the class period,defendants john sperling,peter sperling,joseph,gregory capelli,charles edelstein,brian swartz,brian mueller,and gregory iverson violated section a of the securities and exchange act because each was a controlling person who had direct and supervisory involvement in the daily operations of apollo.as controlling persons,they would be jointly and severally liable for violations of section b of the securities and exchange act and rule.
after allowing the plaintiffs to amend their initial complaint,the district court dismissed the plaintiffs amended complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim.the plaintiffs subsequently filed this timely appeal.

discussion 
legal standard 
to plead a claim under section b and rule,the plaintiffs must allege a material misrepresentation or omission scienter a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security reliance economic loss and loss causation.stoneridge inv.partners,llc scientific atlanta,u.
pslra and rule b 
the plaintiffs incorrectly argue that each of the six elements of their b claims is subject to the pleading standards of federal rule of civil procedure a,which requires that a complaint contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,quoting bell atl.twombly.securities fraud class actions must meet the higher,exacting pleading standards of federal rule of civil procedure b and the private securities litigation reform act pslra.see tellabs,makor issues rights.rule b requires that i n alleging fraud or mistake,a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.b.
the pslra requires that the complaint shall,with respect to each act or omission,state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b a.the pslra also requires that the complaint shall specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.id.at b b.
pleading standard for loss causation 
although it is clear that rule b and the pslra apply to almost all elements of a securities fraud action,the law is less clear about the pleading standard that applies to the loss causation element.in dura pharmaceuticals,broudo,the supreme court suggested that rule short and plain statement might apply we assume,at least for argument sake,that neither the rules nor the securities statutes impose any special further requirement in respect to the pleading of proximate causation or economic loss.
after dura,we have applied a plausibility standard to loss causation,which avoids the question of whether the rule a or rule b pleading standard applies.see wpp luxembourg gamma three sarl spot runner,cir it is unclear in this circuit whether rule b heightened pleading standard or whether rule a short and plain statement applies to allegations of loss causation.in re gilead sciences sec,cir so long as the complaint alleges facts that,if taken as true,plausibly establish loss causation,a rule b dismissal is inappropriate.at times,we have applied both rule a and b standards to allegations of loss causation,finding that plaintiffs meet both standards.see berson applied signal tech,cir.
some of our sister circuits have suggested that heightened pleading standards apply to loss causation.see katyle penn gaming,cir we review allegations of loss causation for sufficient specificity,a standard largely consonant with.b requirement that averments of fraud be pled with particularity.tricontinental,pricewaterhousecoopers,llp,cir to plead loss causation,the plaintiff must allege that it was the very facts about which the defendant lied which caused its injuries.the second circuit applies a different,but heightened,test for loss causation,requiring that plaintiffs show that the loss was both foreseeable and caused by the materialization of the risk concealed by the fraudulent statement.see atsi commc ns,shaar fund,cir.at least one district court in the sixth circuit has suggested that heightened pleading requirements apply to loss causation.see.carpenters reg l council pension plan eaton,d.the first circuit,like our court,has only stated that it is unclear whether a plaintiff has to plead loss causation under rule a or b.see.ret.cvs caremark,cir.
other circuits have suggested that heightened pleading standards do not apply to loss causation.the fifth circuit has concluded that rule a applies.see lormand unwired,cir.at least one court in the third circuit agrees with this approach.see junior baseball league pharmanet dev.grp,d.
we are persuaded by the approach adopted in the fourth circuit and hold today that rule b applies to all elements of a securities fraud action,including loss causation.this approach is appropriate for at least three reasons.
first,the law on securities fraud is derived from fraud.as the supreme court has noted,the case law developed in this court with respect to b and rule has been based on doctrines with which we,as judges,are familiar doctrines of fraud and deceit.basic levinson.the requirement of loss causation,in particular,is founded on the common law of fraud and deceit.dura,at the common law has long insisted that a plaintiff in a fraud or deceit case show not only that had he known the truth he would not have acted but also that he suffered actual economic loss.since rule b applies to all circumstances of fraud,salameh tarsadia hotel,cir cert.denied,and since securities fraud is derived from common law fraud,it makes sense to apply the same pleading standard to all circumstances of securities fraud.
second,rule b clearly states that i n alleging fraud or mistake,a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.securities fraud encompasses six elements,including loss causation.dura,at.loss causation is part of the circumstances constituting fraud because,without it,a claim of securities fraud does not exist.
third,our approach creates a consistent standard through which to assess pleadings in b actions,rather than the piecemeal standard adopted by some courts.
accordingly,we hold that rule b governs the plaintiffs amended complaint.however,the plaintiffs claims fail even if the less stringent rule a standard applied.
ii.counts i,iii,and iv 
we first address counts i,iii,and iv of the amended complaint the plaintiffs allege that the defendants made false and misleading statements concerning apollo enrollment,revenue growth,business model,and recruitment of students.the plaintiffs allege that apollo grew largely as a result of unethical recruitment of unqualified students,in contrast to apollo disclosures and public filings,and did not disclose their unsavory practices to investors.
material misstatement 
the plaintiffs fail to state a claim because the material misrepresentations the plaintiffs allege are not objectively false statements.we distinguish puffing from misrepresentation.puffing concerns expressions of opinion,as opposed to knowingly false statements of fact when valuing corporations,investors do not rely on vague statements of optimism like good,or other feel good monikers.this mildly optimistic,subjective assessment hardly amounts to a securities violation.in re cutera sec,cir.statements by a company that are capable of objective verification are not puffery and can constitute material misrepresentations.see sec todd,cir finding that a defendant accounting calculation of the financial impact of a transaction was objective and a material misrepresentation.
the statements the plaintiffs allege apollo made are inherently subjective puffing and would not induce the reliance of a reasonable investor.the plaintiffs amended complaint cites several alleged statements made by apollo,but we analyze a few illustrative examples here.in each of its form k filings between and,apollo stated that w e believe that our track record for enrollment and revenue growth is attributable to our offering comprehensive services combining quality educational content,teaching resources and customer service with formats that are accessible and easy to use for students as well as our corporate clients.in several of its k and q filings between and,apollo described enrollment and revenue growth as significant events.these statements are vague and do not set out with specificity the reasons for its enrollment and revenue growth.we concluded that the statement all the advantages only the nation largest wireless company can provide was vague and provided nothing concrete upon which a plaintiff could reasonably rely.shroyer new cingular wireless,cir.much like the defendant in new cingular,who only used the general term advantages in its description,apollo use of general terms like educational content and teaching resources provided nothing concrete upon which the plaintiffs could rely.id.at.see also glen holly entm t,tektronix,cir affirming dismissal of fraud claim that was based on defendants alleged promise that development was a high priority.
the cases cited by the plaintiffs are inapposite because they consider statements that can be true or false on an objective standard,rather than business puffery or opinion.in sec todd,we considered an objective misstatement,where a defendant publicly reported an incorrect amount for the accounting impact of a transaction.at.in freudenberg e trade financial corporation,the southern district of new york considered financial statements that clearly understated net income and loss reserves as well as the quality of mortgage loans.d.in re van der moolen holding securities litigation dealt with a company that did not disclose that its revenue had been generated by unlawful trading practices,even though it had knowledge that its employees were violating rules of the new york stock exchange.d.unlike accounting calculations or ignorance of rule violations,the statements by apollo were subjective and preceded by qualifiers,such as we believe.
according to the plaintiffs,apollo failed to disclose to investors that it recruited flawed students,who were ultimately unable to pay tuition.apollo also allegedly hid the fact that it had created an incentive system for recruiters that made misconduct inevitable because the recruiters were focused on getting as many students as possible.
the plaintiffs omissions theory fails to state a claim because the defendants clearly disclosed material information to investors.see desai deutsche bank secs,cir as for omissions,the term generally refers to the failure to disclose material information about a company,as opposed to affirmative manipulation.investors knew that they were investing in apollo and its university of phoenix program,an institution whose business model relied on recruiting students for profit.public filings,readily available to apollo investors,revealed that apollo was spending money every year on marketing,which was used to advertise to and recruit students for the university of phoenix.apollo public filings made clear that it targeted individuals unable to attend traditional colleges and universities.apollo also disclosed its enrollment numbers and withdrawal rates.
we can affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs claims in count i,iii,and iv of the amended complaint based solely on the plaintiffs failure to allege specific facts to show a material misstatement or omission.even if the plaintiffs had adequately alleged a claim on misstatement or omission grounds,however,they did not adequately plead scienter.this is an independent basis on which to affirm the district court decision.
