after numerous pretrial delays,the district court issued a lengthy summary judgment order in,which completely disposed of the case as to ten of the plaintiffs and partially disposed of the case as to the remaining plaintiffs.this appeal involves the ten plaintiffs against whom complete summary judgment was issued.they contest the district court decision to dismiss their claims and also challenge its prior denial of their motion for class certification.
having jurisdiction pursuant to,we affirm the decisions below.
factual and procedural background 
prior to the events that gave rise to this case,panaderia la diana had been placed under surveillance by law enforcement due to numerous reports of drug sales on the premises.as part of their investigation,undercover police purchased cocaine and heroin from eight different persons in the parking lot and purchased the prescription drug darvon from an employee inside the restaurant.the police also obtained information about potential firearms located on the premises.
at on april,salt lake city police,in conjunction with officers from other agencies,executed a search warrant at panaderia la diana,seeking evidence of the purported drug activity occurring on the property.the warrant was executed pursuant to high risk procedure and,throughout the course of the search,at least swat members and other law enforcement officers detained approximately eighty people.six people were initially arrested,including the employee who had previously sold darvon to an undercover officer.however,the search produced no new evidence of illegal activity,and the charges were later dropped.
nearly two years later,on march,of the persons detained by law enforcement joined in filing suit under against salt lake city and individual police officers involved in the raid the plaintiffs claimed they suffered maltreatment at the hands of law enforcement officers and alleged a litany of horrific facts to support their claims.the allegations,which were set out at length in the district court thorough opinion,see panaderia la diana,salt lake city,d,describe a wide range of physical and verbal abuse of persons at the scene,including pregnant women and children.
on july,over five years after the plaintiffs filed suit,the city noticed depositions for a number of plaintiffs for july,the last day of the discovery period.on that date,for reasons that are disputed by the parties,the following ten noticed plaintiffs failed to appear at the appointed place carlos perez,maria del carmen cruz,carmelo cruz,laurentino rodriguez,ashley rodriguez,silvia rodriguez,gloria villalobos,pedro campos,jiverto baptista,and rogelio gomez.these plaintiffs were therefore never deposed.
after discovery was closed but before the motions deadline had passed,the plaintiffs moved for certification as a class action pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.in addition,the city moved for summary judgment pursuant to rule.the court denied the plaintiffs request for class certification and granted summary judgment against the ten plaintiffs who failed to appear at their own depositions 
these ten plaintiffs appeal the judgment entered against them as well as the denial of class certification.the city the certification issue.
ii.discussion 
summary judgment against plaintiffs 
when a party moves for summary judgment,it will be granted if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.plaintiffs seeking to overcome a motion for summary judgment may not rest on mere allegations in their complaint but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.e emphasis added see lujan wildlife fed,d c onclusory allegations unsupported by specific evidence will be insufficient to establish a genuine issue of fact.internal quotations omitted.
this does not mean that evidence must be submitted in a form that would be admissible at trial.celotex catrett,d.indeed,parties may submit affidavits even though affidavits are often inadmissible hearsay at trial on the theory that the same facts may ultimately be presented at trial in an admissible form.bryant farmers ins,cir.however,t o determine whether genuine issues of material fact make a jury trial necessary,a court necessarily may consider only the evidence that would be available to the jury in some form.argo blue cross and blue shield of kansas,cir citing truck ins.exch.magnetek,cir affirming summary judgment,in light of the available evidence,because j ury verdicts may not be based on speculation or inadmissible evidence or be contrary to uncontested admissible evidence.
having reviewed this issue de novo and applied the same standard as the district court,burnham humphrey hospitality reit trust,cir,we come to the same these plaintiffs failed to put forward any evidence in their favor that satisfies these standards,panaderia,d at.absent deposition testimony or other competent evidence of what occurred,it was incumbent upon these plaintiffs to the very detailing what happened to them.none of these ten plaintiffs did so.nor,after the district court decision alerted them to their deficiencies,did they ask the court to reconsider its ruling and,at that time,seek to supplement the record.
as it is,the plaintiffs can only argue on appeal that the city never contested their presence at panaderia la diana,and other previously joined plaintiffs who had provided deposition testimony to support their own claims made sweeping statements about the group as a whole.however,neither physical presence on the premises,nor vague,generalized statements from others suggesting that pretty much everyone was treated the same way,applt.appx.at,is sufficient to constitute specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial as to the essential elements of these plaintiffs claims.see flight concepts.boeing,cir.the record is particularly deficient considering the plaintiffs had over five years to prepare their case,and summary judgment was granted only one month before the scheduled trial in the matter.
because these plaintiffs failed to meet the requirements of rule,summary judgment is appropriate.we therefore uphold the district court decision 
denial of plaintiffs motion for class certification 
plaintiffs also appeal on behalf of other potential claimants who were at the restaurant during the raid but did not join the lawsuit,arguing the district court should have certified their case as a class action.the district court initially denied certification on the ground of untimeliness.subsequently,however,the court amended its prior order and denied certification based on the plaintiffs failure to meet two elements set forth in rule and commonality.
whether the district court applied the correct legal standard in its decision to grant or deny class certification is reviewed de novo.shook el paso county,cir.however,w hen the district court has applied the proper standard in deciding whether to certify a class,we may reverse that decision only for an abuse of discretion.id.
timeliness 
this lawsuit had been pending for five years before the plaintiffs moved for class certification.they filed at the latest possible final day of the motions period.at that point,discovery had already closed and a jury trial was just over two months away.because granting certification at that point would have resulted in extending the motions perio
