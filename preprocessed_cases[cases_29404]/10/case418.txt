opinion of the court 
in this appeal,we consider the antitrust implications of an agreement by a manufacturer of a generic drug that,in return for a payment by the patent holder,agrees to drop its challenge to the patent and refrain from entering the market for a specified period of time.
a secondary issue concerns the certification by the district court of a class of antitrust plaintiffs.specifically,we must determine whether the antitrust injury allegedly suffered by class members can be shown through common proof,proof applicable to all plaintiffs,and whether there are insurmountable conflicts preventing named plaintiffs from adequately representing the members of the class.
these appeals arise out of the settlement of two patent cases involving the drug k dur k dur,which is manufactured by schering plough corporation schering.plaintiffs are louisiana wholesale drug company,on behalf of a class of wholesalers and retailers who purchased k dur directly from schering and nine individual plaintiffs,including cvs pharmacy,rite aid corporation,and other pharmacies.defendants are schering and upsher smith laboratories upsher smith 
statutory and regulatory framework 
k dur is schering potassium chloride supplement potassium chloride is used to treat potassium deficiencies,including those that arise as a side effect of the use of diuretic products to treat high blood pressure.
schering did not hold a patent for the potassium chloride salt itself,as that compound is commonly known and not patentable.instead,schering held a formulation patent on the controlled release coating it applied to the potassium chloride crystals.schering identified patent number the patent as the patent that would be infringed by the production of a generic version of k dur.schering assigned the patent to its subsidiary key pharmaceuticals.the patent was set to expire on september.
by statute,a pharmaceutical company must obtain from the food and drug administration fda approval before it may market a prescription drug.a.for a new drug,the approval process requires submission of a new drug application nda,which includes exhaustive information about the drug,including safety and efficacy studies,the method of producing the drug,and any patents issued on the drug composition or methods of use.id.b.the fda publishes the patent information submitted in ndas in the approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations,otherwise known as the orange book.see fda electronic orange book,http.
in,attempting to jumpstart generic competition with name brand pharmaceuticals,congress passed the drug price competition and patent term restoration act,commonly known as the hatch waxman act,stat.the hatch waxman act amended the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act,to permit a potential manufacturer of a generic version of a patented drug to file an abbreviated application for approval with the fda.see j.this short form application,known as an abbreviated new drug application anda,may rely on the fda prior determinations of safety and efficacy made in considering the application of the patented drug.id.j a.
when a generic manufacturer files an anda,it is also required to file a certification that,in the opinion of the applicant and to the best of his knowledge,the proposed generic drug does not infringe any patent listed with the fda as covering the patented drug.id.j a vii.the generic manufacturer can satisfy this requirement by certifying one of the following four options with respect to the patent for the listed drug i that such patent information has not been filed,ii that such patent has expired,iii by certifying the date on which such patent will expire,or iv that such patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture,use,or sale of the new drug for which the application is submitted.id.j a vii.the generic manufacturers at issue here,upsher and esi,used the fourth of these certification options,the paragraph iv certification.id.j a vii iv.when a generic manufacturer submits a paragraph iv certification,it must consult the orange book and provide written notice to each listed patent owner impacted by the anda.id.j b iii i.by statute,a paragraph iv certification constitutes a technical act of patent infringement.e a.
upon receiving notice of a paragraph iv certification with respect to one of its pharmaceutical patents,the patent holder may initiate an infringement suit based on the filing of the paragraph iv certification alone within days after the generic applicant files its anda and paragraph iv certification.j b iii.filing suit by the patent holder within that window effects an automatic stay that prevents the fda from approving the generic drug until the earlier of thirty months have run or the court hearing the patent challenge finds that the patent is either invalid or not infringed.id.j b iii i.
congress explained that the purpose of the hatch waxman act is to make available more low cost generic drugs.i,at,reprinted in.in order to encourage generic entry and challenges to drug patents,the hatch waxman act rewards the first generic manufacturer who submits an anda and a paragraph iv certification by providing it with a day period during which the fda will not approve subsequent anda applications.j b iv.the day exclusivity period is triggered on the date on which the first anda applicant begins commercial marketing of its drug.id.notably,the day exclusivity window is only available to the first filer of an anda with a paragraph iv certification,meaning that even if the first filer never becomes eligible to use its day exclusivity period because it settles,loses,or withdraws the litigation,that potential benefit will not pass to subsequent filers.j d iii.it has been suggested that the first filer is usually the most motivated challenger to the patent holder claimed intellectual property.see scott hemphill,paying for delay pharmaceutical patent settlement as a regulatory design problem,noting a sharp difference in incentives between the first paragraph iv filer and all other generic firms.
as explained further below,in the years after the passage of hatch waxman,some of the patent infringement suits occurring under the hatch waxman framework were resolved through settlement agreements in which the patent holder paid the generic manufacturer to drop its patent challenge and refrain from producing a generic drug for a specified period.these agreements are known as reverse payment agreements or exclusion agreements.concerned about the possible anticompetitive effects of reverse payment agreements,see,at,congress amended hatch waxman as part of the medicare prescription drug,improvement,and modernization act of.those amendments require branded and generic pharmaceutical companies who enter into patent litigation settlements to file those settlement agreements with the federal trade commission ftc and the department of justice doj for antitrust review,stat,codified as amended at j.
ii.factual and procedural background 
approval of the patent 
the patented invention claims a dispersible potassium chloride tablet.the patent was developed using a technique called microencapsulation,a process in which small particles of a drug are coated to make them disperse over time.the research supporting the patent built on work that schering had done for an earlier patent for a aspirin tablet,patent the patent.the application for what became the patent was initially rejected by the patent and trademark office pto as obvious in light of the patent and other prior art.in order to circumvent the prior art,schering amended its application for what became the patent to clarify that the controlled release coating in the invention contained ethylcellulose with a viscosity of greater than cp whereas the patent called for the use of ethylcellulose with a viscosity of cp.schering argued that a coating containing ethylcellulose of greater than cp was not obvious under the prior art.after this amendment,the pto granted the patent on september.
b.the schering upsher litigation and settlement 
in august,upsher filed the first anda seeking approval to produce a generic version of k dur to be called klor con.upsher provided a paragraph iv certification to schering in november,certifying that its generic would not infringe schering patent.on december,within the window provided by hatch waxman,schering sued upsher in the district of new jersey for patent infringement,triggering the month automatic stay in fda approval of upsher generic.
upsher defense against schering patent infringement suit was based on differences between the chemical composition of the controlled release coating in its generic product and that of the invention claimed in the patent.throughout the litigation,upsher vigorously defended against schering infringement claims,at one point telling the court that schering claims of infringement are baseless and could not have been made in good faith.app.at.
the parties began trying to settle the infringement case at least as early as may.during settlement negotiations,upsher requested both a cash payment and an early entry date for its generic product.however,schering expressed concern about possible antitrust problems that might arise if it made a reverse payment.
in the early morning of june,just hours before the district court was to rule on the pending cross motions for summary judgment and begin,if necessary,a patent trial,upsher and schering agreed to settle the case.the settlement was memorialized in an agreement dated june,the schering upsher agreement.that agreement provided that,while upsher did not concede the validity,infringement,or enforceability of the patent,it would refrain from marketing its generic potassium chloride supplement or any similar product until september,at which point it would receive a license under the patent to make and sell a generic form of klorcon.additionally,upsher granted schering licenses to make and sell several pharmaceutical products upsher had developed,including niacor sr,a niacin product used to treat high cholesterol.in return,schering promised to pay upsher sixty million dollars over three years,plus additional smaller sums depending upon its sales of niacor sr in defined markets.while the parties to this litigation dispute whether the payment was solely for the licensing of upsher products or instead formed part of the consideration for dropping the patent action,the agreement lists upsher promises to dismiss the patent infringement action and not to market any microencapsulated potassium chloride tablet until september,as part of the consideration for the payment.
the settlement agreement and the acquisition of licenses from upsher were ratified by schering board of directors on june.subsequent to the settlement,upsher and schering abandoned plans to make and market niacor.
in this action,the parties dispute the facts related to the niacor sr license.plaintiffs contend that the license was a sham and that the million paid as royalties for niacor sr was actually compensation for upsher agreement to delay the entry of its generic potassium tablet.on the other hand,defendants contend that schering board valued the license deal separately and that million was its good faith valuation of the licenses at the time.
c.the schering esi litigation and settlement 
in december,esi esi filed an anda seeking fda approval to make and sell a generic version of k dur along with a paragraph iv certification stating that its proposed generic did not infringe the patent.within the period provided by the hatch waxman act,schering sued esi for patent infringement in the eastern district of pennsylvania.esi defended on the ground that,unlike k dur,its generic equivalent did not employ a coating material with two different ingredients as specified by the patent,but rather was made by a different technology which produces a coating with each layer comprised of a separate material having only a single ingredient.app.at.
in the fall of,schering and esi agreed to participate in mediation before a magistrate judge.the settlement agreement the parties eventually reached the schering esi agreement called for schering to grant esi a license under the patent beginning on january.in exchange,schering would pay esi million up front and a varying sum depending on when esi anda was approved by the fda.specifically,schering agreed to pay esi an amount ranging from a maximum of million if esi anda was approved before july down to a minimum of if the anda was not approved until.as part of the settlement,esi also represented that it was not developing and had no plans to develop any other potassium chloride product.
the fda approved esi generic k dur product in may,and schering paid esi the additional million as required under the settlement agreement.
d.the ftc action 
in march,the ftc filed a complaint against schering,upsher,and esi alleging that schering settlements with upsher and esi unreasonably restrained commerce in violation of section of the federal trade commission act.specifically,the ftc alleged that the settlement payments from schering to upsher and esi constituted reverse payments intended to delay generic entry and improperly preserve schering monopoly.
in june,after a lengthy trial,the administrative law judge alj issued an initial decision dismissing the ftc complaint and finding that neither agreement violated section of the ftc act.in re schering plough,initial decision.the alj found that there was no reverse payment in the schering upsher agreement because the licensing deal included in that agreement was separately valued and was not a payment to upsher to delay generic entry.id.at.the alj also found that the schering esi agreement was not an attempt to unlawfully preserve schering monopoly power in the market.id.at.
in december,the ftc unanimously reversed the alj ruling,finding that there was a direct nexus between schering payment and upsher agreement to delay its competitive entry and that this agreement unreasonably restrain ed commerce.in re schering plough,final order.the ftc likewise found that the esi settlement violated antitrust law,noting that schering had not attempted to rebut the natural presumption that the payment to esi was for delay in generic entry,except to argue unpersuasively that the parties felt judicial pressure to settle.id.at.in making these determinations,the ftc found that it was neither necessary nor helpful to delve into the merits of the underlying patent disputes.id.at.rather,the ftc determined that,where a name brand pharmaceutical maker pays a generic manufacturer as part of a settlement,a bsent proof of other offsetting consideration,it is logical to conclude that the quid pro quo for the payment was an agreement by the generic to defer entry beyond the date that represents an otherwise reasonable litigation compromise.id.at.in applying the rule of reason,the ftc concluded that the possible existence of a reverse payment raises a red flag and can give rise to a prima facie case that an agreement is anticompetitive.id.at.the ftc concluded that the reverse payment at issue was illegal because the settling parties could show neither that the payment was for something other than delay of generic entry nor that the payment had effects.id.at.
schering appealed the ftc ruling to the eleventh circuit,which reversed in schering plough ftc,cir.the eleventh circuit ruling in schering plough is discussed in section iii c infra.
e.the instant litigation 
separate from the ftc challenge,various private parties filed antitrust suits attacking the settlements.those suits,the matters giving rise to this appeal,were consolidated in the district of new jersey by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation.in,by consent of the parties,the district court appointed stephen orlofsky as special master with responsibility to handle all motions,including motions for class certification and summary judgment 
on april,the special master certified a class of plaintiffs consisting of wholesalers and retailers who purchased k dur directly from schering.the district court adopted that decision on december,
in february,the special master issued a report and recommendation granting defendants motions for summary judgment and denying plaintiffs motions for partial summary judgment.in his report and recommendation,the special master applied a presumption that schering patent was valid and that it gave schering the right to exclude infringing products until the end of its term,including through reverse payment settlements.under this analysis,the settlements in this case would only be subject to antitrust scrutiny if they exceeded the scope of the patent or the underlying patent infringement suits were objectively baseless.the special master determined that neither of these exceptions applied.the district court subsequently adopted the report and recommendation in its entirety.
economic background and the history of reverse payment settlements 
reverse payment settlements appear to be unique to the hatch waxman context,and the ftc has made them a top enforcement priority in recent years.a analysis by the ftc found that reverse payment settlements cost consumers billion annually.ftc,pay for delay how drug company pay offs cost consumers billions,available at http.the ftc estimates that about one year after market entry an average generic pharmaceutical product takes over ninety percent of the patent holder unit sales and sells for fifteen percent of the price of the name brand product.id.at.this price differential means that consumers,rather than generic producers,are typically the biggest beneficiaries of generic entry.
iii.the antitrust issue appeals,
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to a and and.this court has jurisdiction over the antitrust appeals pursuant to.
this court exercises plenary review of the district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same summary judgment standard that guides the district court.eichenlaub twp.of indiana,cir.
general antitrust standard 
the sherman act provides,in part,that e very contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations,is declared to be illegal.under a literal reading,this provision would make illegal every agreement in restraint of trade.see arizona maricopa cnty.med.soc y,d.however,it has not been so interpreted.rather the supreme court has long construed it to prohibit only unreasonable restraints.see state oil khan,d.whether a restraint qualifies as unreasonable and therefore conflicts with the statute is normally evaluated under the rule of reason.id.applying this approach,the finder of fact must decide whether the questioned practice imposes an unreasonable restraint on competition,taking into account a variety of factors,including specific information about the relevant business,its condition before and after the restraint was imposed,and the restraint history,nature,and effect.id.this inquiry has been divided into three parts.first,the plaintiff must show that the challenged conduct has produced effects within the market.united states brown,cir.if the plaintiff meets the initial burden,the burden shifts to the defendant to show that the challenged conduct promotes a sufficiently objective.id.at.finally,the plaintiff can rebut the defendant purported justification by showing that the restraint is not reasonably necessary to achieve the objective.id.
courts have recognized,however,that s ome types of restraints have such predictable and pernicious anticompetitive effect,and such limited potential for benefit,that they should be deemed unlawful per se.state oil,at.examples of agreements that have been held unlawful pursuant to the per se rule include horizontal price fixing,output limitations,market allocation,and group boycotts.see copperweld independence tube,d pac.ry.united states,d.the per se rule is applied where a practice facially appears to be one that would always or almost always tend to restrict competition or decrease output.broad.music,cbs,d.
in some situations,courts apply an antitrust analysis that falls between the full rule of reason inquiry on the one hand and the rigid per se approach on the other.this quick look or truncated rule of reason analysis applies where the plaintiff has shown that the defendant has engaged in practices similar to those subject to per se treatment.see brown,at.having so shown,plaintiff is not required to make a full showing of effects within the market rather defendant has the burden of demonstrating justifications.id.
precedent from other circuits 
neither this court nor the supreme court has yet weighed in on the legality of reverse payment settlements.however,five other circuits have addressed the question.two of those courts the first two to consider the question concluded that such agreements should be subject to strict antitrust scrutiny,at least where the settling parties attempted to manipulate the day exclusivity period to block all potential generic competition.the three courts to address the question of reverse payments more recently have reached a contrary result,ruling that such agreements are permissible so long as they do not exceed the potential exclusionary scope of the patent.
circuit andrx,biovail.int l,
the circuit considered a reverse payment in andrx pharmaceuticals,biovail.international,cert.denied,d.unlike the instant case,that case did not involve a settlement resolving patent litigation.rather,while allowing the patent litigation to continue,the name brand manufacturer agreed to compensate the generic producer to delay marketing a generic product.
in september,andrx pharmaceuticals andrx filed an anda seeking to manufacture and sell a generic form of cardizem cd,a heart drug for which hoechst marion russell,hmri held the patent.id.at.andrx filed a paragraph iv certification and was timely sued for patent infringement by hmri.id.the filing of the patent infringement suit triggered the waiting period during which the fda could not give final approval to andrx or any subsequent anda applicants seeking to make a generic version of cardizem cd.id.citing j b iii.in june,a second generic manufacturer,biovail.international biovail,filed an anda and a paragraph iv certification to produce generic cardizem cd.shortly thereafter,the fda issued a tentative approval of andrx anda.id.
soon after the tentative approval was issued,hmri and andrx entered into an agreement pursuant to which hmri would pay andrx million per year beginning on the date that andrx received final approval from the fda and ending on the date that andrx either began selling generic cardizem cd or was adjudged liable for patent infringement in the pending suit.id.the apparent purpose of this agreement was to create a bottleneck by delaying the triggering of andrx day period of exclusivity,and thereby delaying generic entry not only by andrx but also by any other potential generic manufacturer.id.at.
the circuit reversed the district court dismissal with prejudice of biovail antitrust claims,holding that the agreement between hmri and andrx could reasonably be viewed as an attempt to allocate market share and preserve monopolistic conditions.id.at.the circuit treated the payment from hmri to andrx as prima facie evidence of an illegal agreement not to compete,noting that andrx argument that any rational actor would wait for resolution of the patent infringement suit before triggering the day exclusivity period is belied by the quid of hrmi quo.id.at.
sixth circuit in re cardizem cd antitrust,cir 
the sixth circuit decision of in re cardizem cd antitrust litigation concerned the same agreement considered by the circuit in andrx.cir,cert.denied,d.the sixth circuit case was brought by direct and indirect purchasers of cardizem cd who alleged that they suffered antitrust harm as a result of andrx agreement with hrmi to delay market entry.id.at.the sixth circuit held that the andrx hrmi agreement was a horizontal agreement to eliminate competition in the market for cardizem cd throughout the entire united states,a classic example of a per se illegal restraint of trade.id.at.
while both cardizem and andrx concerned an agreement that caused a bottleneck by preventing other generic manufactures from entering the market by delaying the triggering of the first filer day exclusivity period,much of the sixth circuit reasoning in cardizem is equally applicable to cases,like the instant one,that do not involve bottlenecking.specifically,the sixth circuit emphasized its concern that,even setting aside the bar to subsequent generic applicants,hmri had paid andrx not to enter the market itself,stating,it is one thing to take advantage of a monopoly that naturally arises from a patent,but another thing altogether to bolster the patent effectiveness in inhibiting competitors by paying the only potential competitor million per year to stay out of the market.id.at.
eleventh circuit valley drug geneva,cir and schering plough ftc,cir 
the eleventh circuit has also considered the question of reverse payments settlements in three significant cases.the first of these,valley drug geneva pharmaceuticals,cir,cert.denied,concerned two agreements arising out of cases where a name brand drug manufacturer sued generic manufacturers for patent infringement and the generic manufacturers defended on the ground of patent invalidity id.at.in the two agreements at issue,the name brand manufacturer agreed to pay the generic manufacturer substantial sums to refrain from entering the market until the end of the name brand manufacturer patent term.id.at.the patent at issue was subsequently declared invalid in another case.id.at.the district court granted summary judgment to antitrust plaintiffs,holding that the settlements were per se violations of the sherman act.id.at.the eleventh circuit reversed on the ground that the name brand manufacturer held a patent that gave it the right to exclude competitors.id.at.in so ruling,the court emphasized the fact that the name brand manufacturer might have prevailed in the underlying patent litigation,id.at,and highlighted policy considerations favoring the settlement of patent litigation,id.at.the court applied neither a per se nor rule of reason analysis to the agreements as a whole rather,it directed the district court to first determine whether any part of the agreement went beyond the protections afforded by the name brand manufacturer patent and,if so,to apply traditional antitrust scrutiny only to those portions of the agreement.id.at.
a subsequent eleventh circuit case,schering plough ftc,arose out of the same settlement agreement as the instant appeal cir,cert.denied,d.after the ftc found that both agreements violated antitrust laws,the defendants appealed to the eleventh circuit.applying the test articulated in valley drug,the eleventh circuit set aside the ruling of the ftc.id.at.the court rejected the ftc conclusion that schering million payment to upsher was for something other than the licenses it obtained,finding by overwhelming evidence that the payment was only for the licenses.id.as such,the court found that there was no reverse payment from schering to upsher and thus necessarily no antitrust violation in that agreement.id.with respect to the esi settlement,the court acknowledged the presence of a reverse payment but concluded that the payment was acceptable in light of judicial policy favoring settlements and the court finding that the settlement terms reflect ed a reasonable implementation of the protections afforded by patent law.id.at quoting valley drug,at 
plaintiffs construe valley drug and schering plough as requiring courts to conduct an ex post evaluation of the strength of the underlying patent before determining whether the patent shields an agreement from antitrust scrutiny.however,following oral argument in this case,the eleventh circuit explicitly rejected that interpretation of its prior holdings.in ftc watson pharmaceuticals,the eleventh circuit clarified that its prior opinions did not call for an evaluation of the strength of the patent but rather only a determination whether,absent sham litigation or fraud in obtaining the patent,the settlement agreement exceeded the scope of the patent.ftc watson pharms,wl,at,cir.thus the standard applied by the eleventh circuit is identical to the scope of the patent test applied by the second circuit to which we now turn.
second circuit in re tamoxifen citrate antitrust,cir 
the second circuit decision of in re tamoxifen citrate antitrust litigation arose out of an agreement settling a patent infringement suit over the drug tamoxifen,then the most widely prescribed drug for the treatment of breast cancer,cir,cert.denied,d.that settlement was reached while the patent case was on appeal after the district court had ruled the patent invalid.id.the settlement called for the name brand manufacturer to grant the generic manufacturer a license to sell an unbranded version of tamoxifen and make a reverse payment of million to the generic manufacturer.the settlement was contingent on obtaining a vacatur of the district court judgment holding the patent to be invalid,which was subsequently obtained.id.
affirming the district court dismissal of antitrust plaintiffs claims,the second circuit applied a presumption of patent validity and held that there is no injury to the market cognizable under existing antitrust law,as long as competition is restrained only within the scope of the patent.id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the only exceptions to this rule,the court held,occur where there is evidence that the patent was procured by fraud or that the enforcement suit was objectively baseless.id.this test is commonly referred to as the scope of the patent test or the tamoxifen test.the second circuit conceded that there was a potentially troubling result of such a rule in that t he less sound the patent or the less clear the infringement,and therefore the less justified the monopoly enjoyed by the patent holder,the more a rule permitting settlement is likely to benefit the patent holder by allowing it to retain the patent.id.at.the court determined,however,that this risk was counterbalanced by the judicial preference for settlement.id.
in reaching this conclusion,the second circuit concluded that the hatch waxman act created an environment that encourages reverse payments because,unlike traditional infringement suits where the patent holder can negotiate by agreeing to forego the infringement damages it expects to recover,there usually are no infringement damages in hatch waxman suits.id.at.the second circuit thus reasoned that the reverse payments common in hatch waxman suits are less troubling because they take the place of infringement damages that the patent holder might have otherwise waived in order to reach a settlement.id.
judge pooler dissented from the decision in tamoxifen,contending that the scope of the patent rule applied by the majority is not soundly grounded in supreme court precedent and is insufficiently protective of the consumer interests safeguarded by the hatch waxman act and the antitrust laws.id.at pooler,dissenting.judge pooler argued,inter alia,that judicial reevaluation of patent validity is a public good that reverse payment settlements undercut,id.at,and suggested that the proper antitrust standard is one of reasonableness considering all the circumstances affecting a restrictive agreement including the strength of the patent as it appeared at the time of settlement,the amount of the reverse payment,the amount the generic manufacturer would have made during its day exclusivity period,and any ancillary anticompetitive effects of the agreement.id.at.
in a subsequent reverse payment case,arkansas carpenters health welfare fund bayer ag,the second circuit applied the tamoxifen standard and rejected an antitrust challenge to a hatch waxman settlement involving a reverse payment.cir,cert.denied,d.however,the judges on the arkansas carpenters panel made clear that they thought that tamoxifen was wrongly decided and invited appellants to petition for rehearing en banc.id.at.among other things,the arkansas carpenters court noted its concern about evidence suggesting that the number of reverse payment settlements had increased dramatically in the wake of the tamoxifen decision.id.at.rehearing en banc was subsequently denied over a dissent from judge pooler.carpenters health welfare fund bayer ag,cir.
federal circuit in re ciprofloxacin hydrochloride antitrust,
in in re ciprofloxacin hydrochloride antitrust litigation the federal circuit considered a case related to those confronted by the second circuit in arkansas carpenters,cert.denied,d the federal circuit applied the scope of the patent test explicated in tamoxifen and other cases,stating,t he essence of the inquiry is whether the agreements restrict competition beyond the exclusionary zone of the patent.id.at.the court further agree d with the second and eleventh circuits that,in the absence of evidence of fraud before the pto or sham litigation,the court need not consider the validity of the patent in the antitrust analysis of a settlement agreement involving a reverse payment.id.
while the first two courts of appeal to address the issue of reverse payments subjected those agreements to antitrust scrutiny,later courts have gravitated toward the scope of the patent test under which reverse payments are permitted so long as the exclusion does not exceed the patent scope,the patent holder claim of infringement was not objectively baseless,and the patent was not procured by fraud on the pto.the scope of the patent test was applied by the special master in this case and has been applied by at least one other district court in this circuit.see king drug of florence,cephalon,d,applying scope of the patent test but denying defendants motion to dismiss where plaintiffs pleaded facts supporting their claim that the underlying patent suit was objectively baseless.as a practical matter,the scope of the patent test does not subject reverse payment agreements to any antitrust scrutiny.as the antitrust defendants concede,no court applying the scope of the patent test has ever permitted a reverse payment antitrust case to go to trial.
after consideration of the arguments of counsel,the conflicting decisions in the other circuits,the report of the special master,and our own reading,we can not agree with those courts that apply the scope of the patent test.in our view,that test improperly restricts the application of antitrust law and is contrary to the policies underlying the hatch waxman act and a long line of supreme court precedent on patent litigation and competition.
first,we take issue with the scope of the patent test almost unrebuttable presumption of patent validity.this presumption assumes away the question being litigated in the underlying patent suit,enforcing a presumption that the patent holder would have prevailed.we can identify no significant support for such a policy.while persons challenging the validity of a patent in litigation bear the burden of defeating a presumption of validity,this presumption is intended merely as a procedural device and is not a substantive right of the patent holder.see stratoflex,aeroquip,the presumption,like all legal presumptions,is a procedural device,not substantive law.moreover,the effectively conclusive presumption that a patent holder is entitled to exclude competitors is particularly misguided with respect to agreements like those here where the underlying suit concerned patent infringement rather than patent validity in infringement cases it is the patent holder who bears the burden of showing infringement.see egyptian goddess,swisa.
rather than adopt an unrebuttable presumption of patent validity,we believe courts must be mindful of the fact that a patent,in the last analysis,simply represents a legal conclusion reached by the patent office.lear,adkins,d.many patents issued by the pto are later found to be invalid or not infringed,and a study conducted by the ftc concluded that,in hatch waxman challenges made under paragraph iv,the generic challenger prevailed percent of the time.see ftc,generic drug entry prior to patent expiration,available at kimberly moore,judges,juries,and patent cases an empirical peek inside the black box,noting that between and the alleged infringer prevailed in percent of patent cases that reached trial these figures add force to the likelihood conceded by the tamoxifen majority that reverse payments enable the holder of a patent that the holder knows is weak to buy its way out of both competition with the challenging competitor and possible invalidation of the patent.at the less sound the patent or the less clear the infringement,and therefore the less justified the monopoly enjoyed by the patent holder,the more a rule permitting settlement is likely to benefit the patent holder by allowing it to retain the patent.
moreover,we question the assumption underlying the view of the second circuit and other courts that subsequent challenges by other generic manufacturers will suffice to eliminate weak patents preserved through a reverse payment to the initial challenger.cf,id.at.we note that the initial generic challenger is necessarily the most motivated because,unlike all subsequent challengers,it stands to benefit from the day exclusivity period of j b iv.additionally,as the experience of at least one court in this circuit confirms,the high profit margins of a monopolist drug manufacturer may enable it to pay off a whole series of challengers rather than suffer the possible loss of its patent through litigation.see king drug of florence,d at drug manufacturer settled infringement suits by four generic firms,which agreed to delay market entry in exchange for significant payments for various licensing agreements,supply agreements and research and development deals.
this practical analysis is supported by a long line of supreme court cases recognizing that valid patents are a limited exception to a general rule of the free exploitation of ideas.it follows that the public interest supports judicial testing and elimination of weak patents.see cardinal chem.morton int l,d explaining the importance to the public at large of resolving questions of patent validity and noting the danger of grant ing monopoly privileges to the holders of invalid patents bonito boats,thundercraft boats,d noting that the patent laws embody a careful balance between the need to promote innovation and the recognition that imitation and refinement through imitation are both necessary to invention itself and the very lifeblood of a competitive economy united states masonite.a patent affords no immunity for a monopoly not fairly or plainly within the grant id.at patents are to be strictly construed because they are privileges restrictive of a free economy pope gormully.it is as important to the public that competition should not be repressed by worthless patents,as that the patentee of a really valuable invention should be protected in his monopoly.
that reasoning underlies the decision of the supreme court in edward katzinger chicago metallic manufacturing,where the court considered whether a patent licensor could be contractually estopped from challenging the validity of the patent under a licensing agreement that also contained a price fixing term.the court reasoned that if the patent was invalid,the price fixing provision would violate federal antitrust law and that,as such,the licensor could not be estopped from challenging the patent.id.at.in reaching this conclusion the court emphasized the broad public interest in freeing our competitive economy from the trade restraints which might be imposed by agreements stemming from narrow or invalid patents.id.at citing sola jefferson.the court additionally stated it is the public interest which is dominant in the patent system and the right to challenge a patent is not only a private right to the individual,but it is founded on public policy which is promoted by his making the defence,and contravened by his refusal to make it.id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
this logic is persuasive with respect to the situation at bar because reverse payments permit the sharing of monopoly rents between competitors without any assurance that the underlying patent is valid.see also united states studiengesellschaft kohle,suggesting an agreement might be anticompetitive if it give s potential competitors incentives to remain in cartels rather than turning to another product,inventing around the patent,or challenging its validity.it appears that these aspects of the supreme court general patent jurisprudence had been overlooked by the special master and others adopting the scope of the patent test.
we caution that our decision today is limited to reverse payments between patent holders and would be generic competitors in the pharmaceutical industry.as the supreme court has made clear,antitrust analysis must sensitively recognize and reflect the distinctive economic and legal setting of the regulated industry to which it applies.verizon commc ns.law offices of curtis trinko,llp,d see also ia phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp antitrust law,ed.t he presence of regulation in some instances limits the antitrust role and in some instances simply changes it or even enlarges it.the supreme court admonition is particularly relevant in an industry,like the pharmaceutical industry,that is subject to extensive regulation in which congress has balanced the protection of intellectual property and the need for competition.specifically,in passing the hatch waxman act,congress drew a careful line between patent protection and the need to provide incentives for competition in the pharmaceutical industry.see cong.rec,statement of waxman underscoring the fundamental balance of the bill,pt,at emphasizing that the bill achieves what the congress has traditionally done in the area of intellectual property law balance the need to stimulate innovation against the goal of furthering the public interest,reprinted in.the line that congress drew between these competing objectives strongly supports the application of rule of reason scrutiny of reverse payment settlements in the pharmaceutical industry.
the goal of the hatch waxman act is to increase the availability of low cost generic drugs,pt,at,reprinted in.one method congress employed was to encourage litigated challenges by generic manufacturers against the holders of weak or narrow patents.see j b iv establishing day exclusivity period as reward for successfully challenging a patent,at under hatch waxman,manufacturers of generic drugs are encouraged to challenge weak or invalid patents on brand name drugs so consumers can enjoy lower drug prices.that goal is undermined by application of the scope of the patent test which entitles the patent holder to pay its potential generic competitors not to compete.as one commentator has noted,this approach nominally protects intellectual property,not on the strength of a patent holder legal rights,but on the strength of its wallet.see hemphill,paying for delay,supra at in the hatch waxman act the promotion and delay of litigation are central preoccupations of the regulatory regime.an permission for innovators to set innovation policy by through reverse payments is less plausible,as congress has taken explicit steps to fill those gaps.as the second circuit acknowledged in its tamoxifen decision,the principal beneficiaries of such an approach will be name brand manufacturers with weak or narrow patents that are unlikely to prevail in court.see at.thus while such a rule might be good policy from the perspective of name brand and generic pharmaceutical producers,it is bad policy from the perspective of the consumer,precisely the constituency congress was seeking to protect.
in rejecting the scope of the patent test,we are cognizant that such a test encourages settlement,an objective our decisions generally support.see,ehrheart verizon wireless,cir settlement agreements are to be encouraged because they promote the amicable resolution of disputes and lighten the increasing load of litigation faced by the federal courts.however,the judicial preference for settlement,while generally laudable,should not displace countervailing public policy objectives or,in this case,congress determination which is evident from the structure of the hatch waxman act and the statements in the legislative record that litigated patent challenges are necessary to protect consumers from unjustified monopolies by name brand drug manufacturers.we also emphasize that nothing in the rule of reason test that we adopt here limits the ability of the parties to reach settlements based on a negotiated entry date for marketing of the generic drug the only settlements subject to antitrust scrutiny are those involving a reverse payment from the name brand manufacturer to the generic challenger.data analyzed by the ftc suggest that this will leave the vast majority of pharmaceutical patent settlements unaffected.see ftc,bureau of competition,agreements filed with the federal trade commission under the medicare prescription drug,improvement,and modernization act of overview of agreements filed in fy,showing that nearly percent of hatch waxman act infringement suits that settled in did so without reverse payments,available at http.
for all of these reasons we reject the scope of the patent test.in its place we will direct the district court to apply a quick look rule of reason analysis based on the economic realities of the reverse payment settlement rather than the labels applied by the settling parties.specifically,the finder of fact must treat any payment from a patent holder to a generic patent challenger who agrees to delay entry into the market as prima facie evidence of an unreasonable restraint of trade,which could be rebutted by showing that the payment was for a purpose other than delayed entry or offers some benefit.
in holding that a reverse payment is prima facie evidence of an unreasonable restraint of trade,we follow the approach suggested by the dc circuit in andrx and embrace that court common sense conclusion that a payment flowing from the innovator to the challenging generic firm may suggest strongly the anticompetitive intent of the parties entering the agreement at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
we agree,moreover,with the ftc that there is no need to consider the merits of the underlying patent suit because a bsent proof of other offsetting consideration,it is logical to conclude that the quid pro quo for the payment was an agreement by the generic to defer entry beyond the date that represents an otherwise reasonable litigation compromise.in re schering plough,final order,at.of course,a patent holder may attempt to rebut plaintiff prima facie case of an unreasonable restraint of trade by arguing that there is in fact no reverse payment because any money that changed hands was for something other than a delay in market entry.alternatively,the patent holder may attempt to rebut the prima facie case by demonstrating that the reverse payment offers a competitive benefit that could not have been achieved in the absence of a reverse payment.this second possible defense attempts to account for the probably rare situations where a reverse payment increases competition.for example,a modest cash payment that enables a generic manufacturer to avoid bankruptcy and begin marketing a generic drug might have an overall effect of increasing the amount of competition in the market.for the reasons set forth,we will reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings in accordance with the foregoing.
iv.the class certification issue appeal 
procedural background 
the other issue before us on this appeal concerns plaintiffs effort to certify a class of persons who purchased k dur directly from schering between november,and september,and subsequently purchased a generic version of k dur.as identified by the parties experts,the class consists of wholesalers and retailers.the special master recommended granting plaintiffs motion to certify the class.the district court adopted the special master report and recommendation and formally certified the class.
defendants sought interlocutory review of the district court order under federal rule of civil procedure f.while that petition was pending,the district court ruled on the cross motions for summary judgment and entered final judgment in defendants favor.plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal,and defendants filed a cross appeal,which this court dismissed as untimely.see order,in re k dur antitrust,cir.however,this court accepted defenda
