tilly and world of jeans tops,hereafter collectively referred to in the singular as employer appeal from the trial court order denying its motion to compel arbitration of maria rebolledo putative class action regarding statutory wage claims.we agree with the trial court conclusion the parties arbitration agreement expressly excluded statutory wage claims from the arbitration obligation.the order is affirmed.
employer hired rebolledo to work in its warehouse from july,to december.she was rehired on january,and terminated october.in december she filed a lawsuit on behalf of herself and a putative class of similarly situated persons.in february she filed a first amended complaint,the operative complaint,alleging the following four causes of action against employer failure to provide meal periods failure to provide rest periods failure to pay wages of terminated or resigned employees knowing and intentional failure to comply with itemized wage statement provisions violations of the unfair competition law and enforcement of private attorneys general act of.
motion to compel arbitration 
on march,employer filed a motion to compel arbitration and dismiss the class claims.it supplied the arbitration agreement rebolledo signed in hereafter the agreement.rebolledo opposed the motion arguing the agreement expressly excluded the claims made in her lawsuit and was invalid.in addition,rebolledo argued the agreement was unconscionable for the following reasons due to language barriers,she did not understand the terms the agreement did not attach any rules of arbitration or specify which rules applied the agreement lacked mutuality and unfairly favored employer it was an adhesion contract and it was substantively unconscionable.
to support her opposition,rebolledo attached her declaration written in spanish.the translation provided to the court stated,i speak almost no english.i do not read or write in english.spanish is my first and only language.all of my oral communications with my supervisors have been in spanish.she added that at various times during her employment she was given documents to sign.she declared,these documents were presented to me by one of my superiors.the contents of the documents were not explained to me,and the superiors told me not to worry about the documents because they contained nothing bad.i was told that i was required to sign these documents.i witnessed of mine being presented with documents to sign in the same way.
rebolledo did not recall signing the agreement and she believed,i was given this document with no explanation of what the document said,no opportunity to ask questions about it,and not enough time to review and consider the document before signing.i also believe i was told that i was required to sign the document.rebolledo stated she could not read or understand the agreement because it was written in english.
in its reply motion,employer refuted all the points raised by rebolledo.in addition,employer provided evidence rebolledo signed two additional arbitration agreements on june,hereafter the agreement,and on august,the agreement.the employer noted rebolledo also executed an employment application in july in which she agreed to sign an arbitration agreement if she were to be employed.employer asserted all the arbitration agreements contained in bold capital letters above the signature line a clear warning to rebolledo that she was giving up her right to a jury trial and to appeal the arbitrator decision.
employment application employment agreement.
rebolledo employment application requested her employment history and contained four paragraphs written in very small type font immediately above the space provided for her signature.she placed her initials next to each paragraph.the first paragraph related to certifying the information provided in her employment history.the second paragraph authorized employer to investigate her references and background.the third was an agreement to arbitrate any disputes arising out of submission of the application.in addition,it stated i understand that if i am offered employment i will be asked to sign a agreement that applies to disputes arising from my employment with employer.the fourth paragraph clarified the application was not an employment contract.
rebolledo started working june.on june,she signed a document entitled,tilly employment agreement.the first page contained the statement employment was at will and a provision stating rebolledo agreed to read and follow the terms contained in the employer handbook.the remaining page and were devoted to information regarding mediation and arbitration.
in the agreement the parties agreed to mediate any dispute arising out of employment,except workers compensation claims,unemployment insurance,and matters governed by the california labor commissioner.
the arbitration provision provided as follows arbitration.in the event mediation does not resolve the parties dispute,employee and employer agree to submit all disputes arising from employment excepting workers compensation claims,unemployment insurance,and matters governed by the california labor commissioner,including,but not limited to breach of contract,wrongful termination,violation of public policy,discrimination,and harassment to binding arbitration with the american arbitration association aaa under the aaa national rules for the resolution of employment disputes.
the next paragraph stated orange county,california was the proper venue for any arbitration proceedings.the agreement provided if employee and employer are unable to agree on a neutral arbitrator,employer will obtain a list of arbitrators from aaa.employee first and then employer will alternately strike names from the list until only one name remains.
in the next paragraph,the parties agreed code of civil procedure section would govern discovery conducted before arbitration and the arbitrator would conduct a hearing based on aaa rules.the employer stated the arbitrator would issue a written opinion and award.employee and employer agree that arbitration is the exclusive forum for resolving all disputes arising out of or involving employee employment with employer or the termination of that employment,including,but not limited to,actions for w rongful t ermination,d iscrimination,h arassment,or any violation of public policy with the exception of claims for workers compensation,unemployment insurance and any matter within the jurisdiction of the california labor commissioner provided,however,that either party may file a request with a court of competent jurisdiction for provisional remedies,including,but not limited to injunctions and restraining orders,pending resolution of any dispute through the arbitration procedure set forth herein.because it is relevant to our analysis anon,we point out the agreement defines the type of claims excluded from arbitration as including both matters governed by and matter s within the jurisdiction of the california labor commissioner.in drafting the agreement,employer treated the two phrases as being interchangeable.
the final paragraph of the agreement discussed the payment of arbitration costs and fees employer agrees to pay all reasonable arbitration costs that would exceed costs employee would pay in court.the parties are responsible for their own attorney fees.the final statement of the agreement,written in capital letters and bold type,stated,employee and employer acknowledge they are giving up their right to a jury trial and to appeal the arbitrator decision.capitalization and bold omitted.the agreement contained rebolledo signature but employer did not sign it.
the agreement 
rebolledo was rehired on january.in march,during this second period of employment,she signed a document entitled,employmentagreement sic.it contained the following short paragraph employee and employer agree that arbitration is the exclusive forum for resolving all disputes arising out of or involving employee employment with employer and the termination of that employment,including,but not limited to,actions for w rongful t ermination,d iscrimination,h arassment,or any violation of public policy with the exception of claims for workers compensation,unemployment insurance and any matter within the jurisdiction of the california labor commissioner provided,however,that either party may file a request with a court of competent jurisdiction for provisional remedies,under code of civil procedure s ection,pending resolution of any dispute through the arbitration procedure set forth herein.italics omitted.as in the agreement,employer agreed to pay whatever arbitration costs exceeded the costs of litigation and specified each side would bear their own attorney fees.the final statement of the agreement,written in capital letters and bold type,stated,employee and employer acknowledge you are both giving up your right to a jury trial and to appeal the arbitrator decision.capitalization and bold omitted.the agreement contained rebolledo signature and the signature of the employer director of human resources.it did not contain many of the details concerning arbitration described in the agreement.
the agreement 
on august,rebolledo signed the employer handbookacknowledgement sic.like the agreement,the document is half a page long and contains the identical arbitration provisions,with one exception this document does not include the phrase exempting from the agreement any matter within the jurisdiction of the california labor commissioner.other than the title,there is no other mention of a handbook within the document.rebolledo signed the document.there was no place on the agreement for employer signature.
counsel for rebolledo filed a response arguing the reply brief contained several new pieces of evidence.counsel argued these documents did not prove rebolledo could read and understand english,or that she understood her dispute would be subject to arbitration.to the contrary,the evidence confirm ed employer placed a variety of conflicting and confusing arbitration agreements in front of its employees and required them to sign without ever confirming that the employees could read,let alone understand,what they were signing.rebolledo provided a supplemental declaration written in spanish but accompanied by an english translation.rebolledo stated,i have had the opportunity to review a document entitled employment application,the handwriting on the document,besides the signature and the initials to the left of the text in the bottom section of the document,is not mine.this is the handwriting of another person who read the application questions to me in spanish,to whom i told my answers in spanish,and who then translated my answers and filled out the paper in english.
supplemental briefing 
after considering oral argument the court took the matter under submission.three days later it issued a minute order continuing the hearing days to permit the parties to file supplemental briefs regarding the execution and enforceability of the agreement.
employer submitted a supplemental brief.it argued the court tentative ruling was incorrect.employer asserted the agreement was bilateral even though it was missing employer signature.it maintained the agreement was enforceable.
rebolledo filed supplemental briefing,arguing the agreement,like the and agreements,was procedurally and substantively unconscionable and should not be enforced.rebolledo submitted another supplemental declaration.she repeated she did not read,write,or speak english,and spanish was her first and only language.she spoke to her supervisors only in spanish.she restated her recollection that her supervisors gave her documents to sign at various times during her employment.the documents were not explained to her and she was required to sign them.she remembered being told the documents contained nothing bad.she stated the agreement appears to contain my signature.however she clarified,while i do not have a specific recollection of signing this document,i have noticed on the handbook acknowledgment agreement that the blank titled employee signature is not in my handwriting.i believe this document was presented to me by maria pena,a former supervisor.pena would occasionally bring documents around for me to sign while at her place of employment,and she always did it while i was working on the line.i was just told that the company required me to sign,so i should sign,and i did.rebolledo clarified no one explained what the document said,she had no opportunity to ask questions about it,and she was not given time to review it.she was told signing was a requirement.she was not given a copy of the document and it was presented to her with no opportunity for translation.she added,the employer personnel,including but not limited to pena,were aware she could not read or write english and could speak very little english.all of my communications with them were in spanish.
c.the trial court ruling 
the trial court issued a minute order denying employer motion to compel arbitration.it ruled as follows with respect to the agreement the employment application was superseded by the agreement the agreement was not translated for rebolledo the agreement expressly exclude d any matter within the jurisdiction of the california labor commissioner.the labor commission jurisdiction is not limited to claims filed by a l itigant this language of the agreement is broad enough to include claims that have not been filed the commission can also assert its jurisdiction on matters under its own authority.the current claims could be subject to the commission jurisdiction and are,therefore,expressly excluded and by its express terms the agreement survived rebolledo termination.
with respect to the agreement,the court made the following findings the language of this agreement does not by its terms supersede the agreement the agreement expressly excludes any matter within the jurisdiction of the california labor commissioner.the labor commissioner jurisdiction is not limited to claims filed by a l itigant.this language of the agreement is broad enough to include claims that have not been filed.the commission can also assert its jurisdiction on matters under its own authority.the current claims could be subject to the commission jurisdiction and are,therefore,expressly excluded the agreement is expressly unenforceable due to the lack of signatures of the president,senior vice president and director of human resources which are needed to change the policy.this agreement clearly states that the signatures of all three must by obtained.there are no employer agents signatures on this agreement.it lacks mutuality.
the court also determined the agreement was unenforceable,stating,this document is a modification of the prior agreements because the language in the agreement is changed.it,however,does not expressly supersede the and agreements.although plaintiff has signed the document there is no indication that the document was translated for her or that she understood the terms of the handbook.her declaration attached to the opposition indicates she does not speak or understand english and did not understand the term arbitration.
the court also noted,the agreement which is never stated to be superseded requires the signatures of three executives of employer to modify it and they are not on this document.although the e mployer can unilaterally modify an employment contract there must be reasonable notice of their intent to do so and that is lacking here.this agreement also is illusory in that it does not state or identify the rules of the arbitration to be conducted which are material term s missing from the agreement.

legal principles regarding interpretation of arbitration agreements 
the right to arbitration depends upon contract a petition to compel arbitration is simply a suit in equity seeking specific performance of that contract.citations.there is no public policy favoring arbitration of disputes which the parties have not agreed to arbitrate.citation.engineers architects community development th.whether the parties formed a valid agreement to arbitrate is determined under general california contract law.citations.hence,when ruling on a petition to compel arbitration,the superior court may consider evidence on factual issues such as contract formation bearing on the threshold issue of arbitrability.citation.citations.hotels nevada pacific center th.
the basic goal of contract interpretation is to give effect to the parties mutual intent at the time of contracting.citations.when a contract is reduced to writing,the parties intention is determined from the writing alone,if possible.the words of a contract are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense,see also lloyd underwriters craig rush,th,we interpret the intent and scope of the agreement by focusing on the usual and ordinary meaning of the language used and the circumstances under which the agreement was made.founding members of the newport beach country club newport beach country club,th.finally,ambiguities in standard form contracts are to be construed against the drafter.citations.this court must apply the above basic principles of contract interpretation to determine whether rebolledo causes of action fall within the scope of the arbitration clause.victoria superior court cal d,arbitration has become accepted and favored method,h owever,judicial enthusiasm for alternative methods of dispute resolution must not in all contexts override the rules governing the interpretation of contracts.
within the labor commissioner jurisdiction 
the court determined the and agreements did not compel arbitration of rebolledo claims because both agreements expressly exclude d any matter within the jurisdiction of the california labor commissioner.the court determined this provision was broadly written to include any statutory wage claim not actually filed with the labor commissioner,as long as the claim theoretically could have fallen within the labor commissioner authority.the court reasoned the various labor code violations raised in the case were of the type that could have been considered by the labor commissioner,and therefore,were exempted from arbitration.before addressing employer assertion the court was wrong,a brief summary of the labor commissioner scope of authority and jurisdiction is instructive.
the california labor commission is part of the department of labor standards and enforcement dlse,which is under the department of industrial relations.the dlse enforces wage and labor standards and all labor laws not specifically delegated to another agency,fair employment and housing administration,division of occupational safety and health,or division of workers compensation.judith mcilwee,circuit city meets the california labor commissioner does the faa preempt administrative claims.
i f an employer fails to pay wages in the amount,time,or manner required by contract or statute,the employee may seek administrative relief by filing a wage claim with the labor commissioner or,in the alternative,may seek judicial relief by filing an ordinary civil action for breach of contract for the wages prescribed by statute.post associates cal th,post.with respect to the first alternative,the labor commissioner has broad authority to reject,investigate,adjudicate,or litigate on behalf of the employee,depending on the nature of the employee claim.see.
s ection includes remedial procedures for adjudicating wage claims,enforced by the dlse under the direction of the c ommissioner.it states that the c ommissioner shall have the authority to investigate employee complaints,subd.a.the c ommissioner may provide for a hearing in any action to recover wages,penalties,and other demands for compensation.ibid.if the c ommissioner decides to accept the matter and conduct an administrative hearing commonly known as a berman hearing after the name of its sponsor,then assemblyman howard berman he or she must hold the hearing within days post,supra,cal th at.the berman hearing procedure is designed to provide a speedy,informal,and affordable method of resolving wage claims.citation.as explained by our supreme court,the purpose of the berman hearing procedure is to avoid recourse to costly and judicial proceedings in all but the most complex of wage claims.citation.id.at.
in addition to conducting a berman hearing,the labor commissioner has the option of filing a civil action.action to recover unpaid wages.when the labor commissioner takes action to collect wages or benefits on behalf of a worker,the commissioner acts as a trustee of the monies collected and has an affirmative duty to make a diligent search to locate any worker for whom unpaid wages or benefits have been collected.
the legislature has also empowered the labor commissioner to enforce the labor laws including iwc wage orders,by issuing subpoenas compelling witness attendance and production of documents,accepting assignment of wage and other claims such as enforcement of workers compensation awards,mechanics liens,collecting wages and benefits without the worker assignment,seeking injunctions against willful violations of state wage and hour laws.see chin et,cal.practice guide employment litigation the rutter group,to.
certain employment matters can not be considered by the labor commissioner.the commissioner has the duty to determine if the employee claim falls within his or her jurisdiction before proceeding forward.for example,section authorizes the labor commissioner to only prosecute claims properly before the commissioner.it specifies the labor commissioner shall determine all matters arising under his or her jurisdiction,subd.a.some examples of employment matters that do not fall within the jurisdiction of the labor commissioner are claims involving bankruptcies or probate claims involving mechanics,loggers,or minors preferred wage claims in assignment for the benefit of creditors discrimination and retaliation complaints under sections,or matters where criminal or civil citations are issued such as for child labor law violations,unlicensed contractors,payday violations,welfare benefits.see chin et,cal.practice guide employment litigation,supra.
that there are definite limits to the labor commissioner jurisdiction was demonstrated in noble draper th,noble.in that case,the court held the labor commissioner has no jurisdiction to adjudicate tort claims involving conduct that predated the employment relationship or unfair business practice claims under the business and professions code.id.at.the case involved foreign restaurant workers who brought an action claiming defendant induced them to come to the united states and work in a restaurant but they were terminated and not compensated for their work.id.at.the workers first pursued claims for unpaid wages before the labor commissioner.id.at.following the administrative hearing,the workers filed a civil action alleging fraud,negligent misrepresentation,false advertising,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and a statutory claim of unfair business practices under the business and professions code.defendant argued that after choosing an administrative forum,the workers claims were barred by res judicata.ibid.the court disagreed.it reasoned,administrative agencies have only such powers as have been conferred on them,expressly or by implication,by constitution or statute.citation.the labor code generally gives the dlse of which the labor commissioner is the chief the authority to enforce the provisions of the labor code and all state labor laws the enforcement of which is not specifically vested in any other officer,board,or commission.none of the claims at issue in this appeal alleged violation of any provision of the labor code or other state labor laws.noble,supra,th at.the court concluded the civil action was not precluded by the worker prior pursuit of wage claims before the labor commissioner.
in the case before us,the parties agree rebolledo claims fall within the commissioner jurisdiction.rebolledo alleged employer failed to provide meal periods and rest periods or wages in lieu thereof in violation of sections and pay wages of terminated or resigned employees as required by sections and and comply with itemized wage statement provisions in violation of section and,subdivision d.she alleged these violations entitled her to recover civil penalties under the private attorneys general act of et.seq.
section provides the labor commissioner may enforce the provisions of the labor code and all labor laws of the state the enforcement of which is not specifically vested in any other officer,board or commission.clearly rebolledo sought enforcement of various labor code provisions and labor laws in her lawsuit.her statutory wage claims fall into the category of matters governed by and matter s within the jurisdiction of the labor commissioner.
statutory wage claims expressly excluded from the arbitration agreement 
employer admits the and agreements explicitly exclude certain claims from the arbitration obligation.it asserts these exceptions do not apply in this case and rebolledo statutory wage claims must be arbitrated.we disagree.
the sole issue presented in this appeal is simply a matter of contract interpretation.we will begin by considering the agreement.the parties generally agreed to arbitrate all employment disputes but excluded several types of employee claims from arbitration.the agreement expressly exempted from arbitration the following three broad categories workers compensation claims unemployment insurance claims and matters governed by the california labor commissioner.italics added.with respect to the third category of claims,the agreement also defined them as including any matter within the jurisdiction of the california labor commissioner.italics added.
on appeal,the parties offer different interpretations of the phrases matters governed by and matter s within the jurisdiction of the labor commissioner.both sides assert the language is not ambiguous.as we will explain more fully below,we conclude the language plainly stated rebolledo statutory wage claims were exempted from the arbitration agreement.the phrases at issue served to define the type of exempted employment claims as including disputes an employee could have brought before the labor commissioner.the parties intended for employment disputes falling outside the scope of that definition to be arbitrated.we reject employer strained interpretation that the language served to exclude wage claims based on the forum selected by the employee,excluding wage claims actually brought before the labor commissioner.
as explained earlier in this opinion,the scope of the labor commissioner jurisdiction is limited by statute.noble,supra,th at commissioner has only such powers as have been conferred on him or her by constitution or statue.by defining the type of excluded claims as being limited to matters governed by or within the jurisdiction of the commissioner,the parties intended to exclude employment claims alleging violations of the labor code or other state labor law.
we reject employer assertion within the jurisdiction meant claims actually filed with the commissioner.when an employee claim falls within the jurisdiction of the commissioner,the employee has the option of filing the statutory wage claim before the commissioner or in superior court.post,supra,cal th at.the employee has two forums for bringing such claims.moreover,parties can agree to arbitrate statutory wage claims regardless of the chosen forum.see at t mobility llc concepcion concepcion sonic calabasas a,moreno cal th,sonic calabasas a,ii.accordingly,the ordinary meaning of the phrases at issue clearly relates to defining the nature of a claim,not where it is adjudicated.indeed,to adopt employer interpretation we would have to ignore the portion of the agreement defining the exempted claims as matters governed by the labor commissioner because this terminology does not suggest a particular forum of litigation,only a type of subject matter.
if employer intended to exclude only statutory wage claims brought in one forum over another it could have narrowly drafted and defined the phrases matters governed and matter s within the jurisdiction to mean claims actually filed with the commissioner or claims being litigated in a berman hearing.alternatively,employer could have clarified employee was agreeing to arbitrate statutory wage claims not brought before the labor commissioner.however,without language qualifying or limiting the forum for statutory wage claims,an employee would reasonably understand the plain language of exclusion covered all statutory wage claims regardless of where they were adjudicated.victoria,supra,cal d at we must give effect to the parties intentions,in light of the usual and ordinary meaning of the contractual language and the circumstances under which the agreement was made.we would have to rewrite the agreement to expressly limit the exclusion to claims actually filed in a particular forum.this we can not do.
employer argues that because the labor commissioner never asserted jurisdiction over rebolledo wage claims she must arbitrate them.employer provides case authority describing the circumstances when the labor commissioner loses its jurisdiction over a worker wage claim.these cases do not assist employer.in post,supra,cal th at page,the supreme court held the timely filing of an appeal terminates the commissioner jurisdiction.similarly,in murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th,another case cited by employer,our supreme court verified the appeal of the commissioner decision is a de novo trial of the wage dispute.this case does not concern the appeal of a labor commissioner award.
employer also maintains these cases prove the labor commissioner lost jurisdiction of rebolledo lawsuit because she filed her action in superior court.this argument misses the point.the issue on appeal is not whether we should apply a first in time approach to jurisdiction in this case.we need not decide whether the labor commissioner authority to investigate wage violations is trumped once a worker files a lawsuit in superior court.in ruling on a motion to compel arbitration,we need only determine whether the parties actually agreed to arbitrate this particular kind of dispute.accordingly,the dispositive issue is the clear and ordinary meaning of the phrases matters governed and matters within the jurisdiction.a statutory wage claim qualifies as a matter governed by the labor commissioner regardless of whether he or she is actively adjudicating the case.
another argument raised by employer is that the ordinary meaning of the phrases at issue must be viewed in the context of the two other excluded claims.specifically,the agreement e
