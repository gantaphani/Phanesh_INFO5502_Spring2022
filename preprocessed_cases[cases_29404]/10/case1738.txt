plaintiff and appellant robert cornell plaintiff brought this action against robinson ford defendant,alleging violation of california automobile sales finance act asfa,et all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise stated additionally,he claims the consumer legal remedies act clra et and the unfair competition law ucl bus,et were violated by way of the predicate asfa nondisclosure violations.plaintiff vehicle purchase contract from defendant allegedly misrepresented the actual price of the new vehicle,by improperly calculating it with respect to the actual cash value of his other vehicle that was traded in as part of the transaction,but on which he still owed a larger loan balance.in such a case,the existing loan value on the vehicle that was traded in exceeds its current cash value see graciano robinson ford sales,th,d.the purpose of such a practice is allegedly to make the purchase contract more attractive to lenders who may consider taking assignment of the contract,or to achieve a certain monthly payment for the customer.
plaintiff brought a motion for certification of the proposed class,which he defined as including all persons who,since december,purchased a vehicle from robinson ford sales by entering into a retail installment sales contract risc and had the cash price of the vehicle being purchased increased on line.of the risc to cover some or all of the the difference in the amount owed and the actual cash value of a vehicle and robinson ford failed to properly disclose the prior credit or lease balance owing on the on line.g of the risc.plaintiff argued this proposed class was sufficiently ascertainable,there was a community of interest,and there were common questions of law and fact among the members of the class.civ.code,subd.b clra code civ.
defendant opposed the motion on all grounds,chiefly arguing that the class was not ascertainable,there was no community of interest among class members,nor any sufficient evidence as to numerosity,plaintiff cornell was not typical of the class members,and his successor lewis could not adequately represent the class.
the trial court denied the motion on the basis that there was no ascertainable class.at oral argument,it commented,i do think that each case would have to be litigated separately with regard to areas of fraud and punitive damages,subd.a,a permitting punitive damages awards under the clra.
plaintiff appeals,contending the subject statutory schemes amount to strict liability provisions for certain nondisclosures,such that any consideration of individualized common law fraud or punitive damages issues was inappropriate in the class certification decision.he contends all of the criteria for class certification were satisfied,and no superior method to obtain complete relief for the class was available outside of a basis.discovery has shown there are approximately putative class members who were all involved in similar transactions involving adjusted cash prices,and those transactions could be generally analyzed through the available sales documentation in defendant records.
we agree that plaintiff has made an adequate showing for certification of the proposed class,and the trial court erred in concluding otherwise.the order is reversed with directions to grant the motion to certify the class and to conduct appropriate further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
atransactions and participants 
on august,cornell purchased a new ford truck at defendant automobile dealership in calexico,california.at that time,he traded in a honda vehicle on which he still owed,although the cash value of the honda was only.the seller credited the buyer with for the value of the honda,and increased the cash price of the vehicle being purchased accordingly in the purchase contract.there were other terms that are not relevant here,such as an additional down.cornell had mechanical difficulties with the new truck and pursued lemon law remedies,and eventually returned it to defendant.
based on the of the honda,the cash price charged to cornell for his new truck was not the cash price that would have been put on his contract if he were a cash buyer pursuant to the asfa,section,subdivision e.he took possession of the ford truck in arizona and was not required to pay any sales tax on the vehicle.he registered it in his home state of oregon,where residents pay a flat rate for registration of a vehicle,such that the expense of registration was not calculated on the cash price of the vehicle.
complaint and motion proposed class defendants 
plaintiff action was filed in november against defendant dealer and also ford motor company,and pled statutory causes of action for inadequate disclosures under the asfa,and related claims under the clra and the ucl unlawful or unfair business practices.the clra allegations referred to deceptive practices through the selling of vehicles over the advertised price,subd.a.various forms of relief were sought,including actual and consequential damages,rescission and restitution,and further,punitive damages under the clra only the class allegations were added after the original plaintiff died in,his personal representative was substituted,and an existing trial date was vacated.
before summarizing plaintiff statutory arguments,we look to the definitions of the relevant terms as explained by this court in thompson rv sales,th,d thompson.an in this context is the difference between the appraised or actual cash value of a,and the amount put on the risc as the value of the vehicle.negative equity in a sales transaction involving a vehicle results when the loan balance on the buyer vehicle is greater than its value.ibid.
the operative complaint is the second amended complaint the complaint,alleging that defendant commonly entered into riscs with consumers in which defendant rolled some or all of the from a into the cash price of the vehicle being purchased this practice usually took the form of failure to disclose prior credit or lease balances on the vehicles.plaintiff contends that where,as here,the buyer negative equity is concealed in the cash price by the inclusion of an for a,the proper statutory disclosures of the actual cash price were not made,the may potentially pay higher amounts of sales tax and higher registration fees because of the rolled negative equity,and the contract may be unenforceable by statute.plaintiff contends defendant misrepresented and misstated the cash price of the new vehicle,which was a violation of asfa disclosure requirements in several respects,and therefore was also a violation of the clra ucl.
plaintiff through the representative for cornell brought a motion for class certification,proposing a class of those persons who,since december,had entered into a risc with defendant,which included the following components the cash price of the vehicle being purchased was increased in the risc to cover some or all of the the difference in the amount owed and the actual cash value of a vehicle,and the prior credit or lease balance owing on the was not properly disclosed on the risc.plaintiff argued the claims in the complaint could be appropriately litigated in a class action under the asfa,and in accordance with the class action criteria set forth in the clra,subd.b.
in plaintiff attorney supporting declarations,deposition excerpts from defendant sales manager and employees were incorporated to demonstrate that pursuant to defendant records,there were approximately purchase contracts that might represent potential class members.such transactions were documented in deal jackets that normally included a risc,a recap deal sheet,the vehicle invoice,or related documents,from which the could be calculated.plaintiff submitted a proposed notice of pendency of class action,defining the class as outlined above.
defendant opposed the motion,arguing that even though it had processed numerous purchase transactions in this manner,a class action was nevertheless inappropriate,because the proposed class was not ascertainable and the necessary community of interest among class members was lacking.defendant referred to the individualized negotiations that each potential class member must have conducted in purchasing a vehicle and arranging for a,and claimed proper disclosures had been made orally in some cases.defendant also argued there was insufficient evidence as to numerosity,cornell was not typical of the class members,his successor lewis could not adequately represent the class,and the motion should have been brought earlier in the proceedings.in reply,plaintiff maintained that all of the elements for class certification were satisfied.
at oral argument before the trial court,the parties discussed the criteria to be used in deciding a motion for class certification.defendant contended that even if there were common issues regarding potential statutory violations under the asfa,there were still reasons to deny the class certification because each potential plaintiff case would have to be litigated separately with regard to how the deal was negotiated,particularly with regard to potential violations of clra,which could result in punitive damages awards.in response,plaintiff argued the various form contracts could be analyzed in like manner for whether they properly disclosed the negative equity represented by a vehicle,as opposed to inflating the supposed sale price.plaintiff contended there was no fraud or tort cause of action pled,but rather allegations of deceptive business practices under the standards of the asfa,which did not involve any punitive damages claims.even though punitive damages were potentially available under the clra,that should not preclude class treatment because the merits of the underlying statutory violations alleged had not yet been resolved.
the court based its tentative ruling primarily on a finding that the class was not ascertainable.although the court questioned whether plaintiff,the personal representative of cornell,would be an adequate representative of the class since the facts of cornell particular transaction had not required him to pay any increased sales tax or registration fees that were based on an inflated sale price,the court did not consider that to be a dispositive factor.rather,the court stated,each case would have to be litigated separately with regard to areas of fraud and punitive damages.the court concluded by stating,i think you would have testimony forthcoming to a jury,particularly in the area of punitive damages,and under those circumstances i just do find that we have an ascertainable class that would be represented by cornell factual situation 
the trial court issued an order denying class certification.the ruling states court finds there is no ascertainable class.motion for class certification is denied.plaintiff appeals.
discussion 
we first set out the standard of review and principles governing class certification rulings.we then consider the merits of the ruling with respect to the different statutory schemes pled.
standard of review and general class action rules 
trial courts are normally afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification.lockheed martin superior court cal th,d,lockheed martin.if a trial court ruling is supported by substantial evidence,it normally will not be overturned unless improper criteria were used citation or erroneous legal assumptions were made citation citation any valid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.citation.drug stores,superior court cal th,d,drug.
in determining class certification questions,the courts do not decide the merits of the case,but must focus on whether common or individual questions are likely to arise in the action.i n determining whether there is substantial evidence to support a trial court certification order,we consider whether the theory of recovery advanced by the proponents of certification is,as an analytical matter,likely to prove amenable to class treatment.drug,supra,cal th at,d.reviewing courts consistently look to the allegations of the complaint and the declarations of attorneys representing the plaintiff class to resolve this question.id.at,d.
the criteria for class certification are well established.section of the code of civil procedure authorizes class suits in california when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court.the burden is on the party seeking certification to establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the class members.citation.lockheed martin,supra,cal th at,d.
also as outlined in lockheed martin,the community of interest requirement for class certification embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.citation.plaintiffs acknowledge it is their burden to establish the requisite community of interest and that the proponent of certification must show,inter alia,that questions of law or fact common to the class predominate over the questions affecting the individual members.citation.lockheed martin,supra,cal th at,d.
in addition to demonstrating the necessary community of interest among class members,the proponent of the class must show that the predominant common issues of law and fact can be effectively managed in a class action 
we long ago recognized that each class member might be required ultimately to justify an individual claim does not necessarily preclude maintenance of a class action.citation.predominance is a comparative concept,and the necessity for class members to individually establish eligibility and damages does not mean individual fact questions predominate.citations.individual issues do not render class certification inappropriate so long as such issues may effectively be managed.citations.nor is it a bar to certification that individual class members may ultimately need to itemize their damages.we have recognized that the need for individualized proof of damages is not per se an obstacle to class treatment.citations.drug,supra,cal th at,d.
such practical considerations are left to the discretion of the trial courts,which are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action lockheed martin,supra,cal th at,d.for example,trial courts can fashion methods to manage individual questions that are procedurally innovative citation.drug,supra,cal th at,d,see also in re cipro cases i ii th,d the ultimate question in every case of this type is whether the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance of a class action would be advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.the trial court must carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the courts.
in feitelberg credit suisse first boston,llc th,d,the court clarified that a ucl claim may be properly subject to treatment as a class action when the statutory requirements of section of the code of civil procedure are met.citation.that authority is now explicit in the amended statute,which authorizes the pursuit of representative claims or relief on behalf of others provided that the claimant complies with section of the code of civil procedure ibid.of the three varieties of unfair competition established by section,plaintiff mainly asserts the unlawful prong,based on the other alleged statutory violations.
statutory schemes for recovery analysis 
we next consider whether the theories of recovery that plaintiff is pursuing are analytically appropriate for class treatment.drug stores,supra,cal th at,d.both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the class members are required,including predominant common legal and factual questions,as well as adequate representation of typical claims by the class representative.lockheed martin,supra,cal th at,d.if such statutory causes of action could properly be handled in a class format,we also must examine the trial court ruli
