background 
in june dey filed a first amended complaint fac,a proposed class action,against vacation resorts and continental.the fac had a single cause of action for violation of the ucl,predicated on violation of the federal fair debt collection practices act fdcpa.et.
the fac alleged that under a written contract dey purchased a timeshare interest in a condominium project called the shores at lake travis the shores.the fac alleged numerous facts on information and belief,including that vacation resorts provided management services to the shores homeowners association association one of vacation resorts duties was the collection of delinquent homeowner fees vacation resorts retained continental to perform the collections work vacation resorts and continental had an agreement under which continental would not charge vacation resorts or the association any collection fees,but it would instead collect additional fees from homeowners and share the fees with vacation resorts the agreement effectively rewrote the rules of the association to provide for a penalty assessment in the form of an arbitrarily calculated collection fee against members whose accounts are referred for collection and continental regularly added a collection fee to the principal amount of debt when it enters the debt into its system prior to or contemporaneously with its first contact with the debtor.
the fac also alleged the association assessed delinquencies against him,as allowed by its written rules,and in april and may,continental sent dey collection notices.the april notice sought in principal,in interest and a collection fee of,percent of the outstanding principal.the may notice sought the same principal and collection fee and increased the amount of interest.dey paid the full amount of the may notice.
the fac alleged the collection fee constituted an unfair business practice within the meaning of the ucl.the ucl claim was based on defendants alleged violation of the fdcpa by d emanding a collection fee that does not reasonably reflect the actual cost of collection,and us ing unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect a debt by collecting a fee,charge,or expense not expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law.the complaint prayed for restitution,injunctive relief and attorney fees.the fac did not incorporate a copy of any contract or allege any particular contractual terms.
vacation resorts and continental demurred to the fac on the grounds of uncertainness and failure to state a cause of action.after a hearing,the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.

a demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law.city of chula vista county of san diego th,d.in reviewing the propriety of the sustaining of a demurrer,the court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.citations.the court does not,however,assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.citation.the judgment must be affirmed if any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken.citations.citation.however,it is error for a trial court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory.citation.and it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d.we review the trial court ruling independently.mccall pacificare of,cal th,d.
the ucl does not proscribe specific acts,but broadly prohibits unfair competition,meaning any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising.bus.the ucl governs business practices as well as injuries to consumers,and has as a major purpose the preservation of fair business competition.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.because business professions code,section is written in the disjunctive,it establishes three varieties of unfair or practices which are unlawful,or unfair,or fraudulent.in other words,a practice is prohibited as unfair or deceptive even if not unlawful and vice versa.ibid.
by proscribing any unlawful business practice,business professions code,section borrows violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful practices that the unfair competition law makes independently actionable,supra,cal th,d.dey relies on provisions of the fdcpa as the basis for his ucl claim.
the purpose of the fdcpa is to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors.e.the fac alleged defendants violated title united states code section,which prohibits the collection of any amount including any interest,fee,charge,or expense incidental to the principal obligation unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law.italics added.
as the trial court explained,however,dey did not attach any contract to the complaint,and the complaint did not allege how or why the collection fees at issue were not expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt.the complaint merely alleged dey acquired his time share interest under a written contract and,on information and belief,the written rules of the association provide that it is entitled to recover costs incurred by it in the collection of delinquent assessments.
in their demurrer to the fac,defendants argued the pleading was insufficient because,among other reasons,it did not allege any particular contract terms.in his opposition,instead of offering to rectify the problem,dey criticized defendants for raising contract issues as they are red herrings.none of them are even remotely relevant to the violations alleged,which stem from the conduct of vacation resorts and continental,not from any actions or failures to act by any other person or entity.accordingly,the trial court properly found the fac did not allege a violation of title united states code insofar as the statute pertains to fees not expressly authorized by an agreement.
as the court further noted,the fac did not allege how the collection fee was not permitted by law,the alternative ground for liability under title united states code section.in the absence of an express agreement,whether charges are permissible within the meaning of the fdcpa turns on california law.hunt check recovery systems,d,italics added.it is dey burden to demonstrate why the collection fee is illegal,rather than defendants burden to justify that it is legal for it to charge a fee for the service.berryman merit property management,th,d berryman.
