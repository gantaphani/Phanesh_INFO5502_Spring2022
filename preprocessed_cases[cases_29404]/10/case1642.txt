introduction 
plaintiff and appellant lauren hervey hervey purchased an automobile insurance policy from defendant and respondent mercury casualty company mercury.hervey alleges mercury breached the policy by offsetting uninsured motorist payments due her for injuries suffered in an automobile accident with the amount mercury paid hervey under the medical expense coverage in the same policy for the same accident.according to hervey,mercury took the offset notwithstanding the title of the medical expense coverage endorsement medical excess,no reimbursement.the operative terms of that endorsement deleted only the medical expense payments offset or reimbursement provisions from liability recoveries from those responsible for the accident.the medical expense endorsement did not delete the offset or reimbursement provision contained in the uninsured motorist section of the policy,the provision upon which mercury relied for its right of offset for medical expense payments made by mercury.we hold that the trial court properly sustained without leave to amend mercury demurrer to hervey class action complaint because the policy was not reasonably susceptible to hervey interpretation of it.
background 
as this appeal arises from an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,the facts are taken from those alleged in the complaint and those judicially noticed.
hervey purchased from mercury automobile insurance that included medical expense coverage.the medical expense endorsement contains,inter alia,the following language this endorsement forms part of the policy shown below,all other terms and conditions of this policy remain unchanged medical excess,no reimbursement.condition of part ii and exclusion j,part ii are hereby deleted from the policy.the policy declaration page specifies medical expense coverage,and the box entitled no excess no reimbursement is checked.
the provision deleted by the medical expense endorsement in part ii expenses for medical,condition of the policy,provides in part,reimbursement provisions if payment is made under this coverage expenses for medical services,to or on behalf of any person,such person agrees to reimburse the company to the extent of such payment from the proceeds of a any settlement or judgment that may result from the exercise of any rights of recovery of such person against any party that such person claims is responsible for bodily injury to the person for which payment under medical expense coverage has been made.b any payment received or to be received by or on behalf of an injured person under the provisions of any automobile or premises insurance affording benefits for medical expenses,individual blanket or group accident,disability or hospitalization insurance,medical,surgical,hospital or funeral service,benefits or reimbursement plan,workers compensation or disability benefits law or any similar law.
the medical expense endorsement also deleted exclusion j of part ii,which excludes from coverage,expenses payable under this part,if the expenses are paid,payable or eligible for payment under the terms and conditions of any automobile or premises insurance affording benefits for medical expenses,individual,blanket,or group accident,disability or hospitalization insurance,medical or surgical reimbursement plan,association or corporation plan providing hospital,surgical,medical or similar benefits to participants,enrollees or members.no payment shall be made,under this part until claim for the expenses incurred shall have been first submitted to the benefit providers listed in thru above,and such providers have paid their limit of payment or furnished their applicable limit of service and the insured furnishes a written statement from the provider s as proof.no payment shall be made,under this part for medical expenses incurred which the insured is not required to pay 
focusing on the exclusions in the medical expense endorsement,the parties dispute the continuing applicability of part iv uninsured motorists motorists coverage,condition c,which states,if the insured has valid and collectible automobile medical payment insurance available to him or her,the damages which the insured shall be entitled to recover from the owner or operator of the uninsured motor vehicle shall be reduced for purposes of uninsured motorist coverage by the amounts paid or due to be paid under the automobile medical payment insurance.
hervey was involved in an automobile accident caused by an uninsured driver.hervey claimed under the medical expense coverage,and mercury paid,medical expenses she incurred as a result of the injuries she received in the accident.thereafter,hervey claimed amounts under the uninsured motorist section of her policy for the injuries she suffered as a result of the same accident caused by the uninsured driver.mercury agreed to settle the uninsured motorist claim,but took the position that it would offset against any amount payable for uninsured motorist coverage the amount it paid hervey under the medical expense coverage.
hervey complaint is on her own behalf and on behalf of a class composed of all similarly situated insureds who had medical coverage under a mercury automobile policy.hervey alleged claims for breach of contract,declaratory relief,and a violation of business and professions code section et unfair competition law.mercury demurred and moved to strike the complaint.mercury also requested judicial notice of the specimen policy and endorsement issued to hervey,to which request hervey objected.hervey,in opposition to mercury demurrer and motion,requested judicial notice of her demand for inspection and mercury response,which response included mercury specimen insurance policy and endorsement.the trial court denied mercury request for judicial notice,but granted hervey request.the trial court then sustained mercury demurrer without leave to amend,deemed the motion to strike moot,and ruled that each side was to bear her or its own costs and attorney fees.thereafter,the trial court entered judgment in favor of mercury,and hervey timely filed a notice of appeal.

standard of review 
the standard of review on appeal following the sustaining of a demurrer is de novo.linear technology applied materials,th.in reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer,we are guided by rules.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.blank kirwan cal d,see also randi muroc joint unified school dist.cal th.
when a demurrer is sustained without leave to amend,the reviewing court must determine whether there is a reasonable probability that the complaint could have been amended to cure the defect.a determination by the reviewing court that there is such a reasonable probability results in the conclusion that the trial court abused its discretion by denying leave to amend.williams housing authority of los angeles th.the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that the complaint could have been amended to cure the defect.campbell regents of university of california cal th.
interpretation of insurance policy 
ordinary rules of contract interpretation apply to insurance policies.see aiu ins.superior court cal d.under statutory rules of contract interpretation,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.citations.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.citation.the clear and explicit meaning of these provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage citation,controls judicial interpretation.citation.thus,if the meaning a layperson would ascribe to contract language is not ambiguous,we apply that meaning.citations.in the insurance context,we generally resolve ambiguities in favor of coverage.citations.similarly,we generally interpret the coverage clauses of insurance policies broadly,protecting the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.citations.these rules stem from the fact that the insurer typically drafts policy language,leaving the insured little or no meaningful opportunity or ability to bargain for modifications.citations.because the insurer writes the policy,it is held responsible for ambiguous policy language,which is therefore construed in favor of coverage,fn.omitted see powerine oil,superior court cal th,while insurance contracts have special features,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.
parol evidence is admissible to interpret an insurance policy if relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible.garcia truck ins.exchange cal d.although parol evidence may be admissible to determine whether the terms of a contract are ambiguous see dore arnold worldwide,cal th,it is not admissible if it contradicts a clear and explicit policy provision.see supervalu,wexford underwriting managers,th,supervalu.to the extent the rules of contract interpretation involve parol evidence,the evidence is admissible as follows the determination whether to admit parol evidence involves a process.first,the court provisionally receives without actually admitting all credible evidence concerning the parties intentions to determine ambiguity,whether the language is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged by a party.if in light of the extrinsic evidence the court decides the language is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged,the extrinsic evidence is then admitted to aid the second the contract quoting general motors superior court th.supervalu,supra,th at.
the admission of extrinsic evidence to interpret a written document is explained in winet price th.dist,as follows p arol evidence is properly admitted to construe a written instrument when its language is ambiguous.the test of whether parol evidence is admissible to construe an ambiguity is not whether the language appears to the court unambiguous,but whether the evidence presented is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language is reasonably susceptible.citation.the application of this principle would preclude a court from granting a demurrer based on a written document that is attached to and incorporated into a complaint by reference.also,it appears inconsistent with the general rule that the interpretation of a document is a question of law to be decided by the court when it is not ambiguous and there is no extrinsic evidence.these two principles are reconciled by reference to the terms of a complaint.when the complaint fails to allege that the terms of the contract have any special meaning,the court can construe the language of the document on its face to determine whether as a matter of law the contract is reasonably subject to a construction sufficient to sustain a cause of action in response to a demurrer.however,when the plaintiff alleges a meaning to the document that is reasonable in light of its terms,the court can not grant a demurrer but must permit the admission of extrinsic evidence regarding the meaning of the document as intended by the parties.miller starr,cal.real estate ed.contracts,com.compare trident center connecticut general life insurance cir,california essentially has no parol evidence rule with banco do brasil latian d,fn.and,yes,judge kozinski,there is a parol evidence rule in lessons of a pyrrhic victory.it has also been held that when a party attaches a contract to a complaint and alleges its interpretation of the contract,the failure to plead what extrinsic evidence will be offered does not waive or forfeit any right to introduce such evidence.see southern pacific land westlake farms,d,see also hayter trucking,shell western e p,th.
when the facts are undisputed,as they are deemed to be when ruling on a demurrer,the interpretation of a contract,including whether an insurance policy is ambiguous or whether an exclusion or limitation is sufficiently conspicuous,plain,and clear,is a question of law.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,fire ins.exchange superior court th,united states automobile baggett d,ambiguity issue of law croskey,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group,whether exclusion or limitation is conspicuous,plain and clear question of law croskey.
judicial notice 
the trial court denied mercury request for judicial notice of the policy in issue.see pastoria nationwide ins.th,fn.on demurrer,trial court denied request for judicial notice for lack of foundation.but the trial court granted hervey own request to judicially notice mercury response to a request for production of documents,which response included the specimen policy and the endorsement.although hervey complains that she should be able to obtain extrinsic evidence and amend the complaint and that the trial court should not have decided the meaning of the policy by taking judicial notice of it,she has not specifically challenged on appeal the trial court ruling granting her request for judicial notice we therefore consider the allegations of the complaint together with the specimen policy and endorsement attached to hervey response to mercury request for production.
parol evidence 
although hervey did not attach the insurance policy to her complaint,she alleged the existence of the automobile liability policy and that mercury breached the policy by offsetting from the amount of uninsured motorist payments due the amount of medical expenses paid.hervey,however,did not plead parol evidence to support her interpretation of the policy.instead,she relied on the medical expense coverage endorsement and,particularly,the language in that endorsement,no excess,no reimbursement.
on appeal,hervey contends that she should be given the opportunity to amend her complaint to plead ambiguity of the policy and to obtain and introduce extrinsic evidence to support her interpretation of the as advertising copy,marketing brochures,and deposition testimony of insurance company executives and employees.but had hervey actually relied upon such material in purchasing her automobile coverage from mercury,she would either have alleged that fact or asserted she could amend to plead such reliance.she has done neither and she does not suggest how she would or could amend her complaint.
the policy,although not attached to,or otherwise incorporated in,the complaint,was judicially noticed by the trial court.as noted,hervey alleged in conclusory fashion that mercury breached the policy by offsetting the medical expenses paid against the uninsured motorist obligation.we shall assume that allegation satisfies the requirement that she must allege in the complaint the meaning she ascribes to that policy hayter trucking,shell western e p,supra,th at and determine if the policy is reasonably susceptible of that meaning and whether the offset or reimbursement term she challenges is enforceable.
interpretation of the policy 
hervey contends that the no reimbursement in large print on the medical expense endorsement,along with the checked box for no reimbursement next to the medical expense coverage on the declaration page,conveyed that mercury would not seek reimbursement or offsets of medical expense payments as a result of payments from any source.she adds that the retention of the right of reimbursement for uninsured motorist obligations was buried in the policy so that it was not conspicuous,plain and clear as required by haynes farmers ins.exchange cal th.hervey also asserts that condition of part ii,which was deleted,arguably allowed mercury to obtain reimbursement from any source,whether from an insured driver or from the insurer as a result of the act of the uninsured driver,and thus its deletion at least creates an ambiguity in the policy so that she should be given the opportunity to introduce parol evidence.
