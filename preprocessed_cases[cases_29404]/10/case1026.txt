we consider in this disposition whether,when a settlement agreement has been reached in a class action and fees have been awarded to class counsel,a class member who objects only to the fee award has standing to appeal the denial of his own request for fees.we also consider a concerning the district court reduction of plaintiffs attorney fees and costs.we vacate and remand.
facts and prior proceedings 
this case is before us for the third time.plaintiffs stetson et first appealed the district court order dismissing their complaint in may.after oral argument,we referred the case to mediation.a settlement was reached,and we remanded the case to the district court for the limited purpose of considering approval of and approving the settlement agreement between the putative class and defendants.the district court rejected the proposed settlement,and we reasserted jurisdiction.we then reversed the district court order of dismissal the order from which the appeal had originally been taken but again referred the case to mediation.by february,a new settlement had been reached,and we issued our mandate,returning jurisdiction to the district court.
the parties presented the new settlement agreement which included a million gross settlement fund to the district court for approval.plaintiffs attorneys class counsel sought million in fees as compensation,which represented approximately percent of the common fund.class counsel also sought in costs.certain class members objectors objected to the fee request but not to the underlying settlement,asserting that class counsel were entitled to no more than in fees.objectors then sought percent of any reduction in class counsel fees as their own fee award,as well as in incentive awards for each individual objector.
the district court granted in fees to class counsel,which reflected a reduction of requested fees of approximately percent.it also reduced class counsel costs reimbursement to.the district court announced its reasoning from the bench,as follows 
the court finds that the lodestar method is preferable in the circumstances of this case.in re bluetooth headset prods,cir.
using the lodestar method,the court first determines the reasonable fee by multiplying the reasonable hourly rate by the reasonable hours expended in the litigation.here,class counsel has provided a declaration with the schedule of hourly rates charged by each attorney who worked on the matter and how many hours were expended by those attorneys.after review of the timesheet submissions and declarations of counsel,the court finds that the hourly fee and hours expended are not reasonable.
first,the hourly fee charged by counsel is beyond the prevalent market rate.the court finds that a reasonable hourly fee for an attorney with the experience of class counsel dealing with a case of this magnitude and degree of difficulty in the central district is per hour.see trevinu gates,cir.
second,the court finds that many of the hours billed by class counsel were redundant,excessive,or otherwise unnecessary.hensley eckerhart,d.
for instance,class counsel disner time sheet does not separate and describe the time and tasks performed by each attorney indeed,it appears that on many entries two attorneys billed for the same work.in sum,the court finds that class counsel reasonable fee is.this is using the per hour rate applied across all counsel and to the total hours reasonably spent on this case.
further,taking account of class counsel experience,skill in litigating this case,the complexity of the issues involved,and the customary fees charged by counsel in similar cases,the court finds that the lodestar fee is reasonable and,on balance,the kerr factors do not justify an upward or downward adjustment.kerr screen actors guild,cir.
the district court also found that class counsel inadequately supported its claim for expert fees specifically,with the exception of rook,class counsel has not provided the court with information regarding how crucial or indispensable the unnamed experts were to the litigation.finally,the district court denied objectors fee request in its entirety,finding that objectors role was not even minimally material in bringing about the successful settlement because objectors did not add anything to the court independent analysis.
both plaintiffs and objectors appealed.
discussion 
we review an award of attorney fees for abuse of discretion.stanger china motor,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when it applies an incorrect rule of decision,or when it applies the correct rule to factual conclusions that are illogical,implausible,or without support in the record.rodriguez disner rodriguez ii,cir.findings of fact are reviewed for clear error conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.stanger,at.
objectors standing to appeal 
in a class action,an objector need not establish standing to object to an award of attorney fees by the district court.the district court has the authority and duty to pass upon the fairness of the attorneys fees settlement independently of whether there was objection.zucker occidental petroleum,cir.the objector therefore needs only a procedural vehicle with which to place his arguments before the district court,which is provided by federal rule of civil procedure h a class member,or a party from whom payment is sought,may object to the motion for class counsel fees.
if,however,an objector seeks to appeal an award of fees to class counsel,he must independently satisfy article iii that is,he must demonstrate standing to appeal independent of his ability to object before the district court.knisley network,cir.where an objector has participated in the settlement,he has standing to appeal because a reduction in class counsel fees will likely increase his own award from the common fund.id.at.even where an objector has not participated in the common fund settlement,he may still have standing to appeal the settlement if he prevails,a better settlement might be obtained on remand in which he could participate.thus,his injury is likely redressable on appeal.id.by contrast,an objector who has refused to participate in the settlement and who objects only to class counsel fees generally will not have standing to appeal the fee award because he has not participated in the settlement,a reduction in fees will not benefit him,and therefore barring some unusual terms in the settlement agreement he has no injury that is redressable.id.at.
nevertheless,an objector has standing to appeal a denial of his own claim for fees.if the district court reduces class counsel fees but denies fees to the objector,that denial creates a particularized injury to the objector that can be redressed on appeal.a particularized,redressable injury of that sort is sufficient to confer standing.knisley,at.thus we concluded in rodriguez ii that even if an objector does not submit a settlement claim,he nevertheless has standing to appeal the denial of his request for fees because an attorney who confers a benefit on the class is entitled to fees based on equitable principles of unjust enrichment,and has standing to challenge the denial of such fees,regardless whether the attorney client will receive any of the savings.at.
here,class counsel challenge objectors standing to appeal the denial of their petition for fees.objectors concede that they did not file a claim to receive a share of the settlement proceeds.however,their appeal does not concern the district court award of fees to class counsel.they appeal only the district court denial of their own petition for fees,which is a particularized injury to the objectors we can redress.thus,knisley is distinguishable,and as in rodriguez ii,objectors have standing to appeal the district court denial of their petition for fees.
class counsel also assert that objectors objection was untimely.all agree that objectors filed their objection on july.the district court order setting forth the relevant deadlines is ambiguous.in one paragraph,the order provides that a putative objector,no later than days before the august,final settlement hearing presently,july,must file a written notice of intention to object emphasi
