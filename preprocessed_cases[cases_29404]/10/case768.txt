amended opinion 
this is a consolidated case.the heiser plaintiffs are individuals who live or have lived in or near oak ridge,tennessee,and who allegedly have cancer or have an increased risk of acquiring cancer or other diseases.the ball plaintiffs are who live or have lived in a community known as scarboro in oak ridge.plaintiffs claim that they have been harmed through exposure to radioactive and other toxic substances over the period when nuclear weapons were manufactured in oak ridge.defendants are private contractors of the united states government that operate or have operated nuclear weapons manufacturing and research facilities in the oak ridge reservation,and secretary spencer abraham of the united states department of energy and john gordon of the national nuclear security administration.plaintiffs appeal from a final order granting summary judgment to both the and,and the denial of plaintiffs motion for class certification.plaintiffs seek injunctive and equitable relief for medical monitoring and environmental cleanup,and,in heiser,damages for all the reasons stated below,we affirm.
background 
the federal government established the oak ridge reservation orr as part of the manhattan project in.the orr includes three production facilities,each in a separate valley.the city of oak ridge was established in the orr to house thousands of civilian workers and military personnel.the federal ownership and control of the area ended when the city of oak ridge received a charter of incorporation from the state of tennessee in.
in the early,workers were recruited from tennessee and other southern states to work as common laborers,janitors,and domestic workers in oak ridge.these workers were housed in a separate camp,which came to be known as scarboro,near one of the oak ridge plants,code named,that enriched uranium and produced nuclear weapon components.it is undisputed that scarboro was established and maintained as a segregated community in the.the district court noted that scarboro remains a predominantly community in oak ridge.ja.
in addition to federal agencies,the following private contractors operate or have operated the oak ridge facilities and are named as in plaintiffs complaint the university of chicago monsanto company union carbide corporation company management services,eastman chemical company eastman kodak company turner construction company,llc energy systems,lockheed martin energy systems,bwxt llc and bechtel jacobs company,llc.ja.
in the state and federal governments collaborated in forming a panel oak ridge health agreement steering panel orhasp to study the health effects of the release of radioactive and other toxic substances from the oak ridge facilities.the orhasp periodically disclosed the results of its ongoing study and held open meetings throughout the.the study was covered by the news media.
on january,the orhasp issued its final report to the public.the report was dated december.the orhasp final report determined 
the results suggest it is likely that some people were hurt by the releases.the project reports present estimates of the number of people who could have become ill as a result of exposure to the orr environmental pollutants.two groups were most likely to have been harmed local children drinking milk from a backyard cow or goat in the early,and fetuses carried in the and early by women who routinely ate fish taken from the contaminated creeks and rivers located downstream from the orr.
the heiser plaintiffs claim personal injury from emissions.four of the heiser plaintiffs allege they have developed thyroid cancer due to radioactive emissions.the remaining three allege they are at risk of developing thyroid cancer.
the ball plaintiffs allege discrimination under a number of civil rights statutes and the equal protection and due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.in particular,the ball plaintiffs allege that defendants located and maintained,and continue to maintain,scarboro in an area known by defendants to be the most contaminated and the most vulnerable to ongoing pollution because of its proximity to the plant.pls.ball br.at.plaintiffs maintain that as a result,the housing in scarboro is less desirable,worth less,and accorded lower priority in terms of cleanup than other parts of oak ridge.plaintiffs also maintain that defendants,by placing plaintiffs in the location of scarboro and the immediate environs of the plant,created a condition which was inherently unsafe and unhealthy and is the proximate cause of plaintiffs injuries and of their higher risk of injuries,creating the need for medical monitoring and surveillance.id.at.
plaintiffs commenced this action within one year of the date of the release of the orhasp final report on january.
discussion 
notice and discovery.
plaintiffs first challenge the district court grant of summary judgment under.on the basis that the statute of limitations had run on plaintiffs claims.plaintiffs argue that the district court should not have granted the summary judgment without first giving notice to plaintiffs and without permitting plaintiffs discovery as to the statute of limitations issue.pls.ball br.at pls.heiser br.at.counter that a separate notice was not required because their motion was for dismissal or,in the alternative,for summary judgment,which provided notice to plaintiffs.heiser br.at.
a district court decision to convert a motion to dismiss under rule b into a motion for summary judgment under rule is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see shelby county health care council of indus.workers health welfare trust fund,cir.
when deciding on a motion for summary judgment.f allows the court to order discovery if it should appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party can not for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party opposition.further,under.b,before the district court may treat a motion to dismiss as a summary judgment motion,it must give all parties reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to the issue.the sixth circuit interpreted this requirement to mean that it is serious error for a district court to convert the motion sua sponte to a summary judgment motion without notice to parties and without further discovery.helwig vencor,cir en banc.
here,the district court did not act sua sponte in converting the motion to dismiss to a summary judgment motion.moved for summary judgment in the alternative.moreover,as correctly assert,plaintiffs responded to the summary judgment motion by submitting materials outside the pleadings,such as affidavits.see.heiser br.at.therefore,plaintiffs insistence that they genuinely were surprised that the court would have any intention to convert the motion,pls.heiser br.at,is not supported by the facts.they had notice that the district court might treat the motion as one for summary judgment because such a motion was actually filed,and they responded to it.
accordingly,the only remaining issue is whether the district court abused its discretion in denying plaintiffs request for discovery before it granted the summary judgment motion.
it is that the plaintiff must receive a full opportunity to conduct discovery to be able to successfully defeat a motion for summary judgment.see anderson liberty lobby,d see also celotex catrett,d the plain language of rule c mandates the entry of summary judgment,after adequate time for discovery and upon motion,against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case,and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial white landing fisheries,buchholzer,cir in light of anderson and celotex,a grant of summary judgment is improper if the is given an insufficient opportunity for discovery.
the district court decision to deny further discovery is,however,generally unreviewable unless the appellant has filed a rule f affidavit or a motion that gives the district court a chance to rule on the need for additional discovery.plott motors,cir.beyond the procedural requirement of filing an affidavit,rule f has been interpreted as requiring that a party making such a filing indicate to the district court its need for discovery,what material facts it hopes to uncover,and why it has not previously discovered the information.cacevic city of hazel park,cir.
the sixth circuit generally applies the abuse of discretion standard to the district court decision to deny discovery whether such request was made on a motion or by a rule f affidavit.see plott,at.it is not an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny the discovery request when the party makes only general and conclusory statements in its affidavit regarding the need for more discovery and does not show how an extension of time would have allowed information related to the truth or falsity of the document to be discovered.ironside simi valley,cir.it is also not an abuse of discretion to reject a rule f affidavit as insufficient to support further discovery when the affidavit lacks any details or specificity.emmons mclaughlin,cir.
the affidavit in question here was submitted by plaintiffs attorney and included the following statements in support of the discovery request 
in my opinion,to respond with due diligence,discharging my responsibilities to the class,to the materials outside the pleadings which these defendants urge the court to consider by converting their motion to one for summary judgment,would require obtaining the results of substantial written and document discovery,and a number of depositions,on the subjects of when plaintiffs claims accrued,and what information was released by any defendants to members of the public and when and how such releases occurred,and on a variety of statements,and agents of defendants,over the years on the subject of the safety of their operations and their impact upon the environment surrounding their operations.only this type of discovery would produce an adequate response to the many partial documents,and partial collections of documents,submitted by defendants,who appear upon inspection of the documents to have selected some,and omitted others bearing on the same subjects.
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred because the affidavit was sufficient and specific.see pls.heiser br.at.counter that plaintiffs discovery request does not include any specific statements as to which material facts they hope d to uncover.heiser br.at quoting cacevic,at.additionally argue that when plaintiffs claims accrued is not a discoverable fact,but is a legal question.see id.
the district court here stated without explanation that plaintiffs have not satisfied the requirements of rule f.ja.the district court additionally noted,however,that even if they had,they have not described any helpful discovery in light of the fact that it has been publicly debated since the early that toxins are present in the oak ridge community.id.the district court further observed that the orhasp final report contained no information not previously available to the public.id.the district court took judicial notice of such publicity under.ja.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiffs discovery request.plaintiffs rule f affidavit does not state how any discovery would have shed further light on the issue of when the statute of limitations began to run.plaintiffs merely hint at concealment on the part of defendants with respect to adverse health effects of the emissions.see discussion,infra.the reality of toxic emissions from the oak ridge facilities has,however,been in the public domain for some time.accordingly,as the district court stated,the discovery requested in plaintiffs rule f affidavit was irrelevant to the issue of statute of limitations.ja.
statute of limitations.
a district court decision to grant summary judgment is reviewed de novo.higgason stephens,cir.
i personal injury claims.
the ultimate issue in this case is when the statute of limitations was triggered.plaintiffs maintain that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of all defendants on the grounds that tennessee statute of limitations barred plaintiffs claims.pls.ball br.at see also ann.a.plaintiffs argue that the statute did not begin to run with respect to their personal injury claims until january,when the final report of the orhasp was released.
the statute of limitations commences to run when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of his action.sevier turner,cir carvell bottoms,the statute is triggered when the plaintiff becomes aware of facts sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice that he has suffered an injury as a result of wrongful conduct.a plaintiff has reason to know of his injury when he should have discovered it through the exercise of reasonable diligence.sevier,at.the sixth circuit explained the duty to inquire as follows 
i f greater than de minimis harm is discernable at the time of the tortious event,then the time of the event rule applies i f the injured person sustains an injury which can not itself be reasonably discovered,or the cause of which can not reasonably be discovered,until some time following the tortious event and the running of the statute of limitations,courts often apply the discovery rule,tolling the running of the statute of limitations to the date by which the plaintiff reasonably should have discovered both cause and injury.
hicks hines,cir quotations omitted see.united food commercial workers unions drug mercantile employees joint health welfare fund muir,cir in defining the concept of due diligence,this court has looked to what event should have alerted the typical lay person to protect his or her rights.quoting dixon anderson,cir overberg lusby,cir noting that plaintiff had a duty to inquire when she became knowledgeable about her medical condition accord boeing north,cir accrual of claim must be based on knowledge and not mere suspicion.
as rightly observed by,the public record here was sufficient to alert plaintiffs as to a possible connection between emissions and health risks near oak ridge long before january.the rule in this circuit is that w here events receive widespread publicity,plaintiffs may be charged with knowledge of their occurrence.hughes vanderbilt,cir quotation omitted.a plaintiff is charged with constructive knowledge even when she claims that she did not hear or read any of the media reports.hughes,at.the relevant inquiry in such cases is an objective one.id.citations omitted that is,the question is whether a typical person would have been aware of a possible link between emissions and health risks 
given that local and national news media repeatedly covered the issue,and that the orhasp publicized the progression of its study since its inception in and issued its preliminary results throughout,plaintiffs should have been aware of a potential personal injury claim connected to oak ridge emissions or releases in or at the latest,when the orhasp preliminary reports became available.ja.it is true that the orhasp final report constitutes the first instance when a definite link was established with finality.however,plaintiffs do not allege that they belong to the two groups most likely to have been harmed by the oak ridge releases the issue of the final report did not by itself trigger plaintiffs duty to inquire under hicks.accordingly,plaintiffs should have raised their claims sometime in the late when it became apparent that they may have had a viable claim 
more importantly,none of the plaintiffs here claim that they have contracted a disease attributable to the toxic releases within the statute of limitation period.only some of the heiser plaintiffs allege they have actually contracted cancer,while others claim increased risk of cancer.yet,there must necessarily be different accrual dates when the injury complained of is the increased risk of disease as opposed to the disease itself.when the increased risk of disease is the injury claimed,the threshold of finding a duty to inquire under hicks is lower.that is,individuals should know that they are at risk as soon as a link between cancer and emissions becomes apparent.on the other hand,when the injury is contracting cancer,the claim will accrue when the plaintiff knew or should have known of the disease,not just the risk of acquiring the disease.in that event,a plaintiff must clearly plead that the injury occurred within the statute of limitations period.plaintiffs here face a formidable statute of limitations hurdle.the reason is in part that individuals not similarly situated became plaintiffs in one and the same suit it is possible the weaker claims have obscured the stronger claims.from this vantage point,however,it is impossible to discern who would have a viable claim,especially given that no argument was advanced that plaintiffs were diagnosed with any disease during the limitations period.the district court noted correctly that conceivably a plaintiff with a still viable claim could exist,a person who was diagnosed with thyroid cancer within one year of filing suit.ja.this opinion does not address such a claim.
on a different note,we find plaintiffs claims alleging the fraudulent acts of concealment to be without merit.pls.ball br.at.plaintiffs claim no specific act of concealment,but underline that a number of the articles that covered oak ridge were equivocal and contained phrases such as no harm from the emissions,no link to cancer,and no health concern.id.pls.heiser br.at.plaintiffs also point to national security classification of information regarding oak ridge.pls.ball br.at.
we recognize that when a government project such as oak ridge is shrouded in secrecy,it may be difficult to collect the necessary facts to make a case.however,it was well known that plants in oak ridge engaged in nuclear weapons manufacturing and other nuclear research,that they released toxic materials,and that such toxic materials may be hazardous to human health depending on the dosage.ja.plaintiffs needed to present to this court with sufficient clarity and particularity what they claim was fraudulently concealed by government officials and contractors and how that affected their case.dayco goodyear tire rubber,cir.we find nothing in the record of this case that exhibits any concealment motivated by bad faith on the part of defendants.we further note that the duty to inquire applies even when the government may have engaged in concealment of facts.see kronisch united states,cir 
ii civil rights claims.
the ball plaintiffs additionally argue that the statute of limitations does not apply because have a continuing affirmative duty to remedy effects of exposure to emissions as such effects constitute vestiges of historical de jure racial segregation.pls.ball br.at.plaintiffs charge that the continuing existence of scarboro as a segregated community is attributable and attributed by the amended complaint to all defendants unconscionable actions.pls.ball br.at.plaintiffs attempt to derive support from a number of school desegregation cases,such as freeman pitts,d columbus board of education penick,d and dayton board of education brinkman,d.plaintiffs also rely on various affirmative action cases for the proposition that affirmative action may be used to eradicate continuing effects,vestiges of discrimination that occurred in the past.pls.ball br.at.the cases cited by plaintiffs include wygant jackson board of education,d fullilove klutznick,d including the concurring opinion by justice powell united steelworkers of america weber,d regents of university of california bakke,d hazelwood school district united states,d and hammon barry.
counter that plaintiffs alleged exposure to oak ridge emissions is not a vestige of racial discrimination.ball br.at.alternatively argue that they have no ongoing affirmative duty to remedy the effects of discrimination by governmental entities.id.at.finally argue that,in any event,there is no affirmative duty to remedy the effects of residential segregation.
the district court observed that the scarboro community has been integrated since the.ja.the district court went on to say to find otherwise would mean the statute of limitations would never be tolled unless every black person left scarboro.id.the district court specifically discounted the de facto discrimination cases regarding school desegregation finding them not applicable here.id.
the district court is correct.the factual patterns of school desegregation cases bear little resemblance to the facts alleged here.moreover,plaintiffs do not seek to eliminate the vestige of past discrimination by asking for the desegregation of scarboro.see.ball br.at.rather,they are seeking remedies for potential personal injuries and property damage relating to alleged exposure to oak ridge emissions.id.at.as correctly explain 
t he fact that plaintiffs alleged personal injuries and property damage might not have occurred or might not have been so serious but for the racial discrimination that led to the establishment of scarboro in the first instance does not mean that the discrimination was the proximate cause of those injuries and that damage.the concept of the vestiges of discrimination has never been stretched so far as to encompass anything bad that happens to someone that might not have happened but for racial segregation.under p laintiffs logic,anything bad that happens as a result of scarboro location can be deemed a vestige of discrimination,since scarboro itself would not exist but for discrimination.
id.at.it would indeed be a stretch to rely on the school desegregation cases to require to eliminate any lingering effects of past governmental discrimination by paying for cleanup and medical monitoring.
the affirmative action cases plaintiffs reference are similarly not dispositive.those cases stand for the proposition that affirmative action is not prohibited by the constitution or the federal civil rights statutes.see.ball br.at.these cases do not,however,go as far as to interpret the constitution and the federal civil rights statutes as mandating government contractors to remedy past discrimination.that is,contractors have no affirmative duty to eliminate current effects of past discrimination by governmental entities.neither do the government officials have any such duty under the school desegregation and affirmative discrimination cases.
on the issue of affirmative duty,the case plaintiffs rely on is distinguishable.in hills gautreaux,the supreme court sustained a n order directing hud to use its discretion under the various federal housing programs to foster projects located in white areas of the chicago housing market,finding that such an order would be consistent with and supportive of federal housing policy,d.hud was ordered to remedy its own wrong of confin ing black tenants to segregated public housing.id.at.in this case,there is no allegation here that initiated the segregation.
accordingly,we find that neither the united states constitution nor federal civil rights statutes afford the relief plaintiffs ask 
class certification.
plaintiffs next challenge the district court denial of their class action certification motion.in heiser,plaintiffs sought to certify as a rule b or rule b class 
p ersons who lived in oak ridge,tennessee,or otherwise resided in a nearby geographic area under the influence of the defendants from to the present who have not yet contracted thyroid cancer but who have been exposed and put at risk by defendants act.
in ball,plaintiffs sought to certify as a rule b class 
a ll individuals of african american descent who currently live in currently own property in scarboro once lived in the scarboro community and continue to frequently visit the scarboro community.
ja.the district court first emphasized that class action certification is generally not appropriate in mass tort cases.the district court further denied the motion because it found that plaintiffs failed to show commonality and typicality of claims,and failed to meet the adequate representation requirement under.a 
plaintiffs charge that the district court abused its discretion when it ignored five separate sworn affidavits or declarations submitted in support of their class certification motion.pls.heiser br.at.plaintiffs further charge that the distric
