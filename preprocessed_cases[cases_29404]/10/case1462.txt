christine lindsay and robert mcgruder appellants work as auto damage adjusters for the government employees insurance company geico.geico classified all auto damage adjusters as administrative employees,thereby making them ineligible for overtime pay under section a of the fair labor standards act,usc et.flsa or act.the appellants brought this action against their employer,alleging that geico deliberately miscategorized them as administrative employees to avoid paying them overtime pay in violation of the flsa and the new york minimum wage act,lab.law et.new york act.they sought certification of an class under the flsa.they also sought certification of an class under the new york act,using federal rule of civil procedure.the district court denied certification of the state law class,concluding that the flsa class certification procedure requiring all class members to affirmatively opt in precluded it from exercising supplemental jurisdiction over those state law claimants who did not affirmatively join the flsa claim.we disagree and therefore reverse the order denying certification and remand to the district court.
the appellants flsa claim alleged not only that the nature of an auto damage adjuster job duties entitles them to overtime pay under flsa but also that geico classification of auto damage adjusters as administrative employees constitutes a willful violation of the act see a.they sued on behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated auto damage adjusters under b section b is part of the act,which the congress enacted in in response to judicial interpretations of the flsa see ibp,alvarez,d.of particular relevance here,section b provides that,in an action brought under,inter alia,section overtime pay the flsa,n o employee shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.b.that is,potential class members must affirmatively join opt in the lawsuit.see thompson sawyer.
appellant mcgruder also alleged that the nature of a new auto damage adjuster job duties entitles those adjusters to overtime pay under the new york act as well.see lab.law creating civil action for violation of compensation provisions regs.tit,requiring overtime compensation of mcgruder sought to bring the state law claim on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated new auto damage adjusters pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.unlike the procedure set out in b,rule class certification requires notice to all potential class members that they must affirmatively decline to join opt out the lawsuit if they do not want to be class members.see.c b for any class certified under rule b,the court must direct to class members the best notice practicable under the circumstances that the court will exclude from the class any member who requests exclusion,stating when and how members may elect to be excluded in re veneman,certification pursuant to rule b,however,comes with certain procedural requirements because members of a class seeking substantial monetary damages may have divergent interests,due process requires that putative class members receive notice and an opportunity to opt out.
the district court first determined that all geico auto damage adjusters nationwide were similarly situated within the meaning of b.see lindsay gov t employees ins.accordingly,notices were sent to all potential class members requesting them to affirmatively opt into the action if they so desired.the district court,however,subsequently declined to certify mcgruder requested class of geico auto damage adjusters with state law claims under the new york act.see lindsay gov t employees ins,d.first noting that t his circuit has yet to address the question of supplemental jurisdiction in the context of a federal class and a state class,the district court briefly surveyed the decisions from other district and ultimately concluded that it would be inappropriate to exercise jurisdiction over plaintiffs who have not affirmatively opted into the federal action.id.at.thus,it decided to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over only the state law claims of plaintiff mcgruder and any new york plaintiff who is eligible to opt into the federal action and opts in by filing a notice of consent.id.at.we allowed the appellants to appeal the order denying class certification pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f.see in re lindsay,cir.because subject matter jurisdiction is a prerequisite to class certification,it is properly reviewed in a rule f interlocutory appeal.in re lorazepam clorazepate antitrust,constitutional standing issue properly raised in rule f appeal.accordingly,we consider the district court denial of class certification based on its decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.
although it is not clear from the district court order whether the court made its supplemental jurisdiction ruling under a or c we conclude that its decision was based on subsection a.first,its discussion of certification of the state law claims does not mention subsection c.in contrast,its discussion regarding the exercise of its supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims of the flsa class members does.lindsay,d at.moreover,the authority upon which the district court primarily relies construed section a to divest federal courts of jurisdiction over state law claimants who do not also have flsa claims.rodriguez v.the texan,wl,at.because the district court order was based on section a,we review its decision de novo.see harris sec y,dep t of veterans affairs,we review the district court dismissal for want of jurisdiction de novo,because the district court dismissed on the grounds that it lacked the original jurisdiction necessary for supplemental jurisdiction under a,and not on the grounds that it was exercising its discretion to dismiss supplemental claims remaining after dismissal of original claims as authorized by c.
a provides 
except as provided in subsections b and c or as expressly provided otherwise by federal statute,in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.
a emphasis added.leaving aside the beginning proviso for the moment,we think it is clear that section a authorizes a district court to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction in mandatory language.see new rock asset partners,preferred entity advancements,cir by its language a confers jurisdiction in mandatory terms to include those cases which form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution except as expressly excluded by statute or as provided for in subsections b and c.mccoy webster,cir section a requires the district court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims which are closely related to claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction.emphasis added executive software am.dist.for the cent.dist.of,cir by use of the word shall,the statute makes clear that if power is conferred under section a,and its exercise is not prohibited by section b,a court can decline to assert supplemental jurisdiction over a pendent claim only if one of the four categories specifically enumerated in section c applies.in addition to its reference to subsection b excepting provision which relates to diversity jurisdiction only,section a includes three other bases for declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction a federal statute expressly provide s otherwise the other claims are not so related to the claims within the court original jurisdiction that they constitute part of the same case or controversy and the excepting provisions of section c,which allow the court in its discretion to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction 
first,we do not agree with the district court that b represents the kind of statute that is described in section a ope
