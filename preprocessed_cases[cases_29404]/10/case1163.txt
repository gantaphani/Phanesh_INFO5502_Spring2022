this appeal raises two issues whether the judicially created filed rate doctrine,which typically has been utilized in common carrier and public utility litigation,is applicable in a class action lawsuit seeking monetary and injunctive relief under state law arising from the misreporting of pricing data to the united states department of agriculture usda,where the data in turn were used to set a minimum price structure for raw milk sales and if the doctrine is applicable in that situation,whether the district court erred when it dismissed the plaintiffs state causes of action on the ground that the filed rate doctrine barred such claims,even though the court found that i t is not disputed that the usda determined that the rates calculated were erroneous and that other rates should have applied based on corrected pricing inputs.
background 
statutory and regulatory framework as to milk pricing 
as observed in zuber allen,d 
the two distinctive and essential phenomena of the milk industry are a basic structure that permits a higher return for the same product,depending on its ultimate use,and the cyclical characteristic of production.
milk has essentially two end uses as a fluid staple of daily consumer diet,and as an ingredient in manufactured dairy products such as butter and cheese.milk used in the consumer market has traditionally commanded a premium price,even though it is of no higher quality than milk used for manufacture.while cost differences account for part of the discrepancy in price,they do not explain the entire gap.at the same time the milk industry is characterized by periods of seasonal overproduction.the winter months are low in yield and conversely the summer months are fertile.in order to meet fluid demand which is relatively constant,sufficiently large herds must be maintained to supply winter needs.the result is oversupply in the more fruitful months.the historical tendency prior to regulation was for milk distributors,handlers,to take advantage of this surplus to obtain bargains during glut periods.milk can be obtained from distant sources and handlers can afford to absorb transportation costs and still pay more to outlying farmers whose traditional outlet is the manufacturing market.footnote omitted.to maintain income,farmers increase production and the disequilibrium snowballs.
congress passed the agricultural marketing agreement act of et amaa in order to establish and maintain orderly marketing conditions and fair prices for agricultural commodities.glickman wileman elliott,d.section of the amaa authorizes the secretary of agriculture to issue orders applicable to handlers who receive,process,package,or redistribute milk or milk products marketing orders promulgated pursuant to the amaa are a species of economic regulation that has displaced competition in a number of discrete markets glickman,at.as stated in block cmty.nutrition,d,t he essential purpose of this milk market order scheme is to raise producer prices,and thereby to ensure that the benefits and burdens of the milk market are fairly and proportionally shared by all dairy farmers.id.at second alteration in original see also.dairy coop.ass n,dep t of.
milk,milk products,and prices paid by handlers to producers of raw milk,dairy farmers are regulated by what are commonly referred to as federal milk marketing orders fmmos issued by the usda pursuant to section of the amaa.the promulgation process is described in block as follows 
under the scheme established by congress,the secretary must conduct an appropriate rulemaking proceeding before issuing a milk market order.the public must be notified of these proceedings and provided an opportunity for public hearing and comment.see.an order may be issued only if the evidence adduced at the hearing shows that it will tend to effectuate the declared policy of this chapter with respect to such commodity.moreover,before any market order may become effective,it must be approved by the handlers of at least of the volume of milk covered by the proposed order and at least of the affected dairy producers in the region,b i.if the handlers withhold their consent,the secretary may nevertheless impose the order.but the secretary power to do so is conditioned upon at least of the producers consenting to its promulgation and upon his making an administrative determination that the order is the only practical means of advancing the interests of the producers.b.
at alteration in original.
section of the amaa requires that the fmmos contain provisions which,inter alia classify milk in accordance with the purpose for which it is used,set minimum prices for each such use that handlers must pay,require that said prices be uniform except that adjustments can be made for production differentials,grade or quality of the milk,and locations of delivery,and provide for the use of blended prices such that all producers of milk subject to a particular fmmo receive a uniform price for the milk delivered to handlers regardless of the ultimate use of the milk.the amaa and hence each fmmo only requires a minimum price.as observed in farmer union milk mktg.coop.yeutter,cir 
although the amaa mandates a minimum price,it does not mandate a maximum price.handlers can not pay less than the blend price,but they are allowed to pay as much as they want.in times of relative scarcity,handlers can and do negotiate premiums,known as prices,for the sale of the milk.these premiums are most typically paid for milk that is intended for class i use,but they can apply to any of the three classes.thus,market forces are allowed to intrude on this regime on occasion,though only in one direction.
fmmos have been issued which cover some,but not all,regions of the united states see pts,setting price regulations for each designated region.
the secretary of agriculture has delegated his authority under the amaa to the under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs,see a viii g,and,in turn,the under secretary has delegated it to the administrator for the agricultural marketing service ams.a viii see also white eagle coop.ass connor,cir.as to each operative fmmo,there is a market administrator selected by the secretary who is empowered,inter alia,to a dminister the order in accordance with its terms and provisions m ake rules and regulations to effectuate the terms and provisions of the order r eceive,investigate,and report complaints of violations to the secretary and announce fmmo prices on designated days of each month.b.
the district court correctly observed that t he method by which the usda has accomplished the framework for a minimum price structure for milk and milk products is admittedly complex.d at.a description of part of that methodology is provided in.dairy coop.ass n,at,as follows 
the amaa and its implementing regulations use two regulatory mechanisms price fixing and payment pooling.the minimum prices that handlers must pay vary according to the end use of the milk,as categorized in four classes.see a class i milk is sold in fluid form,class ii milk is used to make ice cream,soft cheeses,and related products,class iii milk is used to produce harder cheeses,and class iv milk is used to make butter and related products including nonfat dry milk products.instead of setting specific prices to be paid for each class,the secretary has established a formula by which the price for each class is determined monthly based on the average nationwide wholesale prices from the previous month.see milk in the northeast and other marketing areas notice of proposed rulemaking and tentative partial final decision,june,tentative decision.the formulas for class iii and iv milk are based on the nationwide average prices for butter,nonfat dry milk,cheese,and dry whey,minus a set dollar amount for each of those products,multiplied by a yield factor.l o.class i and ii prices are derived from the class iii and iv prices but class i prices are adjusted for the location of the handler so that handlers pay different prices in different geographic areas.see.the amounts subtracted from the average sale prices of class iii and iv products,known in the milk industry as make allowances or manufacturing allowances,are intended to represent the costs to the handlers of making the end dairy products from raw milk.tentative decision.at.in essence,handlers retain from the average wholesale price the amount set by the make allowance and transfer the balance to producers.
the second major component of dairy market regulation is payment pooling.under this system,handlers pay prices according to the end use of milk,but all the producers in a geographic area receive the same monthly average or blended price per unit of milk sold,regardless of the use to which their milk is put.see b.this payment equalization is accomplished through the producer settlement fund into which handlers pay,or from which handlers withdraw,according to whether their blendprice payments to producers are less or greater than the of the milk they have purchased.again,the effect of this regime is that handlers make payments which vary according to the market value of the milk they use as reflected in minimum prices,while all producers in an area receive the same average,or blended,price per unit of milk.
different geographic areas of the united states are regulated under slightly different conditions,although the formulas used to set prices of class iii and iv milk are the same in all areas.see.each of eleven areas,generally known as a marketing area or milk marketing area,is governed by a different order of the secretary.see,a.
the process utilized by the ams during the relevant period here to establish the formulas through which minimum prices were set pursuant to an fmmo is also complicated,but is adequately summarized in.dairy,dep t of,d,aff,as follows 
under the fmmos,a dairy plant pays,and a dairy producer receives,minimum prices in the form of federally established component prices for,protein,solids not fat,and other solids,or prices that are derived from those component prices.see.there are three factors that are used in the pricing formulas prices of certain dairy products surveyed by the national agricultural statistics service nass a make allowance and a yield.see id.the levels of each of these factors affect the price that plants pay for raw milk and,ultimately,how much producers received for their milk.adjustments in any of these factors will impact pricing.
the make allowance and the yield are fixed by rule the product prices are determined weekly by nass.see id.every friday morning,nass reports the prices of certain cheeses,butter,dry milk,and dry whey.usda then announces the advanced prices based on the weighted average of two weeks of nass prices.id.the make allowances represent the allowance for manufacturing raw milk into a finished product.changes to the make allowance have an inverse relationship to the resulting changes in the minimum prices.producers benefit from lower make allowances,and manufacturers benefit from higher make allowances.the yield factor represents the amount of a manufactured dairy product that can be produced per hundredweight pounds of milk.usda accounts for the portion of the price of milk that is attributable to the costs of the manufacturing process through the make allowance.when the price of manufactured goods is raised,however,usda recaptures the cost by reporting a higher price for the wholesale product prices to nass.as a result,any increase in the selling price of manufactured goods used to produce milk will increase the price manufacturers must pay producers for raw milk.id.
the pricing formulas are changed through formal hearings.see.after the close of the evidentiary portion of the hearing,exceptions and comments are filed by interested parties and an administrative law judge certifies the transcript to usda.see id.dairy programs,a division of usda,then prepares and submits a recommendation to usda.the recommendation details the findings of fact,rationale,and the legal authority for its decision.see id.after dairy programs has issued its recommendation,another round of comments follow,and a referendum on the order,as amended,is held.producers facing a referendum must choose between voting out the entire marketing order or approving the amended order.there is no vote on the amendment itself.if the referendum passes,the order is adopted and becomes a final rule.see id.
to actually set the minimum prices,fmmos require the collection and input of certain economic information regarding commercial transactions involving milk and milk products.see.prior to,the usda national agricultural statistics service nass relied on the prices of dairy commodities on established and specified public exchanges,including the chicago and new york mercantile exchanges,in the calculation of fmmo minimum milk prices.see.june,the dairy market enhancement act of,et dmea,was enacted in part to give the usda the authority to make the reporting of dairy product information mandatory.see.july.however,the regulations implementing the dmea now codified at part were not promulgated until.
the district court summarized nass methods for collecting pricing information during the period of time relevant to this action and the parties have not disputed that summary as follows 
pursuant to the dmea,weekly surveys are conducted by the national agricultural statistics service nass to collect wholesale prices for representative products within each category.the survey information is gathered from product manufacturers sometimes referred to in pleadings as milk handlers who produce a million pounds or more of manufactured product per year.the fmmo minimum prices for milk for class iii hard cheese and iv dry milk and butter products are determined by applying the wholesale prices reported in the weekly surveys to formulae specified by the fmmo.the fmmo minimum prices for products in classes i and ii are derived by mathematic formulae from the prices determined in classes iii and iv.
of significance to this action,one of the major wholesale pricing inputs collected by nass for computation of the fmmo minimum price for milk for class iv products is the wholesale price for nfdm nonfat dry milk.the dmea requires handlers to submit nass survey information according to instructions that,among other things,direct the handler to exclude from the survey wholesale prices for nfdm for forward sales contracts.forward sales contracts are defined as contracts in which the selling price is set more than days before the completion of the transaction.it appears undisputed that forward sales contracts generally reflected lower prices for nfdm than were reflected in contracts that were completed at or near the time of the transaction during the time period in question.
d at.nass required the firms to fill out annual validation worksheets which included the question w hen reporting nonfat dry milk sales data to nass,did you or can you exclude forward pricing sales sales in which the selling price is established,and not adjusted,or more days before the transaction is completed 
for enforcement purposes,the dmea provides that e ach reporting firm shall maintain,and make available to the secretary,on request,original contracts,agreements,receipts,and other records associated with the sale or storage of any dairy products during the year period beginning on the date of the creation of the records.c.the version of the dmea also provided that t he secretary shall take such actions as the secretary considers necessary to verify the accuracy of the information submitted or reported under this subtitle,c,stat.in,the dmea was amended and bolstered with the following provision 
quarterly audits.the secretary shall quarterly conduct an audit of information submitted or reported under this subtitle and compare such information with other related dairy market statistics.food,conservation,and energy act of,b,stat.codified at c b.
once nass collects price and volume data,the ams uses them to calculate the fmmo minimum raw milk prices.nonfat dry milk nfdm prices are one factor used by ams to determine fmmo minimum prices.the dmea contains no enforcement mechanism or mechanism for compensating producers who receive prices for their milk that are lower than they should be due to inaccurate reporting 
ii.factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs are dairy farmers located in states other than california who sold raw milk that was priced according to fmmos during the time between january,and april.d at.defendants are dairyamerica,dairyamerica,a entity established by a group of nine dairy cooperatives for the purpose of marketing dairy products manufactured by the cooperatives and california dairies,one of the nine cooperatives.id.at.it is alleged that dairyamerica sells approximately percent of the nfdm produced in the united states.
as stated by the district court 
it is not disputed that,during the time in question,dairy america submitted pricing information to the nass survey that improperly included wholesale prices for forward contracts for nfdm.plaintiffs allege,and defendants do not appear to dispute,that approximately ninety percent of the contracts executed by dairy america and reported in the weekly nass surveys were forward contracts that should not have been reported in the nass surveys according to dmea procedures.plaintiffs contends sic that,because forward contract prices were significantly below spot prices during the time period in question,the minimum prices set by the fmmo for raw milk were significantly lower than would have been the case if the information provided by dairy america to nass had been provided according to instructions.
id.at.on account of dairyamerica market dominance,its erroneous reports had the effect of pushing fmmo minimum prices paid to milk producers noticeably lower than they would have been otherwise.thus,because of its own transgressions,dairyamerica obtained significant financial benefits from the lowered prices,to the detriment of plaintiff dairy farmers.
in march,dairyamerica misreporting was revealed by the milkweed,a dairy industry publication.in april,dairyamerica ceo confirmed that misreporting to the nass.
on or about april,nass requested that all firms that had reported nfdm data review their weekly price and sales volume submissions for the period of april,through april,and submit revisions.on june,nass published revised prices and sales volume for nfdm,and the ams calculated that the errors in the reporting of nonfat dry milk prices for the period april,through april,had increased the average week price of nfdm by per pound and the average week price of nfdm by per pound during a period of months.
in february,the usda office of the inspector general oig issued a report regarding the april discovery of the error in the reporting of nonfat dry milk prices.office of inspector,dep t of,ir,inspection report survey and estimation internal controls for nonfat dry milk and the dairy products prices report i,available at http last visited june.among its findings were 
a large dairy firm inappropriately included longterm forward contracted nonfat dry milk volume and price information in their weekly submissions to nass.we found that this dairy firm has been including data for sales of this type since.
nass then aggregated the misreported data from this large dairy firm with the weekly data submitted by other dairy firms for the same reporting period.this caused inaccurate nonfat dry milk aggregated volume and price statistics to be published weekly.the internal controls for the survey and estimation process used by nass for the dairy products prices report were inadequate,as this error went undetected from until april.
nass published nonfat dry milk price statistics are utilized by ams as a component of its formula for establishing federal milk marketing order fmmo prices.given that incorrect nonfat dry milk prices were factored into the fmmo formula,the published fmmo prices were also incorrect.ams issued a report on june,stating the total classified value of milk regulated under the fmmo program for the period covered by the nass revision was understated by million covering the period between april,and april.
ams did not have the authority to audit a reporting firm books when the misreporting occurred.the authority was included in the dairy marketing act of,but the rulemaking necessary to implement a program of audits was not completed until july.ams began performing audits on august.between august,and september,ams visited seven plants reporting nonfat dry milk volume and price statistics.based on these visits,ams notified nass of reporting discrepancies at six of the plants.nass contacted these plants and explained the proper reporting criteria.
following the release of the inspection report,nass sent letters to dairy firms,handlers that reported nfdm information asking whether they had correctly related the nfdm data between january,and april,and,if they had not,to provide corrected data.none of the dairy firms provided corrected information,and,hence,the nass and consequently the usda was unable to publish revised nfdm data or fmmo prices for that period in august,ams instituted a new auditing process which included inspections of large dairy firms and their sales records.
beginning in march,each plaintiff filed a class action on behalf of a nationwide class of raw milk producers in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction.see d at.the cases were eventually consolidated.id.the amended class action complaint contains four causes of action the first and second claims for relief charged negligent misrepresentation and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage,respectively,both under california common law the third claim asserted violation of california unfair business practices law,california business and professions code et and the fourth claim alleged unjust enrichment under california common law.
defendants filed separate motions seeking dismissal of the entire lawsuit on five grounds the filed rate doctrine barred plaintiffs claims,the dmea confers no right of private enforcement,the usda is an indispensable party but immune from suit herein,the price reporting program creates no legal obligation on defendants part,and plaintiffs state law claims are preempted by the dmea.the district court dismissed the monetary portions of all four claims solely on the grounds that they were not justiciable pursuant to the filed rate doctrine.d at.the district court also held that,while the filed rate doctrine purportedly does not bar injunctive relief,the third cause of action wherein such relief was inadequately pled.id.at.in so ruling,the district court noted that 
because the filed rate doctrine applies narrowly to bar only claims that are based on minimum prices paid for raw milk,the court is not willing at this point to make the determination that there are no other facts that plaintiffs could possibly plead that would cure the deficiency.further,as noted,the court can not determine at this point that there is no equitable remedy available to plaintiffs.for that reason the amended complaint will be dismissed with leave to amend.
the court is also mindful that the filed rate doctrine consists of a body of law that has been the subject of conflicting interpretations.the court will therefore give favorable consideration to the motion of either party for interlocutory appeal on the issue of whether the filed rate doctrine bars plaintiffs claims in this case.
plaintiffs filed an initial appeal,but their appeal was dismissed because the district court ruling was not a final order.see wmx,miller,cir en banc.plaintiffs then moved in the district court to dismiss their complaint with prejudice so that this court could exercise jurisdiction.the district court granted that motion.plaintiffs then filed a timely notice of appeal.

standard of review and applicable procedural law

because the only issues on appeal raised by plaintiffs concern the application of the filed rate doctrine and its preclusive effect in the present case and because the district court did not rule on defendants other defenses such as the purported lack of a private right of enforcement under the dmea,the status of the usda as an indispensable party,our decision is limited to the filed rate doctrine issues.see singleton wulff,d a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below.ex rel.lee smithkline beecham,cir w e limit our review to issues argued in a party opening brief.
ii.the district court did not err in concluding that the minimum prices for raw milk are generally subject to the filed rate doctrine.
a.the filed rate doctrine 
as we observed in gallo winery encana,cir the filed rate doctrine is a judicial creation that arises from decisions interpreting federal statutes that give federal agencies exclusive jurisdiction to set rates for specified utilities,originally through procedures involving the filing of rates with the agencies.at its most basic,the filed rate doctrine provides that state law,and some federal law antitrust law,may not be used to invalidate a filed rate nor to assume a rate would be charged other than the rate adopted by the federal agency in question.wah chang duke energy trading,llc,cir quoting transmission agency sierra pac.power,cir.it has generally been recognized that there are three purposes or governmental interests which justify or support the filed rate doctrine.
the origin and justifications for the doctrine can be traced to the supreme court early cases involving the interstate commerce act ica.gas hall,d see jim rossi,lowering the filed tariff shield judicial enforcement for a deregulatory era,vand,henceforth lowering the filed tariff shield.in new york,new haven hartford icc,the court,in interpreting the ica,stated 
t he great purpose of the act to regulate commerce,whilst seeking to prevent unjust and unreasonable rates,was to secure equality of rates as to all,and to destroy favoritism,these last being accomplished by requiring the publication of tariffs,and by prohibiting secret departures from such tariffs,and forbidding rebates,preferences and all other forms of undue discrimination.
thus,the initial raison for the doctrine concerned stabilizing rates and preventing pricing discrimination amongst ratepayers see maislin,primary steel,d the duty to file rates with the commission and the obligation to charge only those rates have always been considered essential to preventing price discrimination and stabilizing rates.citations omitted.
once it was determined that federal law required the primacy of filed rates and tariffs,there developed two additional and related justifications for the doctrine,federal preemption or the supremacy of federal law and deference to federal agency expertise or primary jurisdiction.as observed in nantahala power light thornburg,d 
in chicago north western transp.kalo brick tile,d,the court similarly noted that the filed rate doctrine as applied to the actions of the interstate commerce commission assisted in the enforcement of the supremacy of federal law 
the common rationale of these cases is easily stated there can be no divided authority over interstate commerce,and the acts of congress on that subject are supreme and exclusive.missouri pacific stroud.consequently,state efforts to regulate commerce must fall when they conflict with or interfere with federal authority over the same activity.id.at.
alterations in original and parallel citations omitted.allowing filed rates to be subject to litigation in state courts or in federal courts applying state law could result in service rates and conditions varying across jurisdictions,which would conflict with the federal interest in uniformity.see.gas,at permitting individual ratepayers or others to attack a filed rate would undermine the congressional scheme of uniform rate regulation.that conflict would be prevented by treating the filed rates as having what amounts to a preclusive effect on state law claims.
the third justification concerns the unnecessary interjection of the courts into the process where they have no expertise or valid reason to interfere.see,montana dakota utils.nw.pub.serv.we hold that the right to a reasonable rate is the right to the rate which the commission files or fixes,and that,except for review of the commission orders,the courts can assume no right to a different one on the ground that,in its opinion,it is the only or the more reasonable one.
the filed rate doctrine has been given an expansive reading and application in this circuit,even in the face of debate in other forums about its wisdom.mci telecomms.v.at t,d quoting sec,kmart,d internal quotation marks omitted see also square d niagara frontier tariff bureau,d but see verizon,covad commc ns,cir t he filed rate doctrine now functions in the telecommunications field as an anomaly.it is a relic,open to repudiation by the fcc.in gallo winery,at,after reviewing the doctrine and associated principles of federal preemption,we concluded that to the extent congress has given a federal agency authority to set rates under a federal statute and the agency has exercised that authority,such rates are just and reasonable as a matter of law and can not be collaterally challenged under federal antitrust law or state law.see also wah chang,at the filed rate doctrine fortification against direct attack is impenetrable.it turns away both federal and state antitrust actions it turns away racketeer influenced and corrupt organization act actions it turns away state tort actions and it even turns away state attempts to assert sovereign power to commandeer power contracts.footnotes omitted.
b.the filed rate doctrine applies to the minimum rates for raw milk set under fmmos pursuant to the amaa.
no supreme court or federal appellate court case has considered whether the filed rate doctrine applies to marketing orders setting the prices for raw milk under the amaa.however,a number of trial courts in addition to the district court here have held it does.see,in re se.milk antitrust,d,in re dairy farmers of.cheese antitrust,d,servais kraft foods,but see ice cream liquidation,land,d,holding that,while filed rate doctrine does apply to challenges to milk pricing set under an fmmo,it does not apply to a challenge to a defendant artificially inflated wholesale milk prices,which are permitted to be in excess of the minimum rates set under the fmmos.
originally,the filed rate doctrine arose in the context of the following paradigm.a rate or tariff within an industry regulated by federal statute is filed by a carrier or other provider with a federal agency,which in turn accepts and publishes it.see,sec,at.thereafter,the carrier and its customer is not allowed to charge or pay a different rate for that other than the filed one.id.we have held these provisions to create strict filed rate requirements and to forbid equitable defenses to collection of the filed tariff.quoting maislin,at.in turn,the rate is held not to be subject to challenge on antitrust,state law or most other grounds.see,keogh chi.nw.ry.wegoland nynex,cir simply stated,the doctrine holds that any filed rate that is,one approved by the governing regulatory agency is per se reasonable and unassailable in judicial proceedings brought by ratepayers.as noted in ice cream liquidation,d at 
application of the filed rate doctrine in any particular case is not determined by the culpability of the defendant conduct or the possibility of inequitable results.nor does the doctrine application depend on the nature of the cause of action the plaintiff seeks to bring.rather,the courts have held that the doctrine is to be applied strictly to prevent a plaintiff from bringing a cause of action whenever the purpose s underlying the filed rate doctrine are implicated.
citations omitted.
here,admittedly,the statutory scheme created by amaa does not present the typical filed rate scenario.for example,the handlers do not submit rates or prices to the ams in order to create an unwavering price.rather,various pricing data are provided to the nass some of which are supplied by handlers such as the defendants and that data are utilized along with make allowances and yields which are fixed by the agency rules in pricing formulas which,in turn,delineate the raw milk rates.see.also,the rates consist of only minimum prices from which the handlers and producers can deviate,albeit only in an upward direction which favors the dairy producers.further,the set rates are not uniform across the nation.they can vary amongst the eleven established milk marketing areas,and there are also locations without any applicable fmmos and hence no controlling filed rates.see subtit.b,ch.x hillside dairy,at.additionally,the individual handlers make payments which vary according to the market value of the milk they use as reflected in the minimum payments,but all the milk producers in the area covered by the fmmo receive the same average,or blended,price per unit of milk.finally,the fmmos which contain the pricing formulas,while promulgated by the usda and subject to appropriate rulemaking proceedings including public hearing and comment,must be approved by the handlers of at least percent of the volume of milk within the geographic area covered by the proposed order and at least of the affected dairy producers in the region.see.nevertheless,despite those elements,there are sufficient attributes which justify the application of the doctrine to the amaa milk pricing situation generally.
first,milk pricing is the subject of extensive federal statutory and regulatory control.see.additionally,under the amaa,the usda via the ams and through the fmmos sets minimum prices for raw milk purchased from producers by handlers where there can be no downward deviation in the rate.therefore,to paraphrase gallo,the filed rate doctrine is applicable because congress has given the usda authority to set rates under and the usda has exercised that authority to create the fmmos which,in turn,are utilized to establish minimum prices for raw milk purchases and thus such rates are just and reasonable as a matter of law.at.
further,the three underlying justifications for the filed rate doctrine apply to fmmo prices set under the amaa.the setting of minimum rates prevents discriminatory pricing albeit to a more limited extent than other situations where the doctrine has been applied and stabilizes prices by assuring dairy producers of reasonable payments for raw milk as fixed by the ams.additionally,the setting of minimum rates by means of formulas established in the fmmos is a matter which clearly falls within an area of usda expertise,which most courts would not possess.finally,the amaa and its concomitant regulations establish a federal scheme as to uniform minimum pricing which should not generally be the subject of attack by ratepayers or others.as stated in 
it is declared to be the policy of congress 
through the exercise of the powers conferred upon the secretary of agriculture under this chapter,to establish and maintain such orderly marketing conditions for agricultural commodities in interstate commerce as will establish,as the prices to farmers,parity prices as defined by section a of this title a.
to protect the interest of the consumer by a approaching the level of prices which it is declared to be the policy of congress to establish in subsection of this section and b authorizing no action under this chapter which has for its purpose the maintenance of prices to farmers above the level which it is declared to be the policy of congress to establish in subsection of this section.
meaningful review by the federal agency is not a prerequisite to the application of the filed rate doctrine.
plaintiffs challenge application of the filed rate doctrine here based on the contention that the usda lacks any actual legal authority to meaningfully review the substance of the pricing.they rely on brown ticor title ins,cir,where we held that the filed rate doctrine did not apply to title insurance rates filed with state insurance agencies because,although the rates were filed with the state agencies,they were not subjected to meaningful review by the state.id.at citing wileman elliott,giannini,cir 
we are not persuaded that brown requires meaningful review for the filed rate doctrine to apply in all cases,however.in square d niagara frontier tariff bureau,d,the supreme court held that the filed rate doctrine applied to rates merely filed with the interstate commerce commission icc,even when those rates had not been investigated and approved by the icc.similarly,in gallo,we held that the filed rate doctrine applied to market rates for natural gas authorized by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc.the plaintiff argued that the filed rate doctrine applied only to only rates that have been literally filed with and approved by ferc.at.we disagreed,emphasizing that the essential question was whether the market rates were authorized by the ferc.see id.we explained that the ferc was not required to use any particular form of regulation in its quest to ensure reasonable rates.id.it mattered only that the rates were authorized by the ferc in the exercise of its statutory authority.see id.at thus,like the district courts that have addressed the issue,we do not read brown as making meaningful agency review a sine qua non for the applicability of the filed rate doctrine.see in re hawaiian guamanian cabotage antitrust,d,collecting cases that characterize brown as an outlier decision on the issue.
the proper inquiry,therefore,is whether the fmmo minimum prices were authorized by the usda pursuant to its statutory authority,or,to paraphrase gallo,whether the usda was doing enough regulation to justify federal preemption of state laws.see gallo,at.we conclude that it did.
the applicable statute required the secretary to issue orders which provided for a particular,but partial,methodology for establishing minimum uniform prices for raw milk.it is not disputed that the secretary exercised his discretion and promulgated regulations governing that rate setting process and issued orders in the form of the fmmos to effectuate those requirements of the statutory scheme.part of the methodology includes formulas which are dependent upon the input of sales prices and volumes supplied by designated handlers.
plaintiffs argue that the prices dairyamerica reported to nass are comparable to rates like those in brown because ams only had the power to take nass data,plug them into a predetermined formula,and then publish the resulting fmmo prices.once the prices were reported to nass,in other words,the rest of the pricing was mechanical and amounted to silence by ams.moreover,as plaintiffs argue,ams did not have at that time the power to review the accuracy of data collected by the nass.however,plaintiffs do not contend that the secretary did not have the statutory authority to review the accuracy of nass data instead they argue that the usda implementing regulations did not,during the applicable time frame,contain any explicit provision for such a review.in opposition,defendants point out that the usda has,in at least instances,used its discretion to change the price data it used to calculate milk prices 
plaintiffs counter that,under the relevant implementing regulations,ams only has the power to do so i f for any reason a price or pricing constituent required for computing the prices described in is not available.section calculates rates based on nass pricing data.
plaintiffs clearly underestimate the extent of the agency authority and its execution of those powers in setting the minimum prices under the fmmos.indeed,the usda here did far more than the ferc in the gallo case in this regard.first,the agency promulgated regulations which created an intricate system for the setting of the prices.unlike the ferc in gallo which merely reviewed the natural gas market and determined it was competitive,at,the usda not only examined the dairy products market,but also took into account volume,location,of the milk,production differentials,and other factors in creating the formulas in the fmmos.also,the formulas do not consider only one or two data points but a large number of them to arrive at the ultimate price determination.additionally,the formulas which generate the rates also include the consideration of make allowances and yields which are fixed by the agency rules.further,the fmmos are not effective until the secretary obtains the approval of handlers of at least percent of the milk processed and of the affected dairy producers within the geographic territory subject to the order.thus,the secretary exercises extensive authority milk pricing in establishing the formulas in the fmmos which in turn set the parameters for the issued minimum prices.
additionally,as in gallo,the usda here maintained ongoing oversight of the market and initiated remedial actions in response to evidence of market manipulation.indeed,upon being informed of the misreporting by dairyamerica,the agency took steps to determine the effect of the misinformation,calculated corrective prices for the periods when the original data were available,and enacted regulations and amendments to the fmmos for improved oversight of the reporting process.furthermore,plaintiffs contention that ams did not and could not do anything but accept the nass data even if it knew they were unreliable is incorrect.plaintiffs argument is essentially that,had dairyamerica provided false pricing information to nass and then sent a letter to ams saying we made this data up,ams would have been obligated to use that data to set prices.that is,to say the least,a curious interpretation of the pertinent regulations,and.indeed,during the relevant period,the market administrators who were empowered to administer the fmmos had the authority to make rules and regulations to effectuate the terms and provisions of the fmmos,receive,investigate,and report violations to the secretary,and recommend amendments to the secretary.see b.
in sum,the usda did possess the authority and did exercise it to address problems as to the minimum prices for raw milk under the fmmos,such that the filed rate doctrine is applicable in the present amaa situation 
iii.precedent does not require and policy considerations do not support applying the filed rate doctrine as a bar under the facts of this case.
plaintiffs argue that even if the filed rate doctrine applies to milk prices in general,it should not serve as a bar in this case,since the usda has indicated that it would have set different prices had dairyamerica reported its data correctly.we know that prices would have been different but for the misreporting,because the nass issued retroactive revised prices for part of the relevant period after dairyamerica acknowledged its erroneous reporting,and ams calculated the increase in the prices of nfdm for the period between april,and april.we agree that the filed rate doctrine does not preempt or otherwise pose a preclusive bar to plaintiffs lawsuit,because the federal agency itself determined that the fmmo prices were incorrect and the policy considerations behind the doctrine do not justify applying the doctrine as a bar in this case.
plaintiffs initially attempt to avoid the strictures of the filed rate doctrine by arguing that they are not actually seeking to challenge a fixed rate at all.however,we have made it clear that the doctrine precludes remedies which rely on a court recalculation of rates which would have been charged,even if the plaintiff is not directly challenging the filed rate 
wah chang can not avoid the fact that it seeks what amounts to having the courts determine what rates the energy companies should have charged instead of the rates they did charge.wah chang would inevitably drag the courts into a determination of what rate would be fair and proper.that is precisely what wah chang can not do.
wah chang,at.establishing damage amounts for plaintiffs claims,similarly,would require calculating what rates would have been set but for the defendants misreporting.for this reason,it would be unavailing for plaintiffs to rely on gallo dictum that w e are aware of no basis for holding that the filed rate doctrine bars claims based on a reference point for pricing transactions be it a trade index,the consumer price index,or the new york stock exchange that is not itself a rate.gallo,at.still,as discussed below,it is a different situation where the agency itself in the context of the recognizes that its issued rates are in error due to the misconduct of the enriched party.
a.the filed rate doctrine does not bar plaintiffs claims given the usda recognition that its published fmmo rates were incorrect due to defendants misreporting.
the supreme court has said that the filed rate doctrine does not apply to bar a private litigant claims if the rate has been suspended or set aside by the relevant agency.keogh,at whether an agency has sufficiently rejected a rate for purposes of the filed rate doctrine analysis,whether that rejection should eliminate the doctrine preemptive bar,and,even if the bar is so removed,whether thereafter a plaintiff should be allowed to recover damages arising from the incorrect prior rates are admittedly difficult issues.they can only be correctly answered after consideration of the underlying statutory scheme in which the doctrine is being applied and the justifications for the doctrine.
initially,the defendants contend that the issues disputed herein were settled by.gas,where the supreme court held that the filed rate doctrine prohibited a federally regulated seller of natural gas from charging higher rates than those filed with the ferc despite the contention that,had the seller applied for a higher rate,the ferc would have approved it.at.in that case,the court did not find compelling the argument that the defendant misconduct a breach of contract had prevented the plaintiff seller from filing for a higher rate id.at.however,the court specifically focused on the controlling statute,the natural gas act,et.it observed that 
not only do the courts lack authority to impose a different rate than the one approved by the commission,but the commission itself has no power to alter a rate retroactively.when the commission finds a rate unreasonable,it shall determine the just and reasonable rate to be thereafter observed and in force.a,stat,a emphasis added.
id.at.based upon the plain text of the statute specifically precluding the ferc from altering a published rate retroactively as well as ordering any reparations based on the unlawfulness of past rates,the court concluded that a state court could not be allowed to award what amounts to a retroactive right to collect a rate in excess of the filed rate because it would only accentuate the danger of conflict.and constitute a usurpation of federal authority.id.at 
obviously,where the controlling statute prohibits the federal agency from altering a filed rate retroactively or limits any application of reconsidered rates to prospective situations,then the agency can not effectively suspend or set aside the published rates for purposes of a lawsuit seeking recovery based on injuries arising from the imposition of those rates.however,unlike the natural gas act,there is nothing in the amaa or the dmea which specifically bars the usda from revising rates where handlers have supplied incorrect data to the agency.
turning to the issue of the extent to which the federal agency must indicate that it is suspending,setting aside or otherwise rejecting the filed rate,it is noted that a large segment of the cases dealing with the filed rate doctrine arise in the context of statutes such as the ica,the communications act,and legislation involving the ferc,where an policy as to filed rates or tariffs lies at the very heart of the statutory scheme.see,new york,new haven hartford,at at t central office,d.in such situations,a federal agency ability to set aside a published rate retroactively would be extremely limited and,hence,any attempt to do so would have to be explicitly executed and thoroughly explained.for example,in keogh,it was held that a rate that is filed with the icc and,after hearings,is approved by the commission is deemed reasonable and as a matter of law,u nless and until suspended or set aside.at.however,the court observed that in the context of the ica,setting aside or suspending the published tariff for purposes of a legal action for damages would be extremely difficult because any such case which led to a damages award to the plaintiff shipper would operate as a preference over his trade competitors and vitiate the paramount purpose of the ica,preventing pricing discrimination,and in any such proceeding,the commission would have to determine whether a rate is discriminatory but by no conceivable proceeding could the question whether a hypothetical lower rate would under conceivable conditions have been discriminatory,be submitted to the commission for determination.id.at.
plaintiffs cite to the supreme court decision in maislin for the proposition that the doctrine does not bar claims challenging prices that were rejected by the relevant agency.that reading of the case is overbroad.in maislin,the court noted the ica prohibited both carriers and shippers from deviating from published tariffs filed with the icc,but also required that the carrier rates be nondiscriminatory and reasonable,and charged the icc,upon determining that a rate or practice violates the statute,with prescribing the subsequent rate or practice to be followed.at.in,in response to a growing trend wherein carriers and shippers privately negotiated rates lower than those filed with the agency,the icc concluded that changes in the motor carrier industry clearly warrant ed a tempering of the former harsh rule of adhering to the tariff rate in virtually all cases,and so it established a new policy whereby in referenced cases it would decid e if the collection of undercharges would be an unreasonable practice.id.at.a carrier that had entered into such a private contract went bankrupt,and its bankruptcy estate brought an action against the shipper to collect the difference between the contract rate and the higher filed tariff.the court initially held that the filed rate doctrine contains an important caveat the filed rate is not enforceable if the icc finds the rate to be unreasonable.id.at.the court went on to quote from arizona grocery atchison,topeka santa fe ry,that under the act the shipper was bound to pay the legal rate but if he could show that it was unreasonable he might recover reparation.id.at alteration in original thus,maislin stands,in part,for the limited proposition that,where the statute allows the agency to decide that a published tariff is unreasonable under controlling law,the filed rate doctrine will not bar a plaintiff from seeking reparation from the imposition of the unreasonable rate.
the supreme court in icc american trucking associations,d,considered the related issue regarding the extent to which an agency can retroactively reject a previously filed rate.in the motor carrier act of,b,congress set forth specific guidelines to which motor carrier rate bureaus had to comply in order to receive antitrust immunity.in response,the icc issued an interpretive ruling wherein it proposed to adopt a new remedy wherein it would retroactively reject effective tariffs that had been submitted in substantial violation of the law.it based its authority to adopt that remedy on former e,which provided that the commission may reject a tariff submitted to it by a common carrier if that tariff violates this section or regulation of the commission carrying out this section.id.at.the court held that section e did not authorize the commission to reject effective tariffs,but nevertheless found that the icc authority is not bounded by the powers expressly enumerated in the act but that the commission also has discretion to take actions that are legitimate,reasonable,and direct ly adjunct to the commission express statutory power.id.at third alteration in original quoting in re trans alaska pipeline rate cases,d.the court found the icc new remedy to be a justifiable adjunct to its express statutory mandate.at.
the district court here considered the issue of whether the fmmo prices were rejected by the agency such that the filed rate doctrine would be inapplicable.it found that the usda had disapproved of the rates but then stated that the issue before the court is whether the disapproval of rates by the regulating agency can be held by the courts to operate retroactively.d at.the court relied on both american trucking and city of groton to hold that rejection in the context of filed rate doctrine analysis necessarily involves the agency presumably formal suspension or setting aside of the published rates,and a finding that a statutory mandate would be furthered by the retroactive rejection of the minimum pricing structures set forth in fmmos in question id.at.we disagree with the first point and conclude that the second was satisfied.
as discussed above,the primary purposes of the amaa and dmea are to establish and maintain such orderly marketing conditions for agricultural commodities in interstate commerce as will establish,as the prices to farmers,parity prices,and the protection of the producers of milk and milk products,block,at.additionally,the prices that are set for raw milk under the applicable statutes are minimum rates which can be and are subject to further negotiation between handlers and dairy farmers.those rates are not initially filed and reviewed by the agency but rather are the product of formulas established by the usda which are,in part,dependent upon the receipt of pricing data from certain handlers.in such a situation,there is nothing in the controlling statutes or concomitant regulations that would appear to require any formal process or particular expression for the agency retroactively setting aside or rejecting milk prices that have been incorrectly set as a result of misreporting by certain handlers.further,the statutory goals as to an orderly mandate of marketing conditions and the protection of milk producers would both be served by imposing consequences on handlers for misreporting that resulted in incorrect fmmo pricing and multimillion dollar losses for dairy farmers.
neither keogh,maislin,nor american trucking addresses the issue of what specific steps an agency need take before it can be deemed to have rejected a rate.such a question can not be considered in a vacuum the steps required before an agency rate rejection should be recognized will necessarily vary based on both the statutory framework within which the agency acts and upon the purposes of the statute in furtherance of which the agency acts.in american trucking,the court noted that the agency itself had limited its rejection powers such that effective tariffs will be nullified only upon findings of substantial violations of agreements.at.neither keogh nor maislin had the opportunity to address this issue of when an agency has taken sufficient steps to officially disapprove a rate.we conclude that the usda actions here constitute a sufficient rejection such that the filed rate doctrine is not a bar.further,the statutory mandate of the amaa and the dmea,as well as the policies of the filed rate doctrine more generally,are furthered by our conclusion that the filed rate doctrine does not apply to bar plaintiffs claims here.
the usda adequately expressed its disapproval of the fmmo prices while the usda recalculation of minimum dairy prices was not explicitly called a rejection,the agency recognized that earlier filed rates were incorrect at the time they were filed and imposed significant and improper costs on producers.these revisions were,as ams made clear,not necessarily complete since reallocation effects were not considered.the usda also sought to recalculate prices for the whole class period,but could not do so because dairy handlers did not supply it with accurate da
