lisa watson and loretta lawson filed this interlocutory appeal,on their own behalf and as representatives of a class,from the district court denial of their motion to remand to state court.watson and lawson filed their class action in arkansas state court,alleging that philip morris violated the arkansas deceptive trade practices act.see ann.et.we hold that the case was properly removed to federal court.
watson and lawson claim that philip morris engaged in unfair business practices deceptive and unlawful conduct in connection with the manufacture,distribution,promotion,marketing,and sale of cambridge lights and marlboro lights.they basically allege that philip morris designed its cigarettes to deliver more tar and nicotine to smokers than its use of the labels lights and lowered tar and nicotine in its advertising would suggest.the propriety of remand is the only issue before us,as it was in the district court,and we express no views on the merits.
philip morris removed the action pursuant to a,which permits removal where a person is sued for actions taken under the direction of a federal officer.philip morris claims it satisfies the requirements of the federal officer statute because it was acting under the direct control of the federal trade commission ftc when it engaged in the allegedly unlawful conduct.the district court denied watson and lawson motion to remand and certified the following question for interlocutory appeal under b may philip morris remove this lawsuit to federal court under a slip op.at.we affirm the district court answer of yes to that question.
the applicability of this removal statute depends in large part on the role the ftc plays in regulating the tobacco industry 
the federal trade commission act authorizes the ftc to regulate unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce,a,which includes regulation of unfair and deceptive tobacco advertisements,cipollone liggett group,d ftc has long regulated unfair and deceptive advertising practices in the cigarette industry.
in the,the ftc policy changed from permitting some claims of low or lower tar and nicotine levels to prohibiting all such representations in advertising.the ftc wanted a uniform rating system so that consumers could compare tar and nicotine levels among brands.the ftc developed the cambridge filter method,which uses a smoking machine that takes a puff on a cigarette every sixty seconds until the cigarette is smoked to a specified length.brown williamson,at.the machine collects tar and nicotine on filter pads to be measured.since its first formal testing in,the ftc has been reporting the cambridge filter method results in the federal register.from its initial development,the ftc was aware that the testing method did not measure the amount of tar or nicotine that an individual smoker may receive.the purpose of the test was not to replicate human smoking but to provide a basis for comparison.
when the ftc proposed a trade regulation rule in that would require advertisements to disclose tar and nicotine ratings,as determined by the cambridge filter method,several leading tobacco companies responded by entering into an agreement to disclose the cambridge filter method results in all cigarette advertising.the ftc accepted the agreement,which was conditioned on suspension of the formal rulemaking proceedings.letter from eight tobacco companies to ftc,letter agreement.
after twenty years of testing,the ftc decided to terminate its cigarette testing lab,and instead require the cigarette industry to,using the cambridge filter method,and to submit results that would continue to be published in the federal register.the ftc retained the right to conduct unannounced inspections of the industry testing facilities and the right to confirm the test results through a government lab.
based upon the ftc involvement in the tobacco industry,the district court denied watson and lawson motion to remand to state court.our review of that denial is de novo.see nichols harbor venture,cir.
section a permits removal by the following 
the united states or any agency thereof or any officer or any person acting under that officer of the united states or of any agency thereof,sued in an official or individual capacity for any act under color of such office or on account of any right,title or authority claimed under any act of congress for the apprehension or punishment of criminals or the collection of the revenue.
emphasis added.section a requires that a defendant act under the direction of a federal officer show a nexus or causal connection between the alleged conduct and the official authority have a colorable federal defense and be a person within the meaning of the statute.see,jefferson county acker,d requiring a colorable federal defense to a suit for a n act under color of office and a causal connection between the charged conduct and asserted official authority mesa california,d recognizing the a requirement of person s acting under an officer of the united states or any agency thereof sued for act s under color of such office united states todd,cir requiring a colorable defense arising out of the defendant duty to enforce federal law paldrmic altria,d,incorporating all four requirements.watson and lawson dispute only the first and second requirements.
in willingham morgan,d,the supreme court explained why the federal officer removal statute was not meant to be given a narrow or limited interpretation 
one of the primary purposes of the removal its history clearly to have such defenses litigated in the federal courts in cases like this one,congress has decided that federal offices,and indeed the federal government itself,require the protection of a federal forum.this policy should not be frustrated by a narrow,grudging interpretation of a.
the primary purpose of giving the protection of a federal forum under this statute has a lengthy history.the broad scope of federal officer removal is explained in the early case of tennessee davis,where the court applied the original version of the statute to revenue officers 
i f their protection must be left to the action of the state operations of the general government may at any time be arrested at the will of one of its members.the legislation of a state may be unfriendly.it may affix penalties to acts done under the immediate direction of the national government,and in obedience to its laws.it may deny the authority conferred by those laws.the state court may administer not only the laws of the state,but equally federal law,in such a manner as to paralyze the operations of the government.and even if,after trial and final judgment in the state court,the case can be brought into the united states court for review,the officer is withdrawn from the discharge of his duty during the pendency of the prosecution,and the exercise of acknowledged federal power arrested.
see also arizona manypenny,d respondent here,by obtaining a federal forum,has fully vindicated the federal policies supporting removal.the plainest evidence of this vindication is the district court application of the immunity defense.winters diamond shamrock chem,cir.the supreme court interpreted the original version of the statute to exclude agencies removal ability under the statute.primate protection league admin rs.of tulane educ.fund,d.congress responded by amending the statute to explicitly permit agency removal.see,a.congress decision to amend the statute to reverse primate and permit agency removal provides further support for a broad interpretation of the federal officer removal statute.
whether a defendant is acting under the direction of a federal officer depends on the detail and specificity of the federal direction of the defendant activities and whether the government exercises control over the defendant.
r emoval by a person acting under a federal officer must be predicated showing that the acts were performed pursuant to an officer direct orders or to comprehensive and detailed regulations.virden altria group,d,quoting ryan dow chem.mere participation in a regulated industry is insufficient to support removal unless the challenged conduct is closely linked to detailed and specific regulations.virden,d at quoting in re wireless.radio frequency emissions prods.liab,d,rev sub nom.on other grounds,pinney nokia,cir.in contrast to the district court decision in this case,every other district court confronted with tobacco companies alleging they were acting under a federal officer has remanded the case to state court.see virden,d paldrmic altria,d tremblay philip morris,d.
although tobacco companies efforts at federal officer removal have not been successful in other courts,companies contracting with the government have had more success.courts have found private actors,working under government contracts,to be acting under the direction of a federal officer where the government maintained control over the manner in which the contractor performed the contracted work or monitored the performance of the work.virden,d at.
in a fifth circuit government contract case,diamond shamrock chemical company manufactured herbicide,now known as agent orange,for the government.winters diamond shamrock chem,cir.a nurse in vietnam claimed that exposure to agent orange caused her to develop lymphoma.id.diamond removed the case to federal court and argued that when it manufactured agent orange it was acting under the direction of a federal officer.id.at.the government specified the formula for agent orange,as well as the packaging,labeling and shipping requirements.id.at.the government also inspected the labeling of the containers,and compelled diamond to deliver the agent orange to it under threat of criminal sanctions,id.at.in finding diamond acted under the direction of a federal officer,the court stated 
we are convinced that the government detailed specifications concerning the,packaging,and delivery of agent orange,the compulsion to provide the product to the government specifications,and the supervision the government exercised over the formulation,packaging,and delivery of agent orange is all quite sufficient to demonstrate that the defendants acted pursuant to federal direction and that a direct causal nexus exists between the defendant actions taken under color of federal office and winters claims.
the extent of federal direction reached a similar level in fung abex.fung involved exposure to asbestos during abex construction of submarines pursuant to federal contract.id.at.the district court found that the government monitored abex performance at all times and required it to construct and repair the vessels according to the contract specifications.id.at.in addition,the government retained the right to inspect,test,and approve all contract supplies,and performed its own tests on the submarines to ensure compliance with the contract.id.at.the district court found that this level of control and direction satisfied the acting under requirement of section a.id.
here,the ftc exercises the same type of comprehensive,detailed regulation and does the same kind of ongoing monitoring as in winters and fung.in addition to specifying a testing method that was discussed in detail in two separate submissions to chemists journals,the ftc modified the testing method to include the following requirements 
smoke cigarettes to a mm.butt length,or to the length of the filter and overwrap plus mm.if in excess of,
base results on a test of cigarettes per brand,or type,
cigarettes to be tested will be selected on a random basis,as opposed to weight selection,
determine particulate matter on a dry basis to determine the moisture content,
determine and report the tar content after subtracting moisture and alkaloids as nicotine from particulate matter,
report tar content to the nearest whole milligram and nicotine content to the nearest milligram.
federal trade commission testing for tar and nicotine content.the ftc specificity in testing procedures is comparable to the specificity of the government formula for agent orange.
another example of the detail involved in the government directives to the tobacco industry is the specific manner in which the industry agreed to disclose the tar and nicotine ratings in advertising 
the disclosure will be in the following language 
mg.tar,mg.nicotine 
av.per cigarette,ftc report date 
letter agreement at.in fung,the parties agreement included the design for submarines,and in this case the parties agreement included the design for testing cigarettes and disclosure of ratings.in winters,the government controlled the delivery and labeling of agent orange.here,the ftc controls the delivery of tar and nicotine information to consumers.the ftc ongoing monitoring of the cigarette industry far exceeds the monitoring in winters.the government in winters monitored one small aspect of the agent orange creation and distribution labeling of the containers.here,the ftc itself conducted the entire testing process for twenty years and now requires the cigarette manufacturers to conduct the testing to its specifications.the ftc continues to inspect the industry labs,independently verify the results,and publish the ratings.in addition,part of the ftc ongoing monitoring includes monitoring cigarette ads and occasionally bringing claims against companies for deceptive advertising.
we are satisfied that the level of specificity of the direction is more extensive than that in winters,but the question remains whether the government compels compliance with its directions.in winters,diamond shamrock was compelled to supply the agent orange to the government.in fung,the defendant acted pursuant to a binding contract that gave the government legal rights to enforce its directions.in this case,philip morris acted pursuant to a voluntary industry agreement.two of the courts confronted with federal officer removal and the tobacco industry have found it significant that the agreement to test and disclose ratings was a voluntary agreement,not a formal rule.see,paldrmic,d at virden,d at.
we are convinced that the record in this case shows a level of compulsion that establishes that philip morris was indeed acting under the direction of a federal officer.the ftc effectively used its coercive power to cause the tobacco companies to enter the agreement.the ftc made the policy decision to pursue a voluntary agreement instead of proceeding by formal rulemaking.the tobacco industry first proposed an agreement on october,which was just over two months after the ftc announced an intention to make a formal rule requiring disclosure of the cambridge filter method tar and nicotine ratings.this voluntary agreement was a substitute for a formal rule.the industry almost certainly would not have proposed the agreement if the ftc had not threatened to make a formal rule.though the ftc did not act formally,the effect of its actions still compelled the tobacco companies to adhere to a testing and advertising standard that was prompted by the ftc.the ftc agreed with the industry that a voluntary agreement was preferable to the formalities of rulemaking.
ftc chairperson miles kirkpatrick explained how an agreement would best serve the goals of the ftc 
the commission objective is to insure that all cigarette advertising make these tar and nicotine disclosures as soon as possible.if the industry can devise a voluntary plan that is feasible and appropriate,the commission is willing to consider it.a trade regulation rule,if contested in the courts,might take a long time to become effective a workable,voluntary plan by the industry could be put into effect immediately.
press release,ftc.
daniel oliver,chairman of the ftc in,explained that the ftc practice in advertising regulation was moving more toward agreements and away from rulemaking,which had proved to be inefficient,little used and not terribly successful.bringing a single case against one cigarette company would have the effect of bringing the whole industry into compliance and would do so much more quickly than would a formal rulemaking process.as a result,voluntary agreements have become part of a general trend in administrative law,and the tobacco industry has responded to that trend with cooperation.
even if the companies had not been compe
