at issue here are two state laws.one is the unfair competition law,which allows a private party to bring an unfair competition action on behalf of others bus,but only if the person has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.id.the other law is the labor code private attorneys general act of,which provides that an aggrieved employee may bring an action to recover civil penalties for violations of the labor code on behalf of himself or herself and other current or former employees,subd.a.
this case presents two issues.first,may a plaintiff labor union that has not suffered actual injury under the unfair competition law,and that is not an aggrieved employee under the labor code private attorney general act of,nevertheless bring a representative action under those laws as the assignee of employees who have suffered an actual injury and who are aggrieved employees,or as an association whose members have suffered actual injury and are aggrieved employees the answer is no.second,must a representative action under the unfair competition law be brought as a class action the answer is yes,for the reasons stated in the companion case of arias superior court cal th,d.
seventeen individual plaintiffs and two labor transit union,local,and teamsters joint council,plaintiff unions brought this action against defendants first transit,progressive transportation services,and laidlaw transit services.
in the fourth amended complaint plaintiff unions alleged they are the representatives of defendants employees this action is brought on behalf of themselves and all aggrieved transportation industry employees and former employees employed by defendants and over employees and former employees of defendants have assigned to plaintiff unions their rights under the unfair competition law and the labor code private attorney general act of,including the right to sue in a representative capacity.with respect to the individual plaintiffs,they allege they are bringing this action on behalf of themselves as well as on behalf of current and former employees of defendants.
the fourth amended complaint further alleged that defendants have violated the unfair competition law,and that defendants are subject to civil penalties under the labor code private attorneys general act of for failing to provide meal or rest periods as required by the labor code and by an industrial welfare commission wage order.the complaint sought injunctive relief restitution of in unpaid wages in lieu of unprovided meal and rest periods,days wages for each employee who was terminated without being paid in civil penalties prejudgment interest and attorney fees.
the case was assigned to a judge in the complex litigation program of the los angeles county superior court.the judge held an initial status conference,determined that this case was one of five related actions,and designated this action as the lead case.the parties stipulated to a briefing schedule and to a hearing date on which the trial judge would decide threshold legal issues,such as whether plaintiff unions had standing to sue and whether this representative action must be brought as a class action.
after briefing and oral argument,the trial court ruled plaintiff unions lack standing under the unfair competition law because they have not suffered actual injury,and they lack standing under the labor code private attorneys general act of because they are not aggrieved employees employee assignments of rights to plaintiff unions did not confer standing on the unions to prosecute the claims in question,as doing so would circumvent the requirements of both the unfair competition law and the act and would render meaningless recent amendments to the unfair competition law and the unfair competition law claims brought on behalf of others must be brought as a class action.
plaintiff unions petitioned the court of appeal for a writ of mandate and a stay of the trial court ruling.after issuing a stay and an order to show cause,a divided court of appeal panel denied the petition.we granted plaintiff unions petition for review.
we begin with a summary of the relevant aspects of both the unfair competition law and the labor code private attorney general act of,the two state laws at issue here.
unfair competition law 
the unfair competition law prohibits any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice bus.before,the unfair competition law allowed any person acting for the interests of itself,its members or the general public to seek restitution or injunctive relief against unfair acts or practices.bus,former,added by stats,ch.thus,under the former law a plaintiff did not have to show any actual injury,and a representative action brought under the unfair competition law did not have to be brought as a class action.former,kraus trinity management services,cal th,fn,d,stop youth addiction,lucky stores,cal th,d,see corbett superior court th,d.
but that changed in,when voters,exercising their constitutionally granted power of initiative,enacted proposition.in the preamble to that measure the voters declared that the broad standing permitted by the unfair competition law had been abused.see californians for disability rights mervyn,llc cal th,d.proposition amended the unfair competition law to allow private representative claims for relief to be brought only by those persons who satisfied the law new standing requirements and who complied with code of civil procedure section bus.the law now requires that a representative claim,that is,a claim seeking relief on behalf of others,may be brought only by a person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition,this replaced the former standing provision which had allowed an unfair competition law action to be brought by any person acting for the interests of itself,its members or the general public.bus,former.
labor code private attorneys general act of 
in september,the legislature enacted the labor code private attorneys general act of,et,stats,ch,eff.the act permits a civil action by an aggrieved employee on behalf of himself or herself and other current or former employees to recover civil penalties for violations of other provisions of the labor code,subd.a.it defines an aggrieved employee as any person who was employed by the alleged violator and against whom one or more of the alleged violations was sic committed,subd.c.
both the unfair competition law and the labor code private attorneys general act of require a plaintiff to have suffered injury resulting from an unlawful action under the unfair competition law by unfair acts or practices under the act,by violations of the labor code.here,plaintiff unions concede that they do not satisfy these requirements.they insist,however,that under either law they have standing to sue in a representative capacity as the assignees of defendants employees who did sustain injury.we explore the assignment issue below.
the legal concept of assignment refers to the transferability of all types of property,including a cause of action.essex ins.five star dye house,cal th,d.a cause of action,sometimes called a thing in action,is a right to recover money or other personal property by a judicial proceeding.a thing in action,arising out of the violation of a right of property,or out of an obligation,may be transferred by the owner.an obligation is a legal duty,by which a person is bound to do or not to do a certain thing.
at issue here is whether under the unfair competition law an assignment of a cause of action can confer standing on an uninjured assignee,and whether a cause of action under the labor code private attorneys general act of is assignable.in both instances,the answer is no,as discussed below.
we noted earlier that through proposition the california electorate in amended the unfair competition law by requiring the plaintiff to be one who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.bus,see ante d at,fn,at,fn.voter information guide,official title and summary.as the trial court and the court of app
