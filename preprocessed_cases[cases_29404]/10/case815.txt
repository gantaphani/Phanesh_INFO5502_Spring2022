nicholas narducci,at one time the comptroller for the village of bellwood,is suing the village,the former mayor,and the police chief for violating his fourth amendment rights and the fourth amendment rights of other plaintiffs in this class action suit by surreptitiously recording phone calls from the village finance department.he is suing under and title iii,a federal statute prohibiting government officials from intercepting wire or electronic communications.the defendants moved for summary judgment in the district court,which was granted in part and denied in part.they now appeal the denial of summary judgment,arguing that they are entitled to qualified immunity on both the and title iii claims.
for the following reasons,we affirm the district court.
background 
in,joe lagen,the comptroller of the village of bellwood,began to worry about irate residents threatening employees of the village finance department over the phone usually because the residents had failed to pay their utility bills and had seen the city shut off their water service.and that was not lagen only worry.he was also concerned about finance department employees making personal calls on the village time and over the village phone lines.lagen proposed to the village board of trustees at a meeting that the village record calls to and from the finance department on the same system used to record calls to the police and fire departments.
meetings,which were usually attended by bellwood mayor donald lemm,the board of trustees,the village attorney and the village clerk,were a common means by which the board of trustees clarified its agenda in advance of the board meetings and heard proposals it was unusual,but not unheard of,for the board to adopt policy at a meeting.the board of trustees apparently agreed to lagen proposal at the meeting,and authorized him to begin recording the finance department telephone lines.lemm supported the idea as well,having recently heard some complaints about finance department employees being rude to residents calling the village.
the board requested that the bellwood emergency telephone system board,the board overseeing the village operations,connect the finance department phone lines to the recording system for emergency calls.bellwood established an emergency telephone system in and the police department recorded calls to the system.lagen sent gary modrow,a sergeant in the local police force and the chair of the emergency telephone system board,a memo on january,instructing him to add five phone lines from the finance department to the emergency recording system.modrow asked a technician from dictaphone,the manufacturer of the village recording system,to connect those phone lines.the process was completed about thirty days later.narducci contends that the village did not post notices on or near the phones alerting finance department employees that the village was recording their phone calls the village claims,however,that users of the phone system heard an audible beep when they began using one of the recorded lines.narducci,citing deposition testimony from modrow,counters that the beep tone was eliminated and that he,at least,never heard it when using the affected phone lines.it appears that lagen never listened to any of the calls to check up on threats to department employees or misuse of the village phone system,and lemm never with the finance department regarding threats from customers or instances of rude behavior from employees.
in march,gregory moore replaced robert frascone as the chief of the village police department.moore learned before taking office that the village was recording phone lines in the finance department,but did not investigate the circumstances of the recording and took no steps to disconnect the dictaphone from the phone lines until narducci,lagen successor as comptroller,asked him to.moore argued in the district court that he had no authority to disconnect the phone lines,although frascone and lemm claimed in deposition testimony that he did.
narducci took over as bellwood comptroller in or,replacing lagen.he says that when he took over he had no idea that bellwood was recording the phone lines in his department.bellwood is a small unincorporated community just west of chicago,and does not employ a comptroller narducci was simultaneously working for other nearby communities and usually spent only a few days a week in bellwood.when he was in bellwood,he frequently used the phone lines in the finance department both for calls and also to make calls related to confidential matters for other cities.narducci claims that he would usually work at whatever desk in the finance department was open,but that for confidential matters he sought a place to make his calls.
narducci learned that bellwood was recording the phone lines in the finance department in a meeting on february.narducci notified two trustees of the village that he thought the taping was illegal,alerted the fbi and the state attorney,and wrote a memo to moore directing him to stop the recording.after sending that memo,narducci continued to make phone calls on the finance department phone lines but used his cell phone for all confidential calls.
moore instructed modrow to disconnect the finance department phone lines from the dictaphone recorder.moore believed that the phone lines were disconnected in march.modrow,on the other hand,said that he believed the phones were still connected when he left bellwood in february.
in february,narducci filed a lawsuit against the village of bellwood,moore,lemm,and various unknown trustees and employees of the village.he later dismissed the claims against the unnamed trustees and employees,but proceeded with the case against the three named defendants,and later had his suit certified as a class action on behalf of other employees of the finance department whose phone calls were recorded.the suit brought claims under and title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of for,respectively,violating his fourth amendment right not to be subjected to illegal searches and for illegal wiretapping.he also brought illinois state law claims under the eavesdropping act and a tort action for intruding on a place of seclusion.lemm and moore moved for summary judgment on all claims,and specifically on the ground of qualified immunity although as we will see,there a complicated back story to their qualified immunity claim on the title iii count.the district court granted summary judgment on the state law claims and on any title iii claims involving phone calls made after narducci learned about the recording in february.the district court denied summary judgment on the claims and the remaining title iii claims,finding that there were disputed issues of fact and that the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity.lemm and moore now appeal the district court denial of their qualified immunity claims.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court summary judgment decision de novo.chaklos stevens,cir.summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
the defendants are appealing from the district court denial of qualified immunity.the doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from lawsuits for damages when their conduct did not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.the purpose of qualified immunity is to provide reasonable notice to government officials that certain conduct violates constitutional rights before a plaintiff can subject them to liability.hope pelzer,d.reasonable notice does not require that there be a case fundamentally similar to the present case,and indeed an officer can be on notice that his conduct violates constitutional rights even in novel factual circumstances.id.at.although earlier cases involving fundamentally similar facts can provide especially strong support for a conclusion that the law is clearly established,they are not necessary to such a finding.the same is true of cases with materially similar facts.for a right to be clearly established,its contours must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right in the light of law the unlawfulness must be apparent.id.at.quoting anderson creighton,d.
when examining a qualified immunity claim,a court examines whether a constitutional right has been violated and then,if a constitutional right was violated,whether the right in question was sufficiently well established that a reasonable officer would have been aware of it.saucier katz,d.we no longer need to address the two portions of the qualified immunity analysis in any specific order,and can frame our discussion in the way that produces the clearest decision.see pearson callahan,d.here,because defendants argue that narducci fourth amendment rights were not violated and that the violation of this right was not clearly established,we will consider both issues in turn.
fourth amendment violation 
lemm and moore first argue that narducci suit fails because he did not establish a violation of his fourth amendment rights.is not an independent source of tort liability instead,it creates a cause of action for the deprivation,under color of state law,of a citizen rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws of the united states.ledford sullivan,cir.the statute is thus a means of vindicating rights secured elsewhere.id.
the underlying claim in this case is a fourth amendment claim.the touchstone of fourth amendment inquiry is reasonableness,a standard measured in light of the totality of the circumstances and determined by balancing the degree to which a challenged action intrudes on an individual privacy and the degree to which the action promotes a legitimate government interest.green butler,cir.
the supreme court has held that the fourth amendment applies to searches and seizures by government employers or supervisors of the private property of their employees.ortega,d.with respect to the scope of fourth amendment rights in the workplace,however,the court added that t he operational realities of the workplace may make some employees expectations of privacy unreasonable.id.at.practices and procedures of a particular office or legitimate regulations may reduce the expectation of privacy that government employees enjoy in their workplace.id.the circumstances of a particular case matter a great deal,and each fourth amendment claim in this context has to be examined on its own.given the great variety of work environments in the public sector,the question whether an employee has a reasonable expectation of privacy must be addressed on a basis.id.at.
once an employee demonstrates a reasonable expectation of privacy,he must then demonstrate that the search was unreasonable.p ublic employer intrusions on the constitutionally protected privacy interests of government employees for,purposes,as well as for investigations of misconduct,should be judged by the standard of reasonableness under all the circumstances.id.at.this standard has two requirements first,the search must have been justified at its inception,and second,it must have been reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.id.at.
we first consider whether narducci had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his phone line.lemm and moore argue that he did not,for two reasons.first,they argue that narducci did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a phone line in the finance department second,they contend that there was never a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment because nobody ever listened to the calls.
the district court,citing katz united states,d,another case involving surreptitious recording of phone calls,found that narducci enjoyed a reasonable expectation of privacy in his phone line.lemm and moore argue that the issue is more precise,and that in this case the search was only unreasonable if narducci had a reasonable expectation of privacy when talking on a phone line at work.according to the defendants,narducci could not have had a reasonable expectation of privacy when talking on a phone line in a crowded workplace,since anyone working nearby could easily overhear his conversations.additionally,they cite modrow deposition testimony that the recording system emitted an audible beep at the beginning of every phone call,which should have led users of the system to conclude that their calls were recorded.the existence of that beep,and what indication it gave to finance department employees about the privacy of their phone calls,is disputed taking the facts in the light most favorable to narducci as the party,it is not a basis for summary judgment.if the recording procedures were as obvious as lemm and moore now claim that they were,then the jury may well conclude that narducci did not have a subjective expectation of privacy in his phone line.that is a factual dispute that the jury will need to resolve,however.
nor can this court take at face value lemm and moore claim that narducci could not have expected his phone calls to remain private in a crowded work area.narducci claimed in his deposition testimony that when discussing a confidential matter he went to a phone where there was a lot of people working nearby.if true,this would be sufficient for the jury to conclude that narducci had a subjective expectation of privacy when using one of the village phone lines.
lemm and moore also argue,however,that even if narducci had a subjective expectation of privacy it was not an objectively reasonable one.their contention is that society would not recognize a reasonable expectation of privacy in a phone line provided by the village of bellwood for public purposes.under their theory,the need to monitor the efficient provision of public services militates against an expectation of privacy on such a phone line.this broad exclusion is in tension with language from the ortega opinion rejecting such a categorical approach to workplace privacy rights.see ortega,at.given the societal expectations of privacy in one place of work expressed in both oliver and mancusi,we reject the contention made by the solicitor general and petitioners that public employees can never have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their place of work.as the court found in ortega,the idea that one could conduct confidential business at work,and have an expectation of privacy when doing so,is not per se unreasonable.
lemm and moore also argue that there was no search here within the meaning of the fourth amendment because,while the calls were recorded,there was no evidence that anyone ever listened to them.their claim here is that if nobody ever learned about the contents of the phone calls then nobody did anything that could have run afoul of the fourth amendment.narducci argues that we can not credit this claim at summary judgment because there is a factual dispute about whether anyone listened to the phone calls.narducci has not come forward with any evidence that anyone listened to the calls,and is really alluding to the possibility of a factual dispute more than anything else never the less,this is not a proper ground for summary judgment.the defendants ask us to infer from the absence of evidence in the record that nobody from the village of bellwood ever listened to the recorded phone calls,but drawing that inference would be incompatible with the requirement that we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.
taking the facts in the light most favorable to narducci,then,he has demonstrated a reasonable expectation of privacy in his phone line at work.the next issue is whether the workplace search in this case was conducted in a reasonable manner.in ortega,the court rejected a warrant or probable cause requirement for workplace searches and instead determined that those searches must simply be reasonable under all of the circumstances.id.at.under this reasonableness standard,both the inception and the scope of the intrusion must be reasonable.id.at.a search by a superior is justified at its inception when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting
