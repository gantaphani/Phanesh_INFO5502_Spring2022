background 
given the procedural posture of this matter,we view the facts in the light most favorable to appellants.cioffi averill park cent.sch.dist.bd.of,cir.appellants were employees of nfc until its closure on december.nfc business consisted of the origination and resale of mortgages and home equity loans to residential customers.it earned revenue from fees charged for originating the loans and from premiums paid by purchasers of the loans in the secondary market.to conduct this business,nfc relied on two lines of credit a operating credit line from bankboston bb,and a warehouse credit line from bear stearns.nfc used the bb line to fund its origination of loans,which became collateral for the debt incurred to bb.if a loan on the bb line sold quickly in the secondary market,nfc would use the receipts to pay off its debt to bb.otherwise,nfc would sell the loan to bear and sweep it into the warehouse line,with the right and obligation to repurchase it from bear in the event of resale or default on the part of nfc.when nfc sold a loan on the bear warehouse line,it would pay bear an price to repurchase the loan from bear and retain any profit earned from the sale.nfc paid off the amount owed on the bb line on an approximately weekly basis.
nfc fell on hard times in the fall of,and by february,could not fund its continued operations.to obtain the needed funds,nfc,chiefly through david silipigno,nfc and ceo,retained money from sales of loans on the warehouse line that it should have paid to bear stearns.nfc covered its tracks by falsifying the weekly loan schedules it submitted to bear,listing resold loans as unsold and still available as collateral on the warehouse line.
in august,nfc by that point amounted to million of bear discovered by westwood capital westwood,a company nfc had hired to help sell nfc.in november,westwood persuaded nfc to disclose its conduct to bear.nfc actions had placed nfc in default under the terms of the master repurchase agreement mra governing its relationship with bear,and bear consequently had the right under the mra to seize all loans on the warehouse credit line to pay off the line.instead,bear pursued a workout strategy that would allow nfc to remain in business for a time in the hope of selling nfc and using the proceeds to repay bear.
bear refused,however,to continue to do business with the individuals responsible for the fraud.in response,david silipigno,joseph silipigno,and the other nfc personnel involved in the theft resigned as officers of nfc.harvey marcus,nfc general counsel,volunteered to serve as the new president and ceo.he was confirmed in this position by a unanimous consent executed on november,by nfc board,which appears to have consisted solely of david and joseph silipigno.the unanimous consent also reflected that the silipignos resignation as officers was effective as of november.
on november,nfc and bear entered into a letter agreement the november agreement formalizing the terms on which they would agree to continue their business relationship.because marcus had no experience managing a mortgage business,nfc hired an individual named bill bradley to run nfc until it was sold.bear agreed to subordinate its claims against nfc to bradley bonus in the event of nfc sale or bankruptcy.
bear also accepted stock pledge agreements from the silipignos representing their entire ownership interests in nfc in total,of nfc stock.the pledge agreements reflect that bear was entitled to exercise its rights at any time,upon notice of its intent to the pledgors,but bear never voted or took any action with respect to the stock.
at this point,nfc needed new sources of funding.bankboston had terminated nfc operating credit line in response to nfc fraud.although the november agreement left nfc free to seek other sources of capital both from financing for loan originations and from mortgage resales,nfc did not make much if any effort to do so,believing that such efforts would be futile given that word of nfc fraud had spread through the industry.bear itself was no longer willing to continue its warehouse line arrangement with nfc,but agreed that its subsidiary emc mortgage emc would make outright purchases of certain types of loans originated by nfc.bear hired the clayton group to evaluate the loans nfc proposed for purchase by emc.the clayton group,serving as bear underwriter,performed these evaluations at nfc after nfc underwriters approved the loans in question.
while this arrangement enabled nfc to earn money from the purchase premiums paid by emc and the origination fees paid by borrowers,nfc had no way as a practical matter to fund any loan that emc was unwilling to purchase.specifically,emc purchased only loans falling within bear subprime criteria,and nfc was therefore no longer able to originate and sell other types of loans that had previously been part of its product mix.
in early december,nfc could not meet its payroll.bear refused to loan any money to nfc for that purpose,but did agree to a forward purchase transaction.under that procedure,emc advanced funds to nfc in the amount of payments emc was about to make for loans that were in the pipeline but had not yet closed.nfc faced the same problem again with regard to its december,payroll and asked for another forward purchase transaction.this time,however,there were not enough loans in the pipeline to secure the amount necessary to cover the full payroll,and bear refused to advance any amount that could not be secured.according to bradley deposition testimony,bear stated that it would not fund payroll again,regardless of how much could be secured,because bear was to serve as a funding source for loans and not to cover payroll.millie,then a principal banking examiner ii of the new york state banking department present at nfc pursuant to the banking department investigation of nfc following disclosure of the fraud,attempted to obtain a loan to cover the payroll from a company that had been a potential buyer of nfc,but was unsuccessful.
bradley and explained the situation to marcus,and on december,they saw no alternative but to close nfc.however,the decision may have been made in substance at least a day earlier,as paul friedman,a bear executive,sent an email on december,in which he stated that nfc would close its doors on december.in addition,bear issued a notice of default to nfc,also dated december,stating that you nfc have also advised us that you are ceasing operations.in any case,marcus prepared a memo to nfc employees announcing nfc closure,which was posted on nfc door on december.
appellants filed suit on december,and a class was certified by stipulation and order on january.bear moved for summary judgment on april,as did appellants on april.the district court entered judgment granting bear motion and denying appellants motion on october.coppola bear stearns,wl october.appellants appealed.
