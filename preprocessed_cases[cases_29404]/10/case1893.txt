we are asked to decide whether the plaintiff in this case has standing to pursue his individual claims and if not,whether he may nevertheless maintain a suit on behalf of injured class members who do have standing.the court of appeals concluded that the named plaintiff lack of individual standing to bring suit did not,in and of itself,disqualify him from acting as class representative,but rather was a relevant factor in judging whether he should properly represent the class.we hold that the plaintiff has no standing to bring claims as an individual and that a named plaintiff lack of individual standing at the time a class action suit is filed deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff individual claims and over his claims on behalf of the class.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment in part and render judgment dismissing the suit for want of jurisdiction.
henry novak,an attorney,received a form letter from the anderson cancer center soliciting donations.the letter was signed by john mendelsohn,president of anderson,and stated that well over of people with cancer who are cared for at the university of texas anderson cancer center return home cured.although novak did not contribute any money in response to the letter,he sued anderson,mendelsohn,and ten other defendants identified only as john does one through ten,contending that the representation was false and that the defendants had conspired to fraudulently induce the recipients of the letter to contribute money.novak brought suit both in his individual capacity and as representative of the class of persons to whom anderson mailed its annual letter.specifically,novak requested a declaratory judgment that the defendants conduct violated sections conspiracy to commit offense against or to defraud the united states and mail fraud of title of the united states code that the defendants acted outside the course and scope of their employment and that the contributions received in response to the solicitation letter were obtained by false and fraudulent means and must be refunded.novak further requested injunctive relief enjoining the defendants from disseminating the cancer representation and ordering mendelsohn to return contributions made in response to the letter.
the defendants removed the case to federal court based on novak asserted violations of federal statutes.in federal court,novak admitted that he was not attempting to state a cause of action under a federal statute,but was simply attempting to prove that the defendants had committed each of the judicially recognized elements of a mail fraud violation in order to establish a prima facie tort for fraud,thereby entitling him to injunctive relief.the federal court remanded the case to state court,with all parties agreeing that there were no private federal causes of action under sections and of title of the united states code.
the defendants then moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in state district court on the basis that novak lacked standing to sue and on sovereign immunity grounds.the trial court granted the motion without specifying the grounds and rendered a final judgment dismissing the suit.on appeal,the third court of appeals concluded that novak request for a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from disseminating the cure rate would require an advisory opinion because there was no allegation that the defendants were threatening to do so and that the trial court properly dismissed that claim for want of jurisdiction.at.with regard to novak request for a mandatory injunction compelling mendelsohn to return the contributions,the court of appeals concluded that novak and the other uninjured class members lacked standing,but that those persons who contributed in reliance on the letter did have standing to sue for declaratory relief and for a mandatory injunction compelling a refund.id.at.
although it concluded that novak lacked individual standing,the court of appeals held that the trial court erred in dismissing the class claims for declaratory relief and a mandatory injunction requiring a refund.it reasoned that novak lack of standing did not disqualify him from acting as class representative but instead was simply a relevant factor in judging whether he should properly represent the class.id.at.the court then reversed the trial court judgment insofar as it dismisses for want of jurisdiction novak suit on behalf of a class of persons who paid money in reliance upon the allegedly fraudulent statement contained in the letter of january,and the claims of such class members for declaratory and injunctive relief requiring a return of their money.id.at.the court remanded those claims to the trial court and affirmed the remainder of the judgment.id.at.
we granted anderson petition for review,which challenges the court of appeals judgment remanding novak suit on behalf of class members.we first consider novak contention that the court of appeals judgment should be affirmed on the independent basis that he does have standing to pursue his individual claims and therefore has standing to represent the class.
novak contends that he has standing to pursue his claims in an individual capacity and therefore as a class representative because mail fraud does not require an actual injury.he asserts that we should therefore affirm the court of appeals judgment remanding his claims on behalf of the class.
novak asserts that a controversy arises in the mail fraud context at the point in time when the perpetrator uses the mail system in furtherance of a scheme to defraud the recipient and thus no injury to the recipient is necessary for the offense to be completed and for the controversy to mature.however,the cases on which novak relies are federal criminal prosecutions for mail fraud.see,united states,cir.as novak admits,the federal mail fraud statutes do not create a private cause of action,and both the civil rico statute codified at,et and texas fraud require actual injury.see bell,cir holding that there is no private cause of action under the federal mail fraud statutes summit,hoechst celanese,cir holding that the civil rico statute requires a showing that the plaintiff suffered injury desantis wackenhut,holding that fraud requires a showing that the plaintiff suffered injury.as stated by the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit in summit properties t he government can punish unsuccessful schemes to defraud because the underlying mail fraud violation does not require reliance,but a civil plaintiff faces an additional hurdle and must show an injury caused by reason of the violation.at.
even if novak was an intended victim of a completed mail fraud for purposes of governmental prosecution,he was not actually defrauded.his lack of any actual or threatened injury prevents him from being personally aggrieved such that he has any personal stake in the litigation.see nootsie,williamson county appraisal,a plaintiff has standing when it is personally aggrieved.in the interest of b,to establish standing,a person must show a personal stake in the controversy.therefore,novak lacks standing as an individual regardless of the fact that his claims for declaratory judgment are predicated on the federal mail fraud statutes.we turn to the question of whether novak may nevertheless pursue a class action.
the requirement of standing is implicit in the texas constitution open courts provision,which contemplates access to the courts only for those litigants suffering an injury.ass of bus.air control.standing is a prerequisite to jurisdiction,and jurisdiction is essential to a court power to decide a case.bland indep.sch.dist.blue.s tanding focuses on the question of who may bring an action.patterson planned parenthood.in contrast,whether a plaintiff would be an appropriate class representative is determined by rule requirements that the representative claims be typical of the class and that the representative will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.a.
we must decide whether,in a class action context,a named plaintiff lack of individual standing at the time suit is filed pr
