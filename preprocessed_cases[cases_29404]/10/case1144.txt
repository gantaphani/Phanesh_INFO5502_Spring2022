we have jurisdiction pursuant to a c,which provides for immediate interlocutory appeal of a district court denial of a motion to compel arbitration.green tree fin.randolph,d.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court order denying toyota motion to compel arbitration.
background 
plaintiffs are owners of model year toyota prius vehicles who purchased their new vehicles between june and february from toyota dealerships in california,texas,and maryland.plaintiffs bring this putative class action on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated who purchased or leased a model year toyota prius or model year lexus hs collectively class vehicles in the united states.plaintiffs allege that they experienced defects in their antilock brake systems abs,resulting in increased stopping distances.plaintiffs further allege that toyota had notice of the defect as early as july but failed to disclose the defect and continued to manufacture and sell vehicles with defective abs.plaintiffs assert claims for violation of california consumers legal remedies act,cal.et unfair competition,cal.bus.et false advertising,cal.bus.et breach of the implied warranty of merchantability,cal.and common law breach of contract.
plaintiffs purchased their vehicles on credit by entering into either a retail installment sale contract or purchase agreement with their respective dealerships.the agreements hereinafter purchase agreement s set forth the terms of the sales,including information regarding the purchase price,financing,insurance,warranties disclaimed by the dealer,warranties of buyer,and rescission rights.the purchase agreements also contained similarly worded arbitration provisions for example,the agreement entered by plaintiff michael scholten states,
either you or we may choose to have any dispute between you and decided by arbitration,rather than in court or by jury trial.
if a dispute is arbitrated,you will give up your right to participate as a class representative or class member on any claim you may have against us.you will give up any right to class arbitration and to any consolidation of individual arbitrations.
if either you or we elect,any claims or disputes arising out of this transaction,or relating to it,will be determined by binding arbitration and not by court action.this includes all claims and disputes arising out of,or relating to the vehicle,your credit application,this contract,the sale or financing of the vehicle,and any collection activities.
this arbitration clause applies,regardless of whether the claims or disputes arise in contract,tort,statute or otherwise.it also applies to any claim or dispute about the interpretation and scope of this arbitration clause.it also applies to any claim or dispute about whether a claim or dispute should be determined by arbitration.
any claim or dispute is to be arbitrated by a single arbitrator who will arbitrate only your own claims and not the claims of a class of persons.you expressly waive any right you may have to arbitrate a class action.
likewise,the arbitration clauses in the other purchase agreements employ the language you and we or buyer and dealer to identify who may elect arbitration.toyota is not a signatory to any of the purchase agreements.
procedural history 
on february,the national highway traffic safety administration announced a formal investigation into allegations that model year toyota prius hybrid vehicles experienced momentary loss of braking capability on february,toyota voluntarily recalled the class vehicles to update the abs software.between february and february,plaintiffs filed separate class action lawsuits in several federal district courts.on april,the united states judicial panel on multidistrict litigation jpml issued a transfer order in in re toyota motor.unintended acceleration marketing,sales practices and products liability litigation mdl,pursuant to which the jpml transferred several actions to the central district of california.on july,the present actions were consolidated by stipulation pursuant to,and on november,the district court approved a negotiated protective order governing discovery.
on april,plaintiffs filed the operative first amended complaint.the following day,the united states supreme court issued its decision in at t mobility llc concepcion,d,which abrogated discover bank superior court,cal th,d,and held enforceable class action waivers in certain arbitration agreements.discover bank had previously held class action arbitration provisions unconscionable and unenforceable in consumer contracts of adhesion under certain circumstances.cal th at,d.
on june,toyota moved to dismiss plaintiffs claims pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,which the district court denied on september.the following day,toyota informed plaintiffs counsel that toyota intended to move to compel arbitration.on september,toyota answered the first amended complaint,asserting arbitration as one affirmative defense.on october,toyota moved to compel arbitration.the district court denied toyota motion on december,finding toyota had waived any right to arbitrate by vigorously litigating the action,participating in discovery,and negotiating protective orders for nearly two years.the court also found that toyota,as a nonsignatory to the purchase agreements between plaintiffs and dealerships,could not compel arbitration,and equitable estoppel did not require arbitration.
discussion 
toyota first argues that the district court erred by deciding whether toyota had a right to compel arbitration,contending that the purchase agreements commit that question to an arbitrator.
we review de novo district court decisions about the arbitrability of claims.momot mastro,cir.with limited exceptions,the federal arbitration act faa governs the enforceability of arbitration agreements in contracts involving interstate commerce.see et.the faa states that a written provision in any contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.id.the faa reflects both a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration,concepcion.at quoting moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d,and the fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of contract,id.quoting rent a center,west,jackson,d.
the scope of an arbitration agreement is governed by federal substantive law.tracer research envtl.servs,cir.a s a matter of federal law,any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver,delay,or a like defense to arbitrability.chiron ortho diagnostic,cir quoting moses cone,at.
nevertheless,arbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.united steelworkers warrior gulf navigation,d.because arbitration is fundamentally a matter of contract,the central or primary purpose of the faa is to ensure that private agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their terms.momot,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.generally,the contractual right to compel arbitration may not be invoked by one who is not a party to the agreement and does not otherwise possess the right to compel arbitration.britton banking,cir.accordingly,t he strong public policy in favor of arbitration does not extend to those who are not parties to an arbitration agreement.comedy club,improv,cir citation omitted.
the first issue for review is whether the district court had authority to decide whether toyota,a nonsignatory to the purchase agreements,can compel plaintiffs to arbitrate.the district court addressed the issue in a footnote,
while parties may agree to explicit provisions enabling the arbitrator to decide issues of the applicability and scope of an arbitration agreement,these provisions are part of the agreement and only apply to signatories.toyota can not invoke the right to the benefits of the purchase agreement because it was not a party to the agreement thus,the threshold issue of whether toyota,as a nonsignatory,may compel plaintiffs to submit to arbitration under the purchase agreements must be decided by this court.britton,at comedy club,at.none of the cases cited by toyota in support of its position counsels otherwise,as they are inapposite to nonsignatories.
toyota argues that because the purchase agreements expressly provide that the arbitrator shall decide issues of interpretation,scope,and applicability of the arbitration provision,the arbitrator should decide the issue of whether a nonsignatory may compel plaintiffs to arbitrate.
it is well settled in both commercial and labor cases that whether parties have agreed to submi t a particular dispute to arbitration is typically an issue for judicial determination.granite rock int l of teamsters,d citations omitted.it is similarly well settled that where the dispute at issue concerns contract formation,the dispute is generally for courts to decide.id.at citations omitted.as explained in first options of chicago,kaplan,c ourts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is clea r and unmistakabl e evidence that they did so,d quoting at t,commc ns workers of,d see also granite rock.at.in this manner the law treats silence or ambiguity about the question who primarily should decide arbitrability differently from the way it treats silence or ambiguity about the question whether a particular dispute is arbitrable because it is within the scope of a valid arbitration agreement for in respect to this latter question the law reverses the presumption.first options,at.citing mitsubishi motors soler chrysler plymouth,d emphasis in original.
here,the arbitration agreements do not contain clear and unmistakable evidence that plaintiffs and toyota agreed to arbitrate arbitrability.while plaintiffs may have agreed to arbitrate arbitrability in a dispute with the dealerships,the terms of the arbitration clauses are expressly limited to plaintiffs and the dealerships.for example,scholten arbitration clause states that e ither you or we may choose to have any dispute between you and us decided by arbitration.the language of the contracts thus evidences plaintiffs intent to arbitrate arbitrability with the dealerships and no one else.the dealerships are not a party to this action see momot,at.given the absence of clear and unmistakable evidence that plaintiffs agreed to arbitrate arbitrability with nonsignatories,the district court had the authority to decide whether the instant dispute is arbitrable.see united of carpenters and joiners of am.desert palace,cir.
this court addressed a similar issue in mundi union security life insurance,cir.in mundi,the arbitration provision defined a dispute as a disagreement between the two contract signatories wells fargo and the borrower.id.at.the court found that the could not compel arbitration because the arbitration agreement,by its terms,did not apply to the nonsignatory.
the arbitration agreement is premised on a disagreement between wells fargo and the borrower.in the absence of such a disagreement,the arbitration provision does not apply.thus,any disagreement between the borrower and a third party,such as the defendant,is simply not within the scope of the arbitration agreement,even if it is related in some attenuated way to the arbitration provision.
as applied to this case,it makes no difference that plaintiffs and toyota disagree over the arbitrability of the arbitration agreement,as opposed to whether the entire dispute may be arbitrated.t he question who has the primary power to decide arbitrability turns upon what the parties agreed about that matter.first options,at.emphasis in original.the parties to this litigation did not agree to arbitrate arbitrability plaintiffs only agreed to arbitrate arbitrability or any other dispute with the dealerships because the arbitration clause is limited to claims between you and us plaintiffs and the dealerships.in the absence of a disagreement between plaintiffs and the dealerships,the agreement to arbitrate arbitrability does not apply.therefore,a disagreement between plaintiffs and toyota is simply not within the scope of the arbitration agreement.mundi,at.
toyota also argues that it may compel arbitration even though it is a nonsignatory to the purchase agreements because plaintiffs are equitably estopped from avoiding arbitration.
equitable estoppel precludes a party from claiming the benefits of a contract while simultaneously attempting to avoid the burdens that contract imposes.comer micor,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in the arbitration context,this principle has generated various lines of cases.see mundi,at.this case involves a nonsignatory seeking to compel a signatory to arbitrate its claims against the nonsignatory.id.
the united states supreme court has held that a litigant who is not a party to an arbitration agreement may invoke arbitration under the faa if the relevant state contract law allows the litigant to enforce the agreement.see arthur andersen llp carlisle,d.we therefore look to california contract law to determine whether toyota,as a nonsignatory,can compel arbitration 
where a nonsignatory seeks to enforce an arbitration clause,the doctrine of equitable estoppel applies in two circumstances when a signatory must rely on the terms of the written agreement in asserting its claims against the nonsignatory or the claims are intimately founded in and intertwined with the underlying contract,goldman kpmg llp,th,d quoting metalclad ventana envtl.org,th,d,and when the signatory alleges substantially interdependent and concerted misconduct by the nonsignatory and another signatory and the allegations of interdependent misconduct are founded in or intimately connected with the obligations of the underlying agreement.goldman,th at,d.toyota argues that this case presents both circumstances.
in jones jacobson,the california court of appeal addressed the first possibility.th,d.when a signatory relies on the terms of a written agreement,
u nder the doctrine of equitable estoppel,a nonsignatory defendant may invoke an arbitration clause to compel a signatory plaintiff to arbitrate its claims when the causes of action against the nonsignatory are intimately founded in and intertwined with the underlying contract obligations.this requirement comports with,and indeed derives from,the very purposes of the doctrine to prevent a party from using the terms or obligations of an agreement as the basis for his claims against a nonsignatory,while at the same time refusing to arbitrate with the nonsignatory under another clause of the same agreement.
