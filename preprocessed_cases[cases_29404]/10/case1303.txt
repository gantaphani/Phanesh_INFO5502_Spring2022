for over two decades,the district court has overseen a series of consent decrees entered into by appellants,the governor of idaho and other state officials,to remedy alleged constitutional and statutory violations in the provision of services to a class of more than indigent idaho children who suffer from severe emotional and mental disabilities.at this stage of the litigation,the state officials invoke eleventh amendment immunity and also contend that the district court no longer has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to to enforce the consent decrees.in essence,after promising so much over the past twenty years,the officials now claim that those promises are not enforceable.the district court rejected these arguments,and the state officials have appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we hold that the district court continues to have jurisdiction and that the eleventh amendment does not bar the enforcement of the consent decrees.we therefore affirm and return this case to the district court.
factual background and procedural history 
the history of this case is a sad record of promises made and broken over two decades.the defendants have repeatedly promised to provide appropriate services to the plaintiffs,who are a class of severely emotionally and mentally disabled children in the state of idaho.in,the complaint was filed in this case on behalf of indigent children,and the parties eventually stipulated to class certification.see jeff andrus,cir.the complaint alleged that the state officials had violated the class members rights under the constitution,the idaho constitution,and federal and state statutes.among other things,the complaint alleged that some of the plaintiffs had been hospitalized in facilities along with adults,some of whom were known sexual predators and child molesters.the complaint sought only declaratory and injunctive relief.
the defendants filed their answer setting forth multiple defenses to the plaintiffs action,including eleventh amendment immunity.they also alleged that the plaintiffs had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
in,the parties settled a number of claims relating to the provision of educational services.other claims remained,however,and the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court dismissed several of the plaintiffs federal statutory claims,but found that there were disputed issues of material fact as to the plaintiffs claims under the constitution and under idaho law.
in,pursuant to subsequent negotiations,the parties resolved a number of claims relating to alleged constitutional violations in the provision of mental health care to the class members.in a settlement agreement,the defendants agreed to end the practice of placing children in adult facilities and to provide a range of services for children who would not need care.the agreement offered virtually all of the injunctive relief that the plaintiffs sought.it specifically required the defendants,among other things,to prepare a needs assessment of children mental health programs and to provide the class members with facilities and staff for mental health programs and services.the agreement also provided for continuing jurisdiction by the district court for five years or until the district court was satisfied by stipulation or otherwise that the claims for relief were adequately addressed.the agreement was duly entered as a consent decree by the district court in april.
although this court subsequently invalidated portions of the consent decree that were unrelated to the remedies for the alleged substantive injuries,see jeff evans,cir,the supreme court reinstated the decree as entered by the district court.see evans jeff,d shortly after the supreme court decision,another dispute emerged between the parties as to the scope of the plaintiff class,resulting in another appeal to this court.see jeff andrus,cir see also jeff andrus,cir.
by the late,there were serious concerns about the state compliance with the consent decree and the plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce it.the parties again negotiated a settlement and eventually stipulated to a supplemental agreement in december.the agreement reiterated the defendants obligation to prevent hospitalization of the class members in adult facilities,and expanded the defendants agreement in to ensure an available,accessible continuum of alternative treatment facilities and residential programs providing mental health services to the plaintiffs the agreement also required the defendants to prepare legislative budget requests to fund the programs that were agreed upon.as contemplated by the parties,the district court entered the agreement as a consent decree.
this decree did not end the difficulties,however.in,the plaintiffs filed a motion with the district court requesting that the defendants be ordered to comply with the decrees.the matter was referred to a magistrate judge.the defendants did not contest that they were failing to comply with the agreements regarding the provision of services and,with the plaintiffs,submitted a joint proposed report and recommendation that was adopted by the magistrate judge.the district court adopted the recommendation of the magistrate judge and entered an additional order requiring the defendants immediately to allocate a minimum level of recommended by the defendants each of seven regions within the state for the provision of the community services.
because the plaintiffs continued to contend that the defendants had not complied with the decrees,the defendants agreed in to conduct independent evaluations of the state mental health system for children and of the defendants compliance with the decrees.beginning in,the defendants themselves hired outside experts to conduct a thorough evaluation of their compliance.based on the results of this compliance review the compliance review,the plaintiffs moved for a finding of contempt against the defendants in march.the defendants,however,negotiated yet another compliance agreement that provided for an additional independent needs assessment and the creation of a compliance action plan.the defendants also agreed to submit requests for funding to the joint finance and appropriation committee of the idaho state legislature,and agreed in principle with the findings and recommendations made in the compliance review.the district court approved the compliance agreement in december as a third consent decree,and one which resolved the plaintiffs motion for contempt.
as required by the agreement,the defendants independent experts completed their needs assessment in june.a large portion of the report recommendations focused on outpatient care.the defendants,accordingly,developed a compliance plan for the needs assessment recommendations.
however,the plaintiffs objected to the defendants proposed plan,and by,the plaintiffs again moved for a finding of contempt and for the district court formally to adopt the needs assessment itself as the defendants compliance plan.instead of negotiating this time,the defendants objected and filed a brief response.the defendants also filed a motion to dismiss the case and to vacate the consent decrees under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the defendants argued that the district court no longer had subject matter jurisdiction over the consent decrees because the decrees did not redress continuing violations of federal law,and thus jurisdiction was improper under.the defendants also claimed that the continued enforcement of the consent decrees was barred by the eleventh amendment.
the district court held a hearing on the parties motions on august.the court indicated that it planned to deny the defendants motions to dismiss the case or vacate the consent decrees it noted that it had continuing jurisdiction to enforce the decrees under rufo inmates of the suffolk county jail,d.the district court also found that no showing had been made to justify modifying or vacating the consent decrees that had been previously entered.the court took the plaintiffs motion for contempt under consideration.on september,the district court issued a memorandum decision denying plaintiffs motion for contempt.although it noted that it was growing weary with the state failure to comply with the consent decrees,the court gave additional time for the defendants to comply with the court orders and to fulfill the promises embodied by the consent decrees.on september,the district court entered an order formally denying the defendants motions to dismiss the suit and to vacate the consent decrees.the defendants filed this timely appeal.
ii.appellate jurisdiction 
we must first turn to the question of our own jurisdiction to hear this appeal.the plaintiffs contend that we lack jurisdiction to entertain this appeal because the district court order was not final.the defendants argue that we have jurisdiction over their appeal under the collateral order doctrine.see cohen beneficial indus.loan.
for the most part,both sides are wrong.the collateral order doctrine is largely inapplicable in this case.the doctrine establishes a narrow class of decisions that do not terminate the litigation,but must,in the interest of achieving a healthy legal system,nonetheless be treated as final.digital equip.desktop direct,d internal quotations and citations omitted.in order to fall into this class of immediately appealable orders,a district court decision must be conclusive,resolve important questions completely separate from the merits,and render such important questions effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment in the underlying action.id.none of the decisions that the defendants challenge,with the exception of the district court determination that the defendants do not enjoy eleventh amendment immunity,see aqueduct and sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d,satisfy the collateral order doctrine requirement that the issues resolved be completely separate from the merits.to the contrary,the district court determinations plainly are intimately intertwined with the merits of this litigation.
nonetheless,we have an obligation to investigate and ensure our own jurisdiction,see united states,cir,and we conclude that we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.the defendants filed two different motions at the district court,in which they raised essentially the same arguments.one of these was a motion to vacate the consent decrees,brought under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.denials of motions to vacate the judgment under rule b are appealable as final orders under.see stone ins,d taag linhas aereas de angola transamerica airlines,cir plotkin pac,cir.because consent decrees are considered final judgments,see stone city and county of san francisco,cir,we have jurisdiction to review the claims raised in the motion to vacate the consent decrees pursuant to 
we recognize that,in the context of structural litigation,allowing parties to appeal from the denial of motions to vacate consent decrees can create unfortunate incentives.recalcitrant defendants may file motions to vacate simply to delay the implementation of the decrees in the district court.many aspects of our judicial system are open to such abuse.however,courts have the appropriate tools to remedy bad faith appeals.in particular,the awarding of attorneys fees and sanctions can be an effective deterrent to prevent significant abuse.hutto finney,d noting that the awarding of attorneys fees can vindicate the district court authority over a recalcitrant litigant.
we must address one additional issue regarding our appellate jurisdiction.besides the finality issue and eleventh amendment immunity claim raised in the motion to vacate,the defendants also seek to appeal what they describe as an expansion of the plaintiff class by the district court.the defendants refer to a portion of the district court order denying the plaintiffs motion for contempt,in which the district court interpreted a disputed provision of the consent decree.the court read that provision in the expansive way preferred by the plaintiffs rather than the narrow way suggested by the defendants.that determination was clearly not final,however,since the district court refused to hold the defendants in contempt.if and when the district court finds defendants in contempt,they can appeal the district court determination of the disputed provision.see stone,at 
iii.discussion 
we review the district court denial of a motion to vacate the judgment for an abuse of discretion.see sec coldicutt,cir.deference to the district court use of discretion is heightened where the court has been overseeing complex institutional reform litigation for a long period of time.see stone,at.we review de novo,however,any questions of law underlying the district court decision.fdic aaronian,cir.
rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure provides a mechanism for parties to seek relief from a judgment when it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application,or when there is any other reason justifying relief from the judgment in rufo inmates of the suffolk county jail,d,the supreme court established a flexible standard to assess motions to modify or vacate consent decrees stemming from institutional reform litigation.a party must show that a significant change in facts or law warrants the revision of the decree and that the proposed modification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.id.at.the party seeking modification of the consent decree bears the burden of establishing that the rufo standard is met.id.at.
a.the district court subject matter jurisdiction 
the defendants first contend that the district court no longer has subject matter jurisdiction to enforce the consent decrees because the plaintiffs have not shown a continuing violation of federal law.the supreme court rejected this argument in rufo.the court made clear that,to save themselves the time,expense,and inevitable risk of litigation,defendants in institutional reform cases may settle a dispute by undertaking to do more than the constitution itself requires.rufo,at.the state officials in rufo argued that decisions handed down after the consent decree was entered had clarified what the constitution required,and that the district court could not enforce the consent decree beyond the constitutional requirements.the supreme court rejected that contention,noting that 
t he position urged by the state officials would necessarily imply that the only legally enforceable obligation assumed by the state under the consent decree was that of ultimately achieving minimal constitutional prison standards substantively,this would do violence to the obvious intention of the parties that the decretal obligations assumed by the state were not confined to meeting minimal constitutional requirements.procedurally,it would make necessary a constitutional decision every time an effort was made either to enforce or modify the decree by judicial action.
