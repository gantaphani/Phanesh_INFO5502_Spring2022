plaintiffs challenge a court order decertifying a class alleging violations of penal code section,the statute prohibiting the undisclosed monitoring or recording of confidential telephone conversations we affirm the order.
introduction 
in,several borrowers sued their lender,cashcall,alleging cashcall monitored their telephone conversations without their knowledge or consent.over cashcall objections,the trial court certified a class on one of the claims,an alleged violation of section,which imposes liability on a person who intentionally eavesdrops upon or records a confidential communication and engages in this conduct without the consent of all parties.italics added.
after class certification,cashcall successfully moved for summary adjudication on the section claim.the trial court found as a matter of law a corporation does not violate the statute when one of its supervisory employees secretly monitors a conversation between a customer and another corporate employee,reasoning that two employees are a single person within the meaning of the statute.
we reversed this order in a published decision.kight cashcall,th cashcall ii.we held the statute applies even if the unannounced listener is employed by the same corporate entity as the known recipient of the conversation,concluding the trial court statutory interpretation was inconsistent with section language and purpose.id.at.we also rejected cashcall alternative argument that summary adjudication was proper because the undisputed facts established the telephone conversations were not confidential communication s within the meaning of the statute.id.at,italics added.we explained the statutory element requires plaintiffs to show they had an objectively reasonable expectation their conversations would not be secretly monitored,and we held triable factual issues existed on this statutory element.id.at.in so holding,we stated the issue whether there exists a reasonable expectation that no one is secretly listening to a phone conversation is generally a question of fact that may depend on numerous specific factors,and provided examples of these individualized factors applicable in this case.ibid.
on remand,cashcall moved to decertify the class based primarily on its argument that the issue whether any particular class member can satisfy this test requires an assessment of numerous individual factors including those identified in the cashcall ii opinion and these individual issues predominate over any remaining common issues,making a continued class action unmanageable.plaintiffs opposed the motion,arguing cashcall did not meet its burden to establish changed circumstances necessary for class decertification and,alternatively,common issues continued to predominate in the case.
the court granted the decertification motion.the court found the cashcall ii decision constituted changed circumstances and individual issues regarding the individual putative class members objectively reasonable expectation of privacy predominate over defendant alleged uniform policies.plaintiffs appeal.we affirm.the court did not abuse its discretion in decertifying the class based on the record before it.
factual and procedural background 
to understand the parties appellate arguments,it is necessary to briefly review plaintiffs claims,the parties arguments underlying the initial certification order,the summary adjudication ruling,our prior appellate decision,and the parties arguments underlying the decertification order.
in their complaint,plaintiffs alleged they each borrowed money from cashcall,and,in making the loans and collecting delinquent payments on those loans,cashcall secretly monitored and eavesdropped on telephone conversations between cashcall employees and plaintiffs,including conversations pertaining to sensitive financial information.plaintiffs alleged cashcall conducted the illegal monitoring for the purpose of assisting cashcall in its collection efforts without the knowledge or consent of plaintiffs or the class members.plaintiffs alleged several causes of action,including unlawful invasion of privacy in violation of section.plaintiffs sought damages permitted under section the greater of per violation or three times the amount of actual damages and an injunction to prohibit cashcall from continuing to engage in this practice.see.
class certification 
plaintiffs then moved to certify the class,arguing the proposed class and class representatives satisfied each of the elements of a class action.in support,they proffered the declaration of each named plaintiff trevonda holder,marvin knecht,and edward castell 
plaintiff holder said she borrowed from cashcall in june,and thereafter would occasionally receive calls from cashcall asking about her payments.she learned during the litigation that one of these outbound calls on march,was secretly monitored by a cashcall supervisor.
plaintiff knecht said he borrowed from cashcall in august.he said that he would occasionally receive calls from cashcall asking about the status of his payments,and he would return those calls.during this action,he learned that a cashcall supervisor surreptitiously listen ed in on one of these inbound calls,on december.
plaintiff castell said he borrowed from cashcall in december.he said he would occasionally receive phone messages from cashcall asking about the status of his payments,and he would return those calls.during this action,he learned that a cashcall supervisor surreptitiously listen ed in on one of these inbound calls,on april.
these plaintiffs said they were not advised that someone would be listening to the conversation during the conversation they disclosed confidential information regarding their loan and their financial circumstances they objectively believed they were having a conversation only with the collector to whom i was speaking and they did not consent to this monitoring.
in opposition to the motion,cashcall argued primarily that class certification was improper because the call monitoring does not violate section because two corporate employees are a single person for purposes of the statute.cashcall also argued that common issues did not predominate because each class member would be required to individually testify regarding whether he or she had an objectively reasonable expectation that their calls were not being monitored.
in reply,plaintiffs countered that cashcall legal interpretation of section was erroneous,and in any event this asserted defense was a common issue among all class members.regarding the issue whether each class member would need to testify,plaintiffs asserted that the statutory test is objective,and therefore it was not dependent on individualized evidence,that evidence showing each plaintiff believed the calls were not being monitored was sufficient to show the calls were a confidential communication under the statute.plaintiffs further clarified that their requested damages would be limited to the statutory penalty for each monitored call.
after considering the parties arguments and conducting a hearing,the court granted the class certification motion on plaintiffs section claim with the damages limitation.the court found plaintiffs met their burden to show each of the class certification elements,including that common issues predominate over individual issues.the court stated that it need not,and does not,determine for purposes of this motion whether defendant alleged monitoring of telephone calls constitutes eavesdropping for purposes of section.this issue constitutes a predominant common question of law and fact.
the court defined the class as all persons who were physically in california at the time they had telephone conversations in which defendant cashcall,its employees,contractors,agents,monitored such conversations,within one year prior to may,the court also identified two subclasses.subclass one consisted of class members monitored on outbound calls from cashcall employees or agents to the class member.subclass two consisted of class members who were monitored on inbound calls from the class member to a cashcall employee or agent.
summary adjudication 
cashcall then moved for summary adjudication on plaintiffs section class claim.the following facts were before the court in the summary adjudication proceedings 
all members of the class are or were cashcall borrowers.cashcall ii,supra,th at.cashcall customers must telephone cashcall and speak to a cashcall representative to complete their loan application.ibid.during the class period,cashcall randomly monitored calls to and from the servicing department the department that engages in collections and payment enforcement activities inbound calls and outbound calls.ibid.the calls were monitored for quality control purposes.ibid.supervisors monitored calls by electronically listening to the conversation in real time.ibid.the calls were not recorded.ibid.
with respect to call monitoring disclosures,cashcall used an interactive voice response system ivr to receive and route calls.cashcall ii,supra,th at.under this system,a caller was greeted by an automated message that offered two options pressing or.ibid.a caller who selected either of these options automatically heard the call monitoring disclosure which stated this call may be monitored or recorded for quality control purposes.ibid.the ivr would then route the call to the selected department.ibid.
if a caller did not select either option or,or pressed,the caller would be connected to a cashcall operator.cashcall ii,supra,th at.the caller would then hear the call monitoring disclosure only if the operator routed the call to a particular department as opposed to a particular representative.ibid.additionally,a caller could press and then dial a representative direct extension.ibid.a caller would learn of this option after having spoken with a cashcall representative.id.at.cashcall employees sometimes gave out their direct line extensions to existing customers and instructions to avoid the prompts by dialing.ibid.the call monitoring disclosure was not announced if a caller reached a cashcall employee through the option.additionally,the call monitoring disclosure was never announced on outbound calls calls from a cashcall employee to a class member.id.at.
based on these facts and additional evidence relating to the phone conversations of three named plaintiffs,cashcall argued plaintiffs section claim failed as a matter of law because section prohibits only an unannounced third party from overhearing a conversation and two corporate employees count as a single party under corporations law the undisputed facts establish plaintiffs calls with cashcall employees were not confidential communications within the meaning of section and each plaintiff heard the call monitoring disclosure during the relationship.cashcall ii,supra,th at.
the court granted the summary adjudication only on the first ground and did not reach the other two grounds.cashcall ii,supra,th at.the court concluded there was no section violation as a matter of law because the telephone conversations were monitored by an employee of the same corporation who employed the call participant.ibid.
cashcall ii 
on appeal,we held the court erred in concluding section did not apply when a corporate employee secretly monitors a conversation between another corporate employee and a customer.cashcall ii,supra,th at.we explained that in flanagan flanagan cal th flanagan,our supreme court held that section protects an individual right to know who is listening to a telephone conversation,and an actionable violation occurs regardless whether the person knows or should know the conversation may later be disclosed.cashcall ii,supra,th at.based on this holding,the statutory language,and the policies underlying the statute,we concluded that section applies even if the unannounced listener is employed by the same corporate entity as the known participant in the conversation.id.at.
we then addressed cashcall argument that the summary adjudication could be affirmed on the alternate ground that plaintiffs had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the conversation.cashcall ii,supra,th at.although we agreed that a plaintiff reasonable expectation of privacy was a required element to recover under the statute,we concluded that factual issues existed on this issue.id.at.because our reasoning is important to the decertification issue,we describe our analysis in some detail.
we initially reiterated that section applies only to a confidential communication,subd.a,and that the statute defines a confidential communication to include any communication carried on in circumstances as may reasonably indicate that any party to the communication desires it to be confined to the parties thereto,but exclude a communication made in a public gathering,or in any other circumstance in which the parties to the communication may reasonably expect that the communication may be overheard or recorded,subd.c.cashcall ii,supra,th at,italics added.
we then described the legal test to be applied in determining whether a communication is confidential under this statutory language a communication is confidential under this definition if a party to the conversation had an objectively reasonable expectation that the conversation was not being overheard or recorded.flanagan,supra,cal th at.the issue whether there exists a reasonable expectation that no one is secretly recording or listening to a phone conversation is generally a question of fact.see lieberman kcop television,th,i t is for the jury to decide whether under the circumstance presented the plaintiff could have reasonably expected that the communications were private and thus have engaged in a protected confidential communication under see also sanders american broadcasting companies cal th,noting generally the factual assessment of the reasonableness of a privacy expectation.cashcall ii,supra,th at.
applying these principles,we determined cashcall failed to meet its burden to present evidence showing plaintiffs and the class members had no reasonable expectation of privacy as a matter of law cashcall ii,supra,th at.in so doing,we made clear we were not expressing an opinion whether plaintiffs would ultimately prevail on this issue at trial,and stated t he issue whether there exists a reasonable expectation that no one is secretly listening to a phone conversation is generally a question of fact that may depend on numerous specific factors,such as whether the call was initiated by the consumer or whether a corporate employee telephoned a customer,the length of the relationship,the customer prior experiences with business communications,and the nature and timing of any recorded disclosures.id.at.
we also rejected cashcall argument that the evidence established as a matter of law that it provided adequate notice of the call monitoring because all or most callers were informed at the outset of the relationship that calls might be monitored.cashcall ii,supra,th at.we discussed the california supreme court observation in kearney salomon smith barney,cal th kearney that even though some callers might know or have reason to know their telephone calls with financial brokers are being recorded,it appears equally plausible that,in the absence of such an advisement,a california consumer reasonably would anticipate that such a telephone call is not being recorded,particularly in view of the strong privacy interest most persons have with regard to the personal financial information frequently discussed in such calls.cashcall ii,supra,th at,quoting kearney,supra,cal th at,fn.we concluded that a single disclosure at the outset of the relationship would not necessarily inform a borrower that this call and all future calls with cashcall may be monitored or recorded,and there were factual issues regarding whether all class members class members received the message.ibid.
based on our conclusions that the section claim was not barred as a matter of law,and that the confidential communication and issues were factual issues for the trier of fact,we reversed the summary adjudication order and remanded for further proceedings in the trial court.cashcall ii,supra,th at.the california supreme court denied cashcall petition for review.
decertification motion after remand 
several months later,cashcall moved to decertify the class,arguing cashcall ii identification of numerous individual factual issues relevant to the issue demonstrated that liability on the section claim can not be resolved on a basis.cashcall supported this argument by focusing on the circumstances surrounding each of the named plaintiff telephone conversations with cashcall employees.this evidence showed that each plaintiff had different experiences regarding the timing,extent,and nature of the monitored calls and of the call monitoring disclosure,and had different prior experiences with business communications.for example,plaintiff holder admitted to hearing the disclosure at some point,and the two other plaintiffs did not remember ever hearing a disclosure.additionally,plaintiffs holder and knecht each had prior experience with business call monitoring at their jobs while plaintiff castell did not.before their monitored calls,plaintiff holder was a cashcall customer for nine months,knecht for months,and castell for only five months.plaintiff holder made at least three inbound calls to cashcall before her monitored call,castell made one,and knecht made numerous calls.holder had two calls with cashcall on the day that her call was monitored knecht had calls with cashcall within three months of his monitored call and castell had only two or three total calls with cashcall before his monitored call.
cashcall argued that although each of the plaintiffs declared he or she did not believe anyone was listening to the calls,individual facts unique to each plaintiff are relevant to assess whether each plaintiff had an objectively reasonable belief that calls were not being monitored.cashcall also argued that section prohibits eavesdropping only without the consent of all parties,and that t he issue of consent can not be determined on a basis,particularly regarding the class members because they may have heard the call monitoring disclosure at the outset of the monitored call.cashcall argued the case would quickly splinter into more than and would be riddled with administrative burdens and complexities that defeat the purpose of the class action mechanism.
plaintiffs opposed the motion on grounds that the court had already rejected these same arguments in granting the initial certification motion,and cashcall failed to satisfy its burden to show new evidence or changed circumstances to support a different outcome.plaintiffs further argued that common issues continue to predominate,including that it was undisputed cashcall secretly monitored more than calls,and no class member received the call monitoring disclosure during the monitored telephone conversation.plaintiffs argued that whether class members heard the call monitoring disclosure warning during or before the monitored inbound call could be determined on question and answer forms.
after considering the parties submissions and conducting a hearing,the court granted the motion.the court stated the appellate court decision in cashcall ii constitutes a changed circumstance for purposes of the decertification analysis cashcall persuasively argues that individual issues regarding the individual putative class members objectively reasonable expectation of privacy predominate over defendant alleged uniform policies.therefore,this decertification motion is granted.
plaintiffs appeal.
discussion 
decertification motions 
class actions serve an important function in our judicial system.by establishing a technique whereby the claims of many individuals can be resolved at the same time,the class suit both eliminates the possibility of repetitious litigation and provides small claimants with a method of obtaining redress citations.however,because group action has the potential to create injustice,trial courts are required to carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and to allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the courts.citations.bradley networkers,llc th.the proponent must show the class action is superior to individual lawsuits or alternative procedures for resolving the controversy.citations.ibid.
the party seeking certification must establish a community of interest,including that common questions of law or fact will predominate in the litigation.duran bank national cal th,duran.on the predominance issue,the ultimate question is whether the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance of a class action would be advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.citations.the answer hinges on whether the theory of recovery advanced by the proponents of certification is,as an analytical matter,likely to prove amenable to class treatment.citation.as a general rule if the defendant liability can be determined by facts common to all members of the class,a class will be certified even if the members must individually prove their damages.citations.citations.ibid.although a court may properly certify a class even if individual issues need to be considered at trial,class treatment is not appropriate if every member of the alleged class would be required to litigate numerous and substantial questions determining his individual right to recover following the class judgment on common issues.ibid.
after certification,a trial court retains flexibility to manage the class action,including to decertify a class if the court subsequently discovers that a class action is not appropriate.weinstat dentsply,th,accord duran,supra,cal th at.to prevail on a decertification motion,a party must generally show new law or newly discovered evidence showing changed circumstances.citation.a motion for decertification is not an opportunity for a disgruntled class defendant to seek a of its previously unsuccessful opposition to certification.modifications of an original class ruling,including decertifications,typically occur in response to a significant change in circumstances,and i n the absence of materially changed or clarified circumstances courts should not condone a series of rearguments on the class issues.citation.williams superior court th.a class should be decertified only where it is clear there exist changed circumstances making continued class treatment improper.green obledo cal d,green.

ii.analysis 
change of circumstances 
plaintiffs central argument in their appellate briefs is that the court erred in concluding that the cashcall ii decision constituted changed circumstances justifying the court consideration of cashcall decertification motion.
the argument is without merit.in initially seeking class certification and challenging the court summary adjudication order,plaintiffs argued that section confidential communication requirement was an objective test that did not require any individualized analysis required a simple statement from each plaintiff that they each thought the calls were not being monitored.in cashcall ii,we agreed that the test was objective,but stated the test encompassed an evaluation of the totality of the circumstances regarding the reasonableness of the plaintiff belief.cashcall ii,supra,th at see flanagan,supra,cal th at see also sanders american broadcasting companies,supra,cal th at shulman group w productions,cal th.whether this statement constituted new law or a clarification of existing law as applied to the facts of this case,it constituted a reasonable and sufficient ground for the trial court to conclude that reevaluation of class certification was necessary.
plaintiffs argue that as a matter of law the court could not consider the decertification motion because of the problem of intervention.this issue arises when a trial court rules on the substantive merits before reaching a final conclusion on class certification.fireside bank superior court cal th,fireside bank.in a procedure,a defendant may be prejudiced because absent plaintiffs may elect to stay in a class after favorable merits rulings but opt out after unfavorable ones.id.at.plaintiffs may also be prejudiced a defendant should not be allowed to sandbag a plaintiff,withholding its best case against certification and then seeking decertification if it suffered an unfavorable merits ruling.id.at.a rule requiring a court to decide on class certification before the merits promotes fairness by ensuring that parties bear equally the benefits and burdens of favorable and unfavorable merits rulings.id.at.
however,as plaintiffs acknowledge,the rule is not an standard.fireside bank,supra,cal th at.it would be both unduly rigid and unjust to force the maintenance of a class action after a ruling on the merits even when there is a proper reason for decertification green,supra,cal d at.decertification generally requires changed circumstances,but courts retain inherent authority and in fact have the affirmative duty to decertify a class if a merits ruling makes clear that individual issues will engulf the litigation such that the class litigation becomes unmanageable will substantially interfere with one or both of the parties due process rights.see duran,supra,cal th at pp.trial courts have the obligation to decertify a class action if individual issues prove unmanageable or threaten to overwhelm the litigation sav on drug stores,superior court cal th,accord hall rite aid th,fn.a n order granting class certification is subject to modification at any time.i f unanticipated or unmanageable individual issues do arise,the trial court retains the option for decertification macmanus realty partners d,a class can be decertified at any time,even during trial,should it later appear individual issues dominate the case see also walsh ikon office solutions,th,keller tuesday morning,th.a court has a continuing duty to ensure that class action is a fair and an appropriate procedural vehicle for resolving the plaintiffs claims.
under these principles,the court decertification order was not precluded by the rule.there is no evidence in the record of any gamesmanship or other type of tactical maneuvering or abusive conduct that would trigger concerns.cashcall vigorously opposed class certification when plaintiffs initially moved to certify the class,and sought decertification only after cashcall ii clarified the individual factual issues that would arise at trial.although it is true that cashcall would not have sought to decertify the class if it had prevailed on appeal,that is merely because there would be nothing more to litigate on the section claim.the class case would have been over if we had upheld the summary adjudication order.moreover,cashcall did bear the burden of the unfavorable ruling.as cashcall acknowledges in its appellate brief,it remains bound by the published appellate decision that rejected one of its key affirmative defenses.thus,even after decertification,in plaintiffs individual actions cashcall could not prevail on the corporation is one party defense rejected in cashcall ii.
further,we reject plaintiffs argument that a defendant must show a compelling justification for decertification in addition to changed circumstances.in support of this standard,plaintiffs cite to fireside bank.however,the fireside bank reference to the compelling justifications standard pertains to the unusual and disfavored circumstances under which the court may rule on the merits before ruling on an initial class certification motion.fireside bank,supra,cal th at.in this case,the court did not rule on the summary adjudication motion until after it certified the class,and thus this standard is inapplicable.in any event,as discussed below,there were compelling justifications for the court to decertify the class because each plaintiff liability claim would need to be individually litigated,and any remaining common issues were negligible compared to these critical individual issues.
individual issues predominate 
plaintiffs alternatively contend the court erred in concluding the existence of individual issues regarding the existence of confidential communication s precluded the case from going forward as a class action.
a california court of appeal recently addressed this precise issue in the context of an initial section class certification.hataishi first american home buyers protection th hataishi.the hataishi court held the trial court properly refused to certify a class of outbound callers who alleged a violation of section.we agree with hataishi analysis and find it applicable to this case.
in hataishi,a customer alleged her home warranty company home buyers violated section by recording the customer phone conversations without the customer consent.hataishi,supra,th at.the plaintiff sought to certify a class only of outbound callers those who received the phone call that was monitored.id.at.the evidence presented on the certification motion showed that most inbound callers received an automated disclosure regarding call monitoring,but customers who received outbound calls from company employees were not given the message.id.at.in opposing class certification,home buyers contended that each putative class member unique experiences including the length of the class member relationship with home buyers agent,the number of times the class member heard the automated disclosure regarding the recording of inbound calls,and the class member experience with other businesses that monitor calls for quality assurance would be relevant to assessing whether a particular class member reasonably believed an outbound call would not be recorded.id.at.
applying the objective reasonableness test established by our high court in flanagan and articulated by this court in cashcall ii,the hataishi court agreed.hataishi,supra,th at see flanagan,supra,cal th at cashcall ii,supra,th at.the hataishi court stated t he determination whether an individual plaintiff had an objectively reasonable belief that his or her conversation with the defendant would not be recorded will require individualized proof of,among other things,the length of the relationship and the plaintiff prior experiences with business communications hataishi,at,quoting cashcall ii,supra,th at.the court noted the named plaintiff had admitted hearing the call disclosure message approximately a dozen times in other phone calls and had substantial prior business experience,and that under these particular circumstances this plaintiff objectively reasonable expectation regarding the confidentiality of the phone conversation could be very different from other customers who never heard the disclosure or heard it only a few times.id.at.the court stated the plaintiff prior experience s could support a jury finding that she lacked an objectively reasonable expectation that her calls would not be recorded.a jury could rationally reach a different conclusion concerning another plaintiff who has not had the same experience.ibid.the court concluded that due process requires that the defendant be permitted to an individual plaintiff regarding those experiences that may impact the reasonableness of his or her alleged confidentiality expectation.ibid.based on this analysis,the reviewing court found the trial court properly denied class certification on the section claim.ibid.
we agree with hataishi reasoning as applied to this case.in hataishi,as here,the plaintiffs had a continuing ongoing business relationship with the defendant,during which many plaintiffs may have heard a monitoring disclosure statement at least once.as we determined in cashcall ii,there are numerous facts unique to each individual plaintiff that are crit
