admiral insurance company admiral and state of louisiana,through the office of financial institutions and through the office of risk management collectively,louisiana appeal from the order of the district court remanding this case to state court.louisiana claims that the collectively,abshire et commenced this putative class which the proposed class includes at least plaintiffs,the parties are minimally diverse,and the amount in controversy exceeds exclusive of interest and the effective date of the class action fairness act of cafa entitling louisiana to removal.abshire et disagree,contending that they commenced this suit long before cafa effective date.they also the district court denial of fees and costs associated with seeking remand.we affirm the district court remand of the case to state court and its denial of fees and costs to abshire et.
facts and proceedings 
abshire and the other plaintiffs purchased life insurance policies,annuities,and corporate notes from three louisiana companies public investors life insurance pilco,public investors,pi,and midwest life insurance mli.after all three companies failed,abshire et sued louisiana,alleging negligent,intentional,and criminal acts regulatory and otherwise that they claim contributed to these failures.a total of plaintiffs were named as parties in three filed during the early in two different louisiana courts.these actions were ultimately consolidated in louisiana judicial district court for the parish of east baton rouge the jdc.
after prolonged discovery and writ applications,and an earlier effort by louisiana to remove to federal court,abshire et filed an eighth amended complaint on march,which added claims against louisiana excess insurance repleaded several claims.then,as the most recent trial date approached in,an advisory opinion from the ethics advisory service committee of the louisiana state bar association determined that abshire et attorneys would violate the rules of professional conduct if they tried or settled the claims of plaintiffs with whom they had lost contact,using only the powers of attorney that these plaintiffs had executed at the time of retainer.abshire et attorneys therefore filed motions to withdraw as to the plaintiffs with whom they had lost contact.
these ethics and communication issues were hampering efforts to settle,so the jdc,which believed that the parties could benefit from mediation,granted abshire et leave to amend their complaint a ninth time to seek class certification.that court concluded,and abshire et attorneys apparently agreed,that only class certification could give the attorneys the authority needed to participate in mediation and to settle the case if possible 
abshire et filed the ninth amended complaint on may.it defined the proposed class as 
all persons or entities in the united states who filed suit against the state of louisiana its department of insurance or office of financial institutions for damages caused by the state conduct in connection with the failure of the three companies,and whose claim was consolidated into civil action or.
excluded from the class are any persons or entities to the extent their claims in civil action or have been resolved by a final,unappealable judgment,including those claims dismissed as a result of the rulings of the united states district court,western district of louisiana.
in the ninth amended complaint,abshire et also sought to recoup their costs of suit,including reasonable attorneys fees as provided by law.the eighth amended complaint had requested j udgment against the defendants jointly,severally,and in solido for attorneys fees,judicial interest,costs,and all expenses of these proceedings and for any and all other general equitable relief.
other case management problems inherent in such lengthy litigation arose during the years that this suit has been pending in state court.for example,a number of plaintiffs have died.the jdc allowed ex parte substitutions of survivors until louisiana objected.that court then entered an order in conditionally dismissing the claims of the deceased plaintiffs unless counsel for abshire et made proper substitution requests.although the record is unclear on the point,it appears that at least five of the deceased plaintiffs had no survivor who could be substituted in,so their claims presumably were dismissed.louisiana claims that the same held true for at least deceased plaintiffs at that time.
in addition to hearing the motions practice regarding substitutions for deceased plaintiffs,the jdc dismissed the claims of all plaintiffs who were only insureds or beneficiaries of a pilco,pi,or mli life insurance policy or annuity.these dismissals,as louisiana concedes,are final and unappealable.the same order also held that a ll rights possessed by any plaintiff in this litigation are preserved,and shall not in any way be affected by this order,save for those rights a plaintiff may possess as an insured or beneficiary under a life insurance policy or annuity.louisiana contends that this portion of the order related to plaintiffs,each of whom was both an insured or a beneficiary and owned an investment at issue,the claims relating to which were not dismissed.louisiana argues that the order is not final and unappealable as to those plaintiffs because those plaintiffs were not fully dismissed and the order was not certified as a final judgment pursuant to article b of the louisiana code of civil procedure for purposes of an appeal.these two additional management substitution problems arising out of the deaths of some of the plaintiffs and the management of the plaintiffs part of louisiana argument that,by seeking class certification for the first time,the ninth amended complaint commenced a new suit for purposes of cafa.
immediately after abshire et filed the ninth amended complaint,louisiana again removed the action to federal court,this time claiming that,under cafa,jurisdiction exists over abshire et putative class action.abshire et do not contest that if cafa applies,the case satisfies cafa and requirements.instead,abshire et sought remand on grounds that this action was not commenced after cafa effective date february,so cafa is inapplicable,and if cafa applies,at least one mandatory exception to federal jurisdiction under cafa requires remand.the magistrate judge concluded that the instant action commenced prior to cafa effective date and recommended that the case be remanded to state court.because of that conclusion,the magistrate judge report and recommendations did not address the two cafa exceptions to jurisdiction that are presented in this appeal,namely,the local controversy and primary state actor exceptions.
abshire et also requested that,pursuant to c,attorneys fees and costs associated with seeking remand be awarded,arguing that louisiana attempt to remove the case was objectively unreasonable.the magistrate judge determined that even though abshire et prevailed on their motion to remand,louisiana had not acted unreasonably because case law in the area was unsettled at the time of removal.the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendations in full and remanded the case to state court.
both louisiana notice of appeal of the district court remand order and abshire et notice of appeal of the denial of attorneys fees and costs were timely filed pursuant to c we granted permission to appeal and.as permitted by c a,all the parties agreed to a extension of c time limit to complete all action on the appeal.
ii.analysis 
a.the remand.standard of review 
we review de novo a district court order remanding a case to state court 
cafa applies to any civil action commenced on or after february,it does not apply retroactively we must therefore determine whether the filing of abshire et ninth amended complaint commenced a new suit for purposes of cafa if not,cafa does not apply and removal under its provisions was improper.
we have held,as have all other circuits that have addressed the issue,that the date on which a civil action is commenced for purposes of cafa is determined by state law we have further held that louisiana considers a suit commenced by filing of a pleading presenting the demand to a court of competent jurisdiction.thus,our default rule under louisiana law is that,absent special circumstances,a suit is commenced only at the time the original petition is filed in a court of competent jurisdiction the default rule.therefore,abshire et commenced this suit long before cafa effective or about december,when at least one of the petitions for damages was filed in a louisiana court competent to hear it 
we have recognized,however,that at least one exception applies to the default rule,when there are special circumstances,a suit may be commenced more than once.in braud transport service of illinois,we held that,for purposes of cafa,the addition of a new defendant to a case commences a new civil action as to that defendant louisiana now asks us to extend our holding in braud by recognizing an additional exception to the default rule specifically,that abshire et commenced a new civil action when they filed the ninth amended complaint.louisiana reasons that the latest complaint seeks class treatment for the first time and exposes louisiana to additional liability via a claim for attorneys fees and costs,the resurrection of claims held by deceased,plaintiffs,and the resurrection of the plaintiffs previously dismissed claims.noting that no new parties or claims have been added,abshire et counter that merely adding class allegations is insufficient to constitute the commencement of a new suit.we address each contention in turn,cognizant that all appear to present questions of first impression in this circuit.
we may quickly dispose of louisiana contention that the mere addition of class allegations commences a new civil action for purposes of cafa.louisiana asserts that the term civil action in of cafa must be read to mean class action,meaning that any effort to seek class certification not sought before cafa effective date permits removal.this reading is in tension with the plain language of the statute civil action is not synonymous with class action.conceptually,a civil action is a more extensive,more inclusive proceeding than a class action,which is a subset of all civil actions a civil action may commence before it becomes a class action,and congress selected the commencement of the civil action as the relevant event under cafa provision.
louisiana reading is also in tension with the tenth circuit decision in pritchett office depot,which held that congress signaled an intent to narrow the removal provisions of cafa to exclude currently pending suits by deleting language that would have extended cafa to cases in which a class certification order is entered on or after the enactment date.if civil action were treated as congruent with class action for purposes of,then a order would commence a new suit.pritchett,however,does not completely resolve the matter because,even though the certification order there cafa,class allegations had been included in the complaint,which was filed.we find this of no moment,however,because,as we have said,the date on which a civil action commences is determined according to state law,and louisiana has not invited our attention to any authority holding that controlling state law deems a civil action to have been when a complaint is amended to seek class treatment.
to convince us that the default rule under the forum state,that a suit is commenced only at the time the original petition is filed in a court of competent not be applied in this context,louisiana would have to make the same kind of persuasive showing that the newly added defendant made in braud.there,we explained that it would be a novel and unjust principle to make the defendants responsible for a proceeding of which they had no notice.louisiana can not make a similarly persuasive showing here because the notice and concerns that motivated our braud holding are wholly absent from this suit.abshire et ninth amended complaint adds not a single plaintiff of whose claim louisiana was not already aware the claim for attorneys fees is the only arguable exception,which we address below.the proposed class definition is carefully tailored to limit the class to persons who were individual parties to the suits filed in the early.even though some of those parties have died,requiring substitution of successors to preserve their claims in the absence of class treatment,louisiana can not argue that it lacked notice that the plaintiffs for whom there are no successors to substitute were,at some point,claimants.
neither is this a case like plummer farmers group,which presented a close call in plummer,the initial complaint involved one claim,one theory of recovery,and one oklahoma plaintiff.the plummer plaintiffs amended their pleadings after cafa effective date,turning the suit into a three count case with several theories of recovery asserted by thousands of potential plaintiffs spanning the united states.the plummer court thought that such an amendment presented a unique circumstance in which some action other than filing a complaint in court is deemed to commence a lawsuit.that is a doubtful proposition as to the mere addition of class allegations standing alone,especially when,as here,the class comprises only individuals or successors of individuals who were parties to the suits filed in the early 
so,even if we were to adopt the plummer court analysis,abshire et ninth amended complaint is not a drastic modification to a petition by way of amendment which initiates a class action that would present a unique circumstance in which some action other than filing a complaint in court is deemed to commence a lawsuit.even if there were some question whether,to use louisiana colorful analogy,the claims of the,plaintiffs that it contends would be resurrected by class treatment are new claims or plaintiffs,we are nevertheless certain that any resurrection worked here does not work a drastic modification in the case by significantly increas ing the size of the potential class.satisfied that merely melding the plaintiffs previously joined to a suit into a class for case management purposes is not itself sufficient to commence a new suit under cafa,we move on to louisiana second argument,that a new civil action is commenced under cafa when parties or claims are added in an amended complaint.
in braud,we limited our changes made to a complaint after filing may commence a new suit for purposes of a change that added new defendants,noting that w e do not decide when or whether the addition of new claims to a case provides a new removal window.other circuits have addressed the issue,however.in knudsen i,the seventh circuit wrote in dicta that adding a novel claim for relief or add ing a new party commences a new suit for purposes of cafa knudsen i also suggested a method by which courts should determine whether an amendment to a complaint asserts a novel claim for relief,cautioning we imagine,though we need not hold,that when a claim relates back to the original complaint and hence is treated as part of the original suit,it does not commence a new suit,but when a claim is sufficiently independent of the original contentions,it must be treated as fresh litigation.knudsen i made explicit that its analysis was modeled on the federal rule found in federal rule of civil procedure c in knudsen ii,after reviewing the defendants second attempt to remove the action when the plaintiffs made new claims for which the original pleadings did not provide notice,the court adopted this approach,but looked to state illinois as well as federal law 
the tenth circuit has also addressed the contention advanced here by louisiana that a new civil action is commenced under cafa when parties or claims are added in an amended complaint.in prime care of northeast kansas,llc humana insurance,that court adopted a modified version of the approach that the seventh circuit had endorsed in knudsen i,one that we discussed but did not adopt in braud prime care held that the analysis applies to new claims and contrary to braud that the addition of a defendant after cafa effective date did not necessarily commence a new civil action if state law would view the addition of the new defendant as relating back to the filing of the original complaint the eighth circuit approached the problem of a new named party similarly in plubell merck,a case in which the plaintiff amended the complaint to substitute the class representative after cafa effective date these cases present two options for purposes of cafa only the addition of a new defendant a suit or the addition of a new plaintiff or a new claim a civil action under cafa,but only if the amended pleadings do not relate back to the original,complaint.we need not consider choosing between these options on the facts of this case,however,as abshire et ninth amended complaint relates back to the original complaint or,at the least,to one or more complaints,such as the eighth amended version.
we begin our analysis by noting that the approach to commencement that other circuits employ,to the extent that it is ever analytically relevant,is particularly unilluminating in this case cafa commencement provision is a provision,presumably motivated by the typical concerns that caution against retroactively applying a rule or statute,the unjust disturbance of settled legal expectations on which a party has relied relation back is intimately connected with the policy of the statute of limitations.the policies underlying statutes of concerns and that a plaintiff commence suit preserving the evidence and furnish the defendant notice of the suit and its claims preventing repose from vesting when rule c is satisfied,neither of these policies is impinged because the plaintiff commenced suit before the limitations period lapsed and the defendant knew or should have known of the suit and the claims,allowing him to preserve his evidence.in such a circumstance,at least according to the drafters of the rules,it would work an injustice to a plaintiff claim against a particular defendant not earlier named or a specific claim not earlier pleaded.yet,an amendment to assert a new claim that arose out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set attempted to be set the original pleading,which thus satisfies rule c,might disturb settled legal expectations if such claim is based on a statute enacted after the defendant conduct.and,an amendment to assert a claim that does not arise out of the transaction or occurrence described in the original complaint will not disturb settled legal expectations if brought within the period.and might overlap,but,given their logical independence,it is far from pellucid why the test should control our analysis of cafa provision.
in fact,the concerns balanced by the doctrine are virtually in this case.louisiana was sued long ago on all of the claims,except,possibly,on the claims for attorneys fees and costs,by all of the members of the putative class.even if we were to grant that some of those claims ran aground over the past years and that a class action might revive them louisiana lost any expectation of repose for claims brought by the named plaintiffs in this litigation concerning louisiana acts or omissions in the underlying matters when abshire et filed this action in the early.and,at this point,any evidentiary concerns result from the length of the litigation,not from abshire et sleeping on their rights.neither are there notice concerns arising from the strategic choices made by louisiana prior to the filing of the ninth amended complaint.irrespective of whether it knew that this suit exposed it to class liability,louisiana could not have removed this case prior to cafa,so notice could not have affected its tactical decisions,at least not its choice of forum it had none.simply put,this is not a situation in which louisiana could say,well,if i had known it was going to be a class action at the time it was filed,i have removed.
even if we assume,arguendo,that it is appropriate to engage in the test found in either louisiana law or the federal rules,we would conclude that the resurrected plaintiffs and claims clearly satisfy both.in giroir south louisiana medical center,the louisiana supreme court held that the addition of plaintiffs relates back to the filing of the original petition if 
the amended claim arises out of the same conduct,transaction,or occurrence set forth in the original pleading the defendant either knew or should have known of the existence and involvement of the new plaintiff the new and the old plaintiffs are sufficiently related so that the added or substituted party is not wholly new or unrelated the defendant will not be prejudiced in preparing and conducting his defense 
the only newly added plaintiffs,those whom one could arguably suggest were not already parties to the litigation at some point prior to the ninth amended complaint,are the survivors of the earlier deceased plaintiffs who were not properly substituted before class certification was sought.if any such persons are in fact included in the class that is hardly clear,as the class definition is limited to those persons who were already parties to the three satisfy giroir.as for federal law,the seventh circuit has held that class members are not new plaintiffs even when they were not previously joined to the action as individuals,a rule that we find persuasive and completely dispositive of louisiana argument here this reasoning also applies to the claims of the plaintiffs.
as for louisiana protestations that abshire et request for attorneys fees commences a new civil action against it,we need not address the dispute between the parties concerning the meaning of our holding in grant chevron phillips chemical regardless whether louisiana itself or a common fund might be on the hook for abshire et fees at some future point,and regardless whether louisiana could have been liable for attorneys fees under state law before abshire et sought class certification,louisiana has invited our attention to no authority that holds a request for attorneys fees does not relate back to an original filing.to the contrary,our research reveals just the opposite,given that attorneys fees obviously arise out of the same transaction or occurrence that led to the filing of the original complaint,which is the test for relating back under both federal and louisiana law 
thus,whether we apply the louisiana or the federal analysis to abshire et ninth amended complaint,we are convinced that they obviously have not commenced a new civil action.likewise,when we apply our current default rule under louisiana law,we are convinced that the ninth amended complaint does not commence a new civil action,because the petition was filed in a court of competent jurisdiction and the braud exception does not apply.as we reach the same result under either analysis,we decline to create another exception to the default rule under louisiana state law.we therefore apply louisiana law,which provides that a civil action commences only on the filing of the initial pleading in a competent court,and we hold that abshire et commenced this civil action only once,and then long before cafa effective date.remand to state court is appropriate because abshire et commenced their suit before cafa effective date,and no other basis of jurisdiction appears from louisiana notice of removal.this conclusion obviates the need to address cafa mandatory exceptions to jurisdiction urged by abshire et.
we end our discussion of this issue by correcting the parties error regarding braud,which error is responsible for much of the confusion in this case.we made two separate holdings in braud.first,we held that the addition of a defendant commences a new suit as to that defendant for purposes of cafa.second,we held that when a new suit is commenced by the addition of a new defendant,a new window of removability opens under b.here,the parties erred by focusing their analyses on braud second holding,sparring over whether the ninth amended complaint provides a new basis for removal or changes the character of the litigation so as to make it substantially a new suit.that,however,is the test for a new removal window under b in braud we spoke of b as governing removability only after we had first determined that the addition of a ne
