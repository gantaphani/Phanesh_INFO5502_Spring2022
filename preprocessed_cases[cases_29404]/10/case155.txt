plaintiffs are individuals employed by the new york city department of sanitation dsny,who allege that the defendants,the city of new and john doherty,commissioner of the dsny,discriminated against them and others similarly situated on the basis of their race national origin in the dsny promotional practices.plaintiffs bring this putative class action suit under the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause,under,under title vii,and under the new york state and city human rights laws.the district court dismissed all of plaintiffs claims.we affirm.
background 
the second amended sac makes the following factual allegations.after the dsny promotes individuals in its ranks of sanitation workers to supervisors,it may then promote those supervisors to the position of general superintendent,ranging from general superintendent level the lowest level to general superintendent level the highest level.prior to,dsny based promotion to supervisor and to general superintendent levels on written examinations,but after the examinations were eliminated for promotions to levels and.promotions to levels,and are now done on the basis of recommendations.
plaintiffs allege that by using recommendations in this way,the dsny has created a supervisory workforce that is not representative of the racial national origin composition of the sanitation worker workforce.the sac includes the following chart,which summarizes the racial makeup of sanitation workers,supervisors,and general superintendents in fiscal year 
plaintiffs further allege that there are qualified candidates for supervisor in the same percentages racially as the percentages for these races that are present in the sanitation worker workforce as a whole.finally,they allege that even with respect to the positions requiring a written test,supervisor and general superintendent level,the selection process invites some subjective evaluation of candidates.
as to the individual plaintiffs,the sac alleges as follows plaintiff andrenia burgis,a black female,started as a sanitation worker in she was promoted to supervisor in,and,in,she was promoted to general superintendent level.by,burgis had obtained the prerequisites for promotion to level,but instead she was replaced in her command at level by a white male.he was subsequently promoted to level.she did not obtain another command until,and a number of less qualified white individuals were and have since been promoted.
plaintiff christopher burgos,a hispanic male,started at dsny as a sanitation worker in he was promoted to supervisor in.he took the exam for promotion to level and is currently on the list for promotion.
plaintiff leticia smith,a hispanic female,started at dsny as a sanitation worker in she was promoted to supervisor in,and she was promoted to general superintendent level in.she has never been recommended for level,though she has the requisite experience and white females and males with less experience have been promoted.
plaintiff samuel duncan,a male,started at dsny as a sanitation worker in he was promoted to supervisor in.he was demoted during a probationary period,while white supervisors in the same position were allowed to finish probation and remain as supervisors.
plaintiff alonzo hudgins,a black male,started at dsny as a sanitation worker in he was promoted to supervisor in,and was subsequently promoted to general superintendent level.he has never been recommended to level,even though white males in his borough have been recommended and promoted.
plaintiff rashid smith,a black male,started at dsny as a sanitation worker in he was promoted to supervisor in,and he was subsequently promoted to general superintendent level.he has never been recommended for level,even though less qualified white males in his borough have been recommended and promoted.
plaintiff doren pink,a black male,started at dsny as a sanitation worker in he was promoted to supervisor in.he took the test for promotion to general superintendent level,but has not been promoted,though many of his white counterparts who took the test at the same time have been promoted despite being less qualified.
plaintiff anthony joseph,a black male,started at dsny as a sanitation worker in he was subsequently promoted to supervisor.despite having passed the exam,he has not been promoted to general superintendent level,while white employees with lower scores have been promoted.
plaintiff israel dejesus,a hispanic male,started at dsny as a sanitation worker in he was promoted to supervisor in,and he was promoted to general superintendent level in.he has never been recommended for level,even though less qualified white employees have been recommended and promoted.
as for individual defendant doherty,plaintiffs allege that he at all times,was aware that his supervisory workforce was skewed and did not reflect either the racial or national origin makeup of dsny nonsupervisory workforce,or the general population of the city of new york.doherty,reflecting his approval of this disparate classification,has taken no action to change it,and has,therefore condoned the discrimination.
on march,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss.with respect to the and equal protection claims,the district court held that plaintiffs had failed to sufficiently allege discriminatory intent.as to the city and defendant doherty in his official capacity,the district court further found that plaintiffs had not sufficiently pleaded that the alleged discrimination was the result of an official policy,custom,or practice.as to defendant doherty in his individual capacity,the district court concluded that plaintiffs had not adequately alleged that he was personally involved in the alleged discriminatory promotion practices and only made conclusory allegations that he knew the racial composition of the workforce.finally,the district court dismissed plaintiffs title vii disparate impact claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
discussion 
we review de novo a grant of a motion to dismiss under rule b,accepting as true all allegations in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor.anschutz merrill lynch,cir.however,the complaint must contain sufficient factual matter to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,internal quotation marks omitted.
to state a discrimination claim under the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause,plaintiffs must sufficiently allege that defendants acted with discriminatory intent.contractors ass pennsylvania.here,plaintiffs fail to allege in other than conclusory fashion any specific instances of discrimination with respect to any individual plaintiff or others similarly situated.indeed,each plaintiff has at some point been promoted from a sanitation worker to supervisor,and five of the nine were subsequently promoted to general superintendent level.while the sac generally alleges with respect to seven plaintiffs that they have been passed over for subsequent promotions while white individuals,who were allegedly less qualified,were promoted,the sac fails to provide meaningful specifics of the alleged difference in qualifications,let alone discriminatory intent.with respect to the other two plaintiffs,plaintiffs burgos and duncan,the sac alleges even less.it simply alleges that plaintiff burgos was promoted to supervisor in,has taken the exam for general superintendent level,and is currently on the list for promotion.plaintiff duncan,it alleges,was promoted to supervisor but subsequently was demoted during a probationary period while white individuals in an allegedly similar situation were not demoted.
these bare allegations do not present circumstances that give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.texas dep t of cmty.affairs burdine.without any specificity as to the qualifications considered for each position and without any reference to specific statements or individual circumstances that suggest discriminatory treatment,plaintiffs allegations do not support a finding that defendants acted with a discriminatory purpose.for all that one can tell from the sac plaintiffs third bite at the apple,it i
