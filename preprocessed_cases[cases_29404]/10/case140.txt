background 
geismann,a missouri corporation,alleges that it received from zocdoc,a delaware corporation,two unsolicited faxes advertising a patient matching service for doctors.joint appendix.both faxes stated that if the recipient wished to stop receiving faxes,he or she could call a domestic telephone number provided in the fax.
in,geismann filed a complaint in missouri state court alleging that these faxes violated the tcpa which prohibits,inter alia,the use of any telephone facsimile machine,computer,or other device to send,to a telephone facsimile machine,an unsolicited advertisement,unless the sender and recipient have an established business relationship,the recipient volunteered its fax number directly to the sender or through voluntary participation in a directory or other public source,or the fax meets certain specified notice requirements.b c see also id.a the term unsolicited advertisement means any material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property,goods,or services which is transmitted to any person without that person prior express invitation or permission,in writing or otherwise.
the complaint requested between and in damages for each tcpa violation,an injunction prohibiting zocdoc from sending similar faxes in the future,and costs.see id.b providing a private right of action for injunctive relief and damages in the amount of actual monetary loss or for each violation,whichever is greater,to be tripled at the court discretion if the defendant willfully or knowingly violated the statute.
the complaint also requested that the case be treated as a class action.geismann filed a separate motion for class certification pursuant to missouri law the same day that it filed the complaint.the certification motion contained a footnote explaining that geismann filed the motion at the same time as the complaint because the d efendants in class litigation have resorted to making individual settlement offers to named plaintiffs before a class action is certified in an attempt to pick off the putative class representative and thereby derail the class action litigation.pl.state.mot.for class certification at.
on march,zocdoc removed the action to the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri,invoking federal question jurisdiction.see.two weeks later,zocdoc made an offer of judgment to geismann pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure for,plus reasonable attorney fees in satisfaction of geismann individual claims,and an injunction prohibiting zocdoc from engaging in the alleged statutory violations in the future.on april,geismann rejected the offer but indicated that it would be willing to accept if zocdoc would extend the same offer to all members of the putative class action.zocdoc declined.
in august,the district court granted zocdoc motion to transfer the action to the southern district of new york.see a.zocdoc then moved to dismiss the complaint,primarily on the ground that its offer of judgment mooted the action.geismann disputed,inter alia,whether the unaccepted offer provided full satisfaction of its claim,arguing that the tcpa provides for monetary damages per violation,not per fax,entitling it to recover for each of the multiple violations in each fax.pl.opp to def.mot.to dismiss at,geismann zocdoc,cv,ecf.
the district court disagreed,reasoning 
the monetary damages geismann can recover individually under the tcpa for two unsolicited faxes it received are limited to,which could be trebled to not more than if the court finds that it was a willful and knowing violation.zocdoc offer of judgment not only adds geismann attorneys fees,but is twice the trebled amount,and thus more than satisfies any recovery geismann could make under the applicable statute.
