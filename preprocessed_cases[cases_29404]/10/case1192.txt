factual and procedural background 
from may,through november,marlo worked for ups as a hub supervisor,preload supervisor,and supervisor collectively,supervisor or fts.during that time,marlo worked more than forty hours per week on a regular basis without taking meal or breaks,or receiving overtime compensation.as a hub super visor,marlo supervised hourly employees and supervisors engaged in unloading,sorting,and loading pack ages.his duties included assigning employees tasks within their defined work areas,providing training to ensure safety and efficiency,monitoring employees performance,and coordinating delivery times and volume.as a preload super visor,marlo supervised and trained hourly employees and supervisors loading packages onto cars for delivery.as an supervisor,marlo supervised employees delivering packages.
marlo filed suit against ups on may.on june,the district court certified a class under federal rule of civil procedure and appointed marlo class representative.in its order,the district court determined that marlo demonstrated that the job duties as set forth by ups are similar with regard to the proposed class,and that ups applies an overtime exemption policy to the proposed class based on their job titles.the district court concluded that a class action was a superior method for adjudicating the controversy because full time supervisors,especially those still employed at ups,may fear reprisal,precluding them from filing individual actions,and because of the large volume of individual actions that might proceed if the claims were adjudicated individually.the class consisted of fts employed by ups from to.

on remand,the district court decertified the class.see marlo united parcel.the court noted that its concern about the applicability of the evidence has ripened into doubt regarding the continuing efficacy of a class action in this case.id.at.noting that a s a general rule,this court does not consider decertification necessary,id.at,it nonetheless concluded that marlo had not established predominance,noting that the existence of a uniform policy classifying fts as exempt is insufficient absent evidence of misclassification id.at that marlo had relied heavily on a survey that was neither reliable nor representative of the class,id.at and that his remaining evidence similarly was not representative of the class and did not address the primarily engaged element of the exemptions under iwc wage order,id.at.the court concluded 
plaintiff evidence is essentially individual testimony and an exemption policy.under the circum stances in this case,where plaintiff alleges that fts have been misclassified as exempt employees,plaintiff had to provide common evidence to support extrapolation from individual experiences to a class wide judgment that is not merely speculative.plain tiff has not come forward with common proof sufficient to allow a to make a judgment as to the fts.
id.at.moreover,a s the court has found that individual issues predominate in this case,a class action is not the superior method for litigating this matter.id.at.the court certified the issue for interlocutory appeal and stayed the action pending appeal.id.at.we declined to hear the interlocutory appeal.
following a trial and three days of deliberations,the jury returned a partial verdict for marlo.the jury found,in relevant part,that during the period when marlo was a hub supervisor,ups had satisfied neither the executive nor administrative exemption in iwc wage order.the jury similarly found that during the period when marlo was a pre load supervisor,ups had satisfied neither the executive nor administrative exemption.as to marlo work as an supervisor,however,it found that ups had satisfied each element of the executive exemption.it therefore awarded marlo unpaid overtime,meal,and wages for the times when he worked as a hub and preload supervisor.
following trial,the district court denied ups motions for judgment as a matter of law and a new trial,and granted marlo motions for restitution and attorneys fees.ups timely appeals,and marlo timely.
