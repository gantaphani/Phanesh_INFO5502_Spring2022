this matter comes before us on petition for a writ of mandamus.petitioners argue that the district court erred by refusing to resolve their claim of exemption from arbitration under section of the federal arbitration act faa and section of the arizona arbitration act aaa before compelling arbitration pursuant to those acts.we agree that petitioners make a strong argument that the district court erred,but we nonetheless hold that this case does not warrant the extraordinary remedy of mandamus.we therefore deny the petition.

the district court decision 
before the district court,petitioners argued that,because they were employees of defendants,the icoas were exempt from arbitration under section of the faa.for support,petitioners cited various provisions from the icoas and from a separate lease,which purportedly demonstrated that petitioners relationships with defendants were those of employees to employers.the issue of whether an relationship exists between the plaintiffs and defendants,petitioners added,is not only central to the question of exemption from arbitration,it is also a central element of all of plaintiffs substantive claims other than unconscionability.pls.opp to defs.mot.to compel arbitration.
the district court declined to rule on the applicability of the faa exemption,holding that the icoas delegated the question of whether an relationship existed to the arbitrator 
deciding whether an relationship exists between the parties falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement,because the arbitration agreement explicitly includes any disputes arising out of or relating to the relationship created by the contractor agreement,as well as any disputes as to the rights and obligations of the parties,including the arbitrability of disputes between the parties under the terms of the arbitration agreement.
mem.the district court further noted that resolving the question of whether an relationship existed would require analysis of the icoas as a whole,as well as factfinding on the amount of control exerted over petitioners by defendants.id.to conduct such an analysis would,according to the district court,exceed the proper role of courts in addressing threshold questions of arbitrability to consider only the validity and scope of the arbitration clause itself.id.citing republic of nicaragua standard fruit,cir.
petitioners contend that the district court refusal to address the exemption issue prior to ordering arbitration constitutes clear error 
statutory framework 
section of the faa states that an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of a contract,transaction,or refusal,shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.to enforce this provision,any party aggrieved by the alleged failure,neglect,or refusal of another to arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration may petition any united states district court for an order directing that such arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement.if,after hearing the parties,the district court is satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue,the court must order the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement.id.
the faa,and section authority to compel arbitration,do not extend to all arbitration agreements.as section makes clear,the act applies only to contracts evidencing a transaction involving commerce,or arising from a maritime transaction.section,titled exceptions to operation of title,imposes a further limit on the act scope,stating nothing herein contained shall apply to contracts of employment of seamen,railroad employees,or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.
