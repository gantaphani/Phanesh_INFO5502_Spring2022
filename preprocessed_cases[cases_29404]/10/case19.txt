respondent bayer moved in federal district court for an injunction ordering a west virginia state court not to consider a motion for class certification filed by petitioners smith,who were plaintiffs in the action.bayer thought such an injunction warranted because,in a separate case,bayer had persuaded the same federal district court to deny a similar motion that had been filed against bayer by a different plaintiff,george mccollins.the district court had denied mccollins certification motion under fed.rule civ.proc.
the court granted bayer requested injunction against the state court proceedings,holding that its denial of certification in mccollins case precluded litigation of the certification issue in smith case.the court of appeals for the eighth circuit affirmed.it first noted that the act act generally prohibits federal courts from enjoining state court proceedings.but it found that the act relitigation exception authorized this injunction because ordinary rules of issue preclusion barred smith from seeking certification of his proposed class.in so doing,the court concluded that smith was invoking a state rule.rule civ.proc,that was sufficiently similar to the federal rule mccollins had invoked,such that the certification issues presented in the two cases were the same.the court further held that smith,as an unnamed member of mccollins putative class action,could be bound by the judgment in mccollins case.
held in enjoining the state court from considering smith class certification request,the federal court exceeded its authority under the relitigation exception to the act.
a under that act,a federal court may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a state court except in rare cases,when necessary to protect or effectuate the federal court judgments.the act specifically defined exceptions,atlantic coast line locomotive engineers,are narrow and are not to be enlarged by loose statutory construction,chick kam choo exxon.indeed,a ny doubts as to the propriety of a federal injunction against state court proceedings should be resolved in favor of permitting the state courts to proceed.atlantic coast line,at.the exception at issue in this case,known as the relitigation exception,authorizes an injunction to prevent state litigation of a claim or issue that previously was presented to and decided by the federal court.chick kam choo,at.this exception is designed to implement concepts of claim and issue preclusion.ibid.because deciding whether and how prior litigation has preclusive effect is usually the bailiwick of the second court here,the west virginia court every benefit of the doubt goes toward the state court,see atlantic coast line,at,an injunction can issue only if preclusion is clear beyond peradventure.for the federal court determination to preclude the state court adjudication of smith motion,at least two conditions must be met.first,the issue the federal court decided must be the same as the one presented in the state tribunal.and second,smith must have been a party to the federal suit or must fall within one of a few discrete exceptions to the general rule against binding nonparties.
b the issue the federal court decided was not the same as the one presented in the state tribunal.this case is little more than a rerun of chick kam choo.there,a federal court dismissed a suit involving singapore law on forum non conveniens grounds and then enjoined the plaintiff from pursuing the same claim in texas state court.however,because the legal standards for forum non conveniens differed in the two courts,the issues before those courts differed,making an injunction unwarranted.here,smith proposed class mirrored mccollins,and the two suits substantive claims broadly overlapped.but the federal court adjudicated mccollins certification motion under federal rule,whereas the state court was poised to consider smith proposed class under.rule.and the state supreme court has generally stated that it will not necessarily interpret its rule as coterminous with the federal rule.absent clear evidence that the state courts had adopted an approach to state rule tracking the federal court analysis in mccollins case,this court could not conclude that they would interpret their rule the same way and,thus,could not tell whether the certification issues in the two courts were the same.that uncertainty would preclude an injunction.and indeed,the case against an injunction here is even stronger,because the state supreme court has expressly disapproved the approach to rule b predominance requirement embraced by the federal district court.
c the district court injunction was independently improper because smith was not a party to the federal suit and was not covered by any exception to the rule against nonparty preclusion.generally,a party is o ne by or against whom a lawsuit is brought,united states ex rel.eisenstein city of new york,or who become s a party by intervention,substitution,or practice,karcher may.the definition of party can not be stretched so far as to cover a person like smith,whom mccollins was denied leave to represent.the only exception to the rule against nonparty preclusion potentially relevant here is the exception that binds members of properly conducted class actions to judgments entered in such proceedings.taylor sturgell.but mccollins suit was not a proper class action.indeed,the very ruling that bayer argues should have preclusive effect is the district court decision not to certify a class.absent certification of a class under federal rule,the precondition for binding smith was not met.neither a proposed,nor a rejected,class action may bind nonparties.see,at.bayer claims that this court approach to class actions would permit class counsel to try repeatedly to certify the same class simply by changing plaintiffs.but principles of stare decisis and comity among courts generally suffice to mitigate the sometimes substantial costs of similar litigation brought by different plaintiffs.the right approach does not lie in binding nonparties to a judgment.and to the extent class actions raise special relitigation problems,the federal class action fairness act of provides a remedy that does not involve departing from the usual preclusion rules.

keith smith,et,petitioners bayer corporation 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
in this case,a federal district court enjoined a state court from considering a plaintiff request to approve a class action.the district court did so because it had earlier denied a motion to certify a class in a related case,brought by a different plaintiff against the same defendant alleging similar claims.the federal court thought its injunction appropriate to prevent relitigation of the issue it had decided.
we hold to the contrary.in issuing this order to a state court,the federal court exceeded its authority under the relitigation exception to the act.that statutory provision permits a federal court to enjoin a state proceeding only in rare cases,when necessary to or effectuate the federal court judgments.here,that standard was not met for two reasons.first,the issue presented in the state court was not identical to the one decided in the federal tribunal.and second,the plaintiff in the state court did not have the requisite connection to the federal suit to be bound by the district court judgment.
because the question before us involves the effect of a former adjudication on this case,we begin our statement of the facts not with this lawsuit,but with another.in august,george mccollins sued respondent bayer corporation in the circuit court of cabell county,west virginia,asserting various claims arising from bayer sale of an allegedly hazardous prescription drug called baycol which bayer withdrew from the market that same month.mccollins contended that bayer had violated west virginia statute and the company express and implied warranties by selling him a defective product.and pursuant to west virginia rule of civil procedure,mccollins asked the state court to certify a class of west virginia residents who had also purchased baycol,so that the case could proceed as a class action.
approximately one month later,the suit now before us began in a different part of west virginia.petitioners keith smith and shirley sperlazza smith for short filed claims against bayer,similar to those raised in mccollins suit,in the circuit court of brooke county,west virginia.and like mccollins,smith asked the court to certify under west virginia rule a class of baycol purchasers residing in the state.neither smith nor mccollins knew about the other suit.
in january,bayer removed mccollins case to the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.see.the case was then transferred to the district of minnesota pursuant to a preexisting order of the judicial panel on litigation,which had consolidated all federal suits involving baycol numbering in the tens of thousands before a single district court judge.see.bayer,however,could not remove smith case to federal court because smith had sued several west virginia defendants in addition to bayer,and so the suit lacked complete diversity.see b smith suit thus remained in the state courthouse in brooke county.
over the next six years,the two cases proceeded along their separate pretrial paths at roughly the same pace.by,both courts were preparing to turn to their respective plaintiffs motions for class certification.the federal district court was the first to reach a decision.
applying federal rule of civil procedure the district court declined to certify mccollins proposed class of west virginia baycol purchasers.the district court reasoning proceeded in two steps.the court first ruled that,under west virginia law,each plaintiff would have to prove actual injury from his use of baycol to recover.app.to pet.for cert.the court then held that because the necessary showing of harm would vary from plaintiff to plaintiff,individual issues of fact predominate d over issues common to all members of the proposed class,and so the case was not suitable for class treatment,at.in the same order,the district court also dismissed mccollins claims on the merits in light of his failure to demonstrate physical injury from his use of baycol.mccollins chose not to appeal.
although mccollins suit was now concluded,bayer asked the district court for another order based upon it,this one affecting smith case in west virginia.in a motion receipt of which first apprised smith of mccollins suit bayer explained that the proposed class in smith case was identical to the one the federal court had just rejected.bayer therefore requested that the federal court enjoin the west virginia state court from hearing smith motion to certify a class.according to bayer,that order was appropriate to protect the district court judgment in mccollins suit denying class certification.the district court agreed and granted the injunction.
the court of appeals for the eighth circuit affirmed.in re baycol prods.litigation.the court noted that the act generally prohibits federal courts from enjoining state court proceedings.but the court held that the act relitigation exception authorized the injunction here because ordinary rules of issue preclusion barred smith from seeking certification of his proposed class.according to the court,smith was invoking a similar class action rule as mccollins had used to seek certification of the same class in a suit alleging the same legal theories,at the issue in the state court therefore was sufficiently identical to the one the federal court had decided to warrant preclusion,ibid.in addition,the court held,the parties in the two proceedings were sufficiently alike because smith was an unnamed member of the class mccollins had proposed,and because their interests were aligned,smith was appropriately bound by the federal court judgment.ibid.
we granted certiorari,because the order issued here implicates two circuit splits arising from application of the act relitigation exception.the first involves the requirement of preclusion law that a subsequent suit raise the same issue as a previous case the second concerns the scope of the rule that a court judgment can not bind nonparties we think the district court erred on both grounds when it granted the injunction,and we now reverse.
the act,first enacted in,provides that 
a court of the united states may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a state court except as expressly authorized by act of congress,or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.
the statute,we have recognized,is a necessary concomitant of the framers decision to authorize,and congress decision to implement,a dual system of federal and state courts.chick kam choo exxon.and the act core message is one of respect for state courts.the act broadly commands that those tribunals shall remain free from interference by federal courts.atlantic coast line locomotive engineers.that edict is subject to only three specifically defined exceptions.at.and those exceptions,though designed for important purposes,are narrow and are not to be enlarged by loose statutory construction.chick kam choo,at quoting atlantic coast line,at alteration in original.indeed,a ny doubts as to the propriety of a federal injunction against state court proceedings should be resolved in favor of permitting the state courts to proceed.at.
this case involves the last of the act three exceptions,known as the relitigation exception.that exception is to implement concepts of claim and issue preclusion.chick kam choo,at.the provision authorizes an injunction to prevent state litigation of a claim or issue that previously was presented to and decided by the federal court.ibid.but in applying this exception,we have taken special care to keep it strict and narrow.at.after all,a court does not usually get to dictate to other courts the preclusion consequences of its own judgment.wright,miller,cooper,federal practice and procedure,ed.hereinafter wright miller.deciding whether and how prior litigation has preclusive effect is usually the bailiwick of the second court here,the one in west virginia.so issuing an injunction under the relitigation exception is resorting to heavy artillery for that reason,every benefit of the doubt goes toward the state court,see atlantic coast line,at,an injunction can issue only if preclusion is clear beyond peradventure.
the question here is whether the federal court rejection of mccollins proposed class precluded a later adjudication in state court of smith certification motion.for the federal court determination of the class issue to have this preclusive effect,at least two conditions must be met first,the issue the federal court decided must be the same as the one presented in the state tribunal.see wright miller,at.and second,smith must have been a party to the federal suit,or else must fall within one of a few discrete exceptions to the general rule against binding nonparties.see,at.in fact,as we will explain,the issues before the two courts were not the same,and smith was neither a party nor the kind of nonparty who can be bound.so the courts below erred in finding the certification issue precluded,and erred all the more in thinking an injunction appropriate 
in our most recent case on the relitigation exception,chick kam choo exxon,we applied the same issue requirement of preclusion law to invalidate a federal court injunction,at.the federal court had dismissed a suit involving singapore law on grounds of forum non conveniens.after the plaintiff brought the same claim in texas state court,the federal court issued an injunction barring the plaintiff from pursuing relief in that alternate forum.we held that the district court had gone too far.a n essential prerequisite for applying the relitigation exception,we explained,is that the issues which the federal injunction insulates from litigation in state proceedings actually have been decided by the federal court.at.that prerequisite,we thought,was not satisfied because the issue to be adjudicated in state court was not the one the federal court had resolved.the federal court had considered the permissibility of the claim under federal forum non conveniens principles.but the texas courts,we thought,would apply a significantly different forum non conveniens analysis,at they had in prior cases rejected the strictness of the federal doctrine.our conclusion followed w hether the texas state courts are an appropriate forum for the plaintiff singapore law claims has not yet been litigated.ibid.because the legal standards in the two courts differed,the issues before the courts differed,and an injunction was unwarranted.
the question here closely resembles the one in chick kam choo.the class smith proposed in state court mirrored the class mccollins sought to certify in federal court both included all baycol purchasers resident in west virginia.moreover,the substantive claims in the two suits broadly overlapped both complaints alleged that bayer had sold a defective product in violation of the state consumer protection law and the company warranties.so far,so good for preclusion.but not so fast a critical question the question of the applicable legal standard remains.the district court ruled that the proposed class did not meet the requirements of federal rule because individualized issues would predominate over common ones.but the state court was poised to consider whether the proposed class satisfied west virginia rule.if those two legal standards differ as federal and state forum non conveniens law differed in chick kam choo then the federal court resolved an issue not before the state court.in that event,much like in chick kam choo,whether the west virginia state cour t should certify the proposed class action has not yet been litigated.at.
the court of appeals and smith offer us two competing ways of deciding whether the west virginia and federal rules differ,but we think the right path lies somewhere in the middle.the eighth circuit relied almost exclusively on the of the two rules texts.see,at.that was the right place to start,but not to end.federal and state courts,after all,can and do apply identically worded procedural provisions in widely varying ways.if a state procedural provision tracks the language of a federal rule,but a state court interprets that provision in a manner federal courts have not,then the state court is using a different standard and thus deciding a different issue.see wright miller,at stating that preclusion is inappropriate when different legal standards masquerad e behind similar legal labels at the other extreme,smith contends that the source of law is all that matters a different sovereign must in each and every case have the opportunity,if it chooses,to construe its procedural rule differently.brief for petitioners quoting ali,principles of the law,aggregate litigation,reporters notes,cmt.b.but if state courts have made crystal clear that they follow the same approach as the federal court applied,we see no need to ignore that determination in that event,the issues in the two cases would indeed be the same.so a federal court considering whether the relitigation exception applies should examine whether state law parallels its federal counterpart.but as suggested earlier,see supra,at,the federal court must resolve any uncertainty on that score by leaving the question of preclusion to the state courts.
under this approach,the west virginia supreme court has gone some way toward resolving the matter before us by declaring its independence from federal courts interpretation of the federal rules and particularly of rule.in in re.rezulin litigation,in re rezulin,the west virginia high court considered a plaintiff motion to certify a class coincidentally enough,in a suit about an allegedly defective pharmaceutical product.the court made a point of complaining about the parties and lower court reliance on federal cases about federal rule to decide the certification question.such cases,the court cautioned,may be persuasive,but they are not binding or controlling.at,at.and lest anyone mistake the import of this message,the court went on the aim of this rule is to avoid having our legal analysis of our rules amount to nothing more than pavlovian responses to federal decisional law.ibid.italics omitted.of course,the state courts might still have adopted an approach to their rule that tracked the analysis the federal court used in mccollins case.but absent clear evidence that the state courts had done so,we could not conclude that they would interpret their rule in the same way.and if that is so,we could not tell whether the certification issues in the state and federal courts were the same.that uncertainty would preclude an injunction.
but here the case against an injunction is even stronger,because the west virginia supreme court has disapproved the approach to rule b predominance requirement that the federal district court embraced.recall that the federal court held that the presence of a single individualized issue injury from the use of baycol prevented class certification.see supra,at.the court did not identify the common issues in the case nor did it balance these common issues against the need to prove individual injury to determine which predominated.the court instead applied a strict test barring class treatment when proof of each plaintiff injury is necessary by contrast,the west virginia supreme court in in re rezulin adopted an,balancing inquiry in interpreting its rule.rejecting any rigid test,the state court opined that the predominance requirement contemplates a review of many factors.at,at.indeed,the court noted,a single common issue in a case could outweigh numerous individual questions.ibid.that meant,the court further explained quoting what it termed the leading treatise on the subject,that even objections to certification based on causation,or reliance which typically involve showings of individual injury will not bar predominance satisfaction.ibid.quoting conte newberg,newberg on class actions,ed.so point for point,the analysis set out in in re rezulin diverged from the district court interpretation of federal rule.a state court using the in re rezulin standard would decide a different question than the one the federal court had earlier resolved 
this case,indeed,is little more than a rerun of chick kam choo.a federal court and a state court apply different law.that means they decide distinct questions.the federal court resolution of one issue does not preclude the state court determination of another.it then goes without saying that the federal court may not issue an injunction.the act exception does not extend nearly so far.
the injunction issued here runs into another basic premise of preclusion law a court judgment binds only the parties to a suit,subject to a handful of discrete and limited exceptions.see,wright miller,at.the importance of this rule and the narrowness of its exceptions go hand in hand.we have repeatedly emphasize d the fundamental nature of the general rule that only parties can be bound by prior judgments accordingly,we have taken a constrained approach to nonparty preclusion.taylor sturgell.against this backdrop,bayer defends the decision below by arguing that smith an unnamed member of a proposed but uncertified class qualifies as a party to the mccollins litigation.see brief for respondent.alternatively,bayer claims that the district court judgment binds smith under the recognized exception to the rule against nonparty preclusion for members of class actions.see,at.we think neither contention has merit.
