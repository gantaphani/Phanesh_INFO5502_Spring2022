several named plaintiffs and objectors appeal the district court approval of a settlement.the settlement agreement,like others we have approved in the past,granted incentive awards to the class representatives for their service to the class.but unlike the incentive awards that we have approved before,these awards were conditioned on the class representatives support for the settlement.these conditional incentive awards caused the interests of the class representatives to diverge from the interests of the class because the settlement agreement told class representatives that they would not receive incentive awards unless they supported the settlement.moreover,the conditional incentive awards significantly exceeded in amount what absent class members could expect to get upon settlement approval.because these circumstances created a patent divergence of interests between the named representatives and the class,we conclude that the class representatives and class counsel did not adequately represent the absent class members,and for this reason the district court should not have approved the settlement.we have jurisdiction under,and we reverse the district court approval of the settlement.
the plaintiffs below consumers who have been through bankruptcy allege that defendants experian information systems,inc,transunion llc,and equifax information services llc issued consumer credit reports with negative entries for debts already discharged in bankruptcy.in other words,defendants allegedly issued credit reports that stated that the plaintiffs were delinquent in making payments on debts that had been extinguished in bankruptcy.a smaller subset of the plaintiffs also contends that the agencies did not investigate these errors,even after the plaintiffs had notified the agencies of the errors on their reports.defendants allegedly violated the fair credit reporting act and its california counterparts because they did not use reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy in reporting debts discharged in bankruptcy,b,and after being informed of the errors,defendants did not conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information was inaccurate,a.see also cal.b,cal.bus.
the cases began as multiple lawsuits filed in and the district court consolidated the suits,which raised similar claims,and the parties began mediation.in april,the parties reached a settlement for injunctive relief,which the district court approved in august.as part of that settlement,defendants agreed to implement procedures that would presume the discharge of certain debts.no appellant challenges this settlement.
in february,the parties reached an agreement for monetary relief.the monetary settlement creates a common fund of million,million contributed by each of the three defendants.after the costs of settlement administration are deducted,the rest of the fund will be distributed as follows first,the settlement fund will pay awards to class members who demonstrate that they were actually harmed by defendants conduct.class members denied employment will receive,those denied a mortgage or housing rental will receive,and those denied credit or auto loans will receive.about class members claimed awards.second,the settlement fund will pay the class representatives and class counsel for their service in prosecuting the suit.the agreement provides for incentive awards 
on or before october,proposed b settlement class counsel shall file an application or applications to the court for an incentive award,to each of the named plaintiffs serving as class representatives in support of the settlement,and each such award not to exceed.
the agreement also states that class counsel should petition the court for an award of attorneys fees and costs,to be paid out of the fund.the agreement does not specify the amount of such fees and costs.third,the remainder of the fund will be distributed to the rest of the class as convenience awards.claimants simply need to attest that they qualify as class members to receive convenience awards.approximately class members submitted these claims.each claimant will receive about.
the court preliminarily approved the settlement and provisionally certified the settlement class on may.after two rounds of notice to the class,the district court held a series of fairness hearings on the settlement.several named plaintiffs formerly class representatives and objectors collectively objecting plaintiffs challenged the settlement.the district court considered but rejected their objections and found that the settlement was fair,reasonable,and adequate.the court issued an order granting final approval of the settlement on july.white experian info.solutions,d.the court also awarded attorneys fees and costs to class counsel.objecting plaintiffs appealed.
on appeal,objecting plaintiffs give several arguments as to why the settlement was not fair,reasonable,and adequate.but we only reach the issue of whether class representatives and class counsel are adequate where the settlement agreement conditions payment of incentive awards on the class representatives support for the settlement.
we review the district court approval of a settlement for abuse of discretion.rodriguez pub.rodriguez i,cir.under review we must affirm unless the district court applied the wrong legal standard or its findings of fact were illogical,implausible,or without support in the record.rodriguez disner rodriguez ii,cir citing united states hinkson,cir en banc.
objecting plaintiffs contend that the settlement agreement,which provides for incentive awards to named plaintiffs in support of the s ettlement,created a conflict of interest between the class representatives and the class.objecting plaintiffs also assert that,as a result of this conflict,class counsel engaged in conflicted representation by continuing to represent the settling class representatives settling plaintiffs or class representatives and the class at large after the two groups developed divergent interests.objecting plaintiffs thus contend that the class representatives and class counsel were inadequate to represent the absent class members.see.a,g b.upon review of the record and reflection on our precedents,we agree.
incentive awards are payments to class representatives for their service to the class in bringing the lawsuit.see rodriguez i,at see also mclaughlin on class actions ed.in cases where the class receives a monetary settlement,the awards are often taken from the class recovery.see id.although we have approved incentive awards for class representatives in some cases,we have told district courts to scrutinize carefully the awards so that they do not undermine the adequacy of the class representatives.see staton boeing,cir.settling plaintiffs misinterpret the scope of our precedent about incentive awards,so we begin by reviewing that precedent.
in staton boeing company,at,we reversed the district court approval of a settlement because the settlement provided for disproportionately large payments to class representatives.the settlement awarded the class representatives up to each.we noted that in some cases incentive awards may be proper but cautioned that awarding them should not become routine practice i f class representatives expect routinely to receive special awards in addition to their share of the recovery,they may be tempted to accept suboptimal settlements at the expense of the class members whose interests they are appointed to guard.id.at alteration in original quoting weseley spear,leeds kellogg.the settlement in staton magnified the risks associated with incentive awards because the awards there were much larger than the payments to individual class members,eliminat ing a critical check on the fairness of the settlement for the class as a whole.id.at.where a class representative supports the settlement and is treated equally by the settlement,the likelihood that the settlement is forwarding the class interest to the maximum degree practically possible increases.id.but if such members of the class are provided with special incentives in the settlement agreement,they may be more conce
