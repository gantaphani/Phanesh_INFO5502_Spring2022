both sets of named plaintiffs now appeal.because both cases raise the same issue,we have consolidated them before us.
we begin by considering whether appellants voluntary dismissal of their claims with prejudice under rule a left them with a final order appealable under.this question of first impression requires us to consider the scope of two strands of third circuit authority sullivan pacific indemnity,cir,in which we held that a plaintiff may not obtain appellate review after incurring a dismissal for failure to prosecute for the purpose of seeking to appeal an interlocutory order,and fassett delta kappa epsilon,cir,in which we permitted plaintiffs to voluntarily dismiss a portion of their case in order to appeal an order of the district court terminating the remainder of their case.in considering the significance of these cases,we bear in mind that,while an appeal from a final judgment necessarily,and permissibly,appeals prior orders of the district court,appellants here seek review of only the orders decertifying their collective actions,and do not complain of the final orders that dismissed their cases.

we began our opinion by noting that a class certification decision,per se,is not an appealable final order under,but rather is an interlocutory order.id.we characterized the dismissal for failure to prosecute as an attempt to avoid this c ourt firm position against interlocutory appeals of class certification determinations.id.such a strategy,this court reasoned,was impermissible beca
