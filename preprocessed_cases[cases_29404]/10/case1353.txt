this case presents a question of first impression whether the removal provisions of the class action fairness act of,stat.codified in scattered sections of hereinafter class action fairness act or the act,apply to pending state court cases that were removed after the effective date of the act.on march,we entered an order in this case holding that the act does not apply to pending state cases and denying defendant petition for leave to appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.we now issue this opinion explaining the reasoning for that order.
background 
on april,plaintiff romia pritchett,acting on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated,filed a class action complaint against defendant office depot,in the colorado district court for the county of denver.plaintiff,an assistant store manager at an office depot retail store,alleged that defendant violated colorado law by regularly requiring its employees to work extra hours without paying overtime.on june,the state court certified a class pursuant to rule of the colorado rules of civil procedure consisting of a ll assistant store managers employed by office depot,in the state of colorado from april.trial was set for march,and discovery commenced.
approximately one month before the start of trial,on february,congress enacted the class action fairness act.stat.at.one of the most significant features of the new law was that it expanded the subject matter jurisdiction of federal courts over class actions in which at least one plaintiff class member was diverse in citizenship from the defendant and where the amount in controversy exceeded million.see,stat.at codified at d.if such an action arose in state court,section of the act permitted removal to federal court in accordance with,stat.at codified at.
on march,just two weeks before trial was scheduled to begin,defendant removed this action to the united states district court for the district of colorado,utilizing the provisions in d and as a basis for jurisdiction.on march,plaintiff moved to remand the proceedings to state court pursuant to,arguing that the class action fairness act of did not apply to actions already pending in state courts.the district court agreed,and on march,remanded the case to the state court.
on march,with trial only four days away,defendant requested a stay in proceedings from the state court so that it could appeal the district court remand order.the state court denied the request and instead delayed the start date of the trial one week,to march.
on march,defendant filed a petition for leave to appeal the district court remand order with this court and also filed a motion for an emergency stay of the state court proceedings pending appeal.on march,we denied the petition for leave to appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in a brief order and indicated that further elaboration would follow that order also dismissed the motion for an emergency stay as moot.we now issue this opinion to explain the court reasoning in the aforementioned order.
ii.jurisdiction 
defendant filed its petition for leave to appeal under c,which was recently enacted as part of the class action fairness act of,stat.at.section c is a provision that expressly gives the united states courts of appeals discretionary jurisdiction to consider appeals of remand orders in certain class action cases specified in the act,provided that the appeal is taken within seven days of the remand order.c if a court of appeals accepts an appeal under subsection c,the appellate court is given sixty additional days during which to render its judgment.c.
here,the petition for leave to appeal was filed well within the time limit,and jurisdiction vested in the tenth circuit court of appeals at that time.although we ultimately conclude that we do not have jurisdiction over this appeal predicated on the class action fairness act because this action was commenced prior to the effective date of the act,federal courts always have jurisdiction to consider their own jurisdiction.combs pricewaterhousecoopers llp,cir.thus,we have jurisdiction to consider our jurisdiction to grant the requested relief in the instant case.
iii.effective date of d 
section of the act provides that 
the amendments made by this act shall apply to any civil action commenced on or after the date of enactment of this act.
stat.at.the date of enactment of the act is february.id.at.this class action began on april,when plaintiff filed his class action complaint with the colorado district court.defendant removed the case to federal court on march.thus,the applicability of the act turns upon whether this civil action was commenced on april,the state court filing date,or on march,the federal court removal date.
defendant claims that the case was commenced for purposes of the act when it was removed to federal court.in essence,defendant argues that when a preexisting state action is removed to federal court,it is commenced in federal court as of the date of removal.plaintiff argues that the class action commenced just once,when it was initially filed in state court on april.because that date precedes the effective date of the statute,according to plaintiff,this case is not governed by the act.we agree with plaintiff reading of the word commenced.
our analysis is governed by traditional rules of statutory construction and rules pertaining to federal jurisdiction.therefore,we look first to the language of the statute,which reads as follows 
the amendments made by this act shall apply to any civil action commenced on or after the date of enactment of this act.
stat.at.traditionally,a cause of action is commenced when it is first brought in an appropriate court,which here was when it was brought in state court.see.a civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.when a matter is removed to federal court,it is not traditionally viewed as recommenced,nor as a new cause of action.see kieffer travelers fire ins,w e do not usually think of an action as having been commenced in a district court by removal.charles wright,arther miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure,at ed noting that removal jurisdiction is unique because it allows a federal court to hear a claim over which it has no original subject matter jurisdiction and therefore to adjudicate a suit that could never have been commenced there.although there exist some unique circumstances in which some action other than filing a complaint in court is deemed to commence a lawsuit,see,meisel fed.bureau of investigation,d,holding that action under the administrative procedure act may be commenced by filing a miscellaneous discovery motion,we view these situations as exceptions to the general federal rule that a lawsuit is commenced at a discrete moment in time the filing of the original complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction.see.of course,some states provide that service of process may commence a suit.see.
we then look to presumptions that might aid our analysis.it is that statutes conferring jurisdiction upon the federal courts,and particularly removal statutes,are to be narrowly construed in light of our constitutional role as limited tribunals.shamrock oil gas sheets.united states ex rel.king hillcrest health,cir.thus,if there is ambiguity as to whether the instant statute confers federal jurisdiction over this case,we are compelled to adopt a reasonable,narrow construction.here,we find plaintiff interpretation of the word commenced in the act to be such a construction 
finally,we turn to legislative history.although legislative history is sometimes suspect as a persuasive interpretative tool,here the progression of language in the act as it moved through congress is instructive.when the act was originally introduced in the house,the removal provision applied both to cases commenced on or after the enactment date and to cases in which a class certification order is entered on or after the enactment date.see,cong.in contrast,neither the senate version of the bill nor the final statute passed by both houses of congress provided for removal of actions certified on or after the enactment date.see,cong,stat.at.the sen
