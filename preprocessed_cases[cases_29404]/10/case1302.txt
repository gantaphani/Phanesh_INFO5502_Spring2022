this is an appeal from an interlocutory order denying defendants motion to exclude certain members from the plaintiff class.a stipulated judgment was entered thereafter,from which defendants did not appeal.because the order appealed from is not a final order under,lacked the practical effect of granting or denying injunctive relief,and defendants took no other steps to preserve a right of appeal as to it,we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
background 
shumate litigation 
on april,present and future inmates confined at the california institution for women ciw in frontera,california,and at the central california women facility ccwf in chowchilla,california,filed a class action against numerous defendants,including most significantly the governor of california,the california director of finance,the secretary of the youth and adult correctional agency,the director of the california department of corrections cdc,and the deputy director for health care services for the department of corrections,in the united states district court,eastern district of california.shumate wilson,no.civ.the shumate plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to remedy alleged policies,practices,acts,and omissions evidenc ing and constitut ing deliberate indifference to the rights of prisoners and violat ing the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the eighth amendment.the complaint alleged that defendants furnished inadequate sick call,triage,emergency care,nurses,urgent care,chronic care,specialty referrals,medical screenings,care,examinations and tests,medical equipment,medications,specialty diets,terminal care,health education,dental care,and grievance procedures,and that the provision of medical care featured unreasonable delays and disruptions in medication.
on january,the district court certified a plaintiff class,defined as all persons suffering from,or at risk of developing,serious illness or injury,excluding mental disorders,who were then or would be in the future confined at ciw and ccwf.it also certified a subclass,defined as all persons who were then or would be in the future confined at ciw and ccwf and who were diagnosed as hiv positive.after two years of litigation and negotiation,on august,the parties entered into a settlement agreeing to independent audits of the ciw and ccwf healthcare systems to determine their compliance with the parties settlement provisions as to aspects of care 
on december,the independent assessor issued a final report stating that ciw and ccwf substantially complied with the shumate settlement terms,meeting criteria for of the parties settlement provisions.the assessor noted seven areas of concern that precluded a finding of full compliance bus screenings,medication continuity,and physician referrals the wait for sick call the integration of diagnostic testing results into regular chronic care educational and preventative aspects of chronic care mental health staff at ccwf medication distribution at ciw and ciw physical therapy program.on august,pursuant to the parties stipulation and federal rule of civil procedure a ii,the district court dismissed the shumate class action with prejudice.
following the dismissal,in february,ronald shansky,a physician and consultant for the cdc,audited ciw and ccwf compliance with the shumate settlement provisions.after examining medical records,log books,policies,procedures,and meeting minutes,and observing health services furnished to ciw and ccwf inmates,shansky found eleven areas of at ciw and only two at ccwf he opined that the deficiencies at ciw and ccwf were easily correctable.
plata class action 
a year after shumate was dismissed,on august,ten male california inmates filed a complaint against many of the same defendants as in shumate,alleging that the cdc inadequate medical care system violated the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the eighth amendment,as well as the americans with disabilities act ada,et,and section of the rehabilitation act.these allegations are virtually identical to those raised in shumate 
on january,the parties stipulated to injunctive relief.the stipulation called for the cdc to implement health care services division policies and procedures designed to meet or exceed the minimum level of care necessary to fulfill the defendants obligation to plaintiffs under the eighth amendment of the united states constitution.under the stipulation,cdc institutions became subject to a schedule of audits to determine their compliance with the policies and procedures.they are also required to provide access to records,information,housing,and persons including staff and inmates.
the stipulation enforcement provisions provide that t he court shall find that this stipulation satisfies the requirements of a a and shall retain jurisdiction to enforce its terms.the parties agreed to disagree as to whether the stipulated relief would apply to inmates at ciw and ccwf but that upon motion by defendants the district court would resolve the question 
the parties disagree about whether prisoners incarcerated at the california institution for women ciw and the central california women facility ccwf,previously litigated in a class action entitled shumate wilson.civ wbs jfm p,should be members of the class.to resolve this dispute defendants shall move within sixty days after this stipulation is approved by the court for an order determining whether prisoners at ccwf and ciw should be excluded from the class on the sole ground that they are not similarly situated to plaintiffs because of the previously litigated class action entitled.the motion will not otherwise alter the burden of proof under rule or create a presumption concerning their inclusion.
the parties did not provide for appeal of the district court order by either the plaintiff class or defendant.
as provided in the stipulation,defendants moved on march,to exclude ciw and ccwf inmates from the plaintiff class.on may,following briefing and a hearing,the district court denied defendants motion,ordering that the ciw and ccwf inmates be included in the class.defendants filed a notice of appeal from that order on june.the district court held a fairness hearing on the class settlement on june,and entered a final order adopting the class action stipulation on june.that final order was not appealed by either side.
ii.discussion 
defendants assert that we have jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to and federal rule of civil procedure f.because defendants appeal has no relation to either receiverships,see a,or to rights in admiralty,see a,we must examine whether the order appealed from had the practical effect of granting or denying an injunction so as to support jurisdiction under a.we hold that it did not.nor is jurisdiction sustainable under either b or federal rule of civil procedure f,because defendants failed to request permission to file an interlocutory appeal.therefore,we lack jurisdiction over this appeal.
jurisdiction under a 
the parties recognize that the district court order denying exclusion of the ciw and ccwf inmates from the plaintiff class was not a final order for purposes of appeal.this order is best interpreted as a decision to maintain or expand the grant of class certification,comparable to class certification orders.class certification orders generally are not immediately appealable.bauman united states dist.court,cir hufstedler,concurring g enerally an order certifying a class action is a interlocutory order.see also schwarzer,tashima,wagstaffe,california practice guide federal civil procedure before trial,james moore et,moore federal practice b ed.
defendants nevertheless suggest that we have jurisdiction pursuant to a because the district court order had the practical effect of granting or denying injunctive relief.section a allows courts of appeal to review interlocutory orders granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions although defendants acknowledge that the order they appealed from does not technically grant,deny,modify,refuse,or dissolve an injunction,they cite a line of cases beginning with carson american brands,d,which permit appel
