opinion of the court 
disputes about whether workers are properly classified as employees or independent contractors are a classic and reoccurring issue in american law.this case presents such a dispute.jani king the world largest commercial cleaning franchisor,classifies its franchisees as independent contractors.two jani king franchisees,darryl williams and howard brooks,assert that they are misclassified and should be treated as employees.on behalf of a class of jani king franchisees in the philadelphia area,brooks and williams seek unpaid wages under the pennsylvania wage payment and collection law wpcl.stat.the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for class certification.in this interlocutory appeal under federal rule of civil procedure f,we consider whether the misclassification claim can be made on a basis through common evidence,primarily the franchise agreement and manuals.we hold that the claims in this case are susceptible to determination and that the district court did not abuse its discretion by certifying the class.
jani king franchisees provide janitorial and other cleaning services for offices,restaurants,warehouses,and other commercial properties.jani king licenses its trademarks,goodwill,and cleaning system to its franchisees and provides franchisees with administrative,billing,and advertising support.to obtain a franchise,an individual must pass a background check,pay jani king an initial franchise fee of between and,and sign the jani king franchise agreement.app.
jani king requires new franchisees to meet several requirements before starting operations.a new franchisee must attend a day training course and pass a test about jani king safety and training manual,which is more than pages long.a franchisee must also purchase cleaning equipment and insurance,both of which are offered directly by jani king,although a franchisee may select alternative sources.a franchisee must secure any needed licenses and permits.
jani king guarantees new franchisees a certain dollar amount in cleaning contracts for a set period.for a larger initial investment,jani king offers contracts with higher value and guarantees them for a longer period.jani king is responsible for obtaining new customers,and someone from jani king sales office will meet with prospective customers to determine their cleaning needs and give them a quote.if a customer agrees to a cleaning services contract,the contract is between the customer and jani king.the franchisee is not a party.jani king asks franchisees whether they want to provide services under the contract.a franchisee may accept or reject the contract.
jani king exercises a significant amount of control over how franchisees operate.the jani king policies and procedures manual dictates when and how frequently franchisees must communicate with customers,how franchisees must dress when meeting customers,and what uniforms must be worn while performing cleaning work.app.franchisees must be able to respond to any messages within four hours at all times and must notify jani king in advance of any vacations and delegate all business authority to someone else while on vacation.app.any marketing materials must be approved by the jani king regional office,and franchisees are not permitted to advertise their individual phone numbers or have individual websites.app.franchisees must make a monthly report to jani king of all services and supplies invoiced and must keep accurate books and records,which jani king may audit.app.jani king requires franchisees to maintain sufficient working capital.app.jani king requires franchisees to perform cleaning services adequately and may inspect the premises serviced by the franchisee at any time.app.customer complaints must be handled in a prescribed manner and within a certain time frame.
jani king has numerous tools to ensure franchisees adhere to its requirements.jani king may charge a complaint fee for failure to adequately address customer concerns.if the complaint is serious enough,the jani king regional office will address the problem and bill the franchisee for any response work it must do.app.jani king may require franchisees to take remedial training.app.jani king may reassign customer accounts for inadequate performance or failure to adhere to policies and procedures.app.ultimately,jani king may suspend any franchisee for failure to comply with its procedures and policies.
jani king invoices customers and controls billing and accounting.jani king subtracts all fees from the gross revenue and pays the remainder to the franchisee.the fees include a percent royalty fee,a percent accounting fee although this fee is reduced for particularly large franchises,a percent technology licensing fee,and a percent advertising fee.app.in addition,once the initial guaranteed business period expires,franchisees pay a finder fee to jani king for all new customer accounts.franchisees may solicit new business within certain parameters,but any new cleaning contract is between the customer and jani king,which then has sole control over the contract.app.
franchisees have control over certain aspects of their business.while some franchisees do all cleaning work personally,others hire employees.jani king requires franchisees to keep certain employee documents and records,but franchisees otherwise have total control over hiring and firing employees.
there are approximately jani king franchises in the philadelphia area.the named plaintiffs,darryl williams and howard brooks,purchased jani king franchises in the philadelphia area.williams and brooks franchises were small.brooks never hired any employees and performed cleaning services for his franchise himself,with occasional help from his wife or friends.app.williams services one jani king account and performs the cleaning himself,although he paid an employee to help him for two months at one point.app.
franchisees have a wide range of business sizes some have large businesses and many employees,and some have small businesses and no employees.for example,franchisee charles jones has employees,including five supervisors,monthly gross revenue of in february,and total gross revenue since of million.at the opposite end of the spectrum,kadri memedoski has no employees,in monthly revenue for february,and total gross revenue since.jani king presented other examples of franchisees with many employees,including sulejuman smanovski with and althea lanier with.app.
williams and brooks filed suit on behalf of a class of about jani king franchisees in the philadelphia area in state court in,asserting that jani king violated the wpcl.jani king removed the case to the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania and moved to dismiss.for reasons unclear from the record,it took the district court three years to rule on the motion to dismiss,which it eventually granted in part and denied in part in december.the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification,which the district court granted.jani king petitioned our court for leave to appeal under federal rule of civil procedure f,and we granted permission for this appeal.the district court stayed the case pending the outcome of this appeal.
class certification is appropriate when the prerequisites of federal rule of civil procedure are met the party seeking certification must prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that each of the four conditions of rule a numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy is met and that at least one of the provisions of rule b is satisfied.comcast behrend,d.we review a district court class certification order for abuse of discretion.in re hydrogen peroxide antitrust,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if its decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.id.quoting newton merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.
the district court found that each of the rule a factors was met.jani king did not dispute numerosity before the district court.it did argue to the district court that the plaintiffs failed to establish typicality and adequacy.the district court explained at length why typicality and adequacy were satisfied app,and jani king did not challenge these rulings on appeal.nor did jani king challenge the district court conclusion that the superiority requirement of rule b was met.
the issue on appeal is whether the plaintiffs claims are capable of resolution.this involves the commonality requirement of rule a and the predominance requirement of rule b.commonality requires that there be common issues of law or fact.fed.civ.a.to meet the predominance requirement,these common issues of law or fact must predominate over issues affecting individual class members.comcast.at.this is a challenging standard to meet that requires the district court to undertake a rigorous analysis.wal mart stores,dukes,d see comcast.at if anything,rule b predominance criterion is even more demanding than rule a.predominance turns on the nature of the evidence and whether proof of the essential elements of the cause of action requires individual treatment.hydrogen peroxide,at internal quotation marks omitted.because of this consideration,addressing predominance f requently entail s some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff underlying claim.wal mart.at.
we begin our analysis by considering the evidence needed to prove the plaintiffs misclassification claim under the wpcl.the wpcl requires employers,among other things,to pay to employees wages and fringe benefits in a regularly scheduled manner and by lawful money or check and to make only lawful deductions from employees pay.stat.the wpcl gives employees the right to institute a civil action to recover wages owed under the statute.id.a a.the dispute in this case is whether the plaintiffs are employees of jani king eligible to bring a suit under the wpcl or independent contractors not covered by the wpcl.
the wpcl does not define employee.morin brassington.super.in interpreting the meaning of employee under the wpcl,pennsylvania courts have looked to similar statutes such as the pennsylvania unemployment compensation act and the pennsylvania workers compensation act.id.at applying the workers compensation act and related case law to the wpcl frank burns,interdigital commc ns.super applying the definitions in the unemployment compensation act and workers compensation act to the wpcl 
pennsylvania courts interpreting the unemployment compensation act and the workers compensation act have applied a multifactor test to determine whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor.courts interpreting the wpcl have adopted the same multifactor test.the factors include 
the control of the manner that work is to be done responsibility for result only terms of agreement between the parties the nature of the work or occupation the skill required for performance whether one employed is engaged in a distinct occupation or business which party supplies the tools whether payment is by the time or by the job whether the work is part of the regular business of the employer,and the right to terminate the employment at any time.
morin,at quoting lynch workmen comp.appeal.the applicability of this multifactor test to the wpcl is bolstered by the use of the same factors by the pennsylvania supreme court to distinguish between employees and independent contractors in the context of vicarious liability.hammermill paper rust eng g.
although no factor is dispositive,the paramount factor is the right to control the manner in which the work is accomplished.morin,at.the pennsylvania supreme court has also noted,in the context of workers compensation,that control over the work to be completed and the manner in which it is to be performed are the primary factors in determining employee status.universal am can,workers comp.appeal,calling these factors the dominant considerations see lynch,at t he right to control is the most persuasive indication of employee or independent contractor status.
jani king argues that actual control,not the right to control,is the key factor in the test.jani king criticizes a number of pennsylvania decisions,including lynch,and argues that they are mistaken or rely on inapposite cases.but the pennsylvania supreme court has held that the right to control is more significant than actual control.universal am can,at i t is the existence of the right to control that is significant,irrespective of whether the control is actually exercised.and we have also recognized the importance of the right to control.drexel union prescription,cir.actual control of the manner of work is not essential rather,it is the right to control which is determinative.according to jani king,universal am can,an contractor case,relied on cases for this conclusion.but to the extent the pennsylvania case law is premised on a mistake,that mistake is longstanding and accepted by the pennsylvania supreme court.it is not our place to correct such a mistake.
pennsylvania courts,including the pennsylvania supreme court,apply the multifactor test for distinguishing between employee and independent contractor status in many different contexts.based on this authority,we predict that the pennsylvania supreme court would employ this test in the context of the wpcl.we also predict that the right to control,rather than actual control,is the most important of the factors.
we turn next to the more difficult question of whether,using the multifactor test,the employment status question can be resolved in this case through evidence common to the class.the common evidence identified by the plaintiffs and the district court are the jani king franchise agreement,policies manual,and training manual,and representative testimony about those documents.the district court concluded that the plaintiffs claims could be proven through this common evidence and that,therefore,the plaintiffs met the predominance requirement.
the district court accurately summarized the controls placed on franchisees by the franchise agreement and manuals 
plaintiffs have pointed to specific provisions in the franchise agreement,the policies manual,and the training manual collectively jani king documents to show that jani king has the ability to control the manner in which franchisees perform their tasks.all the proposed class members are bound by the jani king documents,which include mandates regarding how often the franchisee must communicate with customers,how franchisees must address customer complaints,where franchisees can solicit business,what franchisees must wear,what types of records the franchisee must keep,how the franchisee can advertise,how far in advance franchisees must inform the franchisor of vacations,and how quickly the franchisee must be able to be reached.in addition,jani king controls the franchisees work assignments,has the right to inspect the franchisees work,and has the ability to change the policies and procedures as it sees fit.
the jani king franchise agreement,policies manual,and training manual are common to the class they apply to the franchisee who has no employees and services a contract and to the franchisee with dozens of employees and many cleaning contracts.these documents describe the level of jani king right to control its franchisees.they also address many of the secondary factors considered in pennsylvania decisions the terms of agreement,the nature of the work,the skill required,who supplies the tools,whether payment is by time or by job,and the right to terminate at any time.see morin,at.we find no legal error in the district court conclusion that these documents could be read to give jani king the right to control its franchisees.app.
we go no further toward resolving the merits of the wpcl claim.although the court must undertake a rigorous analysis at the certification stage and consider some issues,the class certification stage is not the place for a decision on the merits.amgen.ret.plans trust funds,d rule grants courts no license to engage in merits inquiries at the certification stage.merits questions may be considered to the extent but only to the extent that they are relevant to determining whether the rule prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.
jani king asks us to weigh in on the merits of the plaintiffs claim now.jani king first issue on appeal is do the system controls inherent in a franchise relationship make a franchisor the employer of its franchise owners under pennsylvania employment test jani king br.this appeal is not the proper place for us to answer this question,and we decline to do so.it is enough for us to determine that some franchise agreements may contain sufficient controls to render the relationship one of employment and that the common documents in this case contain the types of evidence that courts and juries use to make that determination under pennsylvania law.
jani king may ultimately be correct that the franchise agreement and manual do not contain sufficient controls over the work of its franchisees to make them employees under pennsylvania law,and we express no opinion on that matter here.either way,it is possible to make the determination on a basis.if jani king is correct and the documents can not,as a matter of fact,establish that the franchisees are employees,jani king will prevail class wide.
jani king makes two primary arguments for why the franchise agreement and manual are insufficient to resolve the wpcl claim.one,jani king argues that,as a matter of law,written agreements alone are insufficient to determine employment status.and,two,jani king argues that franchises are inherently different from other types of business relationships and that franchise system controls should be categorically excluded from consideration when determining whether an employment relationship exists.neither of these arguments persuades us that certifying the class was an abuse of discretion.
jani king asserts that the test for employee status under pennsylvania law is not susceptible to proof through common evidence.this is so,according to jani king,because the entire employment relationship must be examined in determining whether it is an employment relationship.c e credits online unemployment comp.bd.of review.jani king notes that courts have repeatedly held that examining the written terms of an agreement alone is not sufficient to determine employment status.jani king br.therefore,jani king argues,the district court erred as a matter of law b y relying on the terms of jani king common franchise documents,to the exclusion of individual evidence of the actual relationships between jani king and franchisees.id.at.
we are not convinced that the terms of a written agreement alone are never sufficient to determine employment status.jani king cited urbano stat courier.super,a class action wpcl case in which the plaintiff delivery drivers argued they were misclassified.in that case,the superior court stated that,w hile an agreement is relevant when identifying whether an relationship exists,it is just one of the criteria to be utilized.id.at.the trial court had granted judgment on the pleadings,finding that the plaintiffs were independent contractors as a matter of law because the driver agreement repeatedly identified drivers as independent contractors.but the superior court reversed because there were disputed facts that the alleged employer exercised control to a greater degree than provided by the agreement.id.in this case,there is no assertion that the agreement and manuals do not control.
we are equally unpersuaded by two other cases relied upon by jani king,jones century oil,cir,and kurbatov department of labor industry.super.jani king cited jones for its statement that it is the actual practice between the parties that is crucial.jones,at quoting george nemeth.kurbatov similarly held that it is the actual working relationship between worker and employer that is determinative.at.but in both these cases,the courts were responding to an argument by the defendant that the worker was an independent contractor because the agreement identified the worker as an independent contractor.jones,at kurbatov,at.these courts were contrasting the actual practice and actual working relationship against the labels used in an agreement.it is these labels that are not determinative.jones,at t he determining factor is not the way in which plaintiffs or defendant regards this relationship but what it really was under the facts and applicable rules of law.quoting feller new amsterdam cas.
the provisions of an agreement may be evidence of what the actual practice or working relationship is.in kurbatov,for example,the superior court affirmed an order of the pennsylvania department of labor and industry,which had determined that an employment relationship existed.the department of labor and industry relied on the agreement,even though the employer testimony conflicted with the agreement.the department of labor and industry was entitled to weigh the evidence and rely on the documentary evidence to the exclusion of testimony.kurbatov,at.compare this to jones,where we vacated a directed verdict because there was testimony that the right to control was not fully reflected in the written agreements.jones,at.
the three decisions cited by jani king contrast with green independent oil.green was a vicarious liability case the defendant company argued it was not responsible for the negligence of a worker whom the company alleged was an independent contractor.the sole evidence of the relationship between the worker and the company was the agreement.id.at.since the terms of the agreement were not in dispute,the determination of the relationship was a question of law for the court.id.an examination of the agreement in its entirety indicate d clearly and convincingly that the relationship was that of independent,not.id.under certain circumstances,therefore,an employment relationship or the lack of one can be determined by examining the documents alone.
because documentary evidence can be sufficient to resolve the multifactor employment status test,it was not an error of law for the district court to rely on this evidence in ruling on class certification.
jani king and the amicus international franchise association stress that franchising is an important and beneficial way of conducting business that is fundamentally different from other situations involving misclassification claims.they both assert that an adverse decision directly threatens the viability of franchising in pennsylvania.jani king br.see amicus br.jani king argues that the system controls inherent in franchising should be irrelevant when considering whether an alleged employer has the right to exercise control.
some case law lends credence to this position.for example,we have noted that s ome degree of control by the franchisor over the franchisee would appear to be inherent in the franchise relationship and may even be mandated by federal trademark law.drexel,at citation omitted.in myszkowski penn stroud hotel,for example,the pennsylvania superior court held that the franchise system controls imposed by best western addresse d the result of the work and not the manner in which it is conducted.
jani king also cites cases from other jurisdictions,including a california case involving jani king,juarez jani king of california,cal.in that case,the district court found it likely that under california law,a franchisee must show that the franchisor exercised control beyond that necessary to protect and maintain its interest in its trademark,trade name and goodwill to establish a prima facie case of an relationship.id.at quoting cislaw southland,th,d.once the district court set aside the policies required to protect jani king service mark and goodwill,it found very little if any common evidence tending to prove an relationship between jani king and its franchisees.id.in the instant case,the district court discounted juarez because pennsylvania law does not distinguish between controls put in place to protect a franchise goodwill and intellectual property and controls for other purposes.app.we have found no pennsylvania case holding otherwise.the district court did not err by discounting juarez.
the pennsylvania cases cited by jani king do not stand for the proposition that franchise system controls are somehow categorically excluded from consideration in the contractor analysis.as we succinctly stated in drexel,
the mere existence of a franchise relationship does not necessarily trigger a relationship,nor does it automatically insulate the parties from such a relationship.whether the control retained by the franchisor is also sufficient to establish a relationship depends in each case upon the nature and extent of such control as defined in the franchise agreement or by the actual practice of the parties.
drexel,at.under pennsylvania law,no special treatment is accorded to the franchise relationship.a franchisee may be an employee or an independent contractor depending on the nature of the franchise system controls.
the plaintiffs wpcl misclassification claim can be resolved by the evidence that is common to the class.we find no clearly erroneous finding of fact or errant conclusion of law in the district court judgment.we therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by certifying the class.we will affirm the district court class certification order.
franchising constitutes a bedrock of the american economy.queen city pizza,domino pizza,cir.yet the majority opinion threatens the viability of this basic economic bedrock.i do not believe that such a result is consistent with either basic class action principles,the nature and importance of the relationship,or prior franchising case law.i predict that the pennsylvania supreme court would ultimately hold that controls necessary to protect a franchisor trademark,trade name,and goodwill in short,franchise system controls are insufficient by themselves to establish the existence of an relationship between the franchisor and its franchisees.in this case,the plaintiffs purported common evidence merely sets forth various franchise system controls.because of the absence of common evidence tending to prove that the franchisees are employees of the franchisor,the district court abused its discretion by certifying a class of jani king franchisees.i therefore must respectfully dissent.
under federal rule of civil procedure b,a class action may be maintained if the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.the majority acknowledges that t his is a challenging standard to meet that requires the district court to undertake a rigorous analysis.op.at quoting wal mart stores,dukes,d.in fact,predominance depends on the nature of the evidence and whether proof of the elements of the cause of action requires individual treatment.see,in re hydrogen peroxide antitrust,cir.because of this consideration,addressing predominance f requently entail s some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff claim.wal mart.at.id.at.in short,we must examine the elements of plaintiffs claim through the prism of rule to determine whether the district court properly certified the class.hydrogen peroxide,at quoting newton merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.the district court should envision the form a representative trial of the claim will take and then conduct a rigorous assessment of the available evidence as well as the methods that the plaintiff proposes to use to prove his or her claim.see,id.at sherman am,civil action,wl,at.
however,the majority purportedly refuses to answer the basic question raised by jani king in its appeal whether franchise system controls make a franchisor the employer of its franchisees under pennsylvania employment test.given the rigorous obligations imposed by rule,i do not see how we could avoid addressing this basic question.the predominance inquiry turns on what pennsylvania law requires as evidence of employment status.in other words,could plaintiffs really show that jani king franchisees are,in fact,its employees under pennsylvania law using the jani king franchise agreement and other evidence common to the entire putative class if,as a matter of state law,controls that are necessary to protect the franchisor own trademark,trade name,and goodwill are,by themselves,not sufficient to make the franchisor the employer of its own franchisees and the common evidence in the record merely implicates such franchise system controls,the court then must determine that plaintiffs can not possibly show that each element is capable of proof through evidence that is common to the class,hydrogen peroxide,at.
in any event,the majority,despite its disclaimers,effectively answers this basic question in the affirmative.after all,it addresses at some length case law considering the contractor distinction under pennsylvania law,including two franchising decisions drexel union prescription centers,cir,and myszkowski penn stroud hotel.it then upheld the district court ruling insofar as it discounted a class certification opinion involving jani king op.at which held that it is likely that under california law,a franchisee must show that the franchisor exercised control beyond that necessary to protect and maintain its interest in its trademark,trade name and goodwill to establish a prima facie case of an relationship,juarez jani king of,cal.quoting cislaw southland,th,d.rejecting juarez,the majority instead held that,u nder pennsylvania law,no special treatment is accorded to the franchise relationship and that a franchisee may be an employee or an independent contractor depending on the nature of the franchise system controls.id.at.obviously,this opinion will be cited as precedent or,at the very least,as dicta for the proposition that,despite the nature and importance of the relationship,franchise system controls may by themselves give rise to an relationship under a variety of different statutory schemes,the wpcl,the pennsylvania unemployment compensation act,and the pennsylvania workers compensation act as well as the doctrine of vicarious liability.i further note that jani king now has the burden of defending against a class action and that this opinion will most likely lead to additional class action litigation against other franchisors.
it appears that the pennsylvania supreme court has not expressly answered the specific question of whether or not franchise system controls are sufficient by themselves to establish the existence of an relationship between the franchisor and the franchisees.given the nature and importance of the relationship,existing pennsylvania case law like drexel and myszkowski,and franchising cases from other jurisdictions,i predict that the state supreme court would answer this question in the negative 
franchise system controls constitute an essential aspect of the franchising mechanism.the pennsylvania supreme court has recognized that the franchise has evolved into an elaborate agreement by which the franchisee undertakes to conduct a business or sell a product or service in accordance with methods and procedures prescribed by the franchisor,and the franchisor undertakes to assist the franchisee through advertising,promotion and other advisory services.atl.richfield razumic,quoting piercing pagoda,hoffner.the franchisor basic product is the franchise itself.piercing pagoda,at citations omitted.product uniformity and quality control attract customers and are critical to the success of both the franchisees as well as the franchisor.see,queen city pizza,at piercing pagoda,at.in fact,a trademark owner risks losing his rights by failing to maintain adequate control over the quality of his licensees products.ungar donuts of,cir.citing.
this relationship thereby offers several important advantages to franchisors and franchisees alike.for example,the franchisee may benefit from existing inventory,training,and directions for market development,and,in addition,the creation and maintenance of goodwill through strict system controls should help to bring in more customers for the franchisee.see,id.at piercing pagoda,at.
given these characteristics,it is not surprising that the franchising sector represents a major component of the economy.nationally,this sector employs millions of people,has payrolls in the billions,and generate trillions of dollars in total sales.see,patterson domino pizza,llc,cal th,d.amicus international franchise association estimates that,in,pennsylvania had franchise establi
