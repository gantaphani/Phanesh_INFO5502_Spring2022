petitioners,comcast corporation and its subsidiaries,allegedly cluster their cable television operations within a particular region by swapping their systems outside the region for competitor systems inside the region.respondents,named plaintiffs in this antitrust suit,claim that they and other comcast subscribers in the philadelphia cluster are harmed because comcast strategy lessens competition and leads to prices.they sought class certification under federal rule of civil procedure b,which requires that questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.the district court required them to show that the antitrust impact of the violation could be proved at trial through evidence common to the class and that the damages were measurable on a classwide basis through a common methodology.the court accepted only one of respondents four proposed theories of antitrust impact that comcast actions lessened competition from overbuilders,companies that build competing networks in areas where an incumbent cable company already operates.it then certified the class,finding that the damages from overbuilder deterrence could be calculated on a classwide basis,even though respondents expert acknowledged that his regression model did not isolate damages resulting from any one of respondents theories.in affirming,the third circuit refused to consider petitioners argument that the model failed to attribute damages to overbuilder deterrence because doing so would require reaching the merits of respondents claims at the class certification stage.

comcast corporation,et,petitioners caroline behrend et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
the district court and the court of appeals approved certification of a class of more than million current and former comcast subscribers who seek damages for alleged violations of the federal antitrust laws.we consider whether certification was appropriate under federal rule of civil procedure b.
comcast corporation and its subsidiaries,petitioners here,provide services to residential and commercial customers.from to,petitioners engaged in a series of transactions that the parties have described as clustering,a strategy of concentrating operations within a particular region.the region at issue here,which the parties have referred to as the philadelphia cluster or the philadelphia designated market area dma,includes counties located in pennsylvania,delaware,and new jersey petitioners pursued their clustering strategy by acquiring competitor cable providers in the region and swapping their own systems outside the region for competitor systems located in the region.for instance,in,petitioners obtained adelphia communications cable systems in the philadelphia dma,along with its subscribers in exchange,petitioners sold to adelphia their systems in palm beach,florida,and los angeles,california.as a result of nine clustering transactions,petitioners share of subscribers in the region allegedly increased from percent in to percent in.see,ed.
the named plaintiffs,respondents here,are subscribers to comcast services.they filed a antitrust suit against petitioners,claiming that petitioners entered into unlawful swap agreements,in violation of of the sherman act,and monopolized or attempted to monopolize services in the cluster,in violation of.ch,stat,as amended.petitioners clustering scheme,respondents contended,harmed subscribers in the philadelphia cluster by eliminating competition and holding prices for cable services above competitive levels.
respondents sought to certify a class under federal rule of civil procedure b.that provision permits certification only if the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.the district court held,and it is uncontested here,that to meet the predominance requirement respondents had to show that the existence of individual injury resulting from the alleged antitrust violation referred to as antitrust impact was capable of proof at trial through evidence that was common to the class rather than individual to its members and that the damages resulting from that injury were measurable on a basis through use of a common methodology.at 
respondents proposed four theories of antitrust impact first,comcast clustering made it profitable for comcast to withhold local sports programming from its competitors,resulting in decreased market penetration by direct broadcast satellite providers.second,comcast activities reduced the level of competition from overbuilders,companies that build competing cable networks in areas where an incumbent cable company already operates.third,comcast reduced the level of benchmark competition on which cable customers rely to compare prices.fourth,clustering increased comcast bargaining power relative to content providers.each of these forms of impact,respondents alleged,increased cable subscription rates throughout the philadelphia dma.
the district court accepted the overbuilder theory of antitrust impact as capable of classwide proof and rejected the rest,at.accordingly,in its certification order,the district court limited respondents proof of antitrust impact to the theory that comcast engaged in anticompetitive clustering conduct,the effect of which was to deter the entry of overbuilders in the philadelphia dma.app.to pet.for cert.
the district court further found that the damages resulting from impact could be calculated on a classwide basis.to establish such damages,respondents had relied solely on the testimony of james mcclave.mcclave designed a regression model comparing actual cable prices in the philadelphia dma with hypothetical prices that would have prevailed but for petitioners allegedly anticompetitive activities.the model calculated damages of for the entire class.app.sealed.as mcclave acknowledged,however,the model did not isolate damages resulting from any one theory of antitrust impact,at.the district court nevertheless certified the class.
a divided panel of the court of appeals affirmed.on appeal,petitioners contended the class was improperly certified because the model,among other shortcomings,failed to attribute damages resulting from overbuilder deterrence,the only theory of injury remaining in the case.the court refused to consider the argument because,in its view,such an attac k on the merits of the methodology had no place in the class certification inquiry.the court emphasized that,a t the class certification stage,respondents were not required to tie each theory of antitrust impact to an exact calculation of damages.at.according to the court,it had not reached the stage of determining on the merits whether the methodology is a just and reasonable inference or speculative.ibid.rather,the court said,respondents must assure us that if they can prove antitrust impact,the resulting damages are capable of measurement and will not require labyrinthine individual calculations.ibid.in the court view,that burden was met because respondents model calculated prices regardless of the type of anticompetitive conduct.at.
we granted certiorari.
the class action is an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.califano yamasaki.to come within the exception,a party seeking to maintain a class action must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with rule.stores,dukes,slip,at.the rule does not set forth a mere pleading standard.ibid.rather,a party must not only be prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties,common questions of law or fact,typicality of claims or defenses,and adequacy of representation,as required by rule a.ibid.the party must also satisfy through evidentiary proof at least one of the provisions of rule b.the provision at issue here is rule b,which requires a court to find that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.
repeatedly,we have emphasized that it may be necessary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question,and that certification is proper only if the trial court is satisfied,after a rigorous analysis,that the prerequisites of rule a have been satisfied.ibid.quoting general telephone of southwest falcon.such an analysis will frequently entail overlap with the merits of the plaintiff underlying claim.at slip,at.that is so because the class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff cause of action.ibid.quoting falcon,supra,at.
the same analytical principles govern rule b.if anything,rule b predominance criterion is even more demanding than rule a.amchem products,windsor.rule b,as an adventuresome innovation,is designed for situations in which treatment is not as clearly called for.supra,at slip,at quoting amchem,at.that explains congress addition of procedural safeguards for b class members beyond those provided for b or b class members,an opportunity to opt out,and the court duty to take a close look at whether common questions predominate over individual ones,at.
respondents class action was improperly certified under rule b.by refusing to entertain arguments against respondents damages model that bore on the propriety of class certification,simply because those arguments would also be pertinent to the merits determination,the court of appeals ran afoul of our precedents requiring precisely that inquiry.and it is clear that,under the proper standard for evaluating certification,respondents model falls far short of establishing that damages are capable of measurement on a classwide basis.without presenting another methodology,respondents can not show rule b predominance questions of individual damage calculations will inevitably overwhelm questions common to the class.this case thus turns on the straightforward application of principles it provides no occasion for the dissent extended discussion,post,at ginsburg and breyer,dissenting,of substantive antitrust law.
we start with an unremarkable premise.if respondents prevail on their claims,they would be entitled only to damages resulting from reduced overbuilder competition,since that is the only theory of antitrust impact accepted for treatment by the district court.it follows that a model purporting to serve as evidence of damages in this class action must measure only those damages attributable to that theory.if the model does not even attempt to do that,it can not possibly establish that damages are susceptible of measurement across the entire class for purposes of rule b.calculations need not be exact,see story parchment paterson parchment paper,but at the stage as at trial,any model supporting a plaintiff damages case must be consistent with its liability case,particularly with respect to the alleged anticompetitive effect of the violation.aba section of antitrust law,proving antitrust damages legal and economic issues,ed.see,image tech.servs.eastman kodak.and for purposes of rule,courts must conduct a rigorous analysis to determine whether that is so,supra,at slip,at.
the district court and the court of appeals saw no need for respondents to tie each theory of antitrust impact to a calculation of damages,at.that,they said,would involve consideration of the merits having no place in the class certification inquiry.at.that reasoning flatly contradicts our cases requiring a determination that rule is satisfied,even when that requires inquiry into the merits of the claim,supra,at,and slip,at,and.the court of appeals simply concluded that respondents provided a method to measure and quantify damages on a classwide basis,finding it unnecessary to decide whether the methodology was a just and reasonable inference or speculative.at.under that logic,at the stage any method of measurement is acceptable so long as it can be applied classwide,no matter how arbitrary the measurements may be.such a proposition would reduce rule b predominance requirement to a nullity.
there is no question that the model failed to measure damages resulting from the particular antitrust injury on which petitioners liability in this action is premised the scheme devised by respondents expert,mcclave,sought to establish a but for baseline a figure that would show what the competitive prices would have been if there had been no antitrust violations.damages would then be determined by comparing to that baseline what the actual prices were during the charged period.the but for figure was calculated,however,by assuming a market that contained none of the four distortions that respondents attributed to petitioners actions.in other words,the model assumed the validity of all four theories of antitrust impact initially advanced by respondents decreased penetration by satellite providers,overbuilder deterrence,lack of benchmark competition,and increased bargaining power.at the evidentiary hearing,mcclave expressly admitted that the model calculated damages resulting from the alleged anticompetitive conduct as a whole and did not attribute damages to any one particular theory of anticompetitive impact.app.
this methodology might have been sound,and might have produced commonality of damages,if all four of those alleged distortions remained in the case.but as judge jordan partial dissent pointed out 
b ecause the only surviving theory of antitrust impact is that clustering reduced overbuilding,for mcclave comparison to be relevant,his benchmark counties must reflect the conditions that would have prevailed in the philadelphia dma but for the alleged reduction in overbuilding.in all respects unrelated to reduced overbuilding,the benchmark counties should reflect the actual conditions in the philadelphia dma,or else the model will identify damages that are not the result of reduced overbuilding,or,in other words,that are not the certain result of the wrong.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the majority only response to this was that a t the class certification stage we do not require that plaintiffs tie each theory of antitrust impact to an exact calculation of damages,but instead that they assure us that if they can prove antitrust impact,the resulting damages are capable of measurement and will not require labyrinthine individual calculations.at.but such assurance is not provided by a methodology that identifies damages that are not the result of the wrong.for all we know,cable subscribers in gloucester county may have been overcharged because of petitioners alleged elimination of satellite competition a theory of liability that is not capable of classwide proof while subscribers in camden county may have paid elevated prices because of petitioners increased bargaining power content providers another theory that is not capable of classwide proof while yet other subscribers in montgomery county may have paid rates produced by the combined effects of multiple forms of alleged antitrust harm and so on.the permutations involving four theories of liability and million subscribers located in counties are nearly endless.
in light of the model inability to bridge the differences between prices in general and prices attributable to the deterrence of overbuilding,rule b can not authorize treating subscribers within the philadelphia cluster as members of a single class prices whose level above what an expert deems competitive has been caused by factors unrelated to an accepted theory of antitrust harm are not anticompetitive in any sense relevant here.the first step in a damages study is the translation of the legal theory of the harmful event into an analysis of the economic impact of that event.federal judicial center,reference manual on scientific evidence ed.emphasis added.the district court and the court of appeals ignored that first step entirely.
the judgment of the court of appeals for the third circuit is reversed.
it is so ordered.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit 
justice ginsburg and justice breyer,with whom justice sotomayor and justice kagan join,dissenting.
today the court reaches out to decide a case hardly fit for our consideration.on both procedural and substantive grounds,we dissent.
this case comes to the court infected by our misguided reformulation of the question presented.for that reason alone,we would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.
comcast sought review of the following question w hether a district court may certify a class action without resolving merits arguments that bear on federal rule of civil procedure prerequisites for,including whether purportedly common issues predominate over individual ones under rule b.pet.for cert.i.we granted review of a different question whether a district court may certify a class action without resolving whether the plaintiff class has introduced admissible evidence,including expert testimony,to show that the case is susceptible to awarding damages on a basis.emphasis added.
our rephrasing shifted the focus of the dispute from the district court rule b analysis to its attention or lack thereof to the admissibility of expert testimony.the parties,responsively,devoted much of their briefing to the question whether the standards for admissibility of expert evidence set out in federal rule of evidence and daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,apply in class certification proceedings.see brief for petitioners brief for respondents.indeed,respondents confirmed at oral argument that they understood our rewritten question to center on admissibility,not rule b.see,tr.of oral arg.
as it turns out,our reformulated question was inapt.to preserve a claim of error in the admission of evidence,a party must timely object to or move to strike the evidence.fed.rule evid.a.in the months preceding the district court class certification order,comcast did not object to the admission of mcclave damages model under rule or daubert.nor did comcast move to strike his testimony and expert report.consequently,comcast forfeited any objection to the admission of mcclave model at the certification stage.at this late date,comcast may no longer argue that respondents damages evidence was inadmissible.
comcast forfeiture of the question on which we granted review is reason enough to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.see rogers united states,concurring in result w e ought not to decide the question if it has not been cleanly presented.the monrosa carbon black export,dismissal appropriate in light of circumstances not fully apprehended at the time certiorari was granted internal quotation marks omitted.the court,however,elects to evaluate whether failed to show that the case is susceptible to awarding damages on a basis.ante,at,internal quotation marks omitted.to justify this second revision of the question presented,the court observes that comcast argued below,and continue s to argue here,that certification was improper because respondents had failed to establish that damages could be measured on a classwide basis.ibid.and so comcast did,in addition to endeavoring to address the question on which we granted review.by treating the first part of our reformulated question as though it did not exist,the court is hardly fair to respondents.
abandoning the question we instructed the parties to brief does not reflect well on the processes of the court.redrup new york,harlan,dissenting.taking their cue from our order,respondents did not train their energies on defending the district court finding of predominance in their briefing or at oral argument.the court newly revised question,focused on predominance,phrased only after briefing was done,left respondents without an unclouded opportunity to air the issue the court today decides against them.and by resolving a complex and question without the benefit of full briefing,the court invites the error into which it has fallen.see infra,at.
while the court decision to review the merits of the district court certification order is both unwise and to respondents,the opinion breaks no new ground on the standard for certifying a class action under federal rule of civil procedure b.in particular,the decision should not be read to require,as a prerequisite to certification,that damages attributable to a classwide injury be measurable on a basis.see ante,at acknowledging court dependence on the absence of contest on the matter in this case tr.of oral arg.
to gain certification under rule b,the named plaintiff must demonstrate,and the district court must find,that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.this predominance requirement is meant to tes t whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation,amchem products,windsor,but it scarcely demands commonality as to all questions.see wright,miller,kane,federal practice and procedure,ed.hereinafter wright,miller,kane.in particular,when adjudication of questions of liability common to the class will achieve economies of time and expense,the predominance standard is generally satisfied even if damages are not provable in the aggregate.see advisory committee notes on fed.rule civ.proc,a fraud perpetrated on numerous persons by the use of similar misrepresentations may be an appealing situation for a class action,and it may remain so despite the need,if liability is found,for separate determination of the damages suffered
