opinion of the court 
plaintiffs,on behalf of themselves and former and current bus drivers and trolley operators the operators employed by defendant,the southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority septa,brought this class action under the fair labor standards act flsa,et,to recover unpaid wages and overtime compensation for work performed during morning inspections required before the start of each operator daily run.relying on our decision in vadino valey engineers,cir,the district court granted septa motion to dismiss on the ground that the flsa claim required the interpretation of provisions of three collective bargaining agreements the cbas between septa and the unions representing the operators and was therefore subject to those agreements grievance and arbitration provisions.because we conclude that the operators flsa claim does not require the interpretation of the collective bargaining agreements,we will vacate the order of the district court.
background 
pre run obligations 
this dispute involves two sets of responsibilities each operator must fulfill at the start of the workday prior to leaving the bus or trolley depots.first,septa bus operations rules and regulations manual has long required operators to perform a series of clerical tasks each morning the reporting tasks.these tasks include checking in with the dispatcher,collecting and punching passenger transfers,filling out forms and waybills,reading septa bulletin orders,checking daily detours and operating conditions,copying their run schedules,and determining and walking to the location of their vehicles.compl.at.the reporting tasks take approximately ten minutes to complete.accordingly,septa operating manual requires that operators report for duty at the required time and at the required location,in accordance with schedules set up in the employees particular departments and locations not less than ten minutes before the time the bus is scheduled to leave the depot.id.at.the operators allege that,even though they are compensated for performing the reporting tasks,this time is not included in the calculation of overtime.
since daily vehicle safety inspections became a federal and state requirement in,septa has also required that operators perform daily inspections the cdl inspections,which require them to inspect several items on each vehicle,including the braking system,lights,horns,doors,turn signals,wheelchair lifts,and pa system.id.at.the cdl inspections take approximately fifteen minutes to complete.the operators contend that septa fails to compensate them for these inspections,and that they must perform them off the clock.according to the flsa,operators must be paid times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked over hours in a given week.because many operators work hours a week exclusive of the time spent performing cdl inspections,the operators contend that septa failure to compensate them for this time results in unpaid overtime wages,constituting a willful violation of the flsa.
b.the collective bargaining agreements 
the operators and septa are bound by the terms of three separate collective bargaining agreements between septa and the city transit division operators ctdo septa and the transport workers union local twu and septa and the united transportation union local utu.each of the cbas includes a provision concerning compensation for time spent working prior to the morning scheduled start time.the cba between the ctdo and septa provides 
where an employee is required to report in advance of the scheduled starting time of one run or to turn in passenger receipts or to so report and turn in,and does so,hour will be added to the scheduled run time and the employee will be paid for the hour at the aforesaid rate.this hour will be treated as time worked for all purposes except in calculating overtime under section c.
the cba between the twu and septa provides 
the authority will pay operators required to report ten minutes in advance of and who are required to turn in receipts at the completion of said work one quarter of an hour per day for report and allowance.such allowance will not be included for the computation of overtime.
the cba between the utu and septa provides 
an additional allowance of of an hour per day will be allowed all regular operators for reporting time for preparation of their assignments it is understood that these additional time allowances should not be considered in the computing of overtime.
each of the cbas also includes broad grievance provisions,which,in sum and substance,require that parties submit to arbitration any dispute involving the application,implementation,or interpretation of any of the provisions of the agreements.
relying on our decision in vadino,septa moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the operators flsa claim is dependent on the disputed interpretation of the above cba provisions regarding reporting time,which,according to the cbas respective grievance provisions,require that the parties first submit the disputed issue to arbitration.on september,the district court granted the motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the operators now appeal.
ii.analysis 
the flsa requires that employers compensate employees working longer than forty hours a week for time worked in excess of forty hours at a rate not less than one and times the regular rate at which he is employed.a.the operators contend that time spent approximately minutes conducting the reporting tasks and the cdl inspections prior to the start of morning runs is compensable time worked for purposes of the flsa.the complaint alleges that septa violated section a of the flsa by failing to properly compensate the operators for this time and for failing to include this time in the computation of overtime 
the district court concluded,however,that the resolution of the flsa claim depends upon the interpretation of provisions of the collective bargaining agreements,which,in accordance with the grievance and arbitration provisions of the cbas,and the strong federal policy in favor of arbitration,must be decided in the first instance by an arbitrator.we disagree.
in barrentine arkansas best freight system,d,the supreme court addressed the distinction between claims arising out of breaches of collective bargaining agreements in that case,under the labor management relations act lmra,and those brought under the flsa.the court acknowledged that the lmra governs relationships between employers and unions by encourag ing the negotiation of terms and conditions of employment through the process,while the flsa reflects a different genre of statute,one which guarantees covered employees specific substantive rights.barrentine,at.the minimum protections the flsa provides to individual workers,including a,take precedence over conflicting provisions in a collectively bargained compensation arrangement.id.at.an employee right to relief under the flsa,therefore,is distinct from an employee contractual rights as provided in a collective bargaining agreement.id.at t he flsa rights petitioners seek to assert in this action are independent of the process.they devolve on petitioners as individual workers,not as members of a collective organization.the court noted that,when vindicating rights under the flsa,the statute enforcement scheme grants individual employees broad access to the courts no exhaustion requirement or other procedural barriers are set up,and no other forum for enforcement of statutory rights is referred to or created by the statute.id.at.
in some instances,however,an employee flsa claim is inevitably intertwined with the interpretation or application of a collective bargaining agreement.we encountered this in vadino.in vadino,an employee asserted two claims against his former employer a claim under section of the lmra,alleging that his employer breached the applicable cba by paying him less than the journeyman wages to which he contended he was entitled and a claim under the flsa,contending that his employer paid him less than one and times his regular rate for hours worked in excess of forty hours per week,because his overt
