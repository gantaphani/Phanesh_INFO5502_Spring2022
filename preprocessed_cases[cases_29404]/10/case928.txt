a class action suit was brought on behalf of white males who claimed to have been discriminated against in hiring by the milwaukee police department.the district court granted the defendants motion to decertify the class and having done so dismissed the suit because the class representative own claim was conceded to be moot.a properly certified class action survives the mootness of the original representative claims,but an individual action must be dismissed in identical circumstances,nelson murphy,cir lusardi xerox,cir,and this suit became an individual action when the class was decertified.the class representative has standing to appeal,however,united states parole commission geraghty,d,as otherwise the defendant in a class action suit could delay appeals indefinitely by buying off successive class representatives.parks pavkovic,cir susman lincoln american,cir zeidman ray mcdermott,cir.
the suit was filed in.culver,the plaintiff and class representative,claimed that the previous year he had requested from the milwaukee police department an application for employment as a police officer and had been told he could not have one because the department would not be accepting applications from white males until.he sought to certify a class consisting not only of other white males whose requests for job applications had been turned down but also white males who had somehow succeeded in applying but had not been hired because the department had changed the scores on the entrance exams to favor women and members of minority groups.the district court certified this broad class in.six years later,a different district judge,to whom the case had been reassigned,granted the city motion to decertify the class on the ground that the class was improper and culver not an adequate representative of any subclass that might be carved out of it.the judge then dismissed the suit,as we said,because culver claim was moot.
the class action is an awkward device,requiring careful judicial supervision,because the fate of the class members is to a considerable extent in the hands of a single plaintiff or handful of plaintiffs,when,as is not the case here,there is more than one class representative whom the other members of the class may not know and who may not be able or willing to be an adequate fiduciary of their interests.often the class representative has a merely nominal stake culver has no stake,and the real plaintiff in interest is then the lawyer for the class,who may have interests that diverge from those of the class members.the lawyer for the class is not hired by the members of the class and his fee will be determined by the court rather than by contract with paying clients.the cases have remarked the danger that the lawyer will sell out the class in exchange for the defendant tacit agreement not to challenge the lawyer fee request.blair equifax check services,cir mars steel continental illinois national bank trust,cir in re general motors.truck fuel tank products liability litigation,cir weinberger great northern nekoosa,cir.
rule tries to minimize the potential abuses of the class action device in two principal ways,first by insisting that the class be reasonably homogeneous.a sosna iowa,d,and second by insisting that the class representative be shown to be an adequate representative of the class.a amchem products,windsor,and,d harriston chicago tribune,cir in re american medical systems,cir.these are often and here related controls because if the class is heterogeneous,the representative is unlikely to be able to offer representation to all members,robinson sheriff of cook county,cir,in much the same way that if a collective bargaining unit is heterogeneous,a union will not be able to offer representation to all members free of any conflict of interest,and so a unit may not be certified for collective bargaining purposes unless the members have a community of interest.continental web press,nlrb,cir.one is not surprised,therefore,that the supreme court has disapproved the across the board class action,that is,a class action in which the class representative has suffered a different kind of injury from other members of the class.general telephone falcon,d.and falcon was a discrimination case,like this one.
the class that was originally certified in this case and has now been decertified was heterogeneous.milwaukee police officers who never received a form to fill out are very differently situated from those who received and completed the form and took the entrance test but were not hired because the test was scored in a discriminatory fashion.the members of the first set are more difficult to identify than the members of the second,since the city has no record of persons who request but are not sent application forms.also unlike members of the second set,members of the first,to have any sort of claim for which relief could be granted,would have to prove that they had the minimum qualifications to be hired.this is still a third members of the first set,unlike the members of the second,would not have to prove that the entrance exams were scored in a discriminatory fashion,because their complaint is that they were not even considered for employment.
these differences show that as the district judge directed,the previously certified class had to be divided into two classes.c b ortiz fibreboard,d williams chartwell financial services,cir,especially since culver,the class representative,is not,and can not be because the classes are mutually exclusive,a member of both.he is a member of the first,and so it would be passing strange for him and a violation of the rule of falcon,rejecting across the board classes to be considered an adequate representative of members of the second.gilchrist bolger,aff on this point,cir vuyanich republic national bank.these cases so held before the supreme court in falcon wiped out the fifth circuit favorable policy toward across the board classes.for that would require him to get into issues,such as the scoring system used by the milwaukee police department,that are inapplicable to his own situation.see rutherford city of cleveland,cir.another route to the same conclusion is that culver claim is not typical of the claims of the entire class,as rule also requires.a retired chicago police ass city of chicago,cir castro beecher,cir.
of course,the fact that a class is overbroad and should be divided into subclasses is not in itself a reason for refusing to certify the case as a class action.williams chartwell financial services,supra,at in re brand name prescription drugs antitrust litigation,cir boucher syracuse university,cir.culver might in principle,though not in actuality,as we about to see be an adequate representative of the subclass to which he belongs,and the lawyer for the class might be able to interest a member of the other subclass in becoming the representative of that subclass.kremens bartley,d in re brand name prescription drugs antitrust litigation,supra,at johnson american credit,and cir.but the lawyer has not tried to do that she insists that the class not be divided.
the district judge was justifiably skeptical of culver adequacy to represent even his own subclass.culver made only perfunctory efforts back in to obtain a job application,and shortly afterwards he obtained another job,with which he is content.having thus no interest in injunctive relief and not seeking damages either he admits that his claim is moot,culver not surprisingly has pursued the suit in a most lackadaisical manner.in the eight years that it has been pending,he has yet to identify any other members of either the larger class or his subclass.he has done nothing to move the case forward except file a flurry of frivolous motions to recuse the various district judges who have succeeded each other in the unrewarding task of shepherding this case.the least frivolous ground,though still frivolous,is that the current district judge former law firm represented the union that represents milwaukee police officers.the judge himself did not represent the union the firm did not represent the union while the judge was a member of the firm and the union i
