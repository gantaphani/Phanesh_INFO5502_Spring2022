costco wholesale corporation appeals the district court order granting class certification in a class action brought by shirley rae ellis,leah horstman,and elaine sasaki collectively plaintiffs.in the class action,plaintiffs allege that costco promotional practices discriminate based on gender.because we granted costco permission to file an interlocutory appeal,our jurisdiction arises under e.we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand.
this complicated case requires us to consider a number of issues relating to class certification.several of these issues have recently been clarified by the supreme court decision in wal mart stores,dukes,d.given this new precedent altering existing case law,we must remand to the district court.see associated builders contractors,curry,cir.specifically,we take the following actions because at least one named plaintiff sasaki alleges a concrete injury that is both directly traceable to costco allegedly discriminatory practices and is redressable by both injunctive relief and monetary damages,see bates united parcel,cir en banc,we affirm the district court ruling on standing.we vacate and remand the district court ruling as to commonality under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court failed to conduct the required rigorous analysis to determine whether there were common questions of law or fact among the class members claims.of the sw.falcon,d.instead it relied on the admissibility of plaintiffs evidence to reach its conclusion on commonality.we vacate the district court ruling as to typicality under rule a,because the district court failed to consider the effect that defenses unique to the named plaintiffs claims have on that question.hanon dataproducts,cir.we affirm the district court ruling that sasaki is an adequate class representative under rule a.as a current employee who continues to be denied promotion,sasaki has incentive to vigorously pursue injunctive relief as well as monetary damages on behalf of all the class members.hanlon chrysler,cir.however,we vacate the district court finding that ellis and horstman could adequately represent the class,because they were former employees and had no incentive to pursue injunctive relief.in light of wal mart rejection of the predominance test.at,the district court must consider whether the claims for various forms of monetary relief will require individual determinations and are therefore only appropriate for a rule b class.thus,we vacate the district court certification of the class under rule b.
factual background 
i.the partiesa.costco 
costco is a corporation headquartered in issaquah,washington.costco operates over retail establishments warehouses.these warehouses sell items ranging from groceries to electronics.within each costco warehouse,the management structure consists of a general manager gm,two to three assistant general managers agm,and three to four senior staff managers.a costco gm is responsible for the entire operation of his or her respective warehouse and earns an average salary of approximately,plus stock and bonuses.costco agms are second in command within each warehouse and earn an average salary of approximately,plus stock and bonuses.costco senior staff managers are divided into four categories front end managers,administration managers,receiving managers,and merchandise managers front end managers oversee cashiers,personnel,cart staff,and other employees who deal directly with costco members.administration managers manage administrative functions such as payroll and human resources.receiving managers oversee stocking of all incoming items from the receiving dock to the shelves.merchandising managers oversee lower level managers and are responsible for planning floor displays to maximize sales.
costco promotes almost entirely from within its organization.only current costco agms are eligible for gm positions.costco does not have any written policy explaining to employees the criteria to be considered for promotion to gm or agm,though candidates are promoted from a list of promotable candidates.costco does not have written guidelines explaining how candidates should be selected for the promotable lists and does not regularly inform employees about the existence of such lists.costco does not require that more than one candidate be considered for any particular opening or that a performance evaluation or any other documents be reviewed before a recommended candidate is approved.costco also lacks a consistent practice for interviewing potential candidates for gm and agm openings.costco does not keep records regarding the selection process.
costco employs a different promotion procedure for senior staff managers.costco fills the majority of senior staff openings by rotating managers among the four senior staff positions.this rotation is part of costco philosophy and,in costco opinion,trains and develops managers for future advancement by exposing them to different aspects of costco operations.like the gm and agm promotion procedures,costco has no written guidelines regarding rotation of senior staff managers.
costco hired shirley ellis as an agm in.prior to joining costco,ellis worked for nearly years in retail management,including five years as a general manager for sam club costco chief competitor.according to ellis,she left sam club,because she was actively recruited by costco and promised promotion to gm within a year.on the other hand,costco claims that it recruited ellis because she misrepresented herself as a star at sam club,when she had,in fact,lost her job for poor performance.
in ellis first year with costco,she transferred locations twice in order to further her goal of promotion to gm.during this time,several gm positions became available,but she did not learn of the openings until after they were filled.in,ellis transferred to colorado to assist her sick mother.according to ellis,a supervisor told her that it would not hurt her chances for promotion.after six months,ellis notified costco that she was again able to relocate anywhere as a gm.in,ellis sent a letter to her supervisors expressing a burning desire to help costco be successful and advance within the company,asking how the gm selection process worked,where she stood as a candidate for promotion,and what she needed to do to become a gm.
in october,ellis,while still employed with costco as an agm,filed a gender discrimination charge with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,alleging that she had been passed over for promotion to gm because she was female.ellis left costco in november.
leah horstman worked for costco for more than years beginning in.in,after years with costco,horstman was promoted to be a senior staff manager.by,horstman had rotated through the administrative manager,merchandise manager,and receiving manager positions.she had earlier worked as an assistant front end manager,but did not rotate to the front end manager position because of scheduling conflicts and her duties as a single mother with two young daughters.
throughout her career with costco,horstman repeatedly expressed her interest in advancing to agm and gm and questioned supervisors about the requirements for both positions.heeding the advice of a supervisor,horstman also transferred to a store and expressed a willingness to move from california to texas in order to become an agm.however,in her final three annual reviews,horstman indicated that her goal was to stay in a position similar to that which she held at the time for three to five years so that she could balance her family life and then to continue her advancement to agm and gm.horstman filed a discrimination charge with the eeoc in october and resigned in june.
elaine sasaki began working for costco in.sasaki advanced to become a senior staff manager within four years.she received consistently high performance reviews,and her gm first indicated that she was ready to be promoted to agm in.although sasaki offered to transfer to places as far away as hong kong,she was not promoted to agm until.sasaki is currently an agm in visalia,california.
since sasaki was promoted to agm in,she has not been selected for at least eight gm positions.she claims she was not aware of any of these openings until after they were filled.sasaki has relocated four times to improve her chances of promotion to gm.in september,sasaki wrote to costco director of human resources expressing her concern that she had not been promoted because of her gender.at least some of her concern stems from an incident in which she claimed to rebuff the advances of her regional senior vice president in a hotel elevator and was later told by him that he holds her to higher standards than other agms.according to costco,sasaki has not been promoted because both her performance appraisals and her identify areas for improvement.further,she has never ranked high on costco gm promotable list.sasaki filed a gender discrimination charge with the eeoc on march.she remains employed as an agm at costco.
ii.procedural history 
the eeoc dismissed ellis charge of gender discrimination,after which ellis filed suit in federal district court on behalf of a title vii class of all women employed by costco in the united states denied promotion to agm gm positions.ellis complaint sought injunctive relief,lost pay,and compensatory and punitive damages.her second amended complaint included horstman and sasaki as named plaintiffs.in august,plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification under rule b and b of the federal rules of civil procedure supported by numerous declarations,deposition transcripts,and costco company documents.plaintiffs also submitted the declarations of three experts in support of their class certification motion statistician richard drogin labor economist marc bendick and sociologist barbara reskin.drogin concluded that female employees are promoted at a slower rate and are at the agm and gm levels relative to their male peers.bendick concluded that female costco employees are in the senior staff manager,agm,and gm positions relative to female employees in similar positions at comparable companies.reskin concluded that costco has a pervasive culture of gender stereotyping and paternalism.
costco opposed class certification and filed employee declarations in support.costco additionally submitted declarations of its own experts,most notably,ali saad,a statistician and labor economist.saad concluded that women are not at costco and that any gender disparities,if they exist,are confined to two regions.costco offered additional expert declarations concluding that gender disparities,if they exist,are based upon factors such as women lack of interest in jobs requiring early morning hours.costco also filed three separate motions to strike plaintiffs experts,supported by costco expert declarations challenging the relevance and reliability of plantiffs experts analysis and conclusions.
on january,the district court filed a page order granting plaintiffs motion to certify a class.the district court certified a class that consists of all current and former female costco employees nationwide who have been denied promotion to gm or agm or denied promotion to senior staff positions since january.ellis costco wholesale.because the district court certified a class broader than the class requested by plaintiffs the parties stipulated to a narrower class definition that consists of all women employed by costco on or after january,in a warehouse including puerto rico who,at any time,have been employed at costco as a senior staff manager or agm.the class includes women who have been promoted to gm or agm since january.stipulation and order regarding class definition,class notice and for regulation of costco communications.
the district court found that all of the requirements of rule a numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy had been satisfied.id.at.it further found that rule b was satisfied,ruling that signed statements from the plaintiffs proved their predominant intent in filing suit was to recover injunctive relief.id.at.it dismissed costco arguments that plaintiffs claims for punitive and compensatory damages precluded such a finding.id.at.it did not consider the fact that two of the named plaintiffs ellis and horstman were no longer employees of costco at the time of the filing of the complaint in making its determination.
as part of its order,the district court ruled on costco motions to strike plaintiffs experts.id.at.the district court granted in part and denied in part costco motion regarding drogin,striking drogin conclusion regarding the average number of years required to reach agm because of the dates drogin used to conduct his analysis.id.at.the district court denied costco motions regarding bendick and reskin.id.at.
costco then sought leave to file an interlocutory appeal,alleging that the district court committed numerous errors by certifying the class.on may,we granted permission to appeal.
costco argues that the district court abused its discretion by certifying the class,because plaintiffs lack standing to seek injunctive relief.standing is a threshold matter central to our subject matter jurisdiction.bates,at.we review the district court factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard and review the district court determination of standing de novo.lozano v.at t wireless,cir.in a class action,the plaintiff class bears the burden of showing that article iii standing exists.bates,at.s tanding requires that the plaintiff suffered an injury in fact,one that is sufficiently concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical,the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct,and the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.id.quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d internal quotation marks omitted.plaintiffs must show standing with respect to each form of relief sought.id.standing exists if at least one named plaintiff meets the requirements.id.
in order to satisfy the lujan requirements,t he plaintiff must demonstrate that he has suffered or is threatened with a concrete and particularized legal harm,coupled with a sufficient likelihood that he will again be wronged in a similar way.id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.past wrongs do not in themselves amount to a real and immediate threat of injury necessary to make out a case or controversy but are evidence bearing on whether there is a real and immediate threat of repeated injury.id.internal citations,alterations,and quotation marks omitted.for plaintiffs to have standing here,the claimed threat of injury must be likely to be redressed by the prospective injunctive relief.id.
sasaki satisfies all aspects of the standing requirements.the parties stipulated class description includes female costco employees who have been denied promotion to agm or gm.sasaki has been denied promotion to gm.costco failure to promote sasaki a current agm to gm is a concrete and particularized harm,because the injury affects her in a personal and individual way.lujan,at.additionally,the crux of plaintiffs lawsuit is that the harm alleged is directly traceable to costco promotion practices and general corporate culture,which plaintiffs allege are discriminatory to women.see bates,at citation omitted.sasaki can also show that there is a significant likelihood that she will be wronged again in a similar way.see id.at.sasaki has been employed as an agm for twelve years.despite her expressed interest in becoming a gm,coupled with numerous relocations to avail herself of that opportunity,sasaki has been passed over for promotion at least eight times.because costco challenged promotion practices for gm and agm positions have not changed there is a likelihood that costco will continue to fail to promote sasaki.finally,if costco allegedly discriminatory policies are enjoined,sasaki claimed threat of being passed over for promotion due to her gender is likely to be redressed.see bates,at.
costco,nevertheless,argues that sasaki lacks standing because,as a current agm,she can not challenge the denial of agm promotions.this argument more appropriately addresses whether sasaki claim is typical of other class members,which we address below.sasaki status as a current agm does not preclude her from meeting lujan standing requirements,given that the purported class also includes women denied promotion to gm.because only one named plaintiff must meet the standing requirements,the district court did not err in finding that plaintiffs have standing.
the district court held that plaintiffs established all four rule a factors necessary for class certification.costco argues that the district court abused its discretion by finding that plaintiffs established commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation.however,costco does not contest the district court holding that plaintiffs established numerosity.
parties seeking class certification bear the burden of demonstrating that they have met each of the four requirements of federal rule of civil procedure a and at least one of the requirements of rule b.zinser accufix research,cir,amended by cir.here,the district court certified the class under rule b.
rule a requires parties seeking class certification to establish that the class is so large that joinder of all members is impracticable numerosity that there are one or more questions of law or fact common to the class commonality that the named parties claims are typical of the class typicality and that the class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of other members of the class adequacy of representation.a.
we review the district court decision regarding class certification for abuse of discretion.lozano,at.the district court abuses its discretion if its certification order is premised on impermissible legal criteria.id.citing moore hughes helicopters,cir.
the united states supreme court requires district courts to engage in a rigorous analysis of each rule a factor when determining whether plaintiffs seeking class certification have met the requirements of rule.falcon,at.the supreme court has also noted that the e valuation of many of the questions entering into determination of class action questions is intimately involved with the merits of the claims.the typicality of the representative claims or defenses,the adequacy of the representative,and the presence of common questions of law or fact are obvious examples.coopers lybrand livesay,d internal citation and quotation marks omitted.when considering class certification under rule,district courts are not only at liberty to,but must perform a rigorous analysis to ensure that the prerequisites of rule a have been satisfied.wal mart.at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.in many cases,that rigorous analysis will entail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff underlying claim.that can not be helped.id.here,the question of commonality overlaps with plaintiffs claim that costco system of promotion and corporate culture constitutes a pattern or practice of discrimination.
commonality 
costco challenges the district court finding of commonality,arguing primarily that the district court failed to conduct the required rigorous analysis and impermissibly declined to resolve numerous disputed issues of law and fact necessary to determine whether plaintiffs established commonality.costco argues that the district court erred by relying on the declarations of plaintiffs experts to establish commonality we agree.because the district court premised its certification order on improper legal criteria,lozano,at,the district court abused its discretion.we vacate its order as to commonality and remand for the district court to reconsider this issue consistent with our holding today.
to show commonality,plaintiffs must demonstrate that there are questions of fact and law that are common to the class.a.the requirements of rule a have been construed permissively,and a ll questions of fact and law need not be common to satisfy the rule.hanlon,at.however,it is insufficient to merely allege any common question,for example,were plaintiffs passed over for promotion see wal mart.at.instead,they must pose a question that will produce a common answer to the crucial question why was i disfavored.id.at see also id.at what matters to class certification is not the raising of common questions but,rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.internal citation,alteration,and quotation marks omitted.in other words,plaintiffs must have a common question that will connect many individual promotional decisions to their claim for class relief.
the precise standard the district court used to evaluate commonality is difficult to discern from its order.the district court began by citing blackie barrack,cir,for the proposition that in adjudicating a motion for class certification,the court accepts the allegations in the complaint as true so long as those allegations are sufficiently specific to permit an informed assessment as to whether the requirements of rule have been satisfied.ellis,at.it proceeded to note,relying on eisen carlisle jacquelin,d,that the merits of the class members substantive claims were generally irrelevant to its inquiry and that it should not inquire into the merits of the suit during the certification process.id.however,later in its order,the district court seemed to qualify its position by noting that it may consider the merits to the extent that they overlap with class certification issues,relying on in re initial public offering securities litigation,cir.id.after all this,the district court stated in its analysis of commonality,that t o the extent that the parties commonality arguments overlap with the merits,the court has evaluated all relevant evidence to determine whether commonality has been established.id.at.this statement mitigates the district court earlier erroneous suggestions that it may but not must consider the merits to the extent they overlap with the commonality issue.
at best,it was unclear what standard the district court used.regardless of whether the district court applied an erroneous standard,we take this opportunity to clarify the correct standard.as we explained above,the merits of the class members substantive claims are often highly relevant when determining whether to certify a class.more importantly,it is not correct to say a district court may consider the merits to the extent that they overlap with class certification issues rather,a district court must consider the merits if they overlap with the rule a requirements.wal mart.at hanon,at.
in wal mart,for example,the supreme court considered whether the statistical and sociological studies cited by the plaintiffs were sufficient to link the alleged discriminatory practice to harm suffered by the entire class.at.in that case,the alleged discriminatory practice was the exercise of discretion by thousands of individual managers throughout the country.id.the only evidence of a nationwide practice of discrimination was wal mart strong corporate culture that makes it vulnerable to gender bias.id.internal quotation marks omitted.however,plaintiffs expert was unable to show to what extent this was true it was unclear whether percent or percent of the employment decisions were based on this alleged bias.id.at.without some evidence of the extent of the bias,no common mode of exercising discretion that pervades the entire company and thus no common question had been shown.see id.at.
part of the confusion over the standard applied by the district court in this case stems from the fact that the district court addressed costco objections to plaintiffs experts in both its commonality analysis and its analysis of costco motions to strike.as the district court noted,the parties staged a battle of the experts over the issue of commonality.in its analysis of costco motions to strike,the district court correctly applied the evidentiary standard set forth in daubert merrell dow,d.wal mart.at doubting proposition that daubert did not apply to the certification stage.under daubert,the trial court must act as a gatekeeper to exclude junk science that does not meet federal rule of evidence reliability standards by making a preliminary determination that the expert testimony is reliable.kumho tire carmichael,d.daubert does not require a court to admit or to exclude evidence based on its persuasiveness rather it requires a court to admit or exclude evidence based on its scientific reliability and relevance.at.thus,an expert inference or assertion must be derived by the scientific method to be admissible.id.at.a trial court has broad latitude not only in determining whether an expert testimony is reliable,but also in deciding how to determine the testimony reliability.kumho tire,at.
however,the district court seems to have confused the daubert standard it correctly applied to costco motions to strike with the rigorous analysis standard to be applied when analyzing commonality.instead of judging the persuasiveness of the evidence presented,the district court seemed to end its analysis of the plaintiffs evidence after determining such evidence was merely admissible.for example,the district court stated that,although costco challenges the propriety of using aggregate data,such arguments attack the weight of the evidence and not its admissibility.ellis,at.therefore,to the extent the district court limited its analysis of whether there was commonality to a determination of whether plaintiffs evidence on that point was admissible,it did so in error.
plaintiffs introduced expert declarations to establish that female employees are promoted at a slower rate and are underrepresented at the agm and gm levels relative to their male peers female costco employees are underrepresented in the senior staff manager,agm,and gm positions relative to female employees in similar positions at comparable companies and costco has a pervasive culture of gender stereotyping and paternalism.costco offered its own evidence to show that women are not underrepresented at costco and that any gender disparities,if they exist,are confined to two regions of costco and gender disparities,if they exist,are based upon factors,such as women lack of interest in jobs requiring early morning hours,which are unrelated to costco culture and promotion processes.id.at.
as an initial matter,we agree that the district court was not required to resolve factual disputes regarding whether women were in fact discriminated against in relevant managerial positions at costco,or whether costco does in fact have a culture of gender stereotyping and paternalism.however,the district court was required to resolve any factual disputes necessary to determine whether there was a common pattern and practice that could affect the class as a whole if there is no evidence that the entire class was subject to the same allegedly discriminatory practice,there is no question common to the class.in other words,the district court must determine whether there was significant proof that costco operated under a general policy of discrimination.wal mart.at alteration omitted 
whether gender disparities are confined to only two regions of costco eight regions,for example,addresses precisely the question of whether there are common questions of law and fact among the putative class members.if,as plaintiffs allege,promotion decisions are based on the biased attitudes of the ceo and upper management,one would expect disparities in all,or at least most,regions.a disparity in only of the regions,however,would not show that discrimination manifested itself in promotion practices in the same general fashion,wal mart.at,throughout costco which is necessary to show commonality in a nationwide class.if no such nationwide discrimination exists,plaintiffs would face an exceedingly difficult challenge in proving that there are questions of fact and law common to the nationwide class.
the district court failed to engage in a rigorous analysis on this point.for example,saad,costco expert,concluded that any gender disparities,if they exist,are confined to two regions.the district court concluded that saad analysis was relevant and reliable for the purposes of commonality and that plaintiffs had not raised any significant challenges in this regard.ellis,at.the district court ultimately denied costco challenge on this point,however,stating that saad analysis has presented an alternative approach but it has not discredited drogin results or methods the evidence proffered by plaintiffs.id.instead of examining the merits to decide this issue,it appears the district court merely concluded that,because both plaintiffs and costco evidence was admissible,a finding of commonality was appropriate.
the district court applied an impermissible legal criteria,see lozano,at,and failed to resolve the critical factual disputes centering around the national versus regional nature of the alleged discrimination.accordingly,we vacate the district court finding of commonality and remand for application of the appropriate legal standard.because we vacate and remand,rather than reverse,the district court commonality determination,we also address the other rule a factors.
typicality 
to demonstrate typicality,plaintiffs must show that the named parties claims are typical of the class.a.the test of typicality is whether other members have the same or similar injury,whether the action is based on conduct which is not unique to the named plaintiffs,and whether other class members have been injured by the same course of conduct.hanon,at citation omitted.typicality refers to the nature of the claim or defense of the class representative,and not to the specific facts from which it arose or the relief sought.id.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
costco argues that plaintiffs can not satisfy the typicality requirement,because each of the named plaintiffs respective discrimination claims are subject to unique defenses.the district court,citing hanon,rejected this argument and held that as a general matter,individualized defenses do not defeat typicality.ellis,at.
hanon,however,supports costco position.in hanon,we stated that a named plaintiff motion for class certification should not be granted if there is a danger that absent class members will suffer if their representative is preoccupied with defenses unique to it.at quoting gary plastic packaging merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.we found that the named plaintiff did not satisfy rule a typicality requirement because his unique background and factual situation require d him to prepare to meet defenses that were not typical of the defenses which may be raised against other members of the proposed class.id.
costco asserts that it has unique defenses against each of the named plaintiffs.specifically,as to horstman,costco claimed defense is that,due to family reasons,horstman rejected rotation to front end manager and stated several times that she wished to defer her pursuit of promotion for three to five years.as to ellis,costco claimed defense is that ellis misrepresented her way into costco,lacked the costco experience of other agms,transferred to a market with limited promotional opportunities,and was disciplined for abusing subordinates.as to sasaki,costco claimed defense is that sasaki is not an outstanding performer and that costco expert has concluded that there is no statistical evidence supporting a claim that females are promoted to gm at a lesser rate in sasaki region.
we decline to express an opinion,in the first instance,about whether these defenses are typical of those that costco may raise against other members of the class or whether they are unique such that plaintiffs can not satisfy rule a typicality requirement instead,we hold that the district court misapplied hanon,and thus abused its discretion by basing its typicality determination on impermissible legal criteria.see lozano,at.we vacate the district court typicality finding and remand so that the district court may apply the appropriate legal standard.
the named plaintiffs must fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.a.to determine whether named plaintiffs will adequately represent a class,courts must resolve two questions do the named plaintiffs and their counsel have any conflicts of interest with other class members and will the named plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute the action vigorously on behalf of the class hanlo
