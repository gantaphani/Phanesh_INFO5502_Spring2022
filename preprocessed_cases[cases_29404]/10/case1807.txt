plaintiff,an attorney,is the named plaintiff in this class action suit.he was represented by the law firm where he works and by a second firm that serves as cocounsel with his firm in other cases.defendant moved to disqualify both firms based on a conflict of interest as the class representative,plaintiff is obligated to seek the maximum recovery for the putative class,but plaintiff and the firms may have an interest in maximizing their recovery of attorneys fees.
the trial court denied the disqualification motion.defendant sought review in this court by way of a petition for a writ of mandate.we issued an order to show cause why the trial court decision should not be reversed.the firm where plaintiff works then withdrew.the second firm did not.we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion to disqualify the firms because an insurmountable conflict of interest exists between the class representative and class counsel,on one hand,and the putative class,on the other hand.
background 
on january,plaintiff lawrence cagney filed this action on behalf of himself and others similarly situated,alleging that defendant apple computer,had collected excess sales tax from consumers in connection with a rebate program.the complaint alleges a violation of california unfair competition law ucl bus,et.in the prayer for relief,cagney requests attorneys fees under section of the code of civil procedure section.apple estimates that if it is found liable,each consumer would be entitled to.
cagney was represented by two law firms,westrup klick llp,where he works as an attorney,and the law offices of allan sigel,which serves as cocounsel with westrup klick in a number of class actions based on the ucl.
on july,apple filed a motion to disqualify both firms on the ground that their close association with cagney would allow them to maximize attorneys fees to the detriment of the putative class.in support of the motion,apple established that from to,westrup klick and the sigel firm had jointly filed class actions under the ucl other than this one in which an attorney from westrup klick or a relative of one of the attorneys was the named plaintiff.from to,there were three such cases,including one with four named westrup klick attorneys and the wife of one of them.
on july,the firms jointly filed opposition papers to the motion to disqualify.apple filed a reply memorandum.
by order dated august,the trial court denied the motion,stating,while the court recognizes compelling federal authority that would require disqualification on similar facts if this case were a federal class action,the controlling california authority does not appear to support disqualification.the trial court also stated t he issues presented by this motion involve controlling questions of law as to which there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion,appellate resolution of which would be of considerable assistance to the courts and counsel handling complex class and representative actions.
on august,apple filed a notice of appeal from the trial court order.
on september,apple filed a petition for a writ of mandate,challenging the same order.on september,we issued an order to show cause,established a briefing schedule,and calendared the matter for oral argument.we stayed apple appeal pending resolution of the writ petition.
on september,days after we issued the order to show klick filed a notice in the trial court withdrawing as counsel for cagney and the putative class.by letter dated october,westrup klick informed this court of its withdrawal,stating that the writ petition was moot as to it.briefing went forward with the sigel firm.having read the briefs and heard oral argument,we now reach the merits of the petition 
discussion 
we review a trial court ruling on a disqualification motion for abuse of discretion,and we accept as correct all express or implied findings that are supported by substantial evidence.however,the trial court discretion is limited by the applicable legal principles.thus,where there are no material disputed factual issues,the appellate court reviews the trial court determination as a question of law.a disqualification motion involves concerns that justify careful review of the trial court exercise of discretion.brand century ins.century ins.th,d,citations omitted.
if the trial court denies a motion to disqualify counsel,the unsuccessful moving party can seek immediate appellate review,either by petitioning the reviewing court for a writ of mandamus,asserting that the remedy by appeal is not adequate or by filing a notice of appeal from the order denying disqualification.a petition for extraordinary relief on the merits accompanied by a request for an immediate stay is preferable,because generally extraordinary writs are determined more speedily than appeals.the specter of disqualification of counsel should not be allowed to hover over the proceedings for an extended period of time for an appeal.reed superior court th,d,citation omitted.
as a preliminary matter,we reject westrup klick contention that its withdrawal as counsel precludes us from deciding whether its representation of cagney gave rise to a conflict of interest.notwithstanding the firm withdrawal,w e have discretion to decide otherwise moot cases presenting important issues that are capable of repetition yet tend to evade review.conservatorship of wendland cal th,fn,d.this case raises important questions about the rights of putative class members and the conflicts of interest that may arise in representing them.and those questions may evade review if,in response to a writ petition or an order to show cause,counsel for the putative class simply withdraws from representation 
disqualification of westrup klick 
the majority of courts have refused to permit class attorneys,their relatives,or business associates from acting as the class representative.the most frequently cited policy justification for this line of cases arises from the possible conflict of interest resulting from the relationship of the putative class representative and the putative class attorney.since possible recovery of the class representative is far exceeded by potential attorneys fees,courts fear that a class representative who is closely associated with the class attorney would allow settlement on terms less favorable to the interests of absent class members.susman lincoln american cir,susman,fns.omitted see id.at,fns,collecting cases.
in any class action there is always the temptation for the attorney for the class to recommend settlement on terms less favorable to his clients because a large fee is part of the bargain.the impropriety of such a position is increased where,as here,the attorney is also the representative who brought the action on behalf of the class,and where,as here,the potential recoveries by individual members,including representatives,of the class are likely to be very small in proportion to the total amount of recovery by the class as a whole.thus,p laintiffs may stand to gain little as class representatives,but may gain very much as attorneys for the class.graybeal american savings loan association.
for the same individual to attempt representation of the class as plaintiff and as counsel presents an inherent conflict of interests.because the financial recovery for reasonable attorney fees would dwarf the individual recovery as a member of the class,the financial interests of the named plaintiffs and of the class are not coextensive.if the interests of a class are to be fairly and adequately protected,if the courts and the public are to be free of manufactured litigation,and if proceedings are to be without cloud,the roles of class representative and of class attorney can not be played by the same person.turoff may cir,turoff accord,pope city of clearwater.
during settlement negotiations the putative class representatives primary duty is to ensure that class counsel does not sacrifice the interests of the class in order to maximize its own recovery from the instant litigation.the seriousness of the risk that class counsel would do so is reflected in the long line of cases which have prevented attorneys from serving as both class representatives and class counsel.citations.the risk recognized by these courts and inherent in having an attorney wear the hats of both class representative and class counsel is obvious ordinarily,class counsel stands to gain much more in fees from a settlement than any individual class member stands to gain from the settlement itself.if one attorney played both roles,he would be sorely tempted to sacrifice the interests of his fellow class members in favor of maximizing his own fees.
class litigation must be monitored by an informed and independent plaintiff and simply can not be left for the lawyers to manage.the court concludes that when putative class counsel are not monitored by an independent and informed client and when that counsel has taken significant action in the case without court oversight or approval,the only adequate class representative is a class member who is about the action and independent of its counsel.in re california micro devices securities litigation,california micro devices,italics in original.
in kramer scientific control cir kramer,the court was presented with the question may a member of the bar who is a plaintiff class representative in a class action designate as his counsel a member or employee of his law firm id.at.answering that question in the negative,and concluding that counsel should be disqualified,the third circuit court of appeals explained the very nature of this litigation,a class action for money damages,suggests the possibility that success,either by verdict and judgment or by settlement,would result also in a attorneys fee from the fund created for the benefit of the class.c ourts have long recognized the historic power of equity to permit the trustee of a fund or property,or a party preserving or recovering a fund for the benefit of others in addition to himself,to recover his costs,including his attorneys fees,from the fund or property itself or directly from the other parties enjoying the benefit.id.at.
a class action is a special type of legal proceeding.our inquiry becomes necessary only because an attorneys fee may emanate from an equitable fund,creating a possible conflict between the interests of the plaintiff class members represented by the class representative,who is an attorney,and the interest of the representative law firm in maximizing its award as attorney for the class.kramer,supra,at,fn.omitted.
w e can not agree that an appearance of an improper conflict of interest inherent in one partner dual role as class representative and as class counsel vanishes when his partner is substituted as class counsel.to argue otherwise is to argue against reality,against the vagaries of human nature,and against public impressions of the legal profession.thus,if one concludes,as we do,that an appearance of impropriety,at a minimum,ensues when an attorney class representative also serves as counsel for a class that may benefit from an equitable fund,substituting a partner as counsel will not suffice as an antidote.what we have said concerning substitution of a partner of the representative applies equally to substitution of an or office associate as counsel.kramer,supra,at.
we have concluded that no member of the bar either maintaining an employment relationship,including a partnership or professional corporation,or sharing office or suite space with an attorney class representative during the preparation or pendency of a class action may serve as counsel to the class if the action might result in the creation of a fund from which an attorneys fee award would be appropriate.kramer,supra,at see serrano priest cal d,fn,discussing common fund doctrine.
and in bruno bell d,the plaintiff,an attorney,prevailed in challenging a state statute on constitutional grounds and sought an award of attorney fees under section.the trial court awarded him in fees,but the court of appeal reversed,stating commencement and maintenance of the present suit was undertaken by plaintiff in pro.per.as a representative of the taxpayers of california.plaintiff stands in a position unlike that of counsel in any reported california case involving an equitable award of attorney fees for his services he purports to be representing himself as party litigant and at the same time claims entitlement to attorney fees for his services.
in kramer,supra,the united states court of appeals held that it was improper for an attorney to prosecute a class action suit in which he himself was named as plaintiff 
without questioning plaintiff integrity and assuming he acted out of the highest motives,we must nonetheless be cognizant that on occasion,ethical conduct of a lawyer may appear to laymen to be unethical.
we conclude that the appearance of impropriety in this case far outweighs the benefits of rewarding an attorney for his diligence in successfully challenging an unconstitutional statute.the attorney fee award was therefore void as against sound public policy.bruno bell,supra,d at,fn.omitted.
cagney attempts to distinguish the foregoing cases on two grounds.first,he asserts that the courts in susman,turoff,and california micro devices addressed conflicts of interest in deciding whether to certify a class,not whether to disqualify counsel.but conflicts that preclude class certification may also support disqualification.courts have held that disqualification is required where class counsel serves as the class representative or where a familial relationship exists between class counsel and the class representative.see,petrovic amoco oil cir,petrovic lowenschuss bluhdorn cir,lowenschuss zylstra safeway stores,cir,zylstra kramer,supra,barliant follett,barliant.
second,cagney seizes on kramer references to a fund and argues that kramer is limited to cases where attorneys fees would be paid out of a common fund,as opposed to direct payment by the defendant under a statute like section.but kramer has been followed in numerous cases without mention of a common fund.see,lowenschuss,supra,at zylstra,supra,at simms exeter architectural products,barliant,supra,at gocial independence blue cross.and in bruno bell,supra,d,the court of appeal followed kramer in applying section very statute upon which cagney would rely in seeking attorneys fees.see bruno bell,supra,d at.
further,disqualification under kramer and similar cases is based in part on one of the prerequisites of a class action the class representative shall fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.kramer,supra,at see susman,supra,at turoff,supra,at california micro devices,supra,at.that requires the class representative to monitor the conduct of class counsel throughout the litigation.armour network associates,d,italics added accord,scott new york city carpenters pension plan.
but whether attorneys fees will be paid out of a common the class ultimately not be ascertainable when a motion to disqualify counsel is brought or,for that matter,until the case is finally resolved by settlement or otherwise under cagney theory,then,disqualification would be based on a eventual source of attorneys may be largely unknown at the time disqualification is sought.see,ramos countrywide home loans,th,d the nature of this settlement agreement arose quite late in the game in this litigation history.a better safeguard for protecting the interests of the putative class is the ongoing supervision of an independent class representative.
in addition,given the possibility that any class action may settle,it should not matter whether attorneys fees are paid out of a common fund or by the defendant directly under section.although under the terms of a settlement agreement,attorney fees technically derive from the defendant rather than out of the class recovery,in essence the entire settlement amount comes from the same source.the award to the class and the agreement on attorney fees represent a package deal.even if the fees are paid directly to the attorneys,those fees are still best viewed as an aspect of the class recovery.lealao,supra,th at,d.
t he size of the class recovery is influenced by and therefore related to the size of the fee even though the fee is paid directly by the defendant and not out of the class recovery a defendant is interested only in disposing of the total claim asserted against it the allocation between the class payment and the attorneys fees is of little or no interest to the defense.lealao,supra,d.
even where the parties do not specifically agree to the amount of attorney fees,the defendant usually has a fairly good idea of the range of fees that will be sought and the approximate amount likely to be awarded.the value of the benefit a settling defendant is willing to confer on the through the establishment of a separate fund or in some other therefore invariably be influenced by the amount of fees it would be obliged,or estimates it would be obliged,to pay class counsel if it did so directly.lealao,supra,th at,d,italics in original.
it is well settled that the parties to a lawsuit may negotiate a settlement according to which the defendant makes a payment embracing both monetary relief to the plaintiff and attorney fees liability the device of a settlement is normally used in class action cases governed by a statute which,if the plaintiffs were to prevail at trial,might permit them to obtain substantial fees directly from the defendant in addition to the amount of any judgment.bowen southtrust bank of alabama.
in short,the prohibition against dual as class counsel and class not limited to common fund cases.the common fund doctrine,like section itself,is simply an exception to the american rule,which provides that parties to a lawsuit must ordinarily pay their own attorney fees.see flannery california highway patrol th,fn,d.under both exceptions,class counsel is entitled to the same thing reasonable attorney fees.see garabedian los angeles cellular telephone th,d common fund graham daimlerchrysler,supra,cal th at,d,section.
and although attorneys fees awarded under the common fund doctrine are based on a analysis,while those under a statute are determined using the lodestar method,t he ultimate goal is the award of a reasonable fee to compensate counsel for their efforts,irrespective of the method of calculation.brytus spang cir,see lealao,supra,th at,d discussing determination of attorneys fees under common fund doctrine and statutes id.at,d trial court may use amount of attorneys fees awardable under common fund doctrine to amount of fees awarded under statute ramos countrywide home loans,supra,th at,d same.
cagney effort to limit disqualification to common fund cases is not entirely without support.in phillips joint legislative,cir phillips,the court,in ordering that a class be certified,stated this court has adopted a per se rule that an attorney who is the partner or spouse of a named class representative is disqualified from acting as counsel for the class.this rule is directed at a particular ethical problem the potential conflict that arises when a class representative stands or appears to stand to gain financially from an award of attorney fees made out of a class fund.put simply,the cause for concern is that the class representative may be too generous with the class money in granting a fee to his own partner or spouse here the problem does not arise.any attorney fee granted in these cases will come directly from the defendants under a federal statute,and not from any fund created for class relief hence,the named plaintiff would never have the opportunity for overgenerosity.id.at fn.omitted.
but phillips has,for good reason,been limited to its facts.as stated by the eleventh circuit court of appeals in affirming the denial of a motion to certify a class i n phillips joint legislative,supra,the court upheld class certification where one of the three named plaintiffs was an attorney with the firm serving as class counsel.the court addressed itself to the narrow issue of whether the class representative may be too generous with the class money in granting a fee to his own partner or spouse.the phillips court stressed that this problem did not arise in its case,because any attorney fees granted would come directly from the defendants under a federal statute,and not from any fund created for class relief.
phillips is distinguishable from the present case.first,phillips is a civil rights case,not an action under the federal truth in lending act tila.throughout our legal history,a shortage has existed of plaintiffs willing and available to file civil rights class actions.the courts are thus,quite rightly,hesitant to deny class certification in civil rights cases.though the legislative history of the tila does indicate a desire to promote class actions,a tila suit is clearly distinguishable from a civil rights action.
second,in accordance with phillips,we recognize that no opportunity exists for the named plaintiff in this case to be too generous with the class money,for the main reason that the court,in tila cases,awards attorney fees.we are,however,concerned with the fact that where a named representative is also an employee of class counsel,that named representative may be more concerned with maximizing the return and with satisfying the needs of class counsel than he is with the needs of other class members.in answering questions of when to settle and how much to settle for,a named representative who is an employee of class counsel may arrive at answers which benefit not the class,but the class counsel.shroder suburban coastal cir,italics added.
similarly,in susman,supra,the seventh circuit court of appeals discussed the requirement that the class representative fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.id.at,fn,quoting fed.rules,rule a.the court stated we do not accept the argument that reliance on the court control of settlement and attorney fees renders strict enforcement of the fair and adequate representation requirement unnecessary.nor do we agree that a realistic approach to ensuring protection of absent class members interests places principal reliance on class counsel and the court.the law require s that representative parties adequately protect the interests of absent class members.the entire process of adjudication which is comprised of the class representative,class counsel,and the trial judge must ensure adequacy of representation.susman,supra,at,italics added.an informed and independent class representative is necessary to monitor class counsel at every stage of the litigation.see california micro devices,supra,at,armour network associates,supra,d at.
phillips should not be applied here for another reason it fails to take into account that class actions,like other civil suits,often settle,and the parties reach some form of agreement as to attorneys fees.see cohelan on california class actions ed,weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group.the settlement of a class action,including a recovery of attorneys fees,requires court approval regardless of whether a class has been certified.see dunk ford motor th,d dunk cal.rules of court,rules.the test used by courts in evaluating the reasonableness of a settlement an amalgam of delicate balancing,gross approximations and rough justice dunk,at,d requires that the trial court have unbiased input that only an independent class representative can provide.
thus,the oversight provided by the court at the time of settlement is in addition to,not in lieu of,the participation and supervision that an independent class representative should provide from start to finish.both levels of scrutiny are necessary to protect the interests of the putative class.j udicial oversight is not a realistic substitute for enforcement of the fair and adequate representation requirement.cohen bloch.and t he court task of overseeing the merits of a settlement or compromise of a suit is greatly facilitated by knowing that the procedures designed to assure adequate representation are carefully followed.kirby cullinet software.
as stated in a leading california treatise an attorney generally may not serve as both class representative and counsel for the class.the concern is that there would be an irreconcilable conflict of interest because the attorney might stand to gain much more in fees than any class member individual recovery.vapnek et,cal.practice guide professional responsibility the rutter group.
a prominent treatise on federal law has noted t he substantial attorney fees that may be awarded in some class actions may mean that at some particular when settlement discussions take attorneys interests and those of the class will conflict.in order to minimize the potential for this problem and to ensure that there is someone concerned only with the class members interests throughout the litigation,several courts have ruled that the class attorney can not be the named representative in this way the representative can watch out for the interests of the class should the attorney be blinded by more selfish motives.wright et,federal practice and procedure ed,fn.omitted.
nevertheless,cagney denies the existence of a conflict,contending that,under california law,an appearance of impropriety by itself does not support a lawyer disqualification speculative contentions of conflict of interest can not justify disqualification of counsel.dch health services waite th,d,italics added.canon of the american bar association model code of professional responsibility hereinafter canon provides that a lawyer should avoid even the appearance of professional impropriety.california has not adopted canon,either in the rules of professional conduct of the state bar of california or in the business and professions code but the aba code still serves to guide california courts,which have adverted to canon or the appearance of impropriety standard in a variety of contexts 
despite the many references to the appearances standard in our case law,and despite occasional judicial statements that d isqualification is proper to avoid any appearance of impropriety,there is no california case in which an attorney has been disqualified solely on this basis.invariably,canon has been relied upon to disqualify counsel only where the appearance of impropriety arises in connection with a tangible dereliction.hetos investments,kurtin th,d,citations omitted.
here,we are dealing with more than speculative conflicts and the appearance of impropriety cagney and westrup klick have placed themselves in a position of divided own financial interest in recovering attorneys fees versus their obligation to the putative class to maximize the recovery of monetary and other relief.this is grounds to disqualify westrup klick.see flatt superior court cal th,d,attorney properly disqualified where unable to give client undivided loyalty people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,cal th,d,same cal pak delivery,united parcel service,th,d same.
as stated by the eighth circuit court of appeals in affirming the disqualification of class counsel whose husband was a class representative the lack of a prohibition on the appearance of impropriety in the rules of professional conduct does not alter the underlying principle that an attorney owes undivided loyalty to the client.petrovic,supra,at,italics added.

in hale citibank,the court denied a motion to certify a class brought by plaintiff andrea hale because her husband,harley schnall,an attorney,had referred at least seven other cases to the firm representing her,heller,horowitz feit.the plaintiffs in the other cases included hale,schnall,and schnall mother and father.schnall had also assisted the heller firm by reviewing pleadings and briefs prepared by the firm.schnall and the heller firm ha d an expectation that when these cases were resolved and if they settled substantially in favor of the plaintiff s,schnall might be recognized for his contribution to the cases.id.at.
in denying the certification motion,the court stated whether these problematic arrangements violate new york state law or ethics is not before this court.whether lawful or not,however,they will inevitably cause hale to confuse her fiduciary duty to the prospective class with her interest in protecting and advancing her husband contingent financial relationship with the heller firm,which in turn is related to a host of extraneous considerations,including the conduct of other cases.given the numerous respects in which such interests could conflict,hale can not be relied on to fairly and adequately represent the proposed class.hale citibank,supra,at,italics added.
in jaroslawicz safety kleen,the court declined to certify a class where a close business relationship existed between the named plaintiff,david jaroslawicz,an attorney,and the law firm that represented him,pomerantz levy,even though jaroslawicz did not work there.as the court explained d efendants point to the fact that jaroslawicz has been represented by the pomerantz firm in previous class actions and has served as in at least other cases,including currently pending cases.defendants contend that the relationship between jaroslawicz and pomerantz levy amounts to a de facto partnership,as evidenced by the fact that jaroslawicz receives his compensation directly from pomerantz levy,and not the court,for cases in which he and pomerantz levy were.
defendants further assert that jaroslawicz interest in the goodwill of pomerantz levy creates a conflict of interest which disqualifies jaroslawicz from serving as class representative.thus far,jaroslawicz has received at least in attorneys fees from the cases in which he has been with pomerantz levy.jaroslawicz share of the attorney fees are not apportioned by the court rather,jaroslawicz receives compensation for his work directly from pomerantz levy.defendants argue that jaroslawicz future earnings create an impermissible conflict because of the fact that jaroslawicz cut of the attorney fees in the currently pending cases where jaroslawicz and pomerantz levy are currently will tempt him to put his counsel interests ahead of those in the class.
in response,jaroslawicz contends that he is neither a partner nor a relative of class counsel in this action,and he will not share in any fee award that class counsel may earn from their representation of the class.thus,there is no relationship between jaroslawicz and class counsel that would restrict his service as a class representative.jaroslawicz characterizes his relationship with pomerantz levy as members of the bar who from time to time refer cases to one another and serve as.a court may find a conflict of interest based on the relationship between the class representative and class counsel even though the class representative will not share in attorney fees from that case.jaroslawicz,supra,at.
t hat jaroslawicz is not in name a partner,relative or employee of pomerantz levy does not preclude a finding that jaroslawicz is an inadequate class representative contrary to plaintiff characterization of the relationship between himself and pomerantz levy,we find that serving as on pending cases describes an interdependent relationship.jaroslawicz,supra,at,italics added.
as a plaintiff in the present case,jaroslawicz maximum recovery is less than.jaroslawicz asserts that his lengthy prior history with pomerantz levy is irrelevant to the decision on adequacy of representation.he does not,however,address his present relationship with pomerantz levy.unlike the other class members,jaroslawicz has a significant financial interest in maintaining the goodwill of pomerantz levy.as a result,the financial interests of jaroslawicz and the class members are not,and jaroslawicz ability to fairly and adequately protect the class comes into question.we are thus persuaded by defendants arguments,and we find that jaroslawicz is not an adequate class representative.jaroslawicz possible recovery as a plaintiff is dwarfed by the fees that pomerantz levy could recover in the action.jaroslawicz,supra,at.
in susman,supra,the named plaintiff was represented by his own firm
