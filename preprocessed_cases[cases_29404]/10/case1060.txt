labor ready southwest labor ready is a temporary staffing agency,providing day laborers to businesses in need of labor help.the employees work for the businesses that require labor,but they remain employees of labor ready,which pays the employees,though not for time spent waiting for assignments at labor ready local offices,and not for time spent traveling from the local office to the businesses that need labor.labor ready also allowed employees to receive a paycheck or alternatively to use a cash disbursement machine cdm in its facility.the fee for using the cdm was one dollar plus any change from the paycheck amount less than a full dollar.
the underlying litigation 
plaintiff appellee jeffrey lee allen allen filed this putative class action in california state court in april.allen claimed violations of the fair labor standards act of flsa,et,as well as california wage and hour and unfair competition laws alleging that,inter alia,labor ready had illegally failed to pay employees for their wait and travel times,and had taken unlawful paycheck deductions by providing cdms and charging for their use.
margie bedolla,anthony allen,michael alvarez and tyler farmer collectively objectors appellants or objectors,are the plaintiffs in other uncertified class actions against labor ready pending in california state courts.the first of these was filed in september,and the other three were filed in november.the objectors suits raise similar wage and hour claims,and also meal and rest break claims that were not raised by allen.
labor ready removed allen suit to the central district of california.class certification was denied in that case.in march,the district court granted summary judgment to labor ready on all claims except for allen claims regarding labor ready use of cdms and related state law claims,which were remanded to state court after the district court declined to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction.allen appealed that ruling to the ninth circuit 
the settlement agreement 
the parties previously attempted two unsuccessful mediations,but while allen state and federal appeals were pending,the parties entered mediation a third time and were successful,leading to a proposed settlement in october.the parties then jointly moved to remand the case to the district court for settlement,and we remanded.
three key provisions of the settlement are at issue here.there was a gross settlement fund of million.from that fund,labor ready agreed to pay each class member who submits a claims form within days of the class notice for claims and for class members who used the cdms during the class period.there is no minimum payout and all of the money in the settlement fund not paid toward attorneys fees,administration costs,or to class members who submit claims reverts to labor ready.there was injunctive relief,whereby labor ready will shut down the cdms throughout california and replace them with an electronic paycard through which workers receive their pay daily without charge further,labor ready will provide training to staff regarding compliance with meal and rest break and overtime laws and committed to an audit to ensure compliance with those laws,and labor ready will post notices in its branch offices telling workers they need not wait in the office for work and provide business cards informing them of their rights under state labor laws.there was an agreement on attorneys fees for allen counsel the class counsel,under which labor ready would not contest an award of of the million common fund,million.
the settlement releases or forecloses all of the claims that allen asserted,or could have asserted,against labor ready,including meal and rest break claims that he did not make,except that class members who do not make a claim will not release any claims under flsa,and class members who opt out will not be held to release any claims made in the lawsuit for individual relief.
after preliminary approval was granted in april,notice was mailed to potential class members.under the terms of the class notice and the district court preliminary approval order,all objections,opt outs,and claims were required to be mailed by july,days after the class notice was sent.in response,people submitted timely and valid claim forms.thus,the labor ready maximum possible payout to the class is,assuming that every person who submitted a claim used the cdms and is entitled to the higher relief amount of.
upon learning details of the prospective settlement through communications with labor ready in their separate suits,objectors sought to intervene as of right and to intervene permissively in allen case.the district court denied their motion,but granted objectors leave to object at the preliminary approval stage.
after a final fairness hearing,the district court issued an order approving the settlement on august.the district court determined that the notice procedure satisfied federal law and due process.the order noted that the four objectors had raised concerns,but overruled them.the district court found that the settlement terms were fair,reasonable and adequate to the class,and awarded million in attorney fees,finding that figure of the common fund fair and reasonable.
objectors appeals of the denial of their intervention motion and of final settlement approval timely followed.
the settlement of a class action must be fair,adequate,and reasonable.e.we review a district court approval of a settlement for a clear abuse of discretion.see rodriguez west publishing,cir.a court abuses its discretion when it fails to apply the correct legal standard or bases its decision on unreasonable findings of fact.nachshin aol,llc,cir.
denial of a motion to intervene as of right is reviewed de novo,except for the timeliness prong which is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.chamness bowen,cir.denial of a motion for permissive intervention is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.blum merrill lynch pierce fenner smith,cir.
we affirm the district court decision to deny objectors untimely motion to intervene.while the district court did not explain its decision to deny the motion,we may affirm on any basis supported by the record,whether or not relied upon by the district court.hall am.van lines,cir.here,the objectors knew of the allen litigation,which had been ongoing for four years,for at least a year before they moved to intervene and had regularly asked labor ready about the status of settlement talks in allen case.a timely motion is required for the granting of intervention,whether as a matter of right or permissively.see arakaki cayetano,cir intervention as of right nw.forrest res.council glickman,cir permissive intervention.
objectors argue that under united states carpenter,a motion to intervene as of right can be timely even though an action has been pending for some time in carptenter,eighteen months when the intervenors act promptly after receiving notice of a proposed settlement that would not adequately represent their interests,cir.but carpenter involved a government entity not representing intervenors interests.id.at.its reasoning was grounded in the need to encourage the assumption that when the government is a party,the interests of others will be protected.id.here,the government is not a party.
we are not persuaded that objectors motion was timely,because the motion was filed after four years of ongoing litigation,on the
