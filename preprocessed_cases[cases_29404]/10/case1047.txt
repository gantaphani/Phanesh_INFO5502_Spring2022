the focus of this case is whether ford motor company sold the plaintiffs a pig in the when each of them purchased a ford focus.the answer to that question is complicated by a dispute over the interpretation of the song beverly consumer warranty act by the california court of appeal and whether that court decision is binding on federal courts in diversity cases.if it is,the consequence negatively impacts the trial court determination of the magnuson moss warranty act in this case.there is also a concern about the warranties,focused on whether the language written by ford is ambiguous.finally,there is the question of whether the record here can be construed to show reliance in favor of the plaintiffs when they admittedly did not read available materials about the ford focus.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of ford.we reverse.
background 
the plaintiffs,margie daniel,mary hauser,donna glass,and andrea collectively plaintiffs,brought this class action against ford,alleging that ford breached implied and express warranties and committed fraud in the sale of model year to ford focus vehicles containing rear suspension defects.plaintiffs purchased their ford focus vehicles from authorized ford dealerships in california.with each purchase,plaintiffs received a new vehicle limited warranty.prior to purchase,they did not research the focus or view brochures,websites,or advertisements about the focus.nor did they read the warranty,maintenance,or owner guides that came with the new vehicles prior to purchasing them.however,plaintiffs did speak to authorized ford dealership sales representatives about the focus when they made their purchases.after purchase,plaintiffs focuses required new rear tires for the first time between and miles.
plaintiffs allege that the focus has a rear suspension defect that leads to premature tire wear,which in turn leads to safety hazards such as decreased control in handling,steering,stability,and braking,the threat of catastrophic tire failure,and drifting while driving on wet or roads.ford allegedly knew or should have known about the defect through testing data,consumer complaints to ford dealerships,testing conducted in response to those complaints,aggregate data from ford dealerships,and from other internal sources.plaintiffs allege ford had a duty to disclose the defect but failed to do so at the time of sale.plaintiffs further allege that,had they known about the defect,they would not have purchased the focus.
plaintiffs instituted this putative class action against ford on november,asserting five claims violation of california consumers legal remedies act,cal violation of california unfair competition law,cal.bus.breach of implied warranty under california song beverly consumer warranty act,cal.breach of warranty under the magnuson moss warranty act,and breach of express warranty under cal.
after plaintiffs moved to certify a class defined as a ll individuals who purchased or leased any through ford focus vehicle in california and who currently reside in the united states,ford moved for summary judgment.first,the district court granted summary judgment on plaintiffs consumers legal remedies act and unfair competition law claims because the court concluded that plaintiffs failed to show reliance.second,the district court granted summary judgment on the song beverly consumer warranty act claims of plaintiffs hauser,glass,and duarte because the court concluded that they failed to present evidence that their vehicles became unmerchantable within the duration of the implied warranty.third,the district court granted summary judgment on the breach of express warranty claims of plaintiffs daniel and duarte because the court concluded that the new vehicle limited warranty did not cover the alleged design defect.finally,the district court granted summary judgment on plaintiffs magnuson moss warranty act claims because those claims depend on plaintiffs warranty claims.the district court also denied plaintiffs motion for class certification.in accordance with federal rule of civil procedure b,the district court entered final judgment.plaintiffs timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we review orders granting summary judgment de novo.clevo hecny,cir.we apply the same principles as the district court whether,with the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the party,there are no genuine issues of material fact,so that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.id.quoting bamonte city of mesa,cir.
plaintiffs raise three issues on appeal whether summary judgment was improper because the district court declined to follow a california appellate court decision that held that latent defects may breach the implied warranty even when they are not discovered within the implied warranty duration whether summary judgment was improper because the district court interpreted the language in ford express warranty that specifically references defects introduced into vehicles during the design process to exclude design defects and whether summary judgment was improper because the district court did not credit dealership omission evidence that plaintiffs submitted to establish reliance.we address each in turn.
