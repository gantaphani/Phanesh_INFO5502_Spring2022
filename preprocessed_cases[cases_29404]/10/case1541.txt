discussion 
the appellate court review of a class certification order is narrowly circumscribed.brinker restaurant superior court cal th,brinker.the decision to certify a class rests squarely within the trial court discretion,which is afforded great deference on appeal.ibid.trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting class action.ibid.as such,we will reverse a certification order only for a manifest abuse of discretion,the order is unsupported by substantial evidence,rests on improper criteria,or rests on erroneous legal assumptions.fireside bank superior court cal th,brinker,supra,at.
to obtain class certification code civ,the plaintiff must demonstrate the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the class members.linder thrifty oil cal th.under the community of interest requirement,the plaintiff must establish predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.ibid.
predominate questions of law or fact do not exist 
as noted,care homes required all new employees to execute an agreement waiving their right to uninterrupted meal periods.the issue on appeal is whether care homes was obligated to inform their employees they may revoke the agreement at any time.plaintiff argues care homes failure to comply with this requirement constitutes a general policy or practice violating wage and hour laws common among class members and establishes a common question of law or fact.we conclude care homes was under no such obligation.
the trial court held plaintiff failed to prove predominate questions of law or fact exist.as a hour residential care facility for developmentally disabled individuals,care homes falls within subdivision e of wage order.under subdivision e,employees may be required to work meal periods without penalty,provided the following conditions are met it is necessary to meet regulatory or approved program standards the employee eats with residents during residents meals and,the employer provides the same meal to the employee at no charge.plaintiff does not contend care homes failed to comply with the foregoing and,as a result,did not establish a general policy or practice violating wage and hour laws common among class members.
on appeal,both parties agree care homes falls within subdivision e of wage order,which provides the following,in relevant part 
e employees of hour residential care facilities for developmentally disabled individuals may be required to work meal periods without penalty when necessary to meet regulatory or approved program standards and one of the following two conditions is met 
a the residential care employees eats sic with residents during residents meals and the employer provides the same meal at no charge to the employee or 
b the employee is in sole charge of the resident s and,on the day shift,the employer provides a meal at no charge to the employee.
plaintiff argues the trial court erred by not holding,in addition to subdivision e of wage order,care homes is also obligated to comply with subdivision a,which permits employees to work meal periods by agreement,and to revoke the agreement at any time 
a no employer shall employ any person for a work period of more than five hours without a meal period of not less than minutes,except that when a work period of not more than six hours will complete the day work the meal period may be waived by mutual consent of the employer and the employee.unless the employee is relieved of all duty during a minute meal period,the meal period shall be considered an on duty meal period and counted as time worked.an on duty meal period shall be permitted only when the nature of the work prevents an employee from being relieved of all duty and when by written agreement between the parties an paid meal period is agreed to.the written agreement shall state that the employee may,in writing,revoke the agreement at any time.italics added.
the resolution of this issue turns on the interpretation of subdivision e of wage order.when a wage order validity and application are conceded and the question is only one of interpretation,the usual rules of statutory interpretation apply.brinker,supra,cal th at.in construing a statute,our fundamental task is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.county of fresno malaga county water dist.th.the statutory language itself is the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.wells learning foundation cal th.therefore,the first step is to scrutinize the statute words,assigning them their usual and ordinary meanings,and construing them in context.ibid.
