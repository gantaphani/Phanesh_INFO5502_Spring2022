in the underlying action,appellant juan rodriguez asserted putative class claims against respondent,for violations of the labor code,industrial welfare commission iwc wage order wage order,and the unfair competition law ucl bus,et.after granting appellant motion for class certification,the trial court granted motion for summary judgment on appellant claims,which relied on brinker restaurant superior court cal th,brinker.we conclude that summary judgment was incorrectly granted with respect to appellant claims relating to rest breaks,as brinker explained that under the applicable wage order provision,rest breaks in an shift should fall on either side of the meal break,absent factors rendering such scheduling impracticable.we therefore affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.

appellant class action complaint,filed august,contained claims under the labor code,the ucl,and wage order,which obliges employers to provide a minute meal period for a work period of more than hours,and rest periods accruing at the rate of minutes per hours or major fraction thereof regs,tit,a,a.the complaint first and second causes of action asserted that appellant had failed to provide meal and rest breaks.underlying those claims were allegations that had contravened wage order by failing to supply the requisite minute meal breaks and compelling employees to take a single,combined rest period the complaint remaining claims the third through seventh causes of action were for failure to pay minimum wages,overtime compensation,and wages due,failure to provide accurate pay statements,and unfair business practices under the ucl.the complaint sought compensatory damages and penalties.
in december,relying primarily on brinker,supra,cal th at,sought summary judgment or adjudication on the complaint with respect to appellant claims as an individual.requested summary adjudication on the first cause of action,contending that appellant always had been permitted minute meal breaks.also requested summary adjudication on appellant second cause of action,contending that practice of providing a combined minute rest period before or after the meal break depending on the shift was lawful.in light of the purported defects in the first and second causes of action,requested summary adjudication on the remaining derivative claims.
in february,while motion for summary judgment or adjudication was pending,appellant filed a motion for class certification of the complaint claims relating to the failure to provide rest breaks.after granting the motion for class certification,the trial court concluded that summary adjudication was proper with respect to appellant first and second causes of action,and thus granted summary judgment with respect to his entire complaint.on march,the court entered a judgment in favor of dismissing the entire action with prejudice.this appeal followed.
discussion 
appellant contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment with respect to the claims relating to the provision of rest breaks.for the reasons discussed below,we agree.
standard of review 
a summary adjudication motion is subject to the same rules and procedures as a summary judgment motion.both are reviewed de novo.citations.lunardi great west life assurance th.a defendant is entitled to summary judgment if the record establishes as a matter of law that none of the plaintiff asserted causes of action can prevail.citation.molko holy spirit cal d.generally,the party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact if he carries his burden of production,he causes a shift,and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th.in moving for summary judgment,all that the defendant need do is to show that the plaintiff can not establish at least one element of the cause of action for example,that the plaintiff can not prove element id.at,fn.omitted.
although we independently assess the grant of summary judgment,our inquiry is subject to two constraints.under the summary judgment statute,we examine the evidence submitted in connection with the summary judgment motion,with the exception of evidence to which objections have been appropriately sustained.mamou trendwest resorts,th,code civ,subd.c.the parties asserted numerous evidentiary objections to the showing proffered by their adversary.because the trial court did not expressly rule on the objections,we presume them to have been overruled.reid google,cal th,google.to the extent asserts an evidentiary objection on appeal,we discuss it below see pt.of the discussion,post.
furthermore,our review is governed by a fundamental principle of appellate procedure,namely,that a judgment or order of the lower court is presumed correct,and thus,error must be affirmatively shown.denham superior court cal d,italics omitted,quoting witkin,cal.procedure appeal.under this principle,appellant bears the burden of establishing error on appeal,even though had the burden of proving its right to summary judgment before the trial court.frank and freedus allstate ins.th.for this reason,our review is limited to contentions adequately raised in appellant briefs.christoff union pacific railroad th.
in view of that principle,the focus of our inquiry is on the claim relating to rest breaks.sought summary adjudication separately with respect to appellant meal break claim the first cause of action and his rest break claim the second cause of action furthermore,its motion for summary judgment insofar as it encompassed the meal break claim was predicated on the ground underlying the related request for summary adjudication.in granting summary judgment,the court granted summary adjudication separately with respect to the meal break claim and the rest break claim.because appellant does not discuss the meal break claim,he has forfeited any contention of error that summary adjudication was improperly granted with respect to that claim.wall street network,new york times th,yu signet th,reyes kosha th,fn.furthermore,as the parties do not dispute that the complaint other claims the third through seventh causes of action are derivative,the propriety of summary judgment with respect to them hinges on the existence of triable issues regarding the rest break claim.
governing principles 
appellant rest break claim relies on section of the labor code and wage order subdivision b of section provides an employer shall not require an employee to work during a meal or rest or recovery period mandated pursuant to an applicable statute,or applicable order of the iwc.in,the legislature created the iwc,which was authorized to regulate the wages,hours,and working conditions of various classes of workers to protect their health and welfare.industrial welfare com.superior court cal d,industrial welfare com.to this end,the iwc promulgated wage orders,which prescribe minimum requirements with respect to wages,hours,and working conditions for workers in a number of industries and occupations id.at.in developing the orders,the iwc collected evidence regarding working conditions,received recommendations and comments from affected individuals,and conducted public hearings.see industrial welfare,supra,cal d at.although the legislature defunded the iwc in,its orders remain in effect.murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th,fn.murphy.as a consequence,wage and hour claims are today governed by two complementary and occasionally overlapping sources of authority the provisions of the labor code,enacted by the legislature,and a series of wage orders,adopted by the iwc.brinker,supra,cal th at.those laws and wage orders are also subject to enforcement by a state agency,namely,the division of labor standards enforcement dlse.brinker,supra,at fn.
here,the propriety of summary adjudication hinges on the extent to which wage order permits an employer to combine the rest periods required during an hour work shift and provide them before or after the meal break.generally,w hen a wage order validity and application are conceded and the question is only one of interpretation,the usual rules of statutory interpretation apply.brinker,supra,cal th at.the task of interpretation is to determine the legislative intent,looking first to the words of the wage order,construed in light of their ordinary meaning and statutory context.gonzalez downtown motors,th.judicial construction that renders any part of the wage order meaningless or inoperative should be avoided.citation.id.at.when necessary to establish the wage order meaning,a court may consider a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citation.citation,quoting aleman airtouch cellular th.in this regard,t he dlse opinion letters,while not controlling upon the courts by reason of their authority,do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.citation.brinker,supra,cal th at,fn,quoting seymore metson marine,th,fn,disapproved on another ground in mendiola cps security solutions,cal th.

in brinker,our supreme court examined the timing of meal and rest breaks under iwc wage order wage order regs.tit,which is applicable to the public housekeeping industry,and contains provisions regarding rest breaks identical to those found in wage order.brinker,supra,cal th at fn.there,several restaurant employees sought class certification of their claims under that wage order for inadequate and mistimed meal and rest breaks.id.at.as the rulings before the supreme court concerned class certification,the court confined its determinations regarding the wage order provisions to those necessary to assess whether class certification was proper.id.at.
in order to decide whether the employees had offered a theory of liability regarding rest breaks suitable for class certification,the court examined two aspects of the duty to provide rest breaks imposed under the wage order.brinker,supra,cal th at.regarding the rate at which rest time must be permitted,the court concluded that the second sentence of section a of wage order defines the requisite amount of rest time as the number of hours worked divided by four,rounded down if the fractional part is half or less than half and up if it is more,times minutes.brinker,supra,at.
the court also addressed the timing of rest breaks to the extent necessary to resolve the plaintiffs contention that employers were required to provide a rest period before any meal break.brinker,supra,cal th at.the court rejected that contention,noting that the only constraint in section a of wage order was that rest breaks must fall in the middle of work periods insofar as practicable.brinker,supra,at.the court stated employers are subject to a duty to make a good faith effort to authorize and permit rest breaks in the middle of each work period,but may deviate from that preferred course where practical considerations render it infeasible.at the certification stage,we have no occasion to decide,and express no opinion on,what considerations might be legally sufficient to justify such a departure.ibid.
the court illustrated the contention defect by reference to a hypothetical employee working a shift,who ordinarily would be entitled to a meal period and a single rest period either the rest period must fall before the meal period or it must fall after.neither text nor logic dictates an order for these,nor does anything in the policies underlying the wage and hour laws compel the conclusion that a rest break at the mark and a meal break at the mark of such a shift is lawful,while the reverse,a meal break at the mark and a rest break at the mark,is per se illegal.brinker,supra,cal th at,fn.omitted.
in rejecting the employees contention,the court discussed a dlse opinion letter interpreting iwc wage order wage order,tit,which applies to certain occupations in the construction,drilling,logging,and mining industries the opinion letter addressed the extent of employer flexibility in scheduling rest breaks under that wage order.industrial relations,dlse opn.letter,at.responding to a hypothetical regarding an hour shift in which the employer provides a minute rest break at the hour mark,a minute rest break at the hour mark,a minute meal break at the hour mark,and no further breaks,the dlse opined that such a schedule would not comport with section a of wage order,absent truly unusual circumstances,as that section requires a rest break in the middle of each work period insofar as practicable.dlse opn.letter,supra,at.furthermore,responding to a hypothetical regarding the provision of one minute combined rest break in the morning or afternoon,the dlse opined that such a schedule is never allowed under ordinary circumstances.ibid.
in brinker,the supreme court focused on the dlse opinion concerning the first hypothetical the hour shift involving two discrete rest breaks prior to the meal break,which relied on language commonly found in the meal break provisions of iwc wage orders,including wage order.brinker,supra,cal th at.the court stated we have no reason to disagree with the dlse view regarding the scenario it considered,but that view does not establish universally the proposition that an employee first rest break must always come sometime before his or her first meal break.rather,in the context of an shift,a s a general matter,one rest break should fall on either side of the meal break.citation.shorter or longer shifts and other factors that render such scheduling impracticable may alter this general rule.id.at.
underlying proceedings 
we next examine the parties showings,with special attention to the evidence bearing on the issues raised on appeal.
in seeking summary adjudication on appellant meal break claim,maintained that appellant admitted in his deposition that no one had ever prevented him from taking minute rest breaks and minute meal breaks,as scheduled by furthermore,relying on brinker,contended its provision of a combined minute rest break complied with section a of wage order.argued that its shift schedules incorporated the requisite amount of rest time namely,minutes and that no statute or provision of the wage order barred a single combined rest period.also argued that practical considerations rendered infeasible the schedule set forth in section a.to establish those considerations,relied on declarations from randall turnbow,wesley turnbow,and nine employees.
according to randall turnbow,founder and chairman,work schedules had incorporated the combined minute rest break for over years,as it benefitted the company and its employees.the combined break arose from an informal agreement between management and employees,who preferred a minute rest break in the morning because it provide d them with sufficient time to cook and eat their main meal of the day,which they took in the morning.the combined break also increased productivity,especially in the paint and processing line departments.randall turnbow stated prior to each break,the painters have to clean out each paint gun and paint pot and the paint lines in between,and shut down certain equipment.then,upon returning from the break,the painters have to refill the paint pots and the paint guns and turn the equipment back on.prior to each break,the processing line employees have to finish all parts,coordinating completion times in a process that typically requires minutes,and then air dry the completed parts.these p ainting and p rocessing l ine efforts take approximately minutes at shutdown and more minutes at the after the break.the fewer times that the shop has to prepare for this hard stop which the combined break affords the easier it is for them to plan the jobs,and the more efficient it is for the production lines.
wesley turnbow,chief executive officer,affirmed that the combined rest break allowed employees working on the first shift largest shift to prepare their morning meal or purchase it from a food truck that arrived in the morning.he stated from my conversations with employees,i know that they prefer to have the combined break for this purpose.wesley turnbow also maintained that the combined break increased productivity for the reasons set forth by randall turnbow.
of the nine employees whose declarations were submitted,eight were assigned to a shift that began in the morning those employees stated that they preferred the combined break in the morning because it allowed them to buy a meal from the food truck and provided for a better rest.the employee assigned to the second shift stated that the combined break in the evening promoted productivity.all maintained that they were allowed brief breaks at other times,and that they had heard no employee complaints regarding the combined break.
appellant showing 
pointing to brinker discussion of the dlse opinion letter addressing the timing of rest breaks,appellant contended that evidence if credited failed to demonstrate the exceptional circumstances required to justify the placement of both rest breaks before the meal break brinker,supra,cal th at.furthermore,in an effort to raise triable issues regarding the amount of time workers needed before and after breaks,appellant relied on testimony from his deposition,during which he asserted that painters required little preparation for a break.he also submitted his own declaration,stating that while he worked as a painter on the first shift,w hen it was time for a meal or rest break,he and the other painters would unplug the air hose,take air out of the gun,switch off the spray boot and lights,and drain the paint back to the gun cap if there was still some in the paint gun.this process took approximately seconds at most.appellant further stated that as a supervisor,he monitored workers in all departments.he was unaware of any machinery or efforts that required nearly minutes to turn off or shut down and minutes to restart.the workers requiring the most time to prepare for a break were the one or two sandblasters on each shift,who needed at most minutes to remove their equipment.a few other employees required a minute or less to prepare for a break,and most needed little or no time.
aside from submitting the evidence described above,appellant vigorously challenged the credibility of the declarations submitted by,arguing that the employee declarations were procured under coercive circumstances and that wesley turnbow declaration offered a reason for the combined rest breaks not reflected in his deposition,namely,that workers required minutes to prepare for a break and minutes to resume production after a break.
we conclude that the trial court erred in granting summary adjudication with respect to the rest break claim.as explained below,under the circumstances established here,section a of wage order obliged to provide a minute rest break in the middle of the work periods occurring before and after the minute meal break insofar as practicable.the existence of triable issues whether the rest break schedule stated in the wage order was not practicable precludes summary adjudication.
rest break timing requirement 
we begin by examining the timing requirement in section a of wage order.that section,the basic provisions of which date back to industrial welfare,supra,cal d at,italics deleted,has long been viewed as part of the remedial worker protection framework brinker,supra,cal th at,quoting murphy,supra,cal th at.for that reason,it must be interpreted in the manner that best effectuates th e protective intent.brinker,supra,at.in construing the section,we must avoid needless policy determinations morillion royal packing cal th.
the first sentence of section a of wage order,by its plain language,specifies that rest periods should fall in the middle of work periods,insofar as practicable.as commonly understood,the term insofar as means t o the degree or extent that.black law dict.ed.webster third new internat.dict.unabridged.although practicable is closely related to the terms possible and feasible,the term ordinarily conveys that the thing so described is capable of being put into practice or accomplished,or alternatively,when the thing in question is practical in nature for example,a method,aim,or plan,that it is feasible.webster third new internat.dict.unabridged,supra,possible to practice or perform capable of being put into practice,done,or accomplished feasible black law,supra,reasonably capable of being accomplished feasible in a particular situation.
we find guidance regarding the meaning of the phrase insofar as practical,as it appears in section a of wage order,from morris williams cal d.there,our supreme court examined former welfare and institutions code section,which directed the administrator of the health and welfare agency to make proportionate reductions in the medi cal program welf,et to the extent feasible.morris,supra,cal d at.the court determined that the phrase to the extent feasible,as found in that statute,obliged the administrator to make proportionate reductions absent an adequate justification why they were not feasible.ibid.here,the term insofar as in the phrase insofar as practicable is equivalent to to the extent,notwithstanding any differences of meaning between the terms practicable and feasible.accordingly,in the context of section a of wage order the phrase insofar as practicable directs employers to implement the specified rest break schedule absent an adequate justification why such a schedule is not capable of being put into practice,or is not feasible as a practical schedule.as observed in brinker,under section a of wage order,employers are obliged to make a good faith effort to implement the preferred schedule,but may deviate from it where practical considerations render it infeasible.brinker,supra,cal th at.
although section a of wage order,does not describe the considerations relevant to such a justification,we conclude that a departure from the preferred schedule is permissible only when the departure will not unduly affect employee welfare and is tailored to alleviate a material burden that would be imposed on the employer by implementing the preferred schedule.as explained above,the wage order must be construed in a manner that promotes its protective intent brinker,supra,cal th at,namely,to safeguard employee health and welfare industrial welfare com.supra,cal d at.furthermore,a departure from the preferred schedule that is merely advantageous to the employer can n
