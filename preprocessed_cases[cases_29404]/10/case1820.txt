jonathan frieman and jan brice appeal from the denial of their motion for class certification in their action against defendant san rafael rock quarry,the quarry alleging nuisance and violations of the unfair practices act.bus,et.ucl.plaintiffs seek nonrestitutionary disgorgement of profits under the guise of a class action.we agree with the trial court determination that plaintiffs failed to establish that a class action would be substantially beneficial and affirm.
background 
plaintiffs jonathan frieman and jan brice are individuals who reside near the quarry they filed a complaint,on behalf of themselves and all those similarly situated alleging that since,the quarry has operated in violation of multiple zoning,mining,environmental and health,and safety regulations,codes and statutes.
according to the complaint and attached documents,the quarry has been operating on the tip of the point san pedro peninsula,adjacent to the city of san rafael since approximately.in,the former owners of the quarry submitted an amended reclamation plan pursuant to the surface mining and reclamation act of.pub.resources code.in,based on the amended plan,marin county adopted a zoning ordinance rezoning the property.since that time,according to the allegations of the complaint,the quarry has operated as a lawful nonconforming use that could not be enlarged or increased.
in,dutra construction company bought the quarry and increased the scope of its operations.in,the bay area air quality management district issued a violation letter to the quarry referencing a expansion that was accomplished without permits.in,the marin county department of public works issued a notice of noncompliance with the amended reclamation plan,identifying multiple violations,including increasing the depth of the mining pit,ignoring the identified date for termination of mining,and a significant increase in truck traffic.subsequent investigations by marin county and the city of san rafael revealed additional municipal code violations by the quarry including construction without building permits of several structures and violation of air quality standards.
in june of,the marin county grand jury issued its report regarding the county government handling of complaints about the quarry the report was critical of the county inaction in response to what it termed as a long history of public complaints about dust,noise,blasting and truck traffic.a part of the grand jury list of recommended actions included a recommendation that the district attorney institute a nuisance abatement action against the quarry.
plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint against the quarry for damages,injunction and restitution on january.the first cause of action of the complaint alleged that the substantial expansion of the quarry activities in violation of various state and local laws and regulations is an unlawful business practice under the ucl.the second cause of action alleged that the same activity constitutes a public nuisance within the meaning of civil code section 
the quarry answered the complaint,denied the allegations and alleged that it had operated as a grandfathered vested nonconforming use since,with no limits on its operations.in april of,the complaint was consolidated for purposes of discovery and pretrial determinations with actions brought by the state of california,the county of marin and an individual plaintiff against the quarry.
on july,plaintiffs in this case filed a motion for class certification.a declaration filed in support of the motion for certification stated that the quarry profited from its noncompliance with the law by increasing the depth of its mine pit,increasing the amount of ore removed by truck rather than barge,and by constructing office space without permits.in their motion for certification,plaintiffs described class a,based on the ucl,as follows all persons who are or have been legal residents for at least days duration within marin county,california,and reside or did reside in an area within five square miles of the quarry,and point san pedro road since september.this class would share equally in the disgorgement of profits that the quarry realized from its with the marin county amended reclamation plan and violations of various zoning and health and safety code regulations.this equitable remedy is sought under section.class b had a similar description,but sought and economic damages based upon allegations of public nuisance for annoyance,inconvenience,and discomfort.
on november,following briefing and argument,the trial court issued its order denying the motion.as to class a,the trial court order stated several reasons for the denial of class certification.first,the court found that plaintiffs failed to show that the class approach would be beneficial.the second reason was that the proposed class members did not have claims for restitution within the meaning of cortez purolator air filtration products,cal th,d,cortez.the trial court distinguished corbett superior court th,d corbett because the prospective class members in that case actually bought vehicles from the defendant,and were entitled to traditional restitution under the ucl.the court also ruled that plaintiffs had not shown the need for a class action to pursue only injunctive relief.as to class b,the court found that common questions of law or fact did not predominate.plaintiffs appealed.
discussion 
plaintiffs argue that the trial court improperly relied on an incorrect legal theory regarding class certification of their ucl claim.they contend that the trial court misread cortez and corbett and based its ruling on the mistaken theory that the remedy of nonrestitutionary disgorgement of profits is never available in a ucl action,even when properly certified as a class action.plaintiffs also claim that the court failed to recognize that common issues of law and fact predominate in the public nuisance class.
we determine that the trial court used appropriate factual criteria and legal assumptions in ruling on the certification motion and affirm for the following reasons.
standard of review and class action requirements 
the denial of certification to an entire class is an appealable order citations,but in the absence of other error,a trial court ruling supported by substantial evidence generally will not be disturbed unless improper criteria were used citation or erroneous legal assumptions were made citation citation.under this standard,an order based upon improper criteria or incorrect assumptions calls for reversal even though there may be substantial evidence to support the court order.citations.accordingly,we must examine the trial court reasons for denying class certification.any valid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.citation.linder thrifty oil cal th,d.
the necessary prerequisites for certification of a class are outlined in the code of civil procedure,as explained by our supreme court.class actions are authorized in california when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court code civ.the party seeking certification as a class representative must establish the existence of an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the class members.citation.the community of interest requirement embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.richmond dart industries,cal d.
despite the supreme court support of the procedural device of class actions,the court has remained mindful of the accompanying dangers of injustice and of the limited scope within which these suits serve beneficial purposes and has consistently admonished trial courts to carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and to allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the courts.citations.city of san jose superior court cal d,city of san jose.the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that substantial benefits will result from class certification.washington mutual bank superior court cal th,d.
plaintiffs failure to show substantial benefit from class certification 
plaintiffs claim that the trial court denial of class certification of the ucl class was based on an incorrect legal theory regarding the available remedy.they rely primarily on kraus trinity management services,cal th,d,kraus and corbett,supra,th,d,to argue that nonrestitutionary disgorgement is available to plaintiffs in a ucl class action under the necessary to prevent prong of the ucl plaintiffs contend that the trial court reliance on cortez,supra,cal th,d,betrays a misunderstanding of their claim because cortez concerned restitution and plaintiffs do not seek restitution they argue that kraus,rather than cortez is the applicable case and that according to kraus,nonrestitutionary disgorgement is available in a class action based on the ucl.
plaintiffs argument puts the cart before the proverbial steed.before they may address the availability of a particular remedy,plaintiffs must establish that the purported class action is appropriate for certification.they failed to make that showing.we do not read the trial court comments as necessarily denying the existence of the remedy of disgorgement in a properly certified class action,but as a determination that plaintiffs here failed to carry their burden of establishing the prerequisites for a certifiable class.massachusetts mutual life ins.superior court th,d.the court was saying that by itself,the desire to obtain nonrestitutionary disgorgement is not a sufficient showing that a class action is more beneficial than a representative action under the ucl,particularly when the proposed class members have no individual claims for restitution.
contrary to plaintiffs argument,the corbett court did not hold that the mere desire to obtain disgorgement of profits supports class certification without an appropriate showing.the court in corbett specified where a class has properly been certified,a plaintiff in a ucl action may seek disgorgement of unlawful profits into a fluid recovery fund.corbett,supra,th at,d,italics added.even according to corbett,a desire for a particular remedy is not itself a reason for certification.in addition,plaintiffs in corbett had individual claims for restitution,as they had paid the allegedly illegal interest fees for cars purchased from defendant car dealer and financed by defendant bank.id.at,fn,d.their class action sought a fluid recovery for disgorgement of moneys that had a nexus to restitutionary damages,a factor not present in this case.they thus sought disgorgement of the illegally obtained funds into a fluid recovery fund as authorized by code of civil procedure section 
the fact that plaintiffs in a proposed class action have individual claims for return of funds that may be redressed in the class proceeding is a factor to consider in granting certification of the class.on the other hand,when the members of a proposed class have no individual monetary loss that may be redressed by disgorgement,that factor may weigh against class treatment.blue chip stamps superior court cal d,blue chip stamps unavailability of damages for class members is factor in considering group action.the trial court comment about corbett merely recognized this distinction.
disgorgement of profits sought by claimants with no ownership interest in the funds was considered for the first time in korea supply lockheed martin cal th,d,korea supply,where the supreme court noted a distinction between two types of disgorgement.the court clarified its discussion in kraus,stating that disgorgement is a broader remedy than restitution,but that disgorgement may have an element of restitution.thus,disgorgement may refer to a surrender of all money obtained by a defendant,even though not all is to be restored to the persons from whom it was obtained but the term disgorgement has also been used to refer to surrender of all profits earned as a result of an unfair business practice regardless of whether those profits represent money taken directly from persons who were victims of the unfair practice.korea supply,supra,at,d.the court in korea supply stated w e held in kraus that while restitution was an available remedy under the ucl,disgorgement of money obtained through an unfair business practice is an available remedy in a representative action only to the extent that it constitutes restitution.ibid.the court distinguished its prior ucl cases that discussed the remedy of disgorgement as referring to the restitutionary form of disgorgement,and not to the nonrestitutionary type sought here id.at,d.the court confirmed this court has never approved of nonrestitutionary disgorgement of profits as a remedy under the ucl.ibid.
the issue of the availability of nonrestitutionary disgorgement in a properly certified ucl class action was not resolved by any of the cited cases.the trial court mention of cortez and its distinguishing of corbett merely noted the distinction between the two types of disgorgement and did not signal reliance on an incorrect legal theory.
regardless of the correct resolution of the issue of remedy,we do not need to determine whether nonrestitutionary disgorgement such as is sought here,is ever available in a properly certified class action,because this case has not been shown to be a properly certifiable class action.plaintiffs failed to show that substantial benefits would accrue to the litigants or the courts from class treatment.
at the hearing on the motion to certify the class in this case,counsel for one plaintiff candidly admitted that the only benefit of a class action over a representative ucl action was the opportunity to obtain fluid fund recovery,based on kraus,supra,cal th,d.counsel admitted d isgorgement of profits is our only remedy other than injunctive relief.plaintiffs made no showing of any other benefit from treating this action as a class action.
plaintiffs argue that forcing the quarry to turn over all profits made during the period that it was in violation of the various environmental and building regulations would be an effective way to prevent future violations under the necessary to prevent prong of the ucl.while that may be true,it is not dispositive.our supreme court has stated that w hile termination of a defendant alleged wrongdoing is a factor to be considered citation it does not warrant group action for damage when the members will not recover damage,and when a simpler remedy such as mandate is available.blue chip stamps,supra,cal d at.
the overarching legislative concern in establishing the ucl was to provide a streamlined procedure to prevent unfair competition.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.a plaintiff seeking the more burdensome route of class certification of the ucl claim must establish an advantage to proceeding as a class action.dean witter reynolds,superior court d.the trial court must weigh the advantages of the cumbersome and potentially expensive class action mechanism against the streamlined procedure available in a representative suit under the ucl.see,corbett,supra,th at,d dis.opn.of haerle,enumerating specific differences between class actions and representative ucl actions see also cohelan on california class actions,class actions are procedurally complex,can be expensive,may proceed slowly,be more time consuming,and must be resolved in manner that precludes attention to the idiosyncratic nature of individual claims.
here,plaintiffs can use the streamlined provisions of the ucl to obtain an injunction against the quarry illegal acts.that streamlined procedure,tailored to allow an expeditious remedy for terminating unfair competition,is the purpose of the ucl.plaintiffs made no showing of substantial benefit to the proposed class,aside from their hope of obtaining a remedy that the ucl does not provide in a representative action.class actions are provided only as a means to enforce substantive law.altering the substantive law to accommodate procedure would be to confuse the means with the sacrifice the goal for the going.city of san jose,supra,
