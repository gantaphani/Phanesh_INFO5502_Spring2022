before us are orders certifying class actions in two jailhouse strip search cases.the two cases,arising before two different judges in the same court judges carter and hornby,are targeted at two different maine counties knox and york.in each case,a named plaintiff seeks to represent others who it is alleged were improperly strip searched.following certification of the classes,we allowed interlocutory appeals and now affirm.
over the last few decades,a changed popular sensibility has produced a series of decisions curtailing what was once an apparently routine practice in many jails of strip searching arrestees not yet convicted of any crime such cases have included,or brought in their wake,lawsuits by those who were searched seeking damages from officials or governmental entities responsible for the searches,miller kennebec county,cir.these suits are ordinarily framed as fourth amendment claims for unconstitutional search and seizure and brought under.id.

in the first case before against knox county,its sheriff,and unidentified tardiff filed such a section claim,asserting that she had been arrested for witness tampering after having been previously charged with violating an order.tardiff knox county.at the jail house,tardiff alleged that she was taken to a shower area,ordered by a female corrections officer to disrobe,and required to squat and cough while the officer could see her vagina and anal area.id.
judge carter,presiding in the case,called this a strip and visual body cavity search,tardiff,at judge hornby,faced with a similar description by the lead plaintiff in a parallel suit against york county,called the same thing a strip search,nilsen york county.for simplicity sake,we use strip search in this decision to cover the described conduct,recognizing that the phrase is used variously in different decisions and that there is a spectrum of possible search practices inflicting differing indignities.just what happened to tardiff and others may itself be disputed.
tardiff sought to represent a class of persons similarly situated and in due course judge carter certified a class under.b.tardiff,at.the class,as defined by the court,covered 
all people who after november,were subjected to a strip search visual body cavity search without evaluation for individualized reasonable suspicion while being held at the knox county jail 
after having been arrested on charges that did not involve a weapon,drugs,or a violent felony or 
while waiting for bail to be set on charges that did not involve a weapon,drugs,or a violent felony or 
while waiting for an initial court appearance on charges that did not involve a weapon,drugs,or a violent felony or 
after having been arrested on a warrant that did not involve a weapon,drugs,or a violent felony.
in the second case,brought before judge hornby,a substitute lead arrested for failing to report for probation and he alleges was strip searched with the same strip,squat and cough procedure as tardiff.nilsen at.like tardiff,he alleged that this was done in accordance with a policy or custom of the county that was applied widely to arrestees including those charged with unthreatening offenses.judge hornby,acting shortly after judge carter,entered a comparable order certifying a class under rule b.id.at 
in each case,the defendants sought interlocutory review of the class certification.we have discretion as to whether to entertain such an appeal.see.f and advisory committee note to subdivision f.one reason for review is a threat of liability so large as to place on the defendant an irresistible pressure to settle.waste mgmt.holdings,mowbray,cir.although we thought it quite possible that the certification orders would survive review,the financial and similar information provided by the two counties in this case persuaded us to grant interlocutory review,which we expedited.
nominally,review of decisions granting or denying class certification is for abuse of discretion,smilow bell mobile,cir,but this chameleon phrase is misleading.express standards for certification are contained in rule,so an appeal can pose pure issues of law reviewed de novo or occasionally raw fact findings that are rarely disturbed.see id.here,we are concerned with applying general standards to particular facts where the touchstone is reasonableness and review is deferential 
all class actions certified under rule must meet certain prerequisites listed in subsection a there must be numerosity of class members,common questions of law or fact,the representative must be typical of the class,and his or her representation of the class must be adequate.a.here,these preconditions are admittedly satisfied.the defendants attack is instead on the further requirement,for a b class,that the court find that common questions predominate over individual ones and that the class action be superior to other methods of resolving the controversy.b.
subsection b,the cute tiger cub that has grown into something unexpectedly fearsome in civil rights and mass tort litigation,is a joinder device for consolidating separate but similar opposed,for example,to disputes about a common fund,which is covered by subsection b b.the subsection lists factors for making the most pertinent here is the predominance and superiority labels turn largely on the particular facts and issues presented.some courts have allowed strip search class actions and others not 
what here are the issues the principal this is our own very rough to be these what rule,policy or custom as to strip searches was in force in each county during the periods in question was it lawful as applied to groups or individual class members if unlawful as to some categories of arrestees,were there still facts as to particular arrestees that justified a strip search and if liability exists,what are the damages to each person injured there are obviously other issues,as to individual defendants but these four are likely the most important.
on the first rules,policies or customs is already deep disagreement between plaintiffs and defendants.so the question arises whose version is a court to assume for purposes of deciding whether a class action is even suitable it is sometimes taken for granted that the complaint allegations are necessarily controlling but class action machinery is expensive and in our view a court has the power to test disputed premises early on if and when the class action would be proper on one premise but not another 
in this case,whether there was a rule,policy or custom of automatically strip searching all or most categories of arrestees is on its face a common disputed both sides concede.nothing here obliged the district courts to do more than view the issue as such and,so viewed,it weighs in favor of class action status.the issue is like any other common predicate to liability for multiple parallel whether the train engineer was negligent or acting within the scope of his employment when the train went off the rails.see,am.trading prod.fischbach moore.
the second issue,whether the strip search policy is unlawful,presents different complications.the first is that it might be lawful as to some groups of arrestees say,those arrested on firearm felony charges and not others say,those seized for of parking tickets.both district courts sought to narrow the potential multiplicity of could in several respects work against class narrowing the class.in both orders,the class definition excluded those arrested for drugs,weapons or violent for which automatic strip searches might seem easier to defend.nilsen,at tardiff,at.
of course,the defendants might still persuad
