civil rights 
the en banc court reversed the district court summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs and remanded for the district court to enter summary judgment for california in an action brought by a class of nonresident commercial fishers challenging california nonresident fee differential for four commercial fishing licenses,vessel registration and permits.
the en banc court first held that california fee differentials for commercial fishing vessel registrations,fishing licenses,dungeness crab permits,and herring gill net permits fell within the purview of the privileges and immunities clause.the en banc court determined that whether the calculation was made at the general level of all nonresident commercial fishers,or at the specific level of nonresident commercial fishers for dungeness crab and herring,the fee differentials charged by california were less than the amount by which california subsidized the management of the nonresidents portions of its commercial fishery.the en banc court therefore held that the fee differentials survived the privileges and immunities clause challenge because the differentials were justified by a substantial reason that was closely related to the differential fees.
the en banc court held that the fees survived an equal protection clause challenge because california interest in receiving compensation for its commercial fishery management provided a rational basis for its fee differentials.
dissenting,judge smith,joined in full by hurwitz and owens and by reinhardt and berzon as to part iii,stated the majority assumed away the major defect in its analysis the fact that nonresident fishermen pay multiple california taxes too,yet nonetheless commence each fishing season thousands of dollars in the hole by virtue of california discriminatory differentials.in judge smith view,the fee differentials are illegal under the privileges and immunities clause.
dissenting,judge reinhardt,joined by judge berzon,concurred in part iii of judge smith dissent and agreed that california failed to carry its burden of demonstrating that the differential fees it charges to nonresidents were closely drawn to the achievement of a substantial state objective.
fletcher,circuit judge 
california charges nonresident commercial fishers higher fees for vessel registrations,licenses,and permits than it charges resident commercial fishers.a certified class of nonresident commercial fishers challenges the fee differentials under the privileges and immunities clause and the equal protection clause.we hold that california fee differentials do not violate either clause.
background 
california requires both resident and nonresident commercial fishers to register their vessels and to purchase licenses and permits in order to engage in commercial fishing in the waters of the state.see cal.fish game code.for many years,california has managed its commercial fishery at a substantial loss.see cal.fish game code a,a.in fiscal year fy,the year for which we have the most extensive documentation in the record,california department of fish and game spent approximately million managing its commercial fishery.in the same year,california received approximately million in fees including registration,license,and permit fees paid by residents and nonresidents from participants in its commercial fishing industry.the approximately million shortfall was covered by california general tax revenues.
california has statutorily mandated fees for commercial fishing vessel registrations,licenses,and permits.see cal.fish game code.fees are adjusted annually based on inflation.beginning in,california charged nonresidents more than residents for certain commercial fishing registrations,licenses,and permits.in,california for the first time charged nonresidents more than residents for herring gill net permits.in,california for the first time charged nonresidents more for commercial fishing vessel registrations and commercial fishing licenses.in,california for the first time charged nonresidents more for dungeness crab permits.
in license year,the fees for resident and nonresident commercial fishers were as follows 
commercial fishing vessel registration 
nonresident 
commercial fishing license 
nonresident 
dungeness crab vessel permits 
nonresident 
herring gill net permits 
nonresident 
cal.dep t fish game,digest of california commercial fishing laws and licensing requirements.dungeness crab and herring were and are limited entry fisheries for which a limited number of permits was and is available.
depending on the activity in question,a commercial fisher in california could be required to pay several fees.for example,a fishing vessel owner who personally engaged in fishing for herring was required to pay a vessel registration fee,a commercial fishing license fee,and a herring gill net permit fee.for a california resident holding a single permit,the total cost in would have been.for a nonresident,the total cost would have been,or times as much as for a resident.a vessel owner who personally engaged in fishing for dungeness crab was required to pay a vessel registration fee,a commercial fishing license fee,and a dungeness crab permit fee.for a california resident,the total cost in would have been for a nonresident,the total cost would have been,or times as much as for a resident.of the approximately million in fees paid to california in fy by the commercial fishing industry,approximately came from fee differentials paid by nonresidents.
plaintiffs,a class of nonresident commercial fishers,challenge the four nonresident fee differentials for commercial fishing vessel registrations,commercial fishing licenses,dungeness crab permits,and herring gill net permits.plaintiffs brought a class action in district court against california director of the department of fish and game for convenience,california,challenging the fee differentials as violating the dormant commerce clause,the privileges and immunities clause,and the equal protection clause.plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their dormant commerce clause claim.the parties filed for summary judgment on the remaining two claims.the district court ruled for the plaintiff class on its privileges and immunities claim,did not reach its equal protection claim,and entered judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b.california appealed the grant of plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and the denial of its own motion for summary judgment.a divided panel of this court affirmed.marilley bonham,cir.we granted rehearing en banc.marilley bonham,cir.
for the reasons that follow,we reverse the grant of summary judgment to plaintiffs.we remand with directions to grant summary judgment to california.

iii.discussion 
privileges and immunities 
article iv,section,clause,of the constitution provides that t he citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.the clause primary purpose was to help fuse into one nation a collection of independent,sovereign states.toomer witsell.the clause establishes a norm of comity between citizens of separate states.austin new hampshire.
a challenge under the privileges and immunities clause entails a inquiry.sup.of friedman,united and constr.trades council camden,see also council of ins.agents brokers,cir.at step one,the plaintiff bears the burden of showing that the challenged law fall s within the purview of the privileges and immunities clause.friedman,at quoting camden,at see also schoenefeld schneiderman,cir.quoting friedman,at.if the plaintiff makes the required showing,at step two the burden shifts to the state to show that the challenged law is closely related to the advancement of a substantial state interest.friedman,at citing sup.of piper,see also schoenefeld,at quoting friedman,at.
we address these two steps in turn.
purview of the clause 
the threshold matter in any privileges and immunities clause case is whether a challenged law fall s within the purview of the clause.camden,at quoting baldwin.fish game comm n.a plaintiff must show that the challenged law treats nonresidents differently from residents and impinges upon a fundamental privilege or immunity protected by the clause.camden,at.because california charges higher fees to nonresident commercial fishers,see cal.fish game code,we easily conclude that plaintiffs interests are facially burdened.mcburney young,see also hillside dairy lyons,carlson state,alaska l icense fees which discriminate against nonresidents are prima facie a violation of the privileges and immunities clause.further,an unbroken line of authority characterizes commercial fishing as a common calling that is protected by the privileges and immunities clause.see mullaney anderson,striking down alaska differentials for commercial fishing licenses as violating the privileges and immunities clause toomer,at c ommercial shrimping in the marginal sea,like other common callings,is within the purview of the privileges and immunities clause.connecticut ex rel.blumenthal crotty,cir.holding that commercial lobstering falls within the purview of the privileges and immunities clause tangier sound waterman ass pruitt,cir.explaining that commercial fishing is a protected privilege because it implicates the right to earn a living quoting toomer,at carlson,at commercial fishing is a sufficiently important activity to come within the purview of the privileges and immunities clause.
we therefore conclude that california challenged fee differentials fall within the purview of the privileges and immunities clause.

commercial fishing fees and state subsidy 
california differential fees for nonresident fishers have not reduced the percentage of nonresidents obtaining permits.in license year,the year differential fees were introduced for herring gill net permits,nonresidents held of these permits in california.in license year,the most recent year for which we have information in the record,nonresidents held of these permits.in license year,the year differential fees were introduced for commercial fishing vessel registrations and commercial fishing licenses,nonresident commercial fishers held of all commercial fishing vessel registrations and of all commercial fishing licenses in california.in license year,nonresident commercial fishers registered of all commercial fishing vessel registrations and of all commercial fishing licenses in california.in license year,the year differential fees were charged for dungeness crab permits,nonresidents held of these permits.in license year,nonresidents held of these permits.
according to a declaration of tony warrington,assistant chief of the law enforcement division of california department of fish and game dfg now the department of fish and wildlife,a reasonable and conservative estimate of commercial fishing enforcement expenditures by the law enforcement division in fy is.according to a declaration of helen carriker,deputy director of administration of dfg,additional fy expenditures by the license and revenue branch of dfg and by the marine region of dfg were.carriker states,however,that these numbers do not capture all of dfg commercial fishing costs,and that all dfg programs benefit commercial fishermen in some way.these numbers also do not include conservation expenditures by other california agencies,such as the california coastal commission.based on the numbers provided by warrington and carriker,a conservative estimate is that california spent approximately in fy on enforcement,management,and conservation activities benefitting commercial fishers.
warrington estimated the fy expenditures by the law enforcement division of dfg attributable to the dungeness crab fishery as,and attributable to the herring gill net fishery as.he noted,however,that these numbers likely underestimate the enforcement costs for these two fisheries because not all personnel costs in terms of both numbers of people and numbers of overtime hours were included,and because some equipment expenses were not included.carriker estimated the fy expenditures by the license and revenue branch of dfg attributable to the dungeness crab fishery as,and attributable to the herring gill net fishery as.according to a declaration by marci yaremko,environmental program manager for dfg,fy expenditures by the marine region of dfg attributable to the dungeness crab fishery were at least,and attributable to the herring gill net fishery were at least.combining the expenditures by the law enforcement division,the license and revenue branch,and the marine region,in fy california dfg spent at least attributable to the dungeness crab fishery and at least attributable to the herring gill net fishery.
during fy,california residents registered commercial fishing vessels nonresidents registered vessels.nonresidents vessels thus accounted for approximately of the total registrations in that year.california residents purchased commercial fishing licenses nonresidents purchased licenses.nonresidents accounted for approximately of the total licenses.california residents paid the yearly fee for dungeness crab permits nonresidents paid the fee for permits.nonresidents accounted for approximately of the total dungeness crab permits.california residents paid the yearly fee for herring gill net permits nonresidents paid the fee for permits.nonresidents accounted for approximately of the total herring gill net permits.
during fy,california received,from residents and nonresidents,a total of approximately for commercial vessel registrations,commercial fishing licenses,dungeness crab permits,and herring gill net permits.of that amount,approximately was due to fee differentials paid by nonresident fishers.broken down by category,the fee differentials were approximately for commercial fishing boat registrations approximately for commercial fishing licenses approximately for dungeness crab permits and approximately for herring gill net permits.
overall,during fy california received approximately in commercial fishing revenues,including revenues from resident and nonresident fishing vessel registrations,fishing licenses,dungeness crab permits,and herring gill net permits.using as the conservative estimate of california overall commercial fishery expenditures,the fy shortfall was slightly over.if we exclude from the calculation fee differentials paid by nonresidents,the shortfall in fy was approximately.the shortfall was covered by california general tax revenues.this shortfall was a subsidy,or benefit,provided by california taxpayers to the commercial fishing industry in california.the question before us is whether,or to what degree,nonresident commercial fishers may be required to pay differential fees to account for their proportionate share of that subsidy,or benefit.
advancement of a substantive state interest 
state expenditures and compensation by nonresidents a state expenditures 
the supreme court has decided two cases in which differential fees were charged to nonresident commercial fishers.first,in toomer witsell,south carolina charged a license fee of for commercial shrimp boats owned by state residents.it charged a license fee of one hundred times greater to commercial shrimp boats owned by nonresidents.id.at.the court wrote that south carolina plainly and frankly discriminates against,and the record leaves little doubt but what the discrimination is so great that its practical effect is virtually exclusionary.id.at see also id.at noting a near equivalent of total exclusion.the court struck down the fee differential as a violation of the privileges and immunities clause.id.at.the court was careful,however,to endorse differential fees that were compensation or reimbursement for benefits as to which nonresidents would otherwise be free riders.the court wrote that the clause allows a state to charge nonresidents a differential which would merely compensate the state for any added enforcement burden they may impose or for any conservation expenditures from taxes which only residents pay.id.at.
second,in mullaney anderson,the tax commissioner of alaska charged a commercial fishing license fee of to residents and a fee a ten times greater fee to nonresidents.alaska sought to justify the fee differential based on enforcement costs attributable to nonresident commercial fishers,but the record did not support its attempted justification.indeed,wrote the court,the tax commissioner and his deputy specifically disclaimed any knowledge of the dollar cost of enforcement.id.at.applying the privileges and immunities clause to a territory as alaska then was,the court struck down the fee differential.the court quoted the language from toomer endorsing differential fees that prevent nonresidents from free riding on enforcement and conservation efforts,id.at,and the court was careful to say that precise cost and reimbursement figures were not required in order to justify differential fees,id.at constitutional issues affecting taxation do not turn on even approximate mathematical determinations.
to justify the fee differentials challenged in this case,california points to the approximately million yearly shortfall in its expenditures in managing its commercial fishery.as noted above,without the revenue produced by the fee differentials,the yearly shortfall would be an additional.california contends that the fee differentials charged to nonresident commercial fishers appropriately compensate it for costs incurred in enforcement and conservation efforts attributable to nonresidents as their proportionate share,and that the fee differentials reduce though do not entirely eliminate the problem that would otherwise exist.
on several occasions,the supreme court has stated that a state expenditures may justify discrimination against nonresidents that would otherwise be impermissible under the privileges and immunities clause.as just noted,the court stated in toomer and mullaney that a state may charge differential fees to nonresident commercial fishers in order to recover the state expenditures in enforcement and conservation measures that are attributable to the nonresidents.in camden,a municipal ordinance required that at least forty percent of workers employed on city construction projects be residents of camden,new jersey.the court wrote,the fact that camden is expending its own funds or funds it administers in terms of a grant is certainly a factor perhaps the crucial factor to be considered in evaluating whether the statute discrimination violates the privileges and immunities clause.camden,at.
the court decisions under the commerce clause make much the same point about state expenditures.commerce clause decisions are relevant to the privileges and immunities clause because the two clauses share the same underlying concerns.see,hicklin orbeck,t he mutually reinforcing relationship between the privileges and immunities clause and the commerce clause a relationship that stems from their common origin in the fourth article of the articles of confederation and their shared vision of federalism renders several commerce clause decisions appropriate support for our conclusion under the privileges and immunities clause.internal citation omitted.in reeves,stake,south dakota built and owned its own cement plant.when demand for cement exceeded supply,south dakota instituted a policy of satisfying all orders from south dakota customers first,relegating customers to the end of the line.the court sustained the policy against a dormant commerce clause challenge,writing 
the state refusal to sell to buyers other than south dakotans is protectionist only in the sense that it limits benefits generated by a state program to those who fund the state treasury and whom the state was created to serve such policies,while perhaps protectionist in a loose sense,reflect the essential and patently unobjectionable purpose of state government to serve the citizens of the state.
id.at.similarly,in mcburney young,the supreme court rejected a dormant commerce clause challenge to a virginia freedom of information act provision under which only virginia residents were allowed to compel production of state government documents.citing reeves,the court wrote,insofar as there is a market for public documents in virginia,it is a market for a product that the commonwealth has created and of which the commonwealth is the sole manufacturer.id.at.the court therefore held that virginia could reserve for its citizens the benefits of the product it had created through the expenditure of state funds.
b compensation by nonresidents for benefits 
the core principle of the foregoing cases is that when a state makes an expenditure from a fund to which nonresidents do not contribute,and when the state provides a benefit through that expenditure to both residents and nonresidents,the state may exclude nonresidents from the benefit either in whole or in part,or it may seek compensation from nonresidents for the benefit conferred.when the benefit at issue is access to a natural resource,the state may not exclude nonresidents,but it may seek reimbursement for money spent to manage and preserve the resource.in such cases,as the court wrote in toomer,the privileges and immunities clause allows a state to charge a differential which would merely compensate the state for any added enforcement burden they may impose or for any conservation expenditures from taxes which only residents pay.toomer,at.
several related principles come from these same cases.first,the benefit provided to a nonresident,and the appropriate amount of compensation from the nonresident,need not be determined with mathematical precision.the constitutional question do es not turn on even approximate mathematical determinations.mullaney,at.second,we accord states deference in determining the benefit provided and the appropriate amount of compensation.a privileges and immunities inquiry must be conducted with due regard for the princip le that the states should have considerable leeway in analyzing local evils and in prescribing appropriate cures.toomer,at.third,in seeking compensation from nonresidents,a state must treat nonresidents and residents with substantial equality.id.at i t was long ago decided that one of the privileges which the privileges and immunities clause guarantees to citizens of state a is that of doing business in state b on terms of substantial equality with the citizens of that state.
consistent with these principles,we may calculate at a general level the benefit provided by california and the appropriate compensation from nonresident fishers.california spent approximately managing its commercial fishing industry in fy.not including the fee differentials paid by nonresident fishers,california received a total amount of approximately in fees from the commercial fishing industry.this amount includes all fees,not limited to commercial fishing license fees,commercial fishing vessel registration fees,dungeness crab permits,and herring gill net permits.of that total amount again excluding the amount paid in fee differentials,approximately came from registration,license,and permit fees paid by commercial fishers.the remaining approximately came from fish landing taxes and from licensing fees paid by fish buyers,sellers,and importers.the shortfall in revenues excluding nonresident differentials in fy was approximately,or approximately of the entire amount spent by california in managing its commercial fishery.the shortfall was a subsidy,or benefit,provided by california to its commercial fishing industry,paid by california taxpayers.all commercial fishers in california residents and nonresidents alike benefited from this subsidy.
we will assume,as a rough estimate,that commercial fishers as a whole benefited from the states subsidy in proportion to the amount they paid in fees.excluding fee differentials,the amount paid to california by commercial fishers was of the total amount paid to california by the entire commercial fishing industry.percent of the state subsidy is approximately.that amount went to commercial fishers as their proportionate share of the subsidy in fy.nonresident commercial fishers in california were of all commercial fishers in fy.twelve percent of the subsidy that went to all commercial fishers is approximately.california could have charged up to that amount to nonresident fishers in fy,as their proportionate share of the subsidy,or benefit,provided to them by california out of its general fund.in actual fact,nonresident fishers paid a total of in fee differentials in fy,substantially less than the amount of their proportionate share of the subsidy,or benefit,provided to them by california.
we may also calculate the subsidies provided to the two specific fisheries for which california charges fee differentials dungeness crab and herring.as described above,in fy california dfg spent approximately attributable to the dungeness crab fishery and approximately attributable to the herring fishery.as noted above,the overall subsidy provided by california to its commercial fishery is of california total expenditures for managing its commercial fishery.we will assume,as a rough estimate,that of the amount spent on the dungeness crab and herring fisheries is the amount by which those specific fisheries were subsidized in fy.
percent of the subsidy provided to the dungeness crab fishery is approximately.nonresidents were of the dungeness crab permit holders in fy.thirteen percent of is approximately,which is the proportionate share of the subsidy provided to nonresident dungeness crab fishers in fy.the differential fee charged to nonresident dungeness crab fishers in fy was approximately,substantially less than the subsidy,or benefit,provided to them.
percent of the subsidy provided to the herring fishery is approximately.nonresidents were of the herring gill net permit holders in fy.eighteen percent of is approximately.the differential fee charged to nonresident herring gill net fishers in fy was,substantially less than the subsidy,or benefit,provided to them.
thus,whether the calculation is made at the general level of all nonresident commercial fishers,or at the specific level of nonresident commercial fishers for dungeness crab and herring,the fee differentials charged by california are less than the amount by which california subsidizes the management of the nonresidents portions of its commercial fishery.
in contrast to the fee differential charged in toomer,california commercial fishing differentials are not virtually exclusionary.toomer,at.indeed,quite the contrary.as the numbers given above demonstrate,the percentages of nonresident fishing vessel registrations,nonresident commercial fishing licenses,nonresident dungeness crab permits,and nonresident herring gill net permits have all increased since the institution of differential fees for nonresidents.further,in contrast to the fee differentials in toomer and mullaney,the multiples of the fees charged to residents are relatively modest.in toomer,south carolina charged nonresident shrimpers one hundred times what it charged residents.in mullaney,alaska charged nonresident fishers ten times what it charged residents.in california,the multiples ranged from about two to slightly less than four.
we therefore conclude that the fee differentials charged by california are permitted under the privileges and immunities clause.
ii.california taxes paid by nonresident fishers 
the above analysis is premised on the nonresident fishers in this case not having paid taxes which only california residents pay.toomer,at.plaintiffs did not argue in the district court or in their briefs to us that they have paid california income tax on their earnings from commercial fishing in california,and that they are therefore protected by the privileges and immunities clause from having to pay fee differentials.plaintiffs made this argument for the first time during oral argument before our en banc panel.our dissenting colleagues use plaintiffs argument as the central rationale of their dissent.we could hold plaintiffs argument waived for failure to raise it in the district court and for failure to raise it in their briefs to us.however,we address it on the merits,for there is enough uncontested information in the record to allow us to consider and reject it.because we reject the argument,there is no unfairness to california resulting from plaintiffs failure to raise it until oral argument before our en banc panel.
if plaintiffs paid more than de minimus income tax to california,such that they should be assimilated,either entirely or in part,to california resident taxpayers for purposes of the privileges and immunities clause,we would have to modify our analysis.however,we do not need to do so because the three named plaintiffs have paid either no or minimal california income tax.one of the named plaintiffs has fished commercially in california for many years and has never paid california income tax.the other two named plaintiffs have fished commercially in california for many years each has paid income taxes in california for only three of those years.
named plaintiff savior papetti lives in mckinney,texas.he owns two commercial fishing boats.he uses one of them to fish in alaska.he has kept the other boat in san francisco since.he does not own any herring gill net permits,but has fished regularly for herring in california,missing only a few years,by leasing permits from others.he has fished for dungeness crab regularly since except for a couple of years.he stated in his deposition that he has filed california tax returns every year.he specifically stated that he has not paid california income tax since.there is nothing in the record to indicate that he paid california income taxes before.
named plaintiff salvatore papetti,savior father,lives in bellingham,washington.he states in his deposition that he has worked as a commercial fisherman since.he owns two commercial fishing boats.he keeps one of them in alaska.he now uses it to fish for salmon,but in the past has used it to fish for dungeness crab and herring in california.at the time of his deposition,his other boat was in washington for repairs.he uses that boat to fish for herring in alaska and in california,and for salmon in washington.he fished for dungeness crab in california as late as.about five or six years ago,he sold his crab permit to his son savior.he has never missed a herring season in california except the year the season was closed due to an oil spill in san francisco bay.he has filed california income tax returns every year,but has paid income taxes to california in only three of those years.he paid in,in,and in.
finally,named plaintiff kevin marilley lives in lynden,washington.he has worked as a commercial fisherman since.he owns three commercial fishing boats.he keeps two in alaska and uses them to fish there.he keeps the third boat in bellingham,washington,and uses it to fish for salmon in alaska and herring in california.he fished for squid and herring in california between and,and fished for squid in california in.he regularly fished for herring in california through.he stated in his deposition that he intended to fish for herring in california in.he stated in his deposition that he believe d he filed a california tax return for every year he fished in california up through.the last time he filed a tax return in california was.he paid income tax in california in only three years.he paid in,in,and in.he last paid california income tax twenty years ago.
our dissenting colleagues do not ask to alter our analysis based on the or minimal california income taxes paid by the three named plaintiffs.rather,they ask us to do so based on an unsupported assumption that unnamed class members paid substantially more in california income taxes than did the named plaintiffs.
the record contains no evidence of california income taxes paid by any of the unnamed class members.attorneys for the plaintiff class had an opportunity in the district court to present evidence of california income taxes paid by unnamed class members,but they failed to present any such evidence.nor did they make any argument in the district court based on payment of california income taxes by any class member,named or unnamed.an assumption that unnamed class members paid substantially more than the named plaintiffs is inconsistent with the basic premises of class certification.federal rule of civil procedure a requires that the claims of the representative parties be typical of the claims of the class.that is,a claim by an unnamed member of the class must match a typical claim by a named plaintiff.in this case,there is no such typical claim in the complaint because the named plaintiffs made no claim whatsoever based on their payment of california income taxes.rule a also requires that there be questions of law or fact common to the class.if a claim based on the payment of california income taxes had been made in the district court which it was not,that claim was required to have been based on law or fact common to the class.to the extent there were facts common to such a claim,if it had been made,the only facts in evidence were those recounted above.
in short,our dissenting colleagues ask us to make an assumption,based on sheer speculation,that unnamed class members paid substantially more in california income taxes than did the named plaintiffs.we respectfully decline to make that assumption.
equal protection 
plaintiffs also challenged california commercial fishing fee differentials under the equal protection clause.the district court struck down the fee differentials as a violation of the privileges and immunities clause and did not reach the equal protection question.we could remand to the district court to address that question in the first instance,but in the interest of judicial efficiency we decide the question ourselves.
because california commercial fishing fee differentials do not classify persons based on protected characteristics,such as race,alienage,national origin,or sex or affect the exercise of fundamental rights,rational basis review applies.fields legacy health,cir.see also country classic dairies,state of,dep t of commerce milk control bureau,cir.t he right to pursue a calling is not a fundamental right for purposes of the equal protection clause.citing new orleans dukes,per curiam see also medeiros vincent,cir.the right to make a living is not a fundamental right,for either equal protection or substantive due process purposes.therefore,in order to succeed plaintiffs must negat e every conceivable basis which might support the legislative classification between residents and nonresidents.fields,at.as explained above,california has a substantial reason for charging nonresident differentials.it has an obvious interest in recovering from nonresident commercial fishers their share of the benefit provided to them by its management of its commercial fishery.congress has recognized this interest as legitimate.see pub,b,stat.but even absent such congressional endorsement,california interest in receiving compensation for the benefit its management confers provides a rational basis for its fee differentials.
conclusion 
we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to plaintiffs.california fee differentials for commercial fishing vessel registrations,fishing licenses,dungeness crab permits,and herring gill net permits survive the privileges and immunities clause challenge because the differentials are justified by a substantial reason that is closely related to the differential fees.the fees survive the equal protection clause challenge because california has a rational basis for charging the differential fees.california is therefore entitled to summary judgment on both of plaintiffs claims.we remand with directions to the district court to enter summary judgment for california.
reversed and remanded.
the majority assumes away the major defect in its analysis the fact that nonresident fishermen pay multiple california taxes too,yet nonetheless commence each fishing season thousands of dollars in the hole by virtue of california discriminatory differentials.to avoid dealing with this problem,the majority employs the analytical head fake of fixating on the named plaintiffs and ignoring the rest of the class.it then opines that the named plaintiffs tax liability is de minimus,assumes that finding is representative,and concludes that its analysis need go no further.
that approach is deeply flawed.our analysis can not properly ignore the bevy of taxes nonresident fishermen pay collectively to the state.moreover,the majority improperly transposes the evidentiary burden it is california that must demonstrate that the differentials recoup a subsidy funded only by its residents.hence,any purported lack of evidence on the tax liability of nonresident fishermen counts against the state,not the other way around.the majority shrugs this off,and thereby fails to require california to bear the burden the privileges and immunities clause demands.
california,like the majority,overlooks how nonresident taxes defray the costs of any subsidy for conservation,and thereby fails to meet its burden to show its discrimination is closely drawn to the achievement of a substantial state objective.sup.of friedman.for that reason,i would affirm the district court judgment in favor of the plaintiffs,and i respectfully dissent.

they hold two commercial fishing licenses,three herring gill net permits,and one commercial fishing vessel registration.this would cost them in license fees if they were california residents,using the majority numbers from.california,however,extracts from the papettis,based simply on their status as nonresidents.so,salvatore and nancy start the season with a deficit,relative to their competitors.adding insult to injury,every year it gets worse because commercial fishing fees are automatically indexed for inflation.cal.fish game code.the effect of the indexing is to widen the gap between resident and nonresident fishing license fees each season.
savior papetti nancy and salvatore son must endure the same headwinds.he registers a boat in california,obtains a fishing license,and secures permits to fish for herring and crab.but since he hails from mckinney,texas,he starts each season behind his california resident competitors.kevin marilley is no different.he sets sail on the sundance kid near san francisco to fish for herring.he registers his boat,obtains a fishing license,and has three herring gill net permits,so he starts in the red,unlike his california resident competitors.frustrated by the disadvantage,marilley and the papettis challenge four of california differential fees under the privileges and immunities clause of the constitution.

the privileges and immunities clause was primarily aimed at creat ing a national economic union,sup.of piper,and was taken from the articles of confederation with no change of substance or intent,unless it was to strengthen the force of the clause in fashioning a single nation,austin,at.it affirms t he citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.const.art.iv,cl.alexander hamilton referred to the clause quite simply as the basis of the union.the federalist,at wright.it place d the citizens of each state upon the same footing with citizens of other states,so far as the advantages resulting from citizenship in those states are concerned.paul virginia.the court found it gave outsiders an exemption from higher taxes or impositions than are paid by the other citizens of the state.corfield coryell,cir.it has been justly said that no other provision in the constitution has tended so strongly to constitute the citizens of the united states one people paul,at.
in light of this background,when states erect barriers that impair our national economic unity,they bear a significant burden of justification laws implicating the clause must serve a substantial state interest and be closely related to the advancement of that interest to be valid.friedman,at.a substantial interest does not exist unless there is something to indicate that constitute a peculiar source of the evil at which the discriminatory statute is aimed.hicklin orbeck,quotation marks omitted,brackets in original.states of course do have some flexibility in prescribing appropriate cures for local ills and,when levying fees,need not demonstrate mathematical precision.see toomer witsell.but citizens of state a must be allowed to do business in state b on terms of substantial equality with the citizens of that state.id.emphasis added.
the evil the fee differentials target in this case is the potential for nonresidents to free ride on california investment in its fisheries the state valid interest thus lies in seeking reimbursement for a benefit funded exclusively by california residents.in this situation,california may exact only a differential which would merely compensate the state for any added enforcement burden nonresidents may impose or for any conservation expenditures from taxes which only residents pay.toomer,at emphasis added 
california elected to put all of its eggs in the second basket,as it never asserted,much less provided any evidence,that nonresident commercial fishermen impose any added enforcement or management burden on the state in conducting our analysis,we thus look to the aggregate benefits nonresident fishermen receive at the expense of california taxpayers.to calculate that benefit,i will leverage,but do not endorse,the majority handiwork.
the majority assumes the million spent on licensing and enforcement is akin to conservation.op.at.it then finds a shortfall,after accounting for received in fees,not including differentials.id.next,the majority assumes commercial fishermen benefitted from the subsidy in proportion to the amount they paid in fees id.that equals percent of the shortfall,meaning fishermen were subsidized to the tune of.id.at.since nonresidents account for twelve percent of commercial fishermen,the majority tags them with twelve percent of that amount.id.at.in other words,according to the majority,nonresident fishermen received a subsidy.id.
this analysis fails because it assumes that the state subsidy derives from taxes which only residents pay,toomer,at,notwithstanding the fact that the record shows that nonresident commercial fisherman pay california taxes as well.nonresident fishermen,in other words,must be assimilated,either entirely or in part,to california resident taxpayers for purposes of the privileges and immunities clause,op.at,because like golden state residents they too pay taxes to fund the state conservation expenditures.
the state expert,carriker,says commercial fishermen in california earned million in,million in,and million in.the state also consistently represented it could charge fees to nonresident fishermen in relation to their percentage of overall fishermen.thus,taking the majority number,we can attribute twelve percent of those earnings to the efforts of fishermen.by that account,nonresident fishermen paid personal income taxes to the state on earnings approximating million 
we can also consider it in another way.using the landings data submitted both for residents and nonresidents,carriker submits that the average income in california was in,in,and in.if we assume nonresident fishermen are comparable to their counterparts,nonresidents would be liable for at least percent in personal income taxes on roughly those amounts.see franchise tax board,annual report,available at.sht ml showing personal income tax rates for each income level from to hereinafter ftb report.
alternatively,if we divide the aggregate earnings approximately million by the number of nonresident fishermen,nonresidents would be paying california taxes on per year on average.this estimate,however,assumes income is distributed evenly,notwithstanding the fish will bite for some fishermen more than others.accordingly,might be construed as the median income,meaning half of nonresident fishermen would make more each year,and the other half less.in that scenario,it would not be surprising for the named plaintiffs to have made modest tax payments,even where nonresident fisherman collectively contribute substantially.
california never contemplated,much less accounted for,the contributions nonresident fishermen make in personal income taxes based on the evidence in the record,however,we can reasonably infer nonresident fishermen incomes contribute meaningfully in the aggregate to the state conservation expenditures.see,ser a substantial portion of general fund revenue comes from nonresident sources,including personal income tax paid by nonresidents,including nonresident commercial fishermen.
consider also the fact that california derives close to thirty percent of the general fund from sales and use tax revenue.nonresident fishermen like the papettis pay those taxes just as california residents do to purchase food,fuel,and other necessary materials in california.i assume that nonresident fishermen are also a salty bunch,and likely pay excise taxes too,on cigarettes,beer,wine,and alcohol,thereby adding further to the state general revenue.yet california makes no effort to account for an
