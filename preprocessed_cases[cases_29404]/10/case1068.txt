we must decide whether removal is proper under the mass action provision of the class action fairness act of cafa,d b i,when plaintiffs in several moved for coordination in the state trial court pursuant to california code of civil procedure section for all purposes and justified their request in part by asserting a need to avoid inconsistent judgments.cafa extends federal removal jurisdiction for certain class actions and for mass actions in which monetary relief claims of or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs claims involve common questions of law or fact.d b i.because we conclude that all of the cafa requirements for a removable mass action are met under the totality of the circumstances in these cases,we reverse the district court remand orders.
defendants appellants teva pharmaceuticals usa,teva and xanodyne pharmaceuticals,xanodyne appeal from the district court orders remanding these cases to state court.these cases were two of pending before the district court alleging injuries related to the ingestion of propoxyphene,an ingredient found in the darvocet and darvon pain relief drugs,as well as in generic pain relievers.there are additional propoxyphene cases pending in multidistrict litigation in the eastern district of kentucky.see in re darvocet,darvon propoxyphene prods.liab,d.
propoxyphene is a pain reliever that was used in the united states to treat mild to moderate pain from through november,when drugs containing propoxyphene were taken off the market because of safety concerns.teva held the rights to the generic form of darvocet and darvon,and plaintiffs allege that teva was involved in all aspects of the creation,distribution,and sale of generic propoxyphene products.xanodyne acquired the rights to darvocet and darvon in.
to date,more than forty actions have been filed in california state courts regarding propoxyphene pain relievers.on october,a group of attorneys responsible for many of the propoxyphene actions against teva,xanodyne,and other defendants filed petitions asking the california judicial council to establish a coordinated proceeding for all california propoxyphene actions under section of the california code of civil procedure california code of civil procedure section,which sets out the standards for coordination,states 
coordination of civil actions sharing a common question of fact or law is appropriate if one judge hearing all of the actions for all purposes in a selected site or sites will promote the ends of justice taking into account whether the common question of fact or law is predominating and significant to the litigation the convenience of parties,witnesses,and counsel the relative development of the actions and the work product of counsel the efficient utilization of judicial facilities and manpower the calendar of the courts the disadvantages of duplicative and inconsistent rulings,orders,or judgments and,the likelihood of settlement of the actions without further litigation should coordination be denied.
plaintiffs asked for coordination of their lawsuits for reasons consistent with the above factors,including concerns that there could be potential duplicate and inconsistent rulings,orders,or judgments,and that without coordination,two or more separate courts may render different rulings on liability and other issues.plaintiffs argued in their petitions and the supporting memoranda that the cases should be coordinated before one judge hearing all of the actions for all purposes,to address the same or substantially similar causes of action,issues of law,and issues of material fact.after these petitions for coordination were filed,teva and xanodyne removed the cases to federal district court under cafa mass action provision.
cafa provides federal district courts with original jurisdiction over mass actions if the actions meet all of the statutory requirements.d.cafa defines a mass action as 
a ny civil action in which monetary relief claims of or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs claims involve common questions of law or fact,except that jurisdiction shall exist only over those plaintiffs whose claims in a mass action satisfy the jurisdictional amount requirements under subsection a.
d b i.the parties dispute only whether plaintiffs petitions for coordination constitute proposals for the cases to be tried jointly under cafa.
the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction under cafa because plaintiffs petitions for coordination were not proposals to try the cases jointly,and it remanded the cases back to state court.the district court distinguished these cases from the seventh circuit decision in in re abbott laboratories,cir,and held that plaintiffs petitions were sufficiently different from abbott consolidation request because the petitions filed in this case focused on purposes,while the petition filed in abbott explicitly sought consolidation through trial.
defendants sought permission to appeal the district court remand orders,which we granted.a panel affirmed.see romo teva pharm.usa,cir,cert.denied.a majority of nonrecused judges voted to rehear the case en banc.cir order.we review the district court remand order de novo.see abrego abrego dow chem,cir per curiam.
the controlling issue before us is whether plaintiffs petitions to coordinate actions under california code of civil procedure section constitute proposals for these actions to be tried jointly,making the actions a mass action subject to federal jurisdiction under cafa.to answer that question,we turn to the language and purpose of cafa.mississippi ex rel.hood au optronics.the statutory issue for us is whether the petitions filed in this case,seeking coordination of the california propoxyphene actions,were in legal effect proposals for those actions to be tried jointly.this is a question of first impression in the ninth circuit.
congress enacted cafa in to curb perceived abuses of the class action device which,in the view of cafa proponents,had often been used to litigate multistate or even national class actions in state courts.tanoh dow chem,cir.cafa further extends federal jurisdiction over mass action cases when several requirements are met,although only the proposed to be tried jointly requirement is at issue here.see d,a.
we have said that cafa mass action provision is fairly narrow,tanoh,at,given that it applies only if there is an aggregate amount in controversy of million or more,at least one plaintiff who is a citizen of a state or foreign state different from that of any defendant,and when monetary relief claims of or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly,d b i see tanoh,at.tanoh dow chemical holds,consistent with the plain language of cafa,that the proposal to try claims jointly must come from the plaintiffs,not from the defendants.at.further,tanoh correctly holds that if the mass action provision requirements are not met,we can not ignore its terms based on general statements in cafa legislative history or the theory that plaintiffs should not be able to game jurisdictional statutes to remain in state court.id.at.
tanoh also holds that plaintiffs are the masters of their complaint and do not propose a joint trial simply by structuring their complaints so as to avoid the plaintiff threshold.id.at,see parson johnson johnson,cir scimone carnival,cir anderson bayer,cir.under this view,plaintiffs can structure actions in cases involving more than potential claimants so as to avoid federal jurisdiction under cafa.that is not surprising,and it is analogous to the fact that individuals and corporations can structure transactions so as to avoid statutory prohibitions or terms.amici chamber of commerce of the united states of america and phrma urge us to conclude that the supreme court decision in standard fire insurance knowles,fatally undermines tanoh reasoning and holding.we reject this interpretation of knowles,which itself reiterates that plaintiffs are the masters of their complaints who may structure those complaints to avoid federal jurisdiction in some circumstances.see id.at 
but while plaintiffs are the masters of their complaints,they are also the masters of their petitions for coordination.stated another way,when we assess whether there has been a proposal for joint trial,we hold plaintiffs responsible for what they have said and done.california code of civil procedure section allows the coordination of all of the actions for all purposes and presents a test to determine whether coordination is appropriate.plaintiffs voluntarily asked for coordination under section,and they submitted memoranda in support of their petitions for coordination.we will carefully assess the language of the petitions for coordination to see whether,in language or substance,they proposed a joint trial.
we conclude that plaintiffs petitions for coordination are proposals for joint trial.first,the petitions say that plaintiffs seek coordination for all purposes.all purposes must include the purposes of trial.so reading the petitions literally,plaintiffs,who in total number far more than,were seeking a joint trial.second,the specific reasons given for coordination also support the conclusion that a joint trial was requested.for example,plaintiffs listed potential issues in support of their petitions that would be addressed only through some form of joint trial,such as the danger of inconsistent judgments and conflicting determinations of liability.
our conclusions here are consistent with tanoh,where we held that the decision to try claims jointly and thus qualify as a mass action under cafa should remain with plaintiffs.at.unlike the plaintiffs in tanoh,who merely filed separate actions that the defendant sought to try jointly,plaintiffs filing of the petitions for coordination was a voluntary and affirmative act that we conclude was a proposal to try the cases jointly.see id.at.
plaintiffs contend that they were simply reciting the section factors,but we find this argument unpersuasive given the language of the petitions and the supporting memoranda.plaintiffs did not simply recite the factors for coordination.they asserted that t he inevitability of realizing the inconsistency and duplication factor of california code of civil procedure section weighs heavily in favor of coordination.plaintiffs further asserted that issues pertaining to liability,allocation of fault and contribution,as well as the same wrongful conduct of defendants,would require coordination.none of these particular arguments is listed in the section factors,and achieving consistency in these areas would almost certainly require a joint trial plaintiffs petitions requested more than coordination.plaintiffs repeatedly stated that the factors catalogued in section all supported coordination,including the fact that o ne judge hearing all of the actions for all purposes in a selected site or sites will promote the ends of justice.in the application of a jurisdictional rule,as well as in its establishment,we agree with the supreme court observation that simplicity is a virtue.hood.at internal quotation marks omitted.looking at the plain language of plaintiffs petitions and memoranda,we must conclude that plaintiffs proposed a joint trial in asking that all of the actions be coordinated for all purposes.
this is not to say that all petitions for coordination under section are per se proposals to try cases jointly for the purposes of cafa mass action provision we can envision a section petition that expressly seeks to limit its request for coordination to matters,and thereby align with the mass action provision exception for any civil action in which the claims have been consolidated or coordinated solely for pretrial proceedings.d b ii iv.it is not clear whether the california judicial council would grant coordination for less than all purposes.however,if plaintiffs had qualified their coordination request by saying that it was intended to be solely for purposes,then it would be difficult to suggest that plaintiffs had proposed a joint trial but where,as here,plaintiffs petition for coordination by arguing that hearing all of the actions together for all purposes would promote the ends of justice,they propose a joint trial,triggering federal jurisdiction as a mass action under cafa.
we reject the rule urged by plaintiffs that a petition to evoke cafa must expressly request a joint trial in order to be a proposal to try the cases jointly.although such a rule would be easy to administer,it would ignore the real substance of plaintiffs petitions.see abbott,at a proposal for a joint trial can be implicit.see also atwell bos.scientific,cir holding that proposals for joint trial may be made implicitly bullard burlington santa fe,cir same.
two of our sister circuits have reached similar conclusions when examining petitions for consolidation.in abbott,the seventh circuit reasoned that the plaintiffs petition for consolidation through trial and not solely for pretrial proceedings was a proposal to try jointly their separately filed cases.at.the seventh circuit concluded that,contrary to the plaintiffs assertion that they did not specifically ask for a joint trial,the language of the plaintiffs petition for consolidation could be construed only as an implicit proposal for joint trial.id.plaintiffs here seek to distinguish their own for all purposes language from the through trial language present in abbott,but the differences between the two phrasings are superficial,and we are not persuaded.
the eighth circuit adopted abbott reasoning,concluding that plaintiffs proposed a joint trial when they filed motions asking for special assignment to a single judge for both pretrial and trial matters,and then argued at the motions hearing that the special assignment made sense for consistency of rulings,judicial economy,and administration of justice.atwell,at alteration in original.the eighth circuit decided that the motions for assignment to a single judge,combined with plaintiffs candid explanation of their objectives,required denial of the motions to remand the cases to state court.id.at.plaintiffs further attempt to distinguish their own petitions for coordination from atwell on the basis that t here is no such explicit language in plaintiffs petition,but again we find this distinction unpersuasive given the language of plaintiffs memoranda in support of their petitions,which both sought coordination for all purposes and gave reasons that likely would be satisfied only by a joint trial of some sort.
asking for coordination or consolidation for all purposes or through trial to address common issues of law or fact is a proposal to try the cases jointly and creates federal jurisdiction under cafa mass action provision.to hold otherwise would ignore the plain language,as well as the substance,of plaintiffs section petitions and supporting memoranda.
because we conclude that plaintiffs petitions for coordination each constitute a proposal to try the cases jointly,we reverse the district court orders granting plaintiffs motions to remand 
this is admittedly a fairly close case but,upon reflection,i respectfully dissent from the conclusion of my esteemed colleagues that this case fits within the parameters for removal under the class action fairness act of cafa.
i start from the premise that removal is disfavored when determining federal jurisdiction,and that any doubt that exists when considering removal statutes should be construed against removal.see tanoh dow chemical,cir see also state of hawaii hsbc bank,wl cir.as we also recognized in tanoh,cafa mass action provision is fairly narrow.at.
with those principles firmly in mind,i reach a different conclusion than that of the majority.the plain language of the class action fairness act,d b i,confers jurisdiction upon federal district courts to try a mass action.a mass action is defined as 
any civil action in which monetary relief claims of or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs claims involve common questions of law or fact 
d b i emphasis added.
the majority concludes that the plaintiffs proposed their cases to be tried jointly by filing a petition for coordination pursuant to california code of civil procedure.that section provides 
coordination of civil actions sharing a common question of fact or law is appropriate if one judge hearing all of the actions for all purposes in selected site or sites will promote the ends of justice taking into account whether the common question of fact or law is predominating and significant to the litigation the convenience of parties,witnesses,and counsel the relative development of the actions and the work product of counsel the efficient utilization of judicial facilities and manpower the calendar of the courts the disadvantages of duplicative and inconsistent rulings,orders,or judgments and the likelihood of settlement of the actions without further litigation should coordination be denied.
the plaintiffs petition for coordination stopped short of requesting a joint trial as contemplated by the plain language of the statute.see d b i defining a mass action as one in which claims of or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly.
on page of the memorandum of points and authorities in support of the petition,plaintiffs gave the following explanation for seeking coordination 
petitioners counsel anticipates that the actions will involve duplicative requests for the same defendant witness depositions and the same documents related to development,manufacturing,testing,marketing,and sale of the darvocet product.absent coordination of these actions by a single judge,there is a significant likelihood of duplicative discovery,waste of judicial resources and possible inconsistent judicial rulings on legal issues.
emphases added.
it is a stretch to parse a proposal for a joint trial from this language.rather,the obvious focus was on pretrial proceedings,i,discovery matters.
on page of the memorandum,plaintiffs informed the court that coordination was also sought because u se of committees and standardized discovery in a coordinated setting will expedite resolutions of these cases,avoid inconsistent results,and assist in alleviating onerous burdens on the courts as well as the parties.emphases added.again,we see a focus on pretrial proceedings,with no mention of a joint trial.
on page,the plaintiffs urged coordination on the following bases 
one judge hearing all of the actions for all purposes in a selected site or sites will promote the ends of justice common questions of fact or law are predominating and significant to the litigation coordination may serve the convenience of parties,witnesses and counsel the relative development of the actions and the work product of counsel coordination may facilitate the efficient utilization of judicial facilities and manpower coordination may enhance the orderly calendar of the courts without coordination,the parties may suffer from disadvantages caused by duplicative and inconsistent rulings,orders or judgments 
plaintiffs also stated i n light of the similarity of the actions,there will be duplicate discovery obligations upon the common defendants unless coordination is ordered.coordination before initiation of discovery in any of the cases will eliminate waste of resources and will facilitate economy emphases added.unlike the cases from the seventh and eighth circuits cited in the majority opinion,not once does the petition for coordination mention joint trial or even trial.rather,the continued focus is on pretrial matters.
the majority opinion isolates the phrases duplicate and inconsistent rulings,orders,or judgments,two or more separate courts may render different rulings on liability and other issues,and hearing all of the actions for all purposes to support its conclusion that the plaintiffs sought a joint trial.majority opinion.in doing so,the majority completely ignores all references to discovery,including on the same page containing the reference to liability,where plaintiffs stated i n light of the similarity of the actions,there will be duplicate discovery obligations upon the common defendants unless coordination is ordered.coordination before initiation of discovery in any of the cases will eliminate waste of resources and will facilitate economy emphases added.a fair reading of the entire petition for coordination reflects a decided focus on pretrial matters.
reliance by the majority on the quoted portions of the petition to the exclusion of all else is inconsistent with the command that any doubt about federal jurisdiction be resolved in favor of remand.this is especially true where most of the quoted words have little to do with trial.i am not persuaded that a reference to rulings and orders evokes the concept of trial rather than pretrial matters.indeed,the opposite may be true 
an order is the mandate or determination of the court upon some subsidiary or collateral matter arising in an action,not disposing of the merits,but adjudicating a preliminary point or directing some step in the proceedings.
black law dictionary ed citing henry campbell black,a treatise on the law of judgments,at ed.
in turn r ulings on motions are ordinarily orders id.citing freeman,a treatise on the law of judgments,at edward tuttle,ed.consequently,at best,plaintiffs reference to rulings and orders is ambiguous,and ambiguity defeats removal.see tanoh,at.
the majority is also on shaky ground when relying on the plaintiffs reference to inconsistent judgments,because judgments may be rendered outside the confines of a trial.default judgments and summary judgments come readily to mind.see federal rules of civil procedure and providing for entry of judgment prior to trial.indeed,it is not at all uncommon for similar cases to be resolved short of trial.see,navarrette armite labs,no,wl at,april,plaintiffs filed a tort action against manufacturers and suppliers of products used for metal fabrication at a foundry,where plaintiffs once worked.plaintiffs allege that they were injured by their workplace exposure to defendants products.the trial court dismissed the case after sustaining demurrers to the plaintiffs fourth amended complaint,without leave to amend.judgment in favor of defendants was affirmed see also baycol cases i and ii,no,wl at,several hundred cases involving baycol,including a number of class actions,which had been filed in california were consolidated in a judicial council coordinated proceeding jccp in los angeles superior court during the next approximately two years many of the cases in the jccp were dismissed or resolved in defendant favor on summary judgment emphases added.
plaintiffs reference to rulings on liability also fit readily within the concept of resolving cases short of trial.see id.resolving cases in defendant favor on summary judgment.unsurprisingly,the majority contrary notion that a joint trial is almost certainly require d to determine liability,majority opinion,is not supported by citation to any california authority.the district court judges who rendered decisions remanding these cases to state court are all seasoned california practitioners,and not one of them interpreted the petition for coordination as requesting a joint trial.see freitas mckesson,sc,wl at,declining to i nfer a request for a joint trial from plaintiffs petition,which does not expressly request such a trial see also rice mckesson,no.wha,wl at,rejecting the argument that plaintiffs implicitly proposed a removable mass action in their coordination petition by using the ambiguous language for all purposes and by raising the possibility of inconsistent judgments rentz mckesson,no.cv psg,wl at,noting that the language in the petition for coordination focuses on coordination for pretrial purposes and the complete lack of any mention of joint trial posey mckesson,no.c rs,wl at,holding that c onstruing plaintiffs petition for coordination as the functional equivalent of an express request for a joint trial would conflict with both the guidance provided by our court of appeals in tanoh,as well as with the general canon of strict construction of removal statutes citation and alteration omitted.
the cases from the seventh and eighth circuit relied upon by the majority are easily distinguishable.in this case,the plaintiffs requested coordination of the cases for all purposes.the majority reads that phrase as impli
