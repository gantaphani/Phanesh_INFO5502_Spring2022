in this negligence case the trial court denied plaintiffs motion to certify a class,finding no community of interest existed and the class action vehicle was not a superior method of resolving the claims of putative class members.because we conclude the order is based on improper criteria and is not supported by substantial evidence,we reverse and direct the trial court to grant the motion.
facts and proceedings below 
the following allegations,facts,and evidence are drawn from the fifth amended complaint,the motion seeking leave to file the fifth amended complaint,and the motion to certify a class.
defendant los angeles gay lesbian center defendant or the center provides medical services in los angeles county.from january to march defendant treated with bicillin more than patients presenting with confirmed syphilis infection or reported sexual contact with someone who was known or suspected to be infected with syphilis.bicillin is not recommended for such use.the proper formulation would have been bicillin.though both medications contain the same amount of penicillin,bicillin is a mixture of short and penicillin,while bicillin is composed wholly of penicillin.robert bolan,the center medical director,admitted in deposition that bicillin was incorrect for the condition treated.
after defendant learned of its mistake in march,in coordination with the los angeles county health department and the centers for disease control and prevention it drafted and issued press releases to advise the public of the error and attempted directly to contact every patient who had been treated to offer retreatment and retesting.to provide consistent information,defendant prepared common language to be included in letters to patients and developed two scripts to be used in telephone calls.
the letter sent to plaintiff raymundo aguilar read in pertinent part as follows we recently reviewed our records and found that the preparation of penicillin you received at the gay lesbian center for treatment of syphilis was below the dosage recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc.to assure that we are addressing this situation,we urge you to come in as soon as possible for evaluation,repeat blood testing and.we urge you to call the center to schedule an appointment for follow up and more information.
approximately patients returned to the center and were offered retesting and retreatment regardless of their medical condition or the retesting results.retesting involved a blood draw and,in cases,a lumbar puncture.retreatment involved receiving between one and three intramuscular injections of bicillin.
plaintiffs george bomersheim,rox brassfield,aguilar,and odie rauch were treated with bicillin and then retested and retreated with bicillin.they filed this action on march.the fifth amended complaint is operative.in it,plaintiffs allege one cause of action,for negligence.they allege defendant accepted a duty to provide medical care consistent with the applicable standard of care and breached that duty by negligently administer ing the bicillin.they allege they suffered damages associated with the notification and retreatment process and underwent a retreatment process with proper medication,and thus suffered damages in an amount subject to proof at trial.
plaintiffs do not seek damages associated with the initial mistreatment.
bomersheim,brassfield and aguilar seek to represent all california residents who,from to,received from center an improper dosage of penicillin for the treatment of syphilis,specifically bicillin,rather than bicillin,and who therefore underwent the retreatment process,whether at the center or elsewhere.they seek special and general damages,attorney fees,costs of suit,and any other appropriate relief.
in its answer,defendant denied each and every allegation in the fifth amended complaint denied plaintiffs suffered any injury or loss if they did suffer injury or loss,denied that the injury or loss was caused by reason of any act or omission on the part of defendant and asserted that any injury or loss was the natural or expected result of reasonable treatment rendered for the disease or condition.
soon after filing the complaint,plaintiffs sought to discover treatment and contact information for putative class members and,when defendant resisted,filed motions to compel discovery.defendant opposed the motions.after several rounds of briefing and the passage of almost two years,defendant apparently made some production,though the record on appeal does not reflect its content.
plaintiffs moved for certification in august.the motion was supported by plaintiffs declarations and citations to the deposition testimony of bolan and darrel cummings,defendant chief of staff.
defendant opposed the motion.it argued that because no class representative or putative class member contracted syphilis as a result of administration of a medication,a nonstandard dosage of penicillin,no one suffered any injury supporting a claim,and because there was an absence of injury,no class was ascertainable.in support of defendant absence of injury argument,bolan declared that blood testing,lumbar puncture and retreatment are aspects of medical care which are generally considered to be innocuous and generally associated with very minimal discomfort or pain.he further declared that no individual reported any untoward effects as a result of the retesting or retreatment.based on bolan review of the center records and his personal performance of about half of the lumbar punctures,no patients reported headaches as a result of the lumbar puncture.bolan opined that the inconvenience of returning to the center for retesting and retreatment was likely minimal in most instances.he represented that no one who returned to the center had developed syphilis.
defendant argued causation could not be established on classwide proof because some putative class members,including plaintiffs aguilar and rauch,received retreatment from other providers before they discovered they had been mistreated at the center.defendant also argued individual issues predominated because the putative class presented up to claims of convoluted and subjective claims of emotional distress,all based upon variations in individual responses to information that a patient had received a dosage,had been requested to return for retesting,and had been offered retreatment.
in a supplemental brief in opposition to the certification motion,defendant argued that its only duty to plaintiffs was treatment of syphilis,and i t is undisputed that the center complied with its duty for the treatment of syphilis,even though it used a dosage of medication to do so.as bolan declared,there was no evidence of treatment failure.bolan also declared that t esting following treatment of a syphilis infection is common practice.there are occasions when treatment of syphilis with the recommended medication does not produce results indicating effective treatment.to assess whether treatment has been adequate,such tests are an important and usual part of the treatment process.
in their reply,plaintiffs argued they suffered physical injury from the retesting and hurtful retreatment process a second,otherwise unnecessary,series of painful and sickening bicillin injections.they argued that b y definition,the class is composed of individuals who had to suffer the retreatment process as a direct result of having been administered the wrong medication by defendant and describe how the bicillin injections were painful and made them sick.were they given the correct medication in the first instance,plaintiffs argued,they would not have had to endure the pain,physical changes and distress brought on by the retreatment process.plaintiffs stated they were not making any damage claim based on the fear of possibly developing a disease.
plaintiffs reply declarations described their reactions to retreatment.each received three intramuscular bicillin injections over a several week period and experienced aches,sweating,and pain in the injection site.
the declarations were silent as to what reactions plaintiffs had to the administration of bicillin.
the trial court found the putative class to be ascertainable and sufficiently numerous,bomersheim and brassfield presented typical claims,and bomersheim would adequately represent the class.the court found aguilar claims were potentially atypical because he asserted that his syphilis had not been cured by the administration of bicillin,and thus potentially had a treatment failure claim.the court found brassfield was not a suitable class representative because he had recently been convicted for possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute,a felony and crime of moral turpitude.plaintiffs do not challenge these rulings.
the trial court found no community of interest existed because individual issues of causation and damages predominated over common issues of duty and breach.it noted that the putative class includes california residents who received from center an improper dosage of penicillin for the treatment of syphilis and who therefore underwent the retesting retreatment process italics added.individuals who underwent the retesting and retreatment process for reasons other than having initially received improper treatment,the court observed,presumably did so because of new syphilis infections or new contacts with persons known or suspected to be infected with syphilis.under the proposed class definition,they would not be eligible to be members of the class,so an inquiry would be required to determine if they sought prior to their receipt of the advisory letters assuming they did receive them.fns.omitted.
further,the trial court found that proof of damages for pain and suffering would require the personal testimony of each class member,particularly given that two named plaintiffs claimed to have had transitory physical reactions to the bicillin injections,one putative representative aguilar apparently had a treatment failure claim,and t he evidence suggests,without clearly proving,that individual reactions to bicillin vary,and some persons may suffer little or no discomfort,while others may be more severely affected.
the court found class treatment of putative members claims would not be superior to individual treatment because the amount of damages potentially to,by one individual action feasible,especially if more plaintiffs joined the action.and apparently relying on plaintiff counsel representation that defendant had virtually admitted duty and breach of duty,the court found issues of duty and breach could be formally established by admissions or summary adjudication.the court concluded,while issues of duty and breach of duty present common questions,the issues of causation and damages require individualized testimony from every single putative class member.the individual issues in this case necessarily overwhelm the common issues.
the trial court denied the certification motion on april.
discussion 
standard for certification 
under section of the code of civil procedure,a class action is authorized when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court.the party seeking certification has the burden to establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among class members.drug stores,superior court cal th.

ascertainability,numerosity,typicality and adequacy of representation are not disputed.
as stated,the trial court found the putative class is ascertainable and sufficiently numerous and one class representative,bomersheim,makes typical claims and is an adequate representative.plaintiffs make no claim of error in these findings.we thus turn to the trial court predominance findings.
commonality 
in denying plaintiffs motion,the trial court found that common questions did not predominate because each class member would be required to present individual proof relating to causation and damages.because trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action,they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification.citation.nevertheless,we must examine the trial court reasons for denying class certification.citations.in particular,we must consider whether the record contains substantial evidence to support the trial court predominance finding,as a certification ruling not supported by substantial evidence can not stand.citations.lockheed martin superior court cal th,lockheed.even a ruling supported by substantial evidence will be reversed if improper criteria were used or erroneous legal assumptions made.linder.thrifty oil cal th.any valid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.caro procter gamble th.
every certification inquiry must begin with an examination of plaintiffs claims.plaintiffs allege that as a direct and proximate result of receiving bicillin rather than bicillin,they underwent a retreatment process,and thus suffered damages they do not allege the original treatment failed,only that because it raised the possibility of failure,retesting and retreatment was required as a prophylactic.retesting consisted of a blood draw and,in cases,a lumbar puncture.retreatment consisted of a series of painful injections of bicillin.to prevail,plaintiffs will have to prove the elements of any negligence cause of action,duty,breach of duty,proximate cause and damages.citation fn.addressing whether questions common to the class predominate over questions affecting members individually,therefore,required the trial court to consider these elements.lockheed,supra,cal th at.
duty and breach 
whether defendant owed a duty of care to putative class members is a question of law for the court.whether it breached that duty is a question of fact.defendant proffers no reason why individualized analysis is required to answer either question.as it is undisputed that all putative class members were defendant patients,all sought treatment for syphilis,and all underwent similar treatment,retesting and retreatment regimens,the trial court rationally concluded the duty and breach elements will be susceptible to common proof.
