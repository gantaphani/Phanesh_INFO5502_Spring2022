the trial court certified this case as a nationwide class action without determining the force and effect of contractual agreements that,according to the defendant,would require the application of different states laws in the action.the court of appeal found certification was proper because the defendant had failed to show that the contractually selected laws would lead to different results.we conclude the certification order must be vacated,for it was based upon an incomplete and erroneous analysis of factors relevant to certification.
factual and procedural background 
american savings bank,now washington mutual bank,fa hereafter,asb,originated home mortgage loans in california,arizona,colorado,and texas,and purchased loans from other lenders throughout the united states.asb standard loan documents included a deed of trust that requires the mortgagor to maintain hazard insurance on the secured property and provides that if the mortgagor fails to do so,then lender may do and pay for whatever is necessary to protect the value of the property and lender rights in the property,and a ny amounts so disbursed shall become additional debt of the mortgagor,secured by the deed of trust.the deed of trust also contained a clause stating this security instrument shall be governed by federal law and the law of the jurisdiction in which the secured property is located.
jayne briseno sued asb on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,unfair business practice violations under california unfair competition law ucl bus,et unjust enrichment,and conversion.according to the second amended complaint,asb maintained a practice of procuring expensive replacement insurance forced order insurance when mortgagors defaulted on their loan obligation to maintain appropriate policies of hazard insurance for their properties.the amount asb charged the mortgagor for forced order insurance typically was two to five times more than the amount of the premium on the original lapsed policy would have been.the crux of the dispute is whether asb victimized its borrowers by systematically overcharging for the replacement insurance coverage and secretly profiting through cash commissions or services from the vendors of the replacement insurance.
in,briseno moved to certify this case as a nationwide class action,comprised of at least mortgagors located throughout the united states who were charged excessive premiums for forced order insurance since,excluding those who received refunds of the entire premium.she argued,among other things,that california could constitutionally exercise jurisdiction over the claims of nonresident mortgagors and that california could apply its own substantive law unless asb proved otherwise under california conflict of laws rules.asb responded that common questions of law do not predominate for a nationwide class because enforcement of the provision in each mortgagor loan documents meant that the action would entail the application of the laws of all states.
the trial court ordered certification of a nationwide class action without purporting to decide what law applies to the claims of the class members.after the court of appeal summarily denied asb petition for extraordinary relief,we granted asb petition for review and transferred the case back to the court of appeal with instructions to issue an alternative writ.
after complying with our directive,the court of appeal denied asb writ petition and discharged the alternative writ.the court affirmed the certification order,reasoning that a t most the choice of law clause raises the potential that another state law might apply.it concluded,in effect,that a defendant who opposes nationwide class certification on the basis of agreements has the burden of demonstrating that the contractually selected laws will lead to results different from california law and render a nationwide class action unsuitable.we granted asb petition for review.
discussion 
section of the code of civil procedure authorizes class suits in california when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court.the burden is on the party seeking certification to establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the class members.linder thrifty oil cal th,d,richmond dart industries,cal d.
to establish the requisite community of interest,the proponent of certification must show,inter alia,that questions of law or fact common to the class predominate over the questions affecting the individual members hereafter sometimes referred to as predominance.see richmond dart industries,supra,cal d at.in essence,this means each member must not be required to individually litigate numerous and substantial questions to determine his or her right to recover following the class judgment and the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,must be sufficiently numerous and substantial to make the class action advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.city of san jose superior court cal d.a class action should be certified only if it will provide substantial benefits both to the courts and the litigants.linder thrifty oil,supra,cal th at,d,city of san jose superior court,supra,cal d at.
because trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action,they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification.linder thrifty oil,supra,cal th at,d.nonetheless,an order based upon improper criteria or incorrect assumptions calls for reversal even though there may be substantial evidence to support the court order.id.at,d.
asb contends that,where putative class members across the nation have contractually agreed in advance to application of their own state law,the trial court must apply the analysis set forth in nedlloyd lines superior court cal th,d,nedlloyd when evaluating a certification motion.here,asb claims,both the trial court and the court of appeal impermissibly sidestepped nedlloyd analysis and erroneously concluded that,even if class claims are subject to enforceable clauses,the clauses are of no significance to the certification decision unless their proponent demonstrates that the contractually designated law is different from california law and when applied will lead to a different result.asb requests that we reverse the denial of its petition for a writ of mandate and remand this matter to the court of appeal with instructions as to the appropriate analysis for the trial court to undertake.
this case presents two pivotal questions arising when certification of a nationwide or multistate class action is sought.first,what is the appropriate analysis for selecting applicable law in a class action where putative class members have contractually agreed to application of another state law second,what analysis must be undertaken in the event litigation of the class action will necessitate application of the laws of multiple states we address these questions in turn 
selection of applicable law 
california has two different analyses for selecting which law should be applied in an action.when the parties have an agreement that another jurisdiction law will govern their disputes,the appropriate analysis for the trial court to undertake is set forth in nedlloyd,supra,cal th,d,which addresses the enforceability of contractual provisions.alternatively,when there is no advance agreement on applicable law,but the action involves the claims of residents from outside california,the trial court may analyze the governmental interests of the various jurisdictions involved to select the most appropriate law.as we shall explain,a trial court considering nationwide class certification might be required to utilize both analyses.
agreements 
to date,most of the california decisions that have considered nationwide class action certification have not involved a contractual clause.those decisions,however,perceive that a reasoned analysis regarding the applicable law is critical in actions seeking to assert claims on behalf of nonresidents,clothesrigger,gte d.clothesrigger see norwest mortgage,superior court th,d although contractual clauses involved,certification reversed on alternative ground.discerning the applicable law is an important task in class actions,for if the claims of nonresident class members will require adjudication under the laws of the members home states,the trial court must ascertain the degree of complexity arising from the need to apply those laws in order to make an informed decision on certification.clothesrigger,supra,d at.the trial court should deny certification if it determines that such complexity results in common legal questions not predominating or makes nationwide class litigation unmanageable.see canon,superior court th,d canon permitting resolution of such issues at the pleading stage osborne subaru of america,d.rose medtronics,d.conversely,the court may certify the nationwide class despite such complexity if it determines the legal questions are sufficiently similar to be manageable and all other requirements for certification are satisfied.clothesrigger,supra,d at.
we agree that the determination is of central importance to issues of predominance and manageability where certification of a nationwide class is sought.accordingly,we conclude trial courts considering such certification generally must apply the analysis set forth in nedlloyd,supra,cal th,d,to evaluate disputed claims that class causes of action are subject to enforceable agreements.
pursuant to nedlloyd,the trial court should first examine the clause and ascertain whether the advocate of the clause has met its burden of establishing that the various claims of putative class members fall within its scope.see nedlloyd,supra,cal th at,d.in nedlloyd we found,as a matter of california law,that a clause negotiated by sophisticated business entities was phrased broadly enough to encompass the plaintiff fiduciary duty claim,in addition to its claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing id.at,d.as we explained,w hen a rational businessperson enters into an agreement establishing a transaction or relationship and provides that disputes arising from the agreement shall be governed by the law of an identified jurisdiction,the logical conclusion is that he or she intended that law to apply to all disputes arising out of the transaction or relationship.id.at,d.
if the trial court finds that the class claims fall within the scope of a clause,it must next evaluate the clause enforceability pursuant to the analytical approach reflected in section,subdivision of the restatement second of conflict of laws restatement under that approach,the court must first determine whether the chosen state has a substantial relationship to the parties or their transaction,or whether there is any other reasonable basis for the parties choice of law.if neither of these tests is met,that is the end of the inquiry,and the court need not enforce the parties choice of law.if,however,either test is met,the court must next determine whether the chosen state law is contrary to a fundamental policy of california.if there is no such conflict,the court shall enforce the parties choice of law.if,however,there is a fundamental conflict with california law,the court must then determine whether california has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue,subd.if california has a materially greater interest than the chosen state,the choice of law shall not be enforced,for the obvious reason that in such circumstance we will decline to enforce a law contrary to this state fundamental policy.nedlloyd,supra,cal th at,d,fns.omitted.
as nedlloyd,recognizes,the foregoing approach reflect s strong policy considerations favoring the enforcement of freely negotiated clauses.nedlloyd,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,if the proponent of the clause here,the party opposing nationwide class certification demonstrates that the chosen state has a substantial relationship to the parties or their transaction,or that a reasonable basis otherwise exists for the choice of law,the parties choice generally will be enforced unless the other side can establish both that the chosen law is contrary to a fundamental policy of california and that california has a materially greater interest in the determination of the particular issue.see id.at,d,upholding application of chosen law where party opposing the clause failed to make such showings.
amici curiae in support of briseno argue that nedlloyd analysis should not apply to provisions in consumer adhesion contracts.in their view,nedlloyd test was designed to apply only to freely and voluntarily agreements between equally powerful and sophisticated commercial entities.
even though nedlloyd was decided in the context of a negotiated arm length transaction between sophisticated business entities,its analysis appears suitable for a broader range of contract transactions.california,we observe,has no public policy against the enforcement of provisions contained in contracts of adhesion where they are otherwise appropriate.see bos material handling,crown controls d.gamer dupont glore forgan,d.windsor mills,collins aikman d,fn.more importantly,nedlloyd analysis contains safeguards to protect contracting parties,including consumers,against agreements that are unreasonable or in contravention of a fundamental california policy.nedlloyd,supra,cal th at,d.under nedlloyd,which adopted the restatement approach and found the enforceability of clauses closely related to that of clauses nedlloyd,supra,cal th at,d,the weaker party to an adhesion contract may seek to avoid enforcement of a provision therein by establishing that substantial injustice would result from its enforcement,com.b,or that superior power was unfairly used in imposing the contract see business products services,ricoh th,d indicating that evidence of unfair use of bargaining power may defeat enforcement of a clause contained in an adhesion contract.in light of these protections,we conclude nedlloyd analysis is properly applied in the context of consumer adhesion contracts.
finally,we address the court of appeal suggestion that california businesses dealing with mass groups of consumers should not be permitted to rely on clauses as a means of avoiding involvement in a nationwide class action.the point is not well taken.class actions are provided only as a means to enforce substantive law.altering the substantive law to accommodate procedure would be to confuse the means with the sacrifice the goal for the going.city of san jose superior court,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted see granberry islay investments cal th,d.consequently,an otherwise enforceable agreement may not be disregarded merely because it may hinder the prosecution of a multistate or nationwide class action or result in the exclusion of nonresident consumers from a class action.
of course,agreements have no effect in a class action if the trial court determines that they are unenforceable or that class claims fall outside their scope.nonetheless,if the class action opponent continues to invoke the application of foreign law to the claims of class members,the trial court remains obligated to analyze the governmental interests of the various jurisdictions involved to determine whose law is more properly applied.
governmental interests and comparative impairment 
in phillips petroleum shutts,d,the united states supreme court held that a forum state may apply its own substantive law to the claims of a nationwide class without violating the federal due process clause or full faith and credit clause if the state has a significant contact or significant aggregation of contacts to the claims of each class member such that application of the forum law is not arbitrary or unfair.id.at.stonewall surplus lines ins.johnson controls,th,d.but even where its own law may be constitutionally applied,california follows a governmental interest analysis to address conflict of laws claims and ascertain the most appropriate law applicable to the issues where there is no effective agreement.clothesrigger,supra,d at.see generally application group,hunter group,th,d cases involving clauses present an exception to application of governmental interest approach stonewall surplus lines ins.johnson controls,supra,th at,d.
g enerally speaking the forum will apply its own rule of decision unless a party litigant timely invokes the law of a foreign state.in such event that party must demonstrate that the latter rule of decision will further the interest of the foreign state and therefore that it is an appropriate one for the forum to apply to the case before it.bernhard harrah club cal d,quoting hurtado superior court cal d,hurtado offshore rental continental oil cal d,fn,cautioning against an unduly literal reading of quoted statements and noting that courts may make their own determination of the policies and interests of the involved states.under the first step of the governmental interest approach,the foreign law proponent must identify the applicable rule of law in each potentially concerned state and must show it materially differs from the law of california.the fact that two or more states are involved does not in itself indicate there is a conflict of laws problem.hurtado,supra,cal d at.indeed,if the relevant laws of each state are identical,there is no problem and the trial court may find california law applicable to class claims.see bernhard harrah club,supra,cal d at.
if,however,the trial court finds the laws are materially different,it must proceed to the second step and determine what interest,if any,each state has in having its own law applied to the case.hurtado,supra,cal d at.despite materially different laws,there is still no problem in choosing the applicable rule of law where only one of the states has an interest in having its law applied.see bernhard harrah club,supra,cal d at.this means the trial court may properly find california law applicable without proceeding to the third step in the analysis if the foreign law proponent fails to identify any actual conflict or to establish the other state interest in having its own law applied.see bernhard harrah club,supra,cal d at,in re title ins.th,d.
only if the trial court determines that the laws are materially different and that each state has an interest in having its own law applied,thus reflecting an actual conflict,must the court take the final step and select the law of the state whose interests would be more impaired if its law were not applied.bernhard harrah club,supra,cal d at,see also offshore rental continental oil,supra,cal d at.in making this comparative impairment analysis,the trial court must determine the relative commitment of the respective states to the laws involved and consider the history and current status of the states laws and the function and purpose of those laws.offshore rental continental oil,supra,cal d at.these rules apply whether the dispute arises out of contract or tort application group,hunter group,supra,th at,d bernkrant fowler cal d,and a separate conflict of laws inquiry must be made with respect to each issue in the case application group,hunter group,supra,th at,d beech aircraft superior court d.
amici curiae in support of asb argue that the burdens contemplated in hurtado,supra,cal d,should not apply when a nationwide class action is at issue.in their view,the law of the other states in which class members reside should presumably govern their claims unless the proponent of class certification affirmatively demonstrates that california law is more properly applied.to support this position,amici curiae point out that nationwide class actions may be,and often are,used to resolve the claims of nonresidents who lack the minimum contacts in the forum state normally needed to support personal jurisdiction.see phillips petroleum shutts,supra,at.in such cases,they argue,california may not constitutionally weigh the scales in favor of applying its own law.we disagree.
as amici curiae acknowledge,and as already noted above,a forum state may constitutionally apply its own law to the claims of nonresident class members if the state has a significant contact or significant aggregation of contacts to the claims asserted by each member of the plaintiff class,contacts creating state interests,in order to ensure that the choice of the forum law is not arbitrary or unfair.phillips petroleum shutts,supra,at.accordingly,so long as the requisite significant contacts to california exist,a showing that is properly borne by the class action proponent,california may constitutionally require the other side to shoulder the burden of demonstrating that foreign law,rather than california law,should apply to class claims 
in sum,in the absence of an effective agreement to the contrary,california law may be used on a classwide basis so long as its application is not arbitrary or unfair with respect to nonresident class members phillips petroleum shutts,supra,at,and so long as the interests of other states are not found to outweigh california interest in having its law applied bernhard harrah club,supra,cal d at,clothesrigger,supra,d at.
certification considerations where laws of multiple states found applicable in action 
as indicated,and conflict of laws issues are significant when certification of a nationwide class is sought.in the event a trial court determines that class claims will require adjudication under the laws of multiple states,the court must then ascertain whether variations exist among the applicable laws.although the involvement of more than one state law does not make a class action per se unmanageable,any variances among state laws must be examined to determine whether common questions will predominate over individual issues and whether litigation of a nationwide class may be managed fairly and efficiently.
in california it is settled that the class action proponent bears the burden of establishing the propriety of class certification.linder thrifty oil,supra,cal th at,d,richmond dart industries,supra,cal d at.although such burden clearly contemplates a demonstration of predominance and manageability clothesrigger,supra,d at.canon,supra,th at,d osborne subaru of america,supra,d at.rose medtronics,supra,d at,there are few california decisions specifically addressing how the proponent may meet this burden.
the procedures articulated in the consumer legal remedies act,et provide no aid on this particular issue.therefore,we may look to the procedures governing federal class actions under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure rule for guidance.linder thrifty oil,supra,cal th at,d,civil service employees ins.superior court cal d,fn.
our survey of the relevant federal decisions,those involving multistate class actions under rule b discloses that,as in california,it is incumbent upon the class action proponent to prove each required element for class certification,including predominance of common issues and manageability.in re american medical systems,cir,see castano american tobacco cir,commander properties beech aircraft,but see maywalt parker parsley petroleum,manageability concerns regarding pendent state law claims found speculative since court declined to select applicable law at time of certification.for a significant number of federal courts,this means the proponent must creditably demonstrate,through an extensive analysis of state law variances,that class certification does not present insuperable obstacles.walsh ford motor cir,relying upon in re school asbestos litigation cir,weikel tower semiconductor,in re jackson national life insurance.premium litigation,in re ford motor bronco ii product liability litigation,see valentino,cir,castano american tobacco,supra,at in re american medical systems,supra,at priest zayre,but see barker fsc securities,pendent state claims certified where defendants failed to establish material state law differences longden sunderman,noting defendant failure to show substantive variations in state fraud laws dekro stern brothers,same.
on this score,the presentation must be sufficient to permit the district court,at the time of certification,to make a detailed assessment of how the difficulties posed by the variations in state law will be managed at trial.castano american tobacco,supra,at in re jackson national life insurance.premium litigation,supra,at chin chrysler,tylka gerber products,in re stucco litigation.for example,certification may be appropriate if the class action proponent shows that state law variations can be effectively managed through the creation of a small number of subclasses grouping the states that have similar legal doctrines.see walsh ford motor,supra,at tylka gerber products,supra,at in re telectronics pacing systems.
a number of federal courts also caution that if more than a few of the laws of the states differ,the district court may face an impossible task of instructing a jury on the relevant law.in re american medical systems,supra,at chin chrysler,supra,at.to meet such concerns,the district court possesses discretion to require the class action proponent to submit sample jury instructions and special verdict forms demonstrating how class causes of action could be presented to a jury for resolution in a way that fairly represents the law of the states while not overwhelming jurors with hundreds of interrogatories and a verdict form as large as an almanac.chin chrysler,supra,at see in re stucco litigation,supra,at.this call for a manageable set of jury instructions presupposes that even slight variations and nuances in applicable state laws may affect predominance and manageability.in re stucco litigation,supra,at see also matter of rorer cir,fisher squibb,tylka gerber products,supra,at concluding that plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that the nuances of consumer fraud statutes and common laws are manageable in re telectronics pacing systems,while even slight variations may be significant and relevant with respect to manageability issues,those that are insignificant or unimportant to the issues at stake should not preclude class action certification 
the foregoing decisions stress that a district court considering certification of a nationwide class can not simply rely on counsel assurances of manageability.castano american tobacco,supra,at in re jackson national life insurance.premium litigation,supra,at chin chrysler,supra,at in re telectronics pacing systems,supra,at.put another way,the court can not accept on faith an assertion that variations in state laws relevant to the case do not exist or are insignificant rather,the party seeking certification must affirmatively demonstrate the accuracy of the assertion.castano american tobacco,supra,at walsh ford motor,supra,at.moreover,it is insufficient to merely refer the district court to densely worded articles,graphs,and charts pertaining to each state laws.as one court explained,class action proponents should not expect the court to ferret through,disseminate,and craft manageable schemes from such materials when that burden clearly rests with the proponents.tylka gerber products,supra,at,fn.the courts in several of our sister states are in accord,ex parte green tree financial so d,borrowers failed to establish that state law variations would not swamp common issues and defeat predominance in action for breach of contract,breach of duty,civil conspiracy,negligence,and wantonness against lender for allegedly improper use of insurance carroll cellco partnership,criticizing trial court for glossing over potential state law differences and speculating on a hypothetical system to deal with factual differences duvall trw,ohio app d,plaintiff failed to sustain burden where he presented no analysis on state law variations regarding strict liability,negligence,breach of warranty,and punitive damages.
in canon,supra,th,d,the court of appeal held that a trial court may,at the pleading stage,consider whether certification of a nationwide class would require application of numerous different state rules of law and whether california has a special obligation to undertake the massive burden of such litigation id.at,d.relying on two federal authorities,the court indicated that a party seeking certification bears the burden of demonstrating how subclasses could be formed to alleviate problems presented by state law variances,relying upon walsh ford motor,supra,at and in re ford motor.ignition switch products.the court issued a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order denying the defendants motion to strike from the complaint all references to a nationwide class.the trial court was instructed to reconsider the motion after giving the class action proponents an opportunity to present a more thorough analysis of the conflicting laws of the various states,and to show how subclasses can be created,or if they would be feasible,to maintain a class action.canon,supra,th at fn,d see norwest mortgage,superior court,supra,th at,d remanding with directions to undertake canon analysis in the event plaintiffs sought certification of class with nonresident members and laws of other states were found controlling.
like canon,we favor adoption of the type of burdens articulated in the federal decisions above.accordingly,we hold that a class action proponent must credibly demonstrate,through a thorough analysis of the applicable state laws,that state law variations will not swamp common issues and defeat predominance.additionally,the proponent presentation must be sufficient to permit the trial court,at the time of certification,to make a detailed assessment of how any state law differences could be managed fairly and efficiently at trial,for example,through the creation of a manageable number of subclasses trial courts,in assessing the propriety of nationwide class certification,must consider these factors,as well as all the other factors relevant to certification,including the potential recovery of each individual claimant and whether the proposed class suit is the only effective way to redress the alleged wrongdoing or to prevent unjust advantage to the defendant.see linder thrifty oil,supra,cal th at,d,blue chip stamps superior court cal d.adherence to these procedures should ensure that nationwide class actions are certified only where they will result in substantial benefits both to the litigants and the courts.see city of san jose superior court,supra,cal d at.
briseno argues that a defendant should not be able to defeat nationwide class certification without affirmatively showing the existence of differences among applicable state laws as contemplated by hurtado,supra,cal d at pages.we reject this argument for three reasons.
first,the showing required in hurtado,supra,cal d,is relevant to the issue of which state law is more appropriately applied to the claims of nonresident class members it would serve no useful purpose after a trial court has decided to apply the laws of other states.such a rule would,in effect,impermissibly relieve the class action proponent of the burden of establishing predominance and manageability.
second,we are not convinced by those of briseno authorities in which courts certified multistate class actions without determining the applicable law or delving into manageability issues,longden sunderman,supra,at in re lilco securities litigation,even if states laws must be applied to pendent state claims,decertification is an option if material variations render their adjudication unmanageable.as discussed ante,in part a,a trial court can not reach an informed decision on predominance and manageability without first determining whether class claims will require adjudication under the laws of other jurisdictions and then evaluating the resulting complexity where those laws must be applied.clothesrigger,supra,d at.see canon,supra,th at,d osborne subaru of america,supra,d at.rose medtronics,supra,d at.that a trial court retains the power to consider decertification when a class action later proves to be unmanageable see vasquez superior court cal d,should not serve to lessen the court initial responsibility to grant certification only where all of the requirements for certification have been met.
third,several of bri
