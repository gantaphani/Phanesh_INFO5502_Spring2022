this case turns on the standards for showing that a class action has an amount in controversy of more than million,which is the threshold for enabling a case to be removed to federal court under the class action fairness act of cafa.because we conclude that the defendants did not meet their burden of showing that the amount in controversy in this class action exceeds that threshold at least at this stage in the litigation we agree with the plaintiffs that removal was improper.we thus do not reach the other issues that the district court resolved in dismissing this suit,and we remand with instructions to the district court to remand the case to state court for lack of jurisdiction.
the defendants are business entities that organize physically challenging obstacle course events in various locations in the united states.the four named plaintiffs registered to participate in one of those events the mudderella event scheduled to take place on september,in haverhill,massachusetts.
this suit began in massachusetts superior court.the plaintiffs complaint alleged that,on august,the defendants notified the plaintiffs that the event had been moved approximately twelve miles from haverhill,to amesbury,massachusetts the complaint also alleged that,on august,just a week before the event,the defendants again notified the plaintiffs that the event had been moved,this time to westbrook,maine,which is miles from haverhill.the complaint alleged that,as a result of that second and final change in location,the four named plaintiffs were unable to participate in the event,and that the defendants refused to refund the plaintiffs their registration fees.
the complaint asserts various claims under massachusetts law.those claims are breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,unjust enrichment,and violation of the massachusetts consumer protection act.laws ch.
of particular significance to this appeal is what the complaint pleads with respect to relief.the complaint states that those seeking relief are,pursuant to rule of the massachusetts rules of civil procedure,not just the four named plaintiffs but also 
all persons who paid registration fees other sums to defendants to participate in mudderella boston at kimball farm in haverhill and did not participate at the changed location 
all persons who participated in mudderella boston in westbrook,maine and traveled additional distance due to the change in location and thereby incurred added expenses including,but not limited to gas,food lodging 
such other class,classes,or as certified by the court.
the complaint further states that the class seeks,in addition to damages in amounts to be determined at trial,an unspecified amount in reasonable attorneys fees and costs,restitution,disgorgement,rescission,a permanent injunction prohibiting defendants from engaging in the conduct described herein,and such other relief as the court deems just.
the plaintiffs served the complaint on the defendants in november.the defendants then timely removed the case to federal court.see b.the defendants asserted that removal was permitted under the class action fairness act of cafa,which provides for federal subject matter jurisdiction over class actions alleging claims where certain conditions are met,including minimal diversity between parties and that the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of.d.
the plaintiffs moved to remand the case to state court.the plaintiffs sole argument for remand was that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under cafa because the defendants had failed to show that over million was in controversy.the defendants responded with estimates of the amount in controversy that were based on the references in the plaintiffs complaint to registration fees and added expenses,including,but not limited to gas,food,lodging.
the district court denied the plaintiffs motion to remand the case to state court.the district court explanation,in its entirety,was that the d efendants hav e shown a reasonable probability that the amount in controversy in this case exceeds million.
alongside the dispute over jurisdiction,the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case and compel mediation and,if mediation were to fail,arbitration of the plaintiffs claims in accordance with the terms of the agreement that the plaintiffs entered into when they registered for the mudderella event.the district court granted that motion.
the plaintiffs then appealed.they argue that the district court erred in concluding that the defendants met their burden of showing that over million is in controversy in this matter and thus that federal subject matter jurisdiction exists under cafa.the plaintiffs also contend that if cafa jurisdiction exists,the district court erred in dismissing the case and compelling mediation and arbitration of the dispute.because we agree with the plaintiffs on the first point,we do not reach the second.
we begin with the standard of review.we have distinguished between a district court conclusion regarding the ultimate question whether it has subject matter jurisdiction under cafa and the district court resolution of specific factual disputes in the course of reaching that conclusion.see amoche guar.trust life ins,cir.the former determination,we have explained,is evaluated de novo,while the latter is reviewed for clear error.id.
as we have noted,the district court order in this case was short it held that the d efendants hav e shown a reasonable probability that the amount in controversy in this case exceeds million.because the district court simply resolved the ultimate question of the sum or value in controversy in this matter,our review is entirely de novo.id.at see also romulus cvs pharmacy,cir.
cafa was enacted with the stated purpose of expanding the number of class actions that could be heard in federal court.amoche,at,stating that,i n cafa,congress expressly expanded federal jurisdiction largely for the benefit of defendants against a background of what it considered to be abusive class action practices in state courts,which had harmed class members with legitimate claims and defendants that had acted responsibly,adversely affected interstate commerce,and undermined public respect for our judicial system alteration omitted quoting cafa,a,stat.congress effectuated that purpose by imposing only a minimal diversity requirement,eliminating the statutory time limit for removal,and providing for interlocutory appeal of a federal district court remand order.id.at citing d,b,c.
but congress did impose various limits on cafa reach.and among them is the one that is relevant in this case that the amount in controversy exceed million.see d.
the defendants bear the burden of showing that this requirement has been met,as they seek removal under cafa.see amoche,at justifying this burden in part by the general rule of deference to the plaintiff chosen forum.to meet that burden,the defendants must show a reasonable probability that more than million is in dispute in this case.id.at.that standard is for all practical purposes identical to the preponderance of the evidence standard.id.yet because questions of removal are typically decided at the pleadings stage where little or no evidence has yet been produced,the removing defendant burden is better framed in terms of a reasonable probability,not a preponderance of the evidence.id.
the decision as to whether the defendants have met their burden may well require analysis of what both parties have shown.id.at.thus,it is not enough for the plaintiffs to m erely label the defendant showing as speculative without discrediting the facts upon which it rests.id.but in evaluating what both parties have shown,we may consider which party has better access to the relevant information.id.
applying those standards to the facts of this case,we conclude that a remand to state court is required.the defendants argument that over million is in controversy in this matter is based on what the defendants contend is a reasonable estimate of the registration fees in controversy and a reasonable estimate of the gas,food,and lodging expenses that the put
