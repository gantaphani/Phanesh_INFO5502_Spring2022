central advisory council cac,not a party to this action in the district court,appeals the district court denial of its motion to amend a order entered by the district court as part of its ongoing remedial relief in this class action brought against the chicago housing authority for de jure segregation in public housing.because cac is not a party for purposes of appeal,we dismiss this appeal.
backgrounda.history of the gautreaux action 
in,a class of individuals who either were living in chicago public housing or on the wait list for public housing gautreaux plaintiffs brought this action against the chicago housing authority cha.they alleged that cha was practicing de jure housing segregation.see generally gautreaux chicago hous.in,the district court granted summary judgment to the gautreaux plaintiffs,finding that cha had selected housing sites using race as a criteria in violation of the fourteenth amendment.id.at.
in the remedial phase of the proceedings,the district court entered an order that required the construction of three housing units in an area where the population is less than general public housing area for every unit built in an area where the population is greater than limited public housing area.see gautreaux chicago hous.in the decades following,this order has been modified several times to reflect changes in neighborhoods,circumstances and community housing needs.
in,the district court appointed daniel levin as the receiver receiver for the development of all new,housing by the cha.the receiver was given broad power to develop and administer the new housing developments.
b.the central advisory council 
cac is an organization representing tenants currently residing in cha public housing.tenants in each public housing development,including the cabrini green homes and robert taylor homes,have formed resident councils whose memberships are limited to those persons residing in that housing development,as provided in the applicable united states department of housing and urban development hud regulations.see.each of these councils elects a president.cac is a council comprised of the presidents of each of these tenants councils.see setting forth the composition and role of the resident council.cac is comprised of approximately council presidents this number includes three presidents of the resident councils of cha senior public housing developments for elderly residents.
in,a relocation rights contract was negotiated between cac and cha.this agreement guaranteed to all cha leaseholders residing in cha properties as of october,the right to return to newly constructed or rehabilitated housing as old housing was demolished.see.
on june,the district court entered an order that stated that no revitalizing order could be entered or modified that would restrict or limit the opportunity of displaced cha residents to return to a cha property without cac first being afforded an opportunity to present evidence and to be heard on the matter.a revitalizing order is a limited waiver of the injunction such an order allows the construction of new housing in a limited public housing area when a responsible forecast of economic integration,with a longer term possibility of racial desegregation,could be made with respect to that area.at.
background of the current action 
the dispute before us today involves a development called lake park crescent,which is located in the north area on the south side of chicago.lake park crescent was built by a private developer and overseen by the receiver.the north neighborhood formerly had contained,dilapidated public housing cha demolished the buildings in the neighborhood and sought adequate housing alternatives.
on june,the district court issued a revitalizing order for the north neighborhood.this order stated that,in order to prevent a of public housing,any new public housing in the north neighborhood must be economically integrated of the units must be reserved for families earning of the area median income ami,while the other half could be occupied by very families earning of the ami.see id.at.
the first phase of lake park crescent was completed and had sixty public housing units thirty reserved for families earning of ami,and thirty reserved for families earning of ami.the developer had no difficulty finding families to occupy the units however,it did encounter difficulty identifying eligible existing public housing tenants to occupy the units.consequently,some of those units remained vacant.the developer contacted all families on cha waiting list who satisfied the existing income limits in august,an open house was held for cha families at or above ami in february,cha began an outreach effort to wait list families in the surrounding communities and,in march,cha began to contact the entire wait list.as of may,nine of the thirty units requiring ami were occupied,and eleven other units were assigned to individuals whose applications were being processed.at.nevertheless,there was still concern about filling the remaining ami units.
district court proceedings 
on may,cac filed a motion to amend the revitalizing order to allow working public housing families to occupy the units reserved for those who make of the ami,even if their income was not as high as of the ami.at.in that motion,cac expressed a concern that the developer was planning a wait list for lake park crescent that would invite members of the general community to live in lake park crescent.id.cac contended that such a list would bypass the thousands of current and past cha residents who are currently on wait lists awaiting housing relocation.id.
the receiver opposed cac motion and offered three other options to the district court.the first option was to continue efforts to locate qualified tenants earning ami from the cha wait list the second option was to locate qualified tenants earning ami from the pool of existing cha tenants who already had made permanent housing relocation choices the third option was to create a waiting list drawing from members of the broader community to fill any units that would remain vacant due to insufficient numbers of cha wait listed families meeting the income criteria.
the gautreaux plaintiffs filed a brief stating that there was merit to the contentions of both cac and the receiver.cha also filed a brief,stating that it supports and is willing to implement either the wait list strategy proposed by the developer or cac proposal to relax the income requirements and that one or the other plan should be adopted promptly.at.
on july,the district court held a hearing.a number of parties and interested persons testified,including representatives of cac,cha,hud,the gautreaux plaintiffs and the receiver and north community representatives.cac was concerned that a wait list that drew in residents from outside cha housing would take away units owed to cha leaseholders under the relocation rights contract ever since the cha began demolishment of their homes.at.
the receiver contended that cac motion would threaten his ongoing efforts to generate public support for replacement public housing because he would be breaking a promise he had made to the north kenwood neighborhood.he had said that the new housing would be housing.id.at.the receiver submitted that,if the court allowed his promises to the neighborhood to be breached,it would diminish his credibility and hamper his efforts to get neighborhood support for public housing for future developments.alderman toni preckwinkle,who represents the north neighborhood,and shirley newsome,chair of the north conservation community council,also testified and expressed their disapproval of cac plan.both asserted that the community had been promised by the receiver that any new housing would be mixed income so as not to repeat the concentrations of poverty caused by the previous,public housing.
the gautreaux plaintiffs admitted that the decision was a tough one.they did not want to take a position contrary to the community wishes nevertheless,they were concerned that,although many of the gautreaux plaintiffs still were waiting for housing,the units in question might be given to famil
