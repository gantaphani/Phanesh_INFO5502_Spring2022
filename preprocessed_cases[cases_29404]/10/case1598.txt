introduction 
crystal morgan,karla sylvester and janay famous plaintiffs or appellants filed this lawsuit against their former employer wet seal,and wet seal retail,wet seal.plaintiffs alleged that wet seal violated california law by requiring employees to purchase wet seal clothing and merchandise as a condition of employment and travel between wet seal business locations without reimbursing them for mileage.
this appeal is from an order denying plaintiffs class certification on the grounds that common questions do not predominate over individual questions with respect to either of their claims and that utilizing the class action procedure is not the superior method for resolving this lawsuit.appellants raise a panoply of issues on appeal but none provides any basis for reversal.accordingly,we affirm the order denying class certification.
ii.statement of facts 
complaint allegations 
on september,plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging that wet seal employment policies violate both the california labor code and the business and professions code.in january,plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint tac,the operative pleading for purposes of this appeal.plaintiffs seek damages,restitution,and injunctive and declaratory relief for two allegedly unlawful policies.
first,plaintiffs allege that wet seal forces employees to purchase apparel,shoes and accessories from wet seal as a condition of their employment without reimbursement the dress code claim.plaintiffs contend that because purchasing wet seal merchandise is a necessary expense incurred in the discharge of work,wet seal failure to reimburse employees for these purchases constitutes a violation of labor code section section.plaintiffs further contend that the dress code policy violates labor code section section by forcing employees to patronize wet seal stores without compensation.finally,plaintiffs contend that the dress code policy violates wage order,section,which is contained in title,section,subdivision a of the california code of regulations wage order because it requires employees to wear apparel and accessories of a distinctive design or color.
the second unlawful policy alleged in the tac is that wet seal requires employees to use their personal vehicles to drive to other wet seal business locations to attend mandatory meetings and perform other work and that,regularly,and as a matter of practice,they do not receive indemnification for these expenditures as required by section the travel expense reimbursement claim 
motions regarding class certification 
on april,plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification pursuant to which they requested that the trial court certify the following dress code class all current and former employees,who worked for wet seal,in any california store including but not limited to stores selling its wet seal brand,arden brand,zutopia and contempo casual brands at any time from four years preceding the filing of this lawsuit to the time that class certification is granted.plaintiffs also moved for certification of a subclass the travel subclass consisting of those class members who used their own vehicles to travel to other stores,in connection with discharge of their job duties.
plaintiffs argued that class certification was appropriate because they are suitable class representatives,the approximately individuals who comprise the proposed dress code class are readily ascertainable from wet seal employee records and,common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues with respect to both the dress code claim and the travel expense reimbursement claim.as to this third factor,plaintiffs theory was that wet seal unlawful practices are reflected in written company policies which apply to all members of the putative class.
on the same day plaintiffs filed their motion,wet seal filed an opposing motion to deny class certification and to strike the class allegations from the tac.wet seal argued,among other things,that their written dress code and travel expense reimbursement policies are lawful on their face and therefore adjudicating plaintiffs claims would necessitate a highly individualized factual inquiry of each putative class member in order to determine whether the facially valid policies were applied in an unlawful manner.
the parties proffered voluminous evidence regarding wet seal policies and practices during the putative class period,from september onward.that evidence comprises a significant portion of the volume appellants appendix.with inadequate assistance from these parties,we will summarize the pertinent categories of that evidence.
documentary evidence of companywide policies 
dress code 
at the commencement of the putative class period in,wet seal employee handbook included a section titled employee dress personal appearance which contains the following relevant provisions 
employees of wet seal enjoy a business casual work environment.the company wants employees to feel comfortable at work while maintaining sensible dress and grooming habits.you are expected to report to work,clean,and dressed according to the requirements of your position.
employees who have regular interaction with the public and clients should talk to their managers for further direction on proper work attire.if you report to work dressed or groomed inappropriately,you may be prevented from working until you return to work well groomed and wearing the proper attire.time spent to return home and change into appropriate clothing will not be paid.
store employees 
the wet seal,store employees represent our company and are required to dress in accordance with the current company dress code guidelines.all employees are required to dress in a manner that is both respectful of our customers and consistent with the current fashion attire that is reflected in the stores.
the current field dress code guidelines can be found in the store operations policies procedures manual.inappropriate dress will not be tolerated.any violations of this policy may result in a disciplinary action up to and including termination 
wet seal issued new versions of its employee handbook in and.the employee dress personal appearance sections of these handbooks contain much of the language that was used in the handbook.notably,the and handbooks also state the current dress code can be obtained through human resources,and employees are not required to wear the company clothing.
the edition of wet seal store operations polices procedures manual contains a provision titled employee dress appearance guidelines which states,in part 
wet seal employees represent wet seal to our customers.our employees must exemplify the fashionable image we want to portray to our customer.the employee discount is a benefit that is offered to employees to purchase and wear current store fashion merchandise.employees are encouraged to wear wet seal merchandise at all times.it is essential that the employees reflect wet seal style during working hours.
if an employee does not have wet seal merchandise the employee should wear clothing consistent with wet seal brand.
in,wet seal revised the dress code policy in its policies procedures manual.instead of the language we have quoted above,the dress code policy states 
the wet seal and arden b store employees represent our company and are required to dress in accordance with the current company dress code guidelines.all employees are required to dress in a manner that is both respectful of our customers and consistent with the current fashion style that is reflected in the stores.employees are not required to wear the company clothing.
those employees interested in purchasing company merchandise are eligible for an employee discount employees are invited to wear wet seal or arden b clothing during work hours,but are not required to do so.
during the relevant time period,wet seal also published several versions of its holiday handbook.the holiday handbook contains language about the dress code that is substantially similar to the language in the employee handbook.
a holiday handbook focused on the brilliance of the gifted girl and referred to wet seal customer as our girl.under a heading called look gifted,this handbook states wet seal team members represent wet seal to our girl.our team members must exemplify the fashionable image we want to portray to our girl.the employee discount is a benefit offered to employees to encourage them to purchase and wear current store fashion.team members are required to dress in a manner that is both respectful of our girl and consistent with the current fashion trends that are reflected in our stores.a fall holiday handbook,which focused on stealing the spotlight,contains substantially the same dress code guidelines that were set forth in the holiday handbook.
in,arden b published a holiday handbook which states that fashion specialists should be stylish,professional and wear clothes that reflect current store fashion and colors.this handbook also states as a fashionista on the sales floor,you must represent the arden b brand,current fashion trends and current color stories presented on the sales floor.team members are required to dress in a manner that is both respectful to our customer,professional and consistent with the current fashion trends that are reflected in our stores.the guidelines in a arden b holiday handbook are substantially similar to the guidelines.
travel expense reimbursement 
all relevant versions of the employee handbook contain a provision titled business expense reimbursement which states,in part employees may be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in the course of business.these expenses usually include air travel,meals,cab fare,rental vehicles and car mileage for personal vehicles.
the and editions of the policies procedures manual both state it is the policy of the wet seal,to reimburse employees for necessary and reasonable travel expenses incurred in the course of company business.travel on company business is defined as time spent by the employees to get to and from locations in the course of conducting company business 
wet seal district directors manual contains a store travel policy.the and editions of this manual contain the following provision 
given proper approvals,associates may use their personal cars for business travel when other transportation is unavailable or uneconomical.the use of personal cars for business is reimbursed only when total business mileage exceeds miles in a workday.reimbursement,if applicable,is at the standard irs rate per mile plus tolls or parking.additionally,if an associate travels to another place of business to work at another store for a particular day,meeting site,they will be reimbursed for mileage,which exceeds their normal commute to and from their regular place of work 
the and editions of the district directors manual both include the following provision as part of the store travel policy 
employees may use their personal cars for business travel when transportation is unavailable or uneconomical.reimbursement,if applicable,is at the standard irs rate per mile,plus tolls or parking.additionally,if an employee travels to another place of business to work at another store for a particular day,meeting site,will be reimbursed for mileage,which exceeds normal commute to and from regular place of work.
wet seal has a standard employee expense report form which employees are required to complete in order to document reimbursable expenses they have incurred.the first item of reimbursable expense that is listed on this form is a claim for reimbursement for automobile mileage 
evidence of company practices 
declarations of named plaintiffs 
the three named plaintiffs,janay famous,crystal morgan and karla sylvester,filed declarations in support of the class certification motion.famous worked as a sales associate at a wet seal store in sacramento for three months in.morgan was employed as an assistant manager at a wet seal store in costa mesa for four months in.sylvester worked as a sales associate in an arden b store in los angeles from september to april.
famous and morgan stated that,when they were hired,they were told by their managers that the company required employees to dress in wet seal merchandise at all times.in her declaration,sylvester stated that when she was hired her manager told her that the company required all store employees to dress in arden b clothing and that the dress code was all wet seal clothing and accessories.all three plaintiffs stated that they did not receive any reimbursement for the wet seal merchandise they purchased during the period of their employment.
morgan and sylvester both stated that they traveled between wet seal stores during the course of their employment,that they were not reimbursed for mileage for their travel,and that they were not aware that wet seal had a policy that addressed reimbursement for mileage for traveling between stores famous stated that,although she was never asked to travel to another store to help out,she was not aware that wet seal had a policy that addressed mileage reimbursement.
putative class members aligned with plaintiffs 
plaintiffs submitted declarations by former employees of wet seal,some who worked at a wet seal store and others who worked at an arden b store.despite plaintiffs strong reliance on this evidence,appellants have provided this court with no meaningful summary of the substantive content of these declarations 
some of these declarants stated that,when they were hired,a manager told them that they were expected or required to wear wet b attire at work.however,the majority of these individuals stated that they were told that they were expected or required to dress in wet seal clothing or in current fashion as displayed in the store,or words to that effect.
more than half of these declarants stated that they were never asked to help out at another store location but also claimed they were not aware that wet seal had a policy that addressed reimbursement for mileage for traveling between stores.the remaining declarants had many different things to say about wet seal travel reimbursement policy for mileage for business related travel.
some former employees stated that they were asked to help out at other stores,but they were not aware of a mileage reimbursement policy and they were not reimbursed for their mileage.others stated that they did engage in travel but did not disclose whether they were reimbursed for mileage or not.other members of this group stated that they were not aware of a wet seal mileage reimbursement policy but that they were reimbursed for their mileage.one former employee stated that she was asked to help out at another store but that she did not recall if she received mileage reimbursement and she did not remember if wet seal had a mileage reimbursement policy.
putative class members aligned with wet seal 
wet seal submitted declarations from putative class members,all of whom stated that they have never been required to wear wet seal clothing and that they do not interpret the wet seal dress code policy to require that wet seal employees wear wet seal clothing at work.some of these individuals were managers while others were sales associates.
according to respondents brief on appeal,of these individuals also expressly attested that they do not have any expenses for which wet seal failed to reimburse them.although wet seal fails to support this factual claim with appropriate references to the record,appellants do not dispute it in their reply brief.
wet seal e mails 
plaintiffs supported their motion with copies of several authored by janee simon,who was wet seal district director for los angeles during at least part of the relevant time period.
in one email,which was sent to eight store managers,simon outlined the areas we have to improve on immediately one of simon concerns was that the team was not wearing the new trends that she thought customers should see.simon stated i know our success would improve if our team were wearing current mdse each need to make sure mgmt are hiring sales who want to buy fashion.hire some new staff you are letting people work who are not dressing for wet seal and this is distressing to me.
in another sent to five store managers,simon stated that o ur fashion specialists must represent our brand and our image daily.this is not happening in our stores at this time.simon discussed an example of two very good fashion specialists who had arrived at work for arden b that day who do not represent our brand at all.simon stated that employees should not wear flat sandals and that they should dress business casual,sophisticated and woman of the times do not allow your employee to dress down as these two did.
on march,simon sent an to a wet seal employee named tricia sprowell,in which she stated that she had sent out a global message to store managers that the policy states for the company that we do not have to wear our merchandise but we need to wear merchandise that is related to our current trends simon told sprowell that the purpose of her message was to inspire the managers to inspire their teams to become informed and up to date about the new trends.simon also told sprowell that,in her message,she said nothing about has to be our merchandise at all just current fashion trends.
e.the order denying class certification 
on august,a hearing on the motions for and against class certification was conducted before the honorable john munter.on august,the court filed a page order denying class certification.the court detailed order contains a thorough and well reasoned analysis of the pertinent facts and issues.the discussion section of the order is divided into two main parts.
preliminarily,the court addressed evidentiary matters.observing that the plaintiffs had lodged a litany of frivolous evidentiary objections spanning over pages,the court characterized this case as a paradigm case of abuse that runs afoul of the supreme court proscription against meritless and inconsequential evidentiary objections that serve to divert a court attention from the key issues in a case.the court then denied all of plaintiffs objections to wet seal evidence,although it also noted that it had not relied on some of the declarations that plaintiffs found objectionable.the court then found that many of wet seal objections to the plaintiffs evidence had merit,but nevertheless decided to treat all of plaintiffs evidence as if it was admissible,and to give that evidence the weight it deserved.finally,the court granted all requests for judicial notice as to which no objection was made,and granted in part an april,request for judicial notice filed by wet seal which plaintiffs had opposed.
in a separate section of its order,the court outlined two reasons for denying plaintiffs class certification.first,the court concluded that individual issues would predominate over any common issues pertaining to both the dress code claim and the travel expense reimbursement claim.in this regard,the court found that wet seal written dress code and travel expense reimbursement policies do not provide a common method of proof on central questions of liability.
the second reason for the decision to deny class certification was that utilizing the class action procedure is not a superior method for dealing with the instant allegations.in this regard,the court found,among other things,that the numerous individual issues would pose overwhelming case management difficulties,and that the plaintiffs did not present a manageable trial plan for adjudicating the merits of their claims.
iii.discussion 
we review the order denying class certification under the abuse of discretion standard of review.sav on drug stores,superior court cal th,d,sav on brinker restaurant superior court cal th,d,brinker.because trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action,they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification.linder thrifty oil cal th,d,linder.a trial court ruling supported by substantial evidence generally will not be disturbed unless improper criteria were used citation or erroneous legal assumptions were made citation citation any valid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.citation.id.at,d.
guiding principles 
generally,a class suit is appropriate when numerous parties suffer injury of insufficient size to warrant individual action and when denial of class relief would result in unjust advantage to the wrongdoer.citations.but because group action also has the potential to create injustice,trial courts are required to carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and to allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the courts.citations.linder,supra,cal th at,d,see also code civ.
t he class action proponent bears the burden of establishing the propriety of class certification.washington mutual bank superior court cal th,d,see also sav on,supra,cal th at,d,linder,supra,cal th at,d.class certification requires proof of a sufficiently numerous,ascertainable class,of a community of interest,and that certification will provide substantial benefits to litigants and the courts,that proceeding as a class is superior to other methods.citations.in turn,the community of interest requirement embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.citation.fireside bank superior court cal th,d.
b.the element of predominance of common issues 
most of appellants arguments on appeal pertain to the trial court finding that individual issues predominate over common issues with respect to both the dress code claim and the travel expense reimbursement claim predominance is a factual question accordingly,the trial court finding that common issues predominate generally is reviewed for substantial evidence.citation.brinker,supra,cal th at,d.
plaintiffs burden 
to obtain class certification,plaintiffs had the burden of establishing that common questions of fact or law predominate over individual issues in this case.sav on,supra,cal th at,d,see also linder,supra,cal th at,d.to carry that burden,they were required to do more than simply show that common issues exist.rather,plaintiffs needed to place substantial evidence in the record that common issues predominate.lockheed martin superior court cal th,d.e ach member of the class must not be required to individually litigate numerous and substantial questions to determine his or her right to recover following the class judgment and the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,must be sufficiently numerous and substantial to make the class action advantageous to the judicial process and the litigants.ibid.
the ultimate question the element of predominance presents is whether the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance of a class action would be advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.citations.the answer hinges on whether the theory of recovery advanced by the proponents of certification is,as an analytical matter,likely to prove amenable to class treatment.citation.a court must examine the allegations of the complaint and supporting declarations citation and consider whether the legal and factual issues they present are such that their resolution in a single class proceeding would be both desirable and feasible.brinker,supra,cal th at,d.
the trial court findings 
in the present case,appellants repeatedly ignore or mischaracterize the findings and analysis set forth in the order denying class certification.therefore,we think it is important to clarify what the trial court found before we turn to appellants claims of error.
a.the dress code claim 
according to the tac,wet seal enforces a companywide dress code policy which violates section,section and wage order.
section requires employers to indemnify employees for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties,or of his or her obedience to the directions of the employer.
section provides,among other things,that an employer may not compel or coerce any employee,or applicant for employment,to patronize his or her employer,or any other person,in the purchase of anything of value.
wage order states that w hen uniforms are required by the employer to be worn by the employee as a condition of employment,such uniforms shall be provided and maintained by the employer.under this order uniform includes apparel and accessories of distinctive design or color.
the trial court found that plaintiffs dress code claim raises several liability issues which would need to be resolved on an individual basis,including for example whether wet seal requires employees to wear wet seal merchandise as a condition of employment whether wet seal coerced or compelled employees to purchase its merchandise assuming employees purchased wardrobe items for work,whether those purchases were necessary expenditures and assuming employees were required to wear certain wardrobe items to work,whether those items constituted a uniform.
the court found that these legal issues are not common issues in this case because there is no method of proving wet seal liability.in reaching this conclusion,the court identified numerous flaws in the plaintiffs theory that wet seal written dress code policy provides a common common method of proving liability.
first,the written policies do not state that employees were required to purchase wet seal clothing as a condition of employment.thus,answering the central liability question whether wet seal employees were required to wear wet seal clothing as a condition of employment or otherwise compelled to purchase wet seal merchandize would require several individualized inquiries including what,if anything,the employee was told by his or her store manager regarding purchasing wet seal clothing or wearing wet seal clothing to work if such a discussion occurred,when and with whom the employee had that discussion how the employee interpreted that discussion whether the employee interpretation was reasonable and whether the employee then purchased wet seal clothing to wear to work pursuant to that discussion.
second,the written policies do not explain with any specificity what employees are required to wear,but instead use broad and vague standards like requiring employees to dress in a manner consistent with the current fashion style that is reflected in the stores thus,for example,determining whether the attire allegedly required by wet seal constitutes a uniform within the meaning of wage order would require several individualized inquiries,including what was the current fashion style reflected in each store at a given period of time whether that style was of a distinctive color or design how each store manager interpreted the phrase wet seal style or consistent with the current fashion style that is reflected in the stores whether each manager required the employees to wear clothing of a distinctive design or color and whether each manager required the employees to wear clothing that is usual or generally usable in the occupation.
third,because the written policy does not describe what an employee is supposedly required to wear,the court found that individualized inquiries would be necessary in order to determine whether any given purchase by an employee constituted a necessary expenditure within the meaning of section.for example,individualized inquiries would be necessary to address what,if anything,the manager told the employee regarding the required wardrobe assuming the employee purchased certain wardrobe items to wear to work,where the employee purchased those items and the particular wardrobe items actually purchased.
the trial court also found that the evidence submitted by both sides demonstrates that the plaintiffs theory of liability regarding its dress code claim is not reasonably susceptible to common proof but rather would require individualized inquiries into a myriad of circumstances depending on the particular direction of individual store managers and supervisors at numerous stores in widely varying locations and over the course of many years.in reaching this conclusion,the court expressly found that the plaintiffs evidence,particularly the employee declarations,demonstrate that the common written dress code policy did not lead to common dress code practices.
b.the travel expense reimbursement claim 
according to the tac,wet seal employees were required to use their personal vehicles to drive between store locations during working hours,but wet seal did not pay the required compensation for the costs associated with driving to and from wet seal business locations.thus,plaintiffs alleged that as a matter of practice,wet seal violated section by failing to indemnify employees for expenditures and losses incurred during the performance of their work.
the trial court found that proving the travel expense reimbursement claim would require numerous individual inquiries.the written travel reimbursement policy states that wet seal will reimburse employees for reasonable expenses incurred in the course of business.however,plaintiffs theory of liability is that as a matter of practice wet seal employees were not reimbursed for expense as required by section.in briefs filed in support of the motion for class certification,plaintiffs characterized the allegedly illegal policy as hit or miss.thus,the court concluded,plaintiffs had essentially conceded that wet seal travel reimbursement practice was not consistent across the board.
the court also found that plaintiffs own evidence demonstrated that wet seal practices varied.for example,the court pointed out,some of the employees who submitted declarations on behalf of the plaintiffs stated that they had been reimbursed for mileage,while others had not.moreover,wet seal produced evidence that over putative class members were reimbursed for mileage,gas,bus fare,travel meals and various other expenses incurred in connection with their jobs.
ultimately,the court concluded that proving liability based on the alleged hit or miss reimbursement policy would require individualized inquiries to address numerous issues including what,if anything,the manger told the employee regarding reimbursement of travel expense whether each travel expense was necessary and a direct consequence of the discharge of the employees job duties whether the employee sought reimbursement of that expense in compliance with the procedures set forth in wet seal reimbursement policy whether the employee was in fact reimbursed for that expense.
objection to merit based analysis 
attempting to avoid our deferential standard of review,appellants posit that the trial court erred as a matter of law by employing an improper criteria in the context of a class certification motion.specifically,appellants complain that the trial court based its decision on a substantive evaluation of the merits of plaintiffs legal claims.
as a general rule,class certification should not be conditioned upon a showing that class claims for relief are likely to prevail.linder,supra,cal th at,d.the certification question is essentially a procedural one that does not ask whether an action is legally or factually meritorious.citation.sav on,supra,cal th at,d.however,issues affecting the merits of a case may be enmeshed with class action requirements,such as whether substantially similar questions are common to the class and predominate over individual questions or whether the claims or defenses of the representative plaintiffs are typical of class claims or defenses.citations.linder,supra,cal th at,d.
in linder,our supreme court acknowledged that screening class causes of action for legal sufficiency before ruling on certification may sometimes better serve important interests of fairness and efficiency,but it determined that there are other mechanisms for weeding out legally meritless suits prior to certification,such as a demurrer or some other pretrial motion.linder,supra,cal th at,d.however,the court also affirmed the principle that trial courts should be afforded flexibility in dealing with class actions,and,in keeping with that principle,held that in the exceptional case where the defense has no other reasonable pretrial means to challenge the merits of a claim to be asserted by a proposed class,the trial court may,after giving the parties notice and an opportunity to brief the merits question,refuse class certification because the claim lacks merit as a matter of law.id.at,d.
in the present case,appellants contend that the trial court violated linder,supra,cal th at page,d,because it based its decision on an evaluation of the merits of plaintiffs claims without first giving plaintiffs notice or the opportunity to brief the merits question.to the contrary,the trial court discussed linder in its denial order and properly applied the linder principles in its discussion.linder states that a trial court is not precluded from scrutinizing a proposed class cause of action to determine whether,assuming its merit,it is suitable for resolution on a classwide basis.ibid.here,the trial court considered the merits of plaintiffs causes of action only for the limited purpose of assessing whether substantially similar question were common to the class and predominated over individual questions,something that linder expressly allows.ibid.
appellants contend that the trial court erred in conducting a merit analysis and interpreting the wage order against plaintiffs and in doing so erroneously framed the class certification questions based on such interpretation.appellants fail to explain how the trial court interpreted wage order against them.
as noted above,in order to determine whether common or individual issues predominate,the trial court discussed the laws that plaintiffs alleged wet seal violated.thus,for example,the court observed that plaintiffs had alleged that wet seal dress code policy violates wage order,and it also quoted the relevant provisions of that wage order.the court also considered the definition of the term uniform that has been approved by the department of labor standards enforcement dlse,noting that the dlse is the state agency empowered to enforce california labor laws,including iwc wage orders.utilizing that definition and the language of the wage order itself,the court made this observation thus,in order to determine whether certain wardrobe items constitute a uniform within the meaning of subdivision a,courts must consider whether the dress code policy requires wardrobe items that are usual and generally usable in the occupation and whether those items have a distinctive design or color.
the factual and legal issues relating to this prong of the dress code claim were directly relevant to the certification inquiry that the court was asked to conduct.the tac contains an express allegation that wet seal violated wage order.furthermore,the trial court took judicial notice of the content of wage order pursuant to the plaintiffs request for judicial notice.the trial court did not make a substantive ruling regarding the merits of this part of the plaintiffs case simply because it looked at the language of the wage order itself.
in their reply brief,appellants complain about the fact that the trial court considered the dlse definition of a uniform.according to appellants,the court used that narrow definition to narrowly construe the wage order as against the employees this vague notion does not constitute a cognizable claim of error.appellants do not actually address the substance of either wage order or the dlse definition or even identify any substantive distinction between them.indeed,appellants do not directly dispute the validity of the dlse definition of a uniform.more fundamentally,appellants simply ignore the reason the trial court consulted these legal authorities,in order to determine whether there was a common legal issue,not to make a substantive ruling regarding the merits of plaintiffs legal claim.
objections regarding use of case authority 
appellants contend the trial court used improper criteria by relying on certain cases and allegedly ignoring others.
first,appellants contend that the trial court erred by relying on a depublished decision,faulkinbury boyd associates th,d,review granted,faulkinbury.however,the trial court did not discuss the substance of faulkinbury,but only cited it once to support the following proposition while a court ordinary does not reach the merits of an action when deciding a certification motion,courts do examine the elements of the alleged claims in the context of deciding whether common issues exist and predominate.appellants do not dispute this legal proposition nor could they in light of the fact that it was expressly approved in linder,supra,cal th at page,d,as the trial court recognized in its written order in this case.
second,appellants forcefully contend that the trial court committed reversible error by relying almost exclusively on howard gap,dist.lexis,wl gap.the order denying class certification contains a discussion of the facts of the gap case prefaced by the trial court observation that the case is instructive.in appellants view,the trial court also tracked the reasoning of the gap court and essentially used that case as the basis for its decision to deny class certification.doing our best to find a concrete claim of error,it appears that appellants are complaining that the gap case is substantively irrelevant we disagree.the gap case addressed the requirement of a predominance of common issues in the context of a substantially similar factual claim.
the gap plaintiff was a former employee who challenged gap alleged policy of requiring employees to purchase and wear gap clothing.gap,supra,dist.lexis at,wl at.gap disputed that it imposed such a policy and produced evidence that its written policies,both during the time of plaintiff employment and thereafter,encouraged employees to purchase and wear gap clothing but did not require them to do so.id.at,dist.lexis at.the district court denied a motion for class certification finding,among other things,that issues common to the putative class did not predominate over individual issues.id.at,dist.lexis at.
the gap court recognized that the question whether gap had a policy requiring employees to purchase and wear gap clothing was a common issue among the putative class,but it found that there was no common method of proof with respect to this issue because gap written policies did not state that employees were required to purchase and wear gap clothing but only encouraged them to do so.the plaintiff acknowledged that her own claim was predicated on oral instructions,but she claimed that she received these instructions as part of a routinized orientation that itself conformed to the written material distributed to her at her employee orientation.gap,supra,dist.lexis at,wl at.however,the declarations of putative class members established that there were individual variations as to what employees were told about the dress policy and that not all employees were told that they were required to wear gap clothing.id.at,dist.lexis at.
the gap court denied class certification because the absence of a common method of proof went to the core question of liability whether employees were compelled to use their wages to purchase and wear gap clothing as a condition of their employment.gap,supra,dist.lexis at,wl at.the court concluded that the individual issues that would have to be addressed to answer this question would overwhelm any common issues.ibid.
the gap decision is analogous to the present case and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by so stating.here,as in gap,there is no method of proof with regard to the fundamental liability questions at the heart of both sets of plaintiffs claims.wet seal written polices do not require employees to purchase and wear wet seal clothing as a condition of employment use their own vehicles to travel on work business without reimbursement.all of the named plaintiffs submitted declarations which establish that their own claims are based on oral instructions from their specific manager s.furthermore the declarations of putative class members submitted by both plaintiffs and wet seal show that employees were told different things about the challenged policies and that many of them were not told that they were required to purchase wear wet seal merchandise or to pay for their mileage for work related travel.
appellants contend that the trial court should not have relied on gap because the gap court recognized that case would have been suitable for class certification if the plaintiff had put forward a common policy,and,in this case,there exists a companywide policy that forms the basis of the alleged injuries for expense reimbursement.this logic is flawed.like appellants,the gap plaintiff did allege that there was a companywide policy.but that allegation was not sufficient in and of itself to establish that common issues predominated because gap disputed that it had such a policy and there was no class wide method of proof for resolving this key liability question.appellants face the same problem that defeated the class certification motion in gap.they have alleged that there are two illegal policies that apply to the class but they failed to produce substantial evidence of a policy which can be used as a method of establishing liability.the written policies are not substantial evidence that wet seal engaged in the allegedly illegal policies arguably,they support the contrary conclusion.furthermore,the anecdotal evidence regarding wet seal application of its dress code and travel expense reimbursement policy is not substantial evidence of a practice that could be used as a common method of proving liability.to the contrary,that evidence,much of which was submitted by plaintiffs themselves,reinforces the conclusion that wet seal liability to putative class members will have to be decided on an individualized basis.
appellants third complaint regarding the trial court use of case law is that the court erred by ignoring plaintiffs case authority.for example,appellants complain that the trial court erred by ignoring estrada fedex ground package system,th,d estrada a california leading authority on point cited by plaintiffs.
estrada was an appeal from a class action judgment holding fedex liable for its policy of erroneously treating its drivers as independent contractors rather than employees.estrada,supra,th,d.one issue on appeal was whether the trial court abused its discretion by certifying a class.id.at,d.finding no such abuse,the estrada court affirmed the trial court finding that there was a predominance of common issues,including whether drivers were employees and,if so,which of their expenses were reimbursable.id.at,d.in reaching this conclusion,the court also affirmed the trial court evidentiary ruling that anecdotal evidence regarding the application of the defendant written policy was admissible at trial because it was relevant to the class as a whole to show the defendant power to interpret the operating agreement.id.at,d.
we reject appellant contention,unsupported by any meaningful discussion,that estrada is on point.obviously,estrada was procedurally very different from the present case.beyond that,there did not appear to be any dispute regarding the nature of the defendant employment policy.the legality of that policy was the core issue in terms of liability and that common issue predominated in that case.here,by contrast,wet seal disputes the tac allegations regarding the nature of its policy and the trial court found that the proponents of class certification failed to produce substantial evidence of a method of proving that wet seal has engaged in the allegedly unlawful practices.
appellants also contend that the trial court erred by ignoring kurihara best buy dist.lexis,wl kurihara.in that case,plaintiff alleged that the defendant employee inspection policy was illegal.id.at,dist.lexis at.best buy opposed a motion for class certification on the ground that variations regarding the application of its formal written inspection policy raised too many individual issues.id.at,dist.lexis at.in granting class certification,the district court found,among other things,that there was a predominance of common issues.as the court explained,h ere,plaintiff has provided substantial evidence of the existence of a policy whereby employees are subject to inspections,and not compensated for the time spent on those inspections.this policy forms the bases of the alleged injuries at the center of this action.the court also found that best buy evidence did not defeat the motion for class certification,noting that although there would likely be individual issues regarding implementation of the defendant policy,the overarching question of whether this policy results in unlawful undercompensation is common and predominant.id.at,dist.lexis at.
appellants contend that this case is like kurihara because there exists a companywide policy that forms the basis of the alleged injuries for expenses reimbursement.appellants further contend that kurihara illustrates that the individual issues raised by wet seal anecdotal evidence are not sufficient to trump the common liability issue in this case.
first,this case is not like kurihara simply because wet seal has written dress code and travel reimbursement policies.as the trial court found,those written policies do not provide a common method of proving liability because they are not substantial evidence of the allegations in the tac which describe the allegedly illegal employment practices.in other words,although wet seal does have written company policies,those policies are not substantial evidence of the conduct alleged in the tac which forms the basis of plaintiffs legal claims.second,anecdotal evidence plays a fundamentally different role in this case than it did in kurihara.in this case,plaintiffs offered anecdotal evidence to support their theory of liability,that wet seal engaged in an unlawful practice of requiring employees to purchase and wear wet seal merchandise as a condition of employment.in light of this circumstance,wet seal anecdotal evidence was as relevant as plaintiffs own declarations.more to the point,all of that evidence was consistent with the trial court conclusion that there is no common method of proving plaintiffs theory of liability.
plaintiffs theory of liability 
appellants contend that the trial court erred by ignoring their theory of liability and basing its decision on the erroneous assumption that in order to answer the central questions on liability,one has to look beyond the written policy to the practices employed by each manager at each of the retail stores during a period of time spanning almost seven years.
the trial court observation that the trier of fact will have to look beyond the written policies to the practices of each manager was neither erroneous,nor was it an assumption.rather,the court considered the evidence of wet seal written policies during the relevant time period and then made a finding of fact that those policies do not constitute substantial evidence that wet seal engaged in either of the unlawful practices alleged in the tac.indeed,for most of the relevant time period,the applicable written policies expressly state that employees are not required to wear wet seal clothing and also that employees may seek reimbursement for travel.despite these facts,the trial court refrained from making any substantive finding regarding the merits of plaintiffs claims,but rather made the accurate observation that,in order to prove those claims,plaintiffs would have to produce evidence beyond the written policies themselves.
appellants make several arguments which are intended to avoid the plain fact that wet seal written policies are not substantial evidence of the conduct alleged in the tac as the factual predicate for plaintiffs legal claims.for example,they argue that wet seal repeatedly acknowledged that its dress code and travel reimbursement policies apply to all putative class members.but liability does not rest on proof of a policy.it rests on allegations that wet seal policies are illegal because they require employees to wear wet seal merchandise as a condition of employment and deny employees mileage reimbursement for travel.wet seal has consistently and vehemently denied these substantive allegations of illegal conduct.
