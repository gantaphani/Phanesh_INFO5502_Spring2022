background 
named plaintiff jason yamada,dds is a torrance,dentist specializing in tooth implants.yamada attended a promotional symposium in hosted by nobel featuring their nobeldirect dental implants.following the symposium,yamada implanted dozens of nobeldirect implants into his patients but noticed that the implants failed at a rate he deemed unusually high.just over a year after the implant launch,two swedish professors at the university of gothenburg warned that the implants were causing bone loss,and they urged nobel to withdraw the implants from the market.in response to those allegations,nobel contacted the swedish medical products agency smpa,a government agency akin to the united states food and drug administration,to investigate.in february of,the smpa formally closed its investigation with no adverse findings as to the implants safety or efficacy.nevertheless,at least a dozen of yamada patients nobeldirect implants failed,which necessitated explant surgery that is,removal of the implants oral reconstruction,implant replacement,and continued monitoring.yamada performed those necessary reparative surgeries at his own expense.
on june,yamada filed a class action complaint against nobel alleging a defect in the nobeldirect implant.the complaint alleged causes of action for declaratory relief,implied indemnity,breach of express and warranty,and a violation of california unfair competition law ucl,california business and professions code,et.
on november,nobel filed a motion to dismiss yamada first amended complaint.on january,the district court the honorable jacqueline nguyen denied the motion as to all but the implied indemnity claim,which it dismissed with prejudice.that same day,the district court ordered yamada to file his motion for class certification by february.meanwhile,the parties filed their preliminary report under rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure.the report was filed prior to discovery,and it noted that defendants had sole possession of the vast majority of key documents in the litigation.plaintiffs sought compensatory damages both past and projected loss,restitution,and declaratory relief to protect the class,essentially a form of indemnity.projected classwide damages were estimated at million and were calculated as follows million for the price of the failed implants,representing an estimated failure rate out of total implants at per implant million for the surgical replacement of the implants at per procedure million to repair or restore teeth adjacent to the implant and million for monitoring and medical costs.
on august,the district court certified a nationwide class and appointed yamada class representative.on may,the case was reassigned to the honorable michael fitzgerald.on june,nobel moved both for summary judgment as to all outstanding claims and for reconsideration of class certification or,alternatively,decertification of the class,arguing that two recently decided cases materially changed the applicable law.the district court denied nobel motion for summary judgment but ordered supplemental briefing on the motion for reconsideration,finding well taken defendants argument that mazza american honda motor,cir,and american honda motor superior court,th,d,represented material changes of law under civil local rule mazza held that california law may only be used on a classwide basis if the interests of other states are not found to outweigh california interest in having its law applied.at quoting.mut.bank,cal th,d.in making that determination,mazza requires courts to conduct a governmental interest test.id.the district court conducted the test and ultimately denied defendants motion for reconsideration under mazza due to,among other reasons,the overwhelming connections between california and defendants conduct relevant to the case.
the material change under american honda concerned causation.in american honda,the california court of appeal stated that for a california breach of warranty claim to proceed,the movant for class certification must provide substantial evidence of a defect that is substantially certain to result in malfunction during the useful life of the product.th at,d.to do that,the movant must demonstrate through expert testimony that there was an inherent defect and that it caused the product to malfunction or that it was substantially certain the product would malfunction as a result of the defect.id.at,d.the district court found that the record demonstrated hundreds of potential causes for implant failures,and that the cause of any particular failure was uncertain.accordingly,the district court granted in part defendants motion and decertified the class as to the claims for declaratory relief,breach of express warranty,and breach of implied warranty.the court left standing the claims for unfair and fraudulent business practices under california ucl.
the parties settled the remaining claims.on may,the district court issued an order granting preliminary approval of the settlement.the settlement agreement provided compensation for class members as follows all implantees whose nobeldirect implants failed before the effective date of the settlement agreement and who had not yet received a replacement for the implants under nobel warranty plan would receive either compensation for the actual amount paid for the failed implants or,if nobel had no record of the actual amount paid,for each failed implant and all implantees whose nobeldirect implants failed after the effective date of the settlement agreement would receive either reimbursement of the actual amount paid or any single replacement nobel implant.
the settlement enhanced nobel original warranty.before the settlement,nobel warranty was for years and provided only for another nobeldirect implant.further,the original warranty gave nobel the right to deny claims if they suspected that the implant failure was caused by patient misuse,and the burden was on the patient to prove otherwise.the prior warranty also required the patient to return the extracted implant to recover.the settlement provided class members a lifetime warranty,and those who experienced past failures could recover merely by signing a declaration attesting that to their knowledge,the patient was not the exclusive cause of the failure.
on september,class counsel filed two motions one for attorneys fees and litigation expenses and the other for approval of the class action settlement.in the motion for attorneys fees,counsel requested in fees and in expenses.the fee request was based on a lodestar and a multiplier of to account for the contingent nature of the litigation.
nobel opposed class counsel motion for attorneys fees.at a hearing on the motion,the district court ruled that the summary nature of the time records and declarations provided by class counsel prevented the court from adequately evaluating whether the number of hours expended on the litigation were reasonable or duplicative.to remedy that defect,the court ordered class counsel to provide unredacted time records under seal and in camera to the court only,after which the court would determine whether copies of the time records should be redacted and provided t
