plaintiff jose gomez appeals adverse summary judgment on personal and putative class claims brought pursuant to the telephone consumer protection act tcpa,b a iii.gomez alleges that the campbell ewald company instructed or allowed a vendor to send unsolicited text messages on behalf of the united states navy,with whom campbell ewald had a marketing contract.because we conclude that campbell ewald is not entitled to immunity,and because we find no alternate basis upon which to grant its motion for summary judgment,we vacate the judgment and remand to the district court.
the facts with respect to gomez personal claim are largely undisputed.on may,gomez received an unsolicited text message stating 
destined for something big do it in the navy.get a career.an education.and a chance to serve a greater cause.for a free navy video call number.
the message was the result of collaboration between the navy and the campbell ewald company a marketing consultant hired by the navy to develop and execute a multimedia recruiting campaign.the navy and campbell ewald agreed to target young adults aged to,and to send messages only to cellular users that had consented to solicitation.the message itself was sent by mindmatics,to whom the dialing had been outsourced.mindmatics was responsible for generating a list of phone numbers that fit the stated conditions,and for physically transmitting the messages.neither the navy nor mindmatics is party to this suit.
in,gomez filed the present action against campbell ewald,alleging a single violation of b a iii,which states 
it shall be unlawful for any person within the united states,or any person outside the united states if the recipient is within the united states 
a to make any call other than a call made for emergency purposes or made with the prior express consent of the called party using any automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice 
iii to any telephone number assigned to a paging service or cellular telephone service 
gomez contends that he did not consent to receipt of the text message.he also notes that he was years old at the time he received the message,well outside of the navy target market.it is undisputed that a text message constitutes a call for the purposes of this section.see satterfield simon schuster,inc,cir w e hold that a text message is a call within the meaning of the tcpa.in addition to seeking compensation for the alleged violation of the tcpa,gomez also sought to represent a putative class of other unconsenting recipients of the navy recruiting text messages.
after a b motion to dismiss was denied,campbell ewald tried to settle the case.campbell ewald offered gomez per violation,plus reasonable costs,but gomez rejected the offer by allowing it to lapse in accordance with its own terms.
campbell ewald then moved to dismiss the case under rule b,arguing that gomez rejection of the offer mooted the personal and putative class claims.after the court denied the motion,campbell ewald moved for summary judgment,seeking derivative immunity under yearsley ross construction.in opposition to the summary judgment motion,gomez presented evidence that the navy intended the messages to be sent only to individuals who had consented or opted in to receive messages like the recruiting text.a navy representative testified that campbell ewald was not authorized to send texts to individuals who had not opted in.the district court ultimately granted the motion,holding that campbell ewald is immune from liability under the doctrine of derivative sovereign immunity.gomez campbell ewald,no.cv dmg cwx,wl,at.gomez filed a timely appeal,arguing that the yearsley doctrine is inapplicable.
this court reviews summary judgment de novo,affirming only where there exists no genuine dispute of material fact.satterfield,at see also.a.we are free to affirm on any basis supported by the record.gordon virtumundo,cir.
we begin with jurisdiction.upon gomez timely appeal,campbell ewald filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,arguing that the personal and putative class claims were mooted by gomez refusal to accept the settlement offer.we denied that motion without prejudice,and now reject campbell ewald argument on the merits.
gomez individual claim is not moot.campbell ewald argues that whether or not the class action here is moot,the individual claim was mooted by gomez rejection of the offer.the company is mistaken.although this issue was unsettled until recently,we have now expressly resolved the question.a n unaccepted rule offer that would fully satisfy a plaintiff claim is insufficient to render the claim moot.diaz first am.home buyers prot,cir.because the unaccepted offer alone is insufficient to moot gomez claim,and as campbell ewald identifies no alternate or additional basis for mootness,the claim is still a live controversy.
similarly,the putative class claims are not moot.we have already explained that an unaccepted rule offer of judgment for the full amount of the named plaintiff individual claim and made before the named plaintiff files a motion for class certification does not moot a class action.pitts terrible herbst,cir.like the pitts plaintiff,gomez rejected the offer before he moved for class certification.gomez rejection therefore does not affect any class claims.
campbell ewald recognizes that it is asking this panel to depart from these precedents.yet it is well settled that we are bound by our prior decisions.miller gammie,cir en banc.although there is an exception for precedents that have been overruled,that exception applies only where the relevant court of last resort has undercut the theory or reasoning underlying the prior circuit precedent in such a way that the cases are clearly irreconcilable.ibid.campbell ewald argues that pitts and diaz are clearly irreconcilable with the supreme court recent decision in genesis healthcare symczyk.campbell ewald overstates the relevance of that case,which involved a collective action brought pursuant to b of the fair labor standards act.id.at.the defendant argued that the case was mooted by the plaintiff rejection of a settlement offer of complete relief.id.at.the supreme court ultimately agreed,first accepting the lower court conclusion that the personal claim was moot,and then holding that the named plaintiff had no personal interest in representing putative,unnamed claimants,nor any other continuing interest that would preserve her suit from mootness.id.at.
campbell ewald correctly observes that genesis undermined some of the reasoning employed in pitts and diaz.for example,the pitts opinion referred to the risk that a defendant might pick off named plaintiffs in order to evade class litigation.at quoting weiss regal collections,cir.the genesis court distanced itself from such reasoning,pointing out that the argument had only been used once by the high court,and only in dicta.at referring to deposit guar.bank,jackson,roper.nevertheless,courts have universally concluded that the genesis discussion does not apply to class actions in fact,genesis itself emphasizes that rule class actions are fundamentally different from collective actions under the flsa and,therefore,the precedents established for one set of cases are inapplicable to the other.at.accordingly,because genesis is not clearly irreconcilable with pitts or diaz,this panel remains bound by circuit precedent,and campbell ewald mootness arguments must be rejected.miller,at.
campbell ewald constitutional challenge is equally unavailing.the company argues that the statute is unconstitutional either facially or as applied,but its argument relies upon a flawed application of first amendment principles.although the district court did not ultimately reach this issue,the record confirms that the challenge was properly raised below.
we have already affirmed the constitutionality of this section of the tcpa.moser fcc,cir.the government may impose reasonable restrictions on the time,place,or manner of protected speech,provided that the restrictions are justified without reference to the content of the restricted speech,that they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,and that they leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.ward rock against racism,quoting clark cmty.for creative non violence,other citations omitted.in analyzing the section,the moser court focused on the statutory language.because nothing in the statute requires the federal communications commission to distinguish between commercial and noncommercial speech,we conclude that the statute should be analyzed as a time,place,and manner restriction.we then upheld the statute after finding that the protection of privacy is a significant interest,the restriction of automated calling is narrowly tailored to further that interest,and the law allows for many alternative channels of communication.id.at.
campbell ewald does not contest our reasoning in moser.instead,campbell ewald argues that the government interest only extends to the protection of residential privacy,and that therefore the statute is not narrowly tailored to the extent that it applies to cellular text messages.the argument fails.first,this court already applies the tcpa to text messages.satterfield,at.second,there is no evidence that the government interest in privacy ends at home the fact that the statute reaches fax machines suggests otherwise.see b c.third,to whatever extent the government significant interest lies exclusively in residential privacy,the nature of cell phones renders the restriction of unsolicited text messaging all the more necessary to ensure that privacy.after all,it seems safe to assume that most cellular users have their phones with them when they are at home.campbell ewald itself notes that in many households a cell phone is the home phone.in fact,recent statistics suggest that over of american households now rely exclusively on wireless telephone service as a consequence,prohibiting automated calls to land lines alone would not adequately safeguard the stipulated interest in residential privacy.for all these reasons,campbell ewald argument is without merit.
nor does the government speech doctrine provide campbell ewald with a meritorious constitutional challenge.campbell ewald argues that military recruiting messages are a form of government speech afforded greater protection by the first amendment.campbell ewald mischaracterizes the doctrine.the government speech doctrine is a jurisprudential theory by which the federal government can regulate its own communication without the constraint of viewpoint neutrality.downs unified sch,cir,cert.denied.for example,the first amendment does not require the federal government to fund messages both for and against abortion.rust sullivan,upholding,under the government speech doctrine,regulations forbidding certain publicly funded doctors from endorsing abortion.similarly,in this context,the doctrine would preclude campbell ewald from demanding that the navy create an advertising campaign that discourages military participation.the government speech doctrine is simply immaterial to the present dispute,in which the plaintiff is not advocating for viewpoint neutrality,but is instead challenging the regulation of a particular means of communication.
campbell ewald nevertheless argues that it can not be held liable for tcpa violations because it outsourced the dialing and did not actually make any calls on behalf of its client.see b a iii rendering it unlawful to make any call using an automated dialing system.gomez,in fact,concedes that a third party transmitted the disputed messages.even so,campbell ewald argument is not persuasive.
although campbell ewald did not send any text messages,it might be vicariously liable for the messages sent by mindmatics.the statute itself is silent as to vicarious liability.we therefore assume that congress intended to incorporate ordinary vicarious liability rules.meyer holley.accordingly,a bsent a clear expression of congressional intent to apply another standard,the court must presume that congress intended to apply the traditional standards of vicarious liability thomas taco bell,d,aff,app x,wl cir.july,per curiam.although we have never expressly reached this question,several of our district courts have already concluded that the tcpa imposes vicarious liability where an agency relationship,as defined by federal common law,is established between the defendant and a caller 
this interpretation is consistent with that of the statute implementing agency,which has repeatedly acknowledged the existence of vicarious liability under the tcpa.the federal communications commission is expressly imbued with authority to prescribe regulations to implement the requirements of the tcpa.b.as early as,the fcc stated that c alls placed by an agent of the telemarketer are treated as if the telemarketer itself placed the call.in re rules and regulations implementing the tcpa of,fcc rcd.more recently,the fcc has clarified that vicarious liability is imposed under federal common law principles of agency for violations of either section b or section c that are committed by telemarketers.in re joint petition filed by dish network,llc,fcc rcd.because congress has not spoken directly to this issue and because the fcc interpretation was included in a fully adjudicated declaratory ruling,the interpretation must be afforded chevron deference.metrophones,global crossing telecomms,cir citing cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,other citations omitted,aff,see also chevron,natural res.def.council,if,however,the court determines congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute,as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation.footnote omitted.
campbell ewald concedes that the fcc already recognizes vicarious liability in this context,but argues that vicarious liability only extends to the merchant whose goods or services are being promoted by the telemarketing campaign.yet the statutory language suggests otherwise,as b simply imposes liability upon any person not any merchant.see ali fed.bureau of prisons,interpreting the use of any as interpreting the phrase any person to reach individuals and entities.and although the fcc ruling may emphasize vicarious liability on the part of merchants,the fcc has never stated that vicarious liability is only applicable to these entities indeed,such a construction would contradict ordinary rules of vicarious liability,meyer,at,which require courts to consider the interaction between the parties rather than their respective identities.see restatement third of agency,explaining that agency may be established by express authorization,implicit authorization,or ratification.
given campbell ewald concession that a merchant can be held liable for outsourced telemarketing,it is unclear why a marketing consultant should be subject to that same liability.as a matter of policy it seems more important to subject the consultant to the consequences of tcpa infraction.after all,a merchant presumably hires a consultant in part due to its expertise in marketing norms.it makes little sense to hold the merchant vicariously liable for a campaign he entrusts to an advertising professional,unless that professional is equally accountable for any resulting tcpa violation.in fact,campbell ewald identifies no case in which a defendant was exempt from liability due to the outsourced transmission of the prohibited calls.
moreover,our own precedent belies any argument that liability is not possible.in our seminal case regarding text messages and the tcpa,we allowed a case to proceed against an analogous marketing consultant who was not responsible for the actual transmission of the text messages.see satterfield,at.in satterfield,a publisher had instructed a marketing consultant to create a text message campaign advertising a new stephen king novel.id.at.the consultant in turn outsourced the recipient selection and message transmission to two other subcontractors.id.a recipient sued both the publisher and the marketing consultant for alleged violations of the tcpa.id.at.the district court entered summary judgment in favor of both defendants,ho
