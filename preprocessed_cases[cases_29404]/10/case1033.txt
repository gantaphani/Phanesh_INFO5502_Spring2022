reinhardt,circuit judge 
defendants gary yasuda and amarillo college of hairdressing appeal the district court denial of their motion to compel arbitration.the district court found that the defendants waived their right to arbitration by their litigation conduct.we affirm.
factual background 
defendant amarillo college of hairdressing,doing business as milan institute and milan institute of cosmetology collectively milan,is a group of nationally accredited private colleges offering career training in cosmetology.the plaintiffs are individuals who enrolled in a cosmetology program at milan institute.as part of their enrollment,each of the plaintiffs signed an enrollment agreement that contained a binding arbitration provision.the arbitration agreement provides,in relevant part 
a ny dispute arising from my enrollment at milan institute,no matter how described,pleaded or styled,shall be resolved by binding arbitration,under the substantive and procedural requirements of the federal arbitration act,by a single arbitrator,conducted by the american arbitration association aaa at milan institute under its commercial rules.all determinations as to the scope,enforceability and effect of this arbitration agreement shall be decided by the arbitrator,and not by a court.the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
in order to graduate from a cosmetology school,students must,among other things,complete hours of technical instruction and practical training.cal.code regs.tit,a.the students perform cosmetology,barbering,and manicure services for the college paying clients.the students also clean,sweep,wash and fold laundry,set up and take down studios,clean pedicure bowls,sell retail products,schedule clients,and promote milan services.the services that students provide do not necessarily correspond to their education,and they are not paid for their work.
procedural background 
the plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit on october,against the college and its owner and president,gary yasuda,alleging that the defendants violated state labor laws and the fair labor standards act flsa.specifically,the plaintiffs contended,among other things,that milan was an employer within the meaning of state law as well as the flsa and thus,as uncompensated employees,they were entitled to minimum hourly wages,overtime wages,and unpaid premiums for missed meal and rest breaks.over seventy individuals opted to join the action between october and march.
on february,the defendants were served with a copy of the summons and complaint via substituted service and by mail.they disputed the appropriateness of the service of process.the parties then stipulated that the defendants were properly and timely served with the summons and complaint on march.the parties also agreed to extend the defendants time to respond to june.the defendants counsel subsequently filed a notice of appearance on march.
on may,the parties filed a joint stipulation to extend time to file motion for flsa conditional certification and class certification with the district court.they stated that they had spent considerable time and effort analyzing the most resourceful and efficient manner with which to approach discovery and certification motions,that it was in the best interest of judicial resources,time and effort to focus discovery on the issue whether the class members were milan employees under wage laws,and that they agreed to extend the deadline to file motions for class and conditional certification.the parties further agreed that there should be discovery and an opportunity for the court to resolve the question whether the plaintiffs were employees of milan under wage laws before any effort to certify the class because the lawsuit presents unique legal claims regarding whether or not the purported class members are employees of the defendants,covered by wage laws.the district court subsequently granted the parties joint stipulation motion.
the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint on june.it named additional plaintiffs and added additional state wage and hour claims.on june,the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs state law claims against all defendants and their flsa claim against yasuda pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b the defendants asserted that plaintiffs were students and not employees of milan as a matter of law,and that the plaintiffs failed to plead yasuda individual liability.after briefing and oral argument on the issue,on july,the district court granted in part and denied in part the defendants motion to dismiss.the court dismissed the causes of action against yasuda with leave to amend,but denied the defendants motion as to the plaintiffs state law claims.as to the state law claims,the district court concluded after a detailed analysis that the california legislature could have included students performing services at their school for the public within the categories of individuals who may practice cosmetology without being paid.because the legislature did not do so,the district court declined to usurp the legislature role by rewriting the cosmetology act.the district court therefore held that the cosmetology act did not preclude the plaintiffs arguments that they were employees under state wage laws and that the parties could proceed to discovery on the issue.
the plaintiffs then filed a second amended complaint on august,which pleaded additional facts as to yasuda individual liability.on september,the defendants filed their answer to the complaint.in addition to responding to all of the plaintiffs causes of action,the defendants pled arbitration as one of their affirmative defenses.they,however,did not move to compel arbitration.
on november,the parties filed a joint rule f report,which detailed the scope of discovery and contained proposed deadlines for the phases of discovery and motions.in a footnote,the defendants maintained that each plaintiff executed an arbitration agreement and that they were not waiving any rights as to those agreements.in the body of the report,the parties stated that they participated in a rule f conference,exchanged initial disclosures pursuant to rule a,and had already begun exchanging written discovery requests and noticing depositions to occur in early.the parties agreed,subject to approval by the court,that the first eight months of discovery should focus on the employee issue so that the court could consider that issue on motions for summary judgment,if the parties chose to file such motions,followed by two months of expert discovery.they also planned to exchange discovery requests and to take and defend depositions of the parties to the case.
the district court held a scheduling conference on december,fourteen months after the plaintiffs filed the original complaint.during the proceeding,the court asked the defendants counsel whether he intended to file a motion to compel arbitration.he responded,w e have made a decision about that.and frankly i think our view of it is we are probably better off just being here in the court with the procedures of rule and discovery and federal practice than handling it in arbitration.the court then warned counsel about the possibility of waiver.the next day,the court issued a scheduling order setting the deadlines for different phases of discovery and motions.
although the plaintiffs made written discovery requests of the defendants in november,they agreed to extend the defendants time to respond in december and january.the defendants eventually produced the discovery responses on february.subsequently,on february,the court issued a stipulated protective order in which the parties agreed to abide by certain procedures and guidelines during discovery.then,on february and,plaintiffs deposed milan chief financial officer.it was on february,that defendants counsel informed the plaintiffs counsel of their intent to compel arbitration.
on march,almost seventeen months after the start of the case,the defendants actually moved to compel individual arbitration.in the motion,they argued,among other things,that the court must enforce the parties arbitration agreements,that the agreements were valid and enforceable,and that they,the defendants,had not waived arbitration.the plaintiffs opposed the motion by arguing that the defendants had waived their right to compel arbitration and that the terms were unconscionable and unenforceable.
applying the three factor waiver test employed in this circuit,the district court denied the defendants motion to compel individual arbitration.the district court held that all the factors were satisfied because it was indisputable that the defendants had knowledge of their existing right to compel arbitration,the defendants engaged in acts inconsistent with that right by delaying their motion to compel and deciding to actively participate in the litigation for seventeen months including the resolution of a motion to dismiss on the merits,and granting the motion to compel seventeen months after the start of litigation and after a ruling partly in favor of the plaintiffs on the motion to dismiss would result in prejudice to the plaintiffs.the defendants timely appealed.
discussion 
the defendants contend that the district court erred in two ways.first,they argue that an arbitrator,rather than the district court,should decide whether the defendants waived their right to arbitration through litigation conduct.second,they contend that even if the district court was correct to decide the issue,it erred by finding waiver.
in howsam dean witter reynolds,the supreme court distinguished between two categories of gateway issues on motions to compel arbitration,each of which has a different presumption as to whether a court or an arbitrator should decide,see also cox ocean view hotel,cir.describing the two categories of disputes.the first category of gateway issues is a question of arbitrability that is,whether the parties have submitted a particular dispute to arbitration.howsam,at.this category includes issues that the parties would have expected a court to decide such as whether the parties are bound by a given arbitration clause or whether an arbitration clause in a concededly binding contract applies to a particular type of controversy.id.at.these disputes are for judicial determination unless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise.id.at.quoting at t,commc ns workers of.in contrast,the second category procedural issues is presumptively not for the judge,but for an arbitrator,to decide.id.at.in howsam,for example,the court held that the question as to whether a party met the arbitral forum statute of limitations for filing a case was a procedural question that the parties would have expected the arbitrator to decide accordingly,as the court made clear,the arbitrator should presumptively decide such disputes.id.at.
we have made clear that waiver by litigation conduct is part of the first category of gateway issues.cox,at.in cox,an employee who had been fired contended that his employer waived its right to arbitrate his discrimination claim because,among other things,it had refused his earlier request to arbitrate.id.at.addressing the defendant argument that the arbitrator should decide the issue,we concluded that the question whether a party waived its right to arbitrate on the basis of its litigation conduct is a question of arbitrability and is in the first category of gateway issues.id.at see also id.accordingly,under howsam,the question before us is presumptively for a court and not an arbitrator to decide.at.every circuit that has addressed this issue whether a district court or an arbitrator should decide if a party waived its right to arbitrate through litigation conducted before the district court has reached the same conclusion.see marie allied home mortg,cir.the proper presumption in this case is that the waiver issue is for the court and not the arbitrator.ehleiter grapetree shores,cir.adopting the first circuit test jpd,chronimed holdings,cir.w e conclude that howsam did not disturb the traditional rule that the courts presumptively resolve claims.grigsby associates,m sec,cir.today we conclude that it is presumptively for the courts to adjudicate disputes about whether a party,by earlier litigating in court,has waived the right to arbitrate.see also hong et cj cgv am.holdings,et,cal.app,finding that the first,third,sixth,and eleventh circuits,as well as the supreme courts of colorado,nebraska,texas and alabama allow courts to decide the waiver by litigation conduct issue.but am.ins.transamerica occidental life ins,cir.holding that the arbitrator presumptively should decide if a party has waived the right to arbitration by litigation conduct in state court 
the defendants next argue that the broad nature of the arbitration clause overcomes the presumption because it contains a clear and unmistakable provision that the question of waiver based on litigation conduct should be decided by the arbitrator.cox again provides the answer.in cox,the agreement stated that a ny controversy involving the construction or application of the terms,provisions,or conditions of this agreement or otherwise arising out of or related to this agreement shall likewise be settled by arbitration.at.we nevertheless found that the court and not the arbitrator should decide the issue of waiver by litigation conduct.in the present case,the provision regarding the scope of the arbitration agreement a ll determinations as to the scope,enforceability and effect of this arbitration agreement shall be decided by the arbitrator,and not by a court is far less broad than the provision in cox,because it does not contain the all inclusive arising out of or related to language.the language in the arbitration contract before us is therefore a fortiori insufficient to show an intent that an arbitrator decide the waiver by litigation conduct issue and to overcome the presumption to the contrary.
in sum,the district court did not err in deciding the litigation conduct waiver issue itself.we have made clear that courts generally decide whether a party has waived his right to arbitration by litigation conduct.if the parties intend that an arbitrator decide that issue under a particular contract,they must place clear and unmistakable language to that effect in the agreement.see hong,cal.app.at.as they did not do so here,the district court did not err by deciding the conduct waiver issue.
the right to arbitration,like other contractual rights,can be waived.united states park place,cir.a determination of whether the right to compel arbitration has been waived must be conducted in light of the strong federal policy favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements.fisher becker paribas,cir.because waiver of the right to arbitration is disfavored,any party arguing waiver of arbitration bears a heavy burden of proof.id.quoting belke merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.as such,a party seeking to prove waiver of a right to arbitration must demonstrate knowledge of an existing right to compel arbitration acts inconsistent with that existing right and prejudice to the party opposing arbitration resulting from such inconsistent acts.id.here,the defendants concede that they had knowledge of the right to compel arbitration thus,we address only the latter two factors.
a.the defendants engaged in acts inconsistent with their right to arbitration 
there is no concrete test to determine whether a party has engaged in acts that are inconsistent with its right to arbitrate.we have stated,however,that a party extended silence and delay in moving for arbitration may i
