fair credit reporting act 
the panel reversed the district court dismissal pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b of an action under the fair credit reporting act.
the panel held that a prospective employer violates b a when it procures a job applicant consumer report after including a liability waiver in the same document as a statutorily mandated disclosure.the panel also held that,in light of the clear statutory language that the disclosure document consist solely of the disclosure,a prospective employer violation of b a is willful when the employer includes terms in addition to the disclosure,such as the liability waiver here,before procuring a consumer report or causing one to be procured.
the modern information age has shined a spotlight on information privacy,and on the widespread use of consumer credit reports to collect information in violation of consumers privacy rights.this case presents a question of first impression in the federal courts of appeals whether a prospective employer may satisfy the fair credit reporting act fcra disclosure requirements by providing a job applicant with a disclosure that a consumer report may be obtained for employment purposes which simultaneously serves as a liability waiver for the prospective employer and others see b a.we hold that a prospective employer violates section b a when it procures a job applicant consumer report after including a liability waiver in the same document as the statutorily mandated disclosure.we also hold that,in light of the clear statutory language that the disclosure document must consist solely of the disclosure,a prospective employer violation of the fcra is willful when the employer includes terms in addition to the disclosure,such as the liability waiver here,before procuring a consumer report or causing one to be procured.
fair credit reporting act.
congress enacted the fcra in in response to concerns about corporations increasingly sophisticated use of consumers personal information in making credit and other decisions.fair credit reporting act of,pub,stat.specifically,congress recognized the need to ensure fair and accurate credit reporting,promote efficiency in the banking system,and protect consumer privacy.safeco ins.burr.congress thus required the use of reasonable procedures in procuring and using a consumer report,defined as 
any written,oral,or other communication of any information by a consumer reporting agency bearing on a consumer credit worthiness,credit standing,credit capacity,character,general reputation,personal characteristics,or mode of living which is used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer eligibility for a credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal,family,or household purposes b employment purposes or c any other purpose authorized under the statute.
congress amended the fcra in.consumer credit reporting reform act of,pub,stat.it recognized the significant amount of inaccurate information that was being reported by consumer reporting agencies and the difficulties that consumers faced getting such errors corrected.at describing amendments.congress was specifically concerned that prospective employers were obtaining and using consumer reports in a manner that violated job applicants privacy rights.at.the disclosure and authorization provision codified at b a was intended to address this concern by requiring the prospective employer to disclose that it may obtain the applicant consumer report for employment purposes and providing the means by which the prospective employee might prevent the prospective employer from doing so withholding of authorization.at.this provision furthers congress overarching purposes of ensuring accurate credit reporting,promoting efficient error correction,and protecting privacy.see safeco,at.indeed,in addition to securing job applicants privacy rights by enabling them to withhold authorization to obtain their consumer reports,the provision promotes error correction by providing applicants with an opportunity to warn a prospective employer of errors in the report before the employer decides against hiring the applicant on the basis of information contained in the report 
congress prohibited procurement of consumer reports unless certain specified procedures were followed 
disclosure to consumer 
a in general 
except as provided in subparagraph b,a person may not procure a consumer report,or cause a consumer report to be procured,for employment purposes with respect to any consumer,unless 
i a clear and conspicuous disclosure has been made in writing to the consumer at any time before the report is procured or caused to be procured,in a document that consists solely of the disclosure,that a consumer report may be obtained for employment purposes and 
ii the consumer has authorized in writing which authorization may be made on the document referred to in clause i the procurement of the report by that person.
b a.congress amended the statute in to add language providing that the authorization may be made on the same document as the disclosure.consumer reporting employment clarification act of,pub,stat.
the fcra provides a private right of action against those who violate its statutory requirements in procuring and using consumer reports.the affected consumer is entitled to actual damages for a negligent violation.for a willful violation,however,a consumer may recover statutory damages ranging from to,punitive damages,and attorney fees and costs.
syed lawsuit against.
syed applied for a job with in.provided syed with a document labeled disclosure release.see appendix a.the disclosure release informed syed that his credit history and other information could be collected and used as a basis for the employment decision,authorized to procure syed consumer report,and stipulated that,by signing the document,syed was waiving his rights to sue and its agents for violations of the fcra.syed signature served simultaneously as an authorization for to procure his consumer report,and as a broad release of liability.
the liability waiver at the heart of the present dispute reads as follows 
i understand the information obtained will be used as one basis for employment or denial of employment.i hereby discharge,release and indemnify prospective employer,precheck,their agents,servants and employees,and all parties that rely on this release the information obtained with this release from any and all liability and claims arising by reason of the use of this release and dissemination of information that is false and untrue if obtained by a third party without verification.
syed alleges that the disclosure release failed to satisfy the disclosure requirements mandated by b a.syed does not contend that form contained too little information.instead,he argues that it contained too much.specifically,he alleges that inclusion of the liability waiver violated the statutory requirement that the disclosure document consist solely of the disclosure.see b a i.syed alleges that he realized had violated the statute when,upon reviewing his personnel file,he noticed that had procured his consumer report,in spite of the allegedly deficient disclosure with which it had provided him.he alleges that he filed the complaint within two years of reviewing his file.
on may,syed filed a putative class action in district court on behalf of himself and any person whose consumer report was obtained by after receiving a disclosure in violation of section b a i within the limitations period.he sought statutory damages pursuant to section a a,punitive damages pursuant to section a,and attorney fees and costs pursuant to section a syed did not seek actual damages,which would have required proof of actual harm.see crabill trans union,cir.citing cases.
the original complaint alleged that statutory violation had been willful,the predicate for syed claimed statutory and punitive damages.see see also safeco,at.on august,the district court dismissed syed complaint for failure to state a claim,with leave to amend.it held that the allegation of willfulness consisted only of labels and conclusions.see bell atl.twombly.
syed filed his first amended complaint fac on september.the fac sets forth the same factual and legal allegations as did the original complaint.however,it also includes citations to federal trade commission ftc staff opinion letters and district court opinions that syed asserts support his position that knew or should have known about its legal obligations under the fcra,thus rendering its statutory violation willful.
on october,the district court again dismissed syed fac for failure to state a claim,this time without leave to amend.the district court reasoned that syed had still not sufficiently pleaded willfulness.the court concluded that the ftc letters could not have warned away from the view it took because they were informal staff opinions,not authoritative guidance.see safeco,at.similarly,the court found that the judicial opinions cited by syed did not demonstrate that conduct had been willful because the opinions issued after had provided syed the disclosure release in.
we have jurisdiction under to review the district court final judgment dismissing with prejudice syed claims against.

syed has established article iii standing.a plaintiff who alleges a bare procedural violation of the fcra,divorced from any concrete harm,fails to satisfy article iii requirement.spokeo,robins.however,syed alleges more than a bare procedural violation.the disclosure requirement at issue,b a i,creates a right to information by requiring prospective employers to inform job applicants that they intend to procure their consumer reports as part of the employment application process.the authorization requirement,b a ii,creates a right to privacy by enabling applicants to withhold permission to obtain the report from the prospective employer,and a concrete injury when applicants are deprived of their ability to meaningfully authorize the credit check.by providing a private cause of action for violations of section b a,congress has recognized the harm such violations cause,thereby articulating a chain of causation that will give rise to a case or controversy.see spokeo,at quoting lujan defs.of wildlife,kennedy,concurring.therefore,syed has article iii standing to bring this lawsuit.see thomas fts usa,llc,supp,cv,wl,at.june,holding that an improper disclosure under b a causes a concrete injury sufficient to confer standing.
violated the fcra by including a liability waiver on the same document as its disclosure.
neither the supreme court nor any circuit court of appeals has addressed whether a prospective employer may satisfy b a by providing a disclosure on a document that also includes a liability waiver.the district court avoided this interpretive question,holding only that view that it had not violated the fcra,whether correct or not,was not objectively unreasonable,and that therefore could not be held liable for statutory or punitive damages.see safeco,at.we conclude that the inclusion of the liability waiver did violate the fcra,and next consider whether that violation was willful.
section b a unambiguously requires a document that consists solely of the disclosure.
we must begin with the text of the statute.where congressional intent has been expressed in reasonably plain terms,that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.griffin oceanic contractors,internal quotation marks omitted.and when the meaning of the words seems to us to be intelligible upon a simple reading,we shall spend no time upon generalities concerning the principles of statutory interpretation.united states pulaski.
the ordinary meaning of solely is a lone singly or e ntirely exclusively.american heritage dictionary of the english language ed.argues that the statute requirement that the disclosure appear on a document that consists solely of the disclosure is ambiguous because subsection ii of the provision provides that the consumer may authorize the procurement of a consumer report on the document containing the disclosure.see b a.if the statute allows for an authorization on the same document as the disclosure,reasons,then the statute must not really require the document to consist solely of the disclosure.see b a.thus urges us to find that section b a is internally inconsistent,and to give no effect to congress use of the term solely.
however,contrary to contention,the statutory allowance for the consumer to authorize in writing the procurement of a consumer report on the same document as the disclosure does not undermine the requirement that the document consist solely of the disclosure.the two clauses are consistent because the authorization clause is an express exception to the requirement that the document consist solely of the disclosure.while the statute does not specifically designate it as such,the authorization clause immediately follows the disclosure clause,and makes express reference to it.see b a ii.this is not a case where we must rationalize two plainly inconsistent subsections,or smooth over a mistake in draftsmanship.russello united states.to the contrary,it is clear that congress intended the two subsections to work together.
allowing an authorization on the same document as the disclosure is consistent with the purpose of the statute.congress passed section b a in order to protect consumers from improper invasion s of privacy,at,and the disclosure and authorization requirements fit hand in glove to achieve that purpose.indeed,each would be largely ineffective on its own.had the statute required disclosure without conditioning the procurement of a consumer report on the job applicant authorization,it would have failed to give the applicant control over the procurement of the personal information contained in the consumer report.on the other hand,had the statute conditioned the procurement of a report on the job applicant authorization without mandating clear disclosure by the prospective employer,congress purpose would have been frustrated because applicants would not understand what they were authorizing.the disclosure and authorization clauses therefore work in tandem to further the congressional purpose of protecting consumers from improper invasion s of privacy.see id.
congress reasonably could have concluded that permitting the consumer to provide an authorization on the same page as the disclosure would enhance the effectiveness of each clause.a job applicant may read a disclosure more closely if he understands that the potential employer may obtain his consumer report only if he signs an authorization for it to do so.the decision to authorize or deny the prospective employer use of his report to accept or reject his employment application may be better informed if the authorization immediately follows the disclosure.
we thus reject argument that section b a is internally inconsistent.it is our duty to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.united states menasche,internal quotation marks omitted.interpretation fails to give effect to the term solely,violating the precept that statutes should not be construed to make surplusage of any provision.wilshire westwood assocs.atl.richfield,cir.alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.that other fcra provisions mandating disclosure omit the term solely is further evidence that congress intended that term to carry meaning in b a i.see.
the statute does not implicitly authorize the inclusion of a liability waiver in a disclosure document.
congress express exception to the solely requirement,allowing the disclosure document to also contain the authorization to procure a consumer report,does not mean that the statute contains other implicit exceptions as well.see united states johnson.indeed,in light of congress express grant of permission for the inclusion of an authorization,the familiar judicial maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius counsels against finding additional,implied,exceptions.see.valley auth.hill.we therefore reject contention that a liability waiver is an implicit exception to the solely requirement in b a i.
moreover,a n implied exception to an express statute is justifiable only when it comports with the basic purpose of the statute.walker fairbanks inv,cir.here,an implied exception permitting the inclusion of a liability waiver on the same document as the disclosure does not comport with the fcra basic purpose.to the contrary,it would frustrate congress goal of guarding a job applicant right to control the dissemination of sensitive personal information.see a at.an authorization requiring the job applicant signature focuses the applicant attention on the nature of the personal information the prospective employer may obtain,and the employer inability to obtain that information without his consent.but a liability waiver does just the opposite it pulls the applicant attention away from his privacy rights protected by the fcra by calling his attention to the rights he must forego if he signs the document.indeed,by reading disclosure release,a job applicant could reasonably conclude that his signature was not consent to the procurement of the consumer report,but to a broad release of the employer from claims arising from the totality of the investigative background inquiries referenced in the first sentence of the form.see appendix thus,b a does not contain an implied exception allowing a prospective employer to include a liability waiver on the same document as the statutorily mandated disclosure.
the statute explicit language can not be interpreted as permitting the inclusion of a liability waiver.
also argues that the statute contains an explicit exception allowing for the inclusion of a liability waiver,positing that a liability waiver is one type of authorization.but we need not speculate about how broadly congress intended us to read the term authorization,because congress told us exactly what it meant when it described the authorization as encompassing only the procurement of a consumer report.b a ii.further,even assuming the statute were not as clear as it is,interpretation is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the term authorize.to authorize is to grant authority or power to.american heritage dictionary.to waive is to give up voluntarily or relinquish.id.at.authorization bestows,whereas waiver abdicates.a consumer may authorize the procurement of a consumer report or waive an employer liability,but he may not authorize a waiver.we decline to so harry the english language.see int l primate prot.league adm rs of tulane educ.fund.we thus reject argument that the statute somehow explicitly permits the inclusion of a liability waiver on the disclosure document 
whether the disclosure is clear and conspicuous is irrelevant to the analysis.
next,suggests that its inclusion of a liability waiver was permissible because even with the waiver,the disclosure was still clear and conspicuous.cites smith waverly partners,llc,cv rlv dsc,wl,at,for the proposition that a disclosure made pursuant to section b a is valid despite the inclusion of a liability waiver where the waiver is not so great a distraction as to discount the effectiveness of the disclosure.the district court in smith concluded that in order to give congress inclusion of the word solely meaningful effect,inclusion of the waiver provision was statutorily impermissible and the waiver is therefore invalid.id.only then,analyzing the single,separated sentence releasing the company from liability,did the court hold that the waiver was not so great a distraction as to discount the effectiveness of the disclosure.id.it is inexplicable to us that a court would find that including a waiver violated the fcra,but because the disclosure was clear and conspicuous,an additional requirement under the fcra,see b a i,the disclosure was nonetheless adequate.see smith,wl,at.because the question of whether a disclosure is clear and conspicuous within the meaning of section b a i is separate from the question of whether a document consists solely of a disclosure,and is not one that is before us here,we decide only that including the waiver violated the statute solely requirement.further,we question whether the smith court approach comports with the clear mandate and purpose of the fcra disclosure procedures.
statutory violation was willful as a matter of law.
syed seeks statutory and punitive damages only,not actual damages.statutory and punitive damages are available under the fcra only where a defendant willfully fails to comply with the statute.a.therefore,we must decide whether willfully failed to comply with section b a by procuring syed consumer report after including a liability waiver on the same document as the statutorily mandated disclosure.we may resolve this question as a matter of law,as the parties acknowledge.
the supreme court has clarified that,under section,willfulness reaches actions taken in reckless disregard of statutory duty,in addition to actions known to violate the act.safeco,at.a party does not act in reckless disregard of the fcra unless the action is not only a violation under a reasonable reading of the statute terms,but shows that the company ran a risk of violating the law substantially greater than the risk associated with a reading that was merely careless.id.at.
interpretation of the statute was not objectively reasonable.
contends that,even if it violated the statute by procuring syed consumer report,its interpretation of b a was not so erroneous that its was willful within the meaning of section.indeed,argues that its reading was not objectively unreasonable because the statutory text was less than pellucid.see id.at.
arguments on this score track its contentions as to why its actions did not violate the statute at all.however,for the reasons outlined above,we conclude that the fcra unambiguously bars a prospective employer from including a liability waiver on a disclosure document provided a job applicant pursuant to section b a.
also contends that its interpretation of the statute is objectively reasonable in light of the dearth of guidance from federal appellate courts and administrative agencies.no court of appeals has spoken to the issue of whether a disclosure document provided pursuant to section b a may permissibly include a liability waiver.nor has an administrative agency promulgated authoritative guidance on the issue 
a lack of guidance,however,does not itself render mi interpretation reasonable.the supreme court has analogized the assessment of whether a fcra violation may give rise to a claim for statutory damages to the determination of whether government employees may be held personally liable in suits for damages.safeco,at.in the qualified immunity context,we have held that when an officer conduct is so patently violative of the constitutional right that reasonable officials would know without guidance from the courts that the action was unconstitutional,closely analogous case law is not required to show that the law is clearly established.boyd benton,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.similarly,at least one circuit court of appeals has concluded that,in the fcra context,a lack of definitive authority does not,as a matter of law,immunize a party from potential liability for statutory damages.cortez trans union,llc,cir.
despite the apparent dearth of guidance on the issue at the time procured syed consumer report,inclusion of a liability waiver in the statutorily mandated disclosure document comports with no reasonable interpretation of b a.therefore,we conclude that mi interpretation was objectively unreasonable.
was willful.
the parties appear to assume that,under safeco,an objectively unreasonable interpretation of the fcra is by definition a reckless one,as well.however,this interpretation improperly conflates recklessness and negligence.in tort law,negligent actions are those which do not meet t
