trial court proceedings 
in their second amended complaint,plaintiffs allege causes of action for specific performance,breach of contract,fraud,and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.they claim that the class consists of more than persons and is consequently so numerous that joinder of all of the class members is impracticable.
in the motion for class certification,plaintiffs allege there were two classes of park residents a contract class and a fraud class.both classes share the common claim that the park owners breached a promise to sell lots within a fixed price range.plaintiffs assert that the lot values are now at roughly the same prices as they were in,but the higher prices the park owners demanded were motivated by their desire to be paid more for the park.
the trial court denied the motion.it ruled,among other things,that the class was not ascertainable and that there was no community of interest.
discussion 
class action requirements 
the marlers contend that they made a sufficient showing of an ascertainable class of park residents.they claim the trial court erred by denying their motion and at least should have allowed them to amend their class definition to more concisely define the class members.we agree.
class actions are statutorily authorized when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court code civ.ghazaryan diva limousine,th.in order to maintain a class action,certain prerequisites must be met,specifically,the existence of an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the class members.citation.the community of interest requirement embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.kennedy baxter healthcare th.
defendants note that appellate courts give deference to trial court findings of fact.true,but here,where the trial court ruling is based on improper criteria or incorrect legal assumptions in deciding class certification,our review is de novo.cho seagate technology holdings,th.i f the court failed to follow the correct legal analysis,an appellate court is required to reverse even though there may be substantial evidence to support the court order.ghazaryan diva limousine,supra,th at.
an ascertainable class 
in determining whether there is an ascertainable class,we look to the class definition.it must be precise and objective.cho seagate technology holdings,supra,th at.a class definition that is ambiguous presents a problem of class ascertainability that goes to the heart of the question of class certification ibid.in the absence of an ascertainable class,it is not possible to give adequate notice to class members or to determine after the litigation has concluded who is barred from relitigating.ibid.the goal in defining the class is to use terminology that will convey sufficient meaning to enable persons hearing it to determine whether they are members of the class plaintiff wishes to represent.ibid.
some courts conclude that class ascertainability is tested by simply determining if class members may be identified from the most inclusive facial class definition.cohen directv,supra,th at.under this method,courts are not concerned whether the definition is overbroad,and they do not consider community of interest factors in testing ascertainability.but our supreme court stated,w hether there is an ascertainable class depends in turn upon the community of interest among the class members in the questions of law and fact involved.daar yellow cab cal d,italics added.
relying on daar,we and other courts have taken a more nuanced approach.we do not exclude an analysis of community of interest factors in testing ascertainability.we may consider whether the class definition is overbroad,and if plaintiffs have shown that class members who have claims can be identified from those who should not be included in the class.ghazaryan diva limousine,supra,th at,fn.akkerman mecta,th,see also vasquez superior court cal d.
here,however,using either approach,the result is the same.there is an ascertainable class of park residents.plaintiffs propose two classes,a contract class and a fraud class.
plaintiffs define the contract class as residents of the park,all of whom are entitled to defendants performance of the commitment in the memorandum of agreement and cooperation agreement to offer to sell to the residents the lots on which the residents mobilehomes rest at prices within the range agreed in the memorandum of agreement and cooperation agreement italics added.
plaintiffs define the fraud class as residents of the park who were induced by defendants representations to the hbaa and to them as members of the hbaa to support defendants application and efforts for conversion of the park from a rental park to a and operated park,but who were not permitted by defendants to purchase their lots within the promised price range of to once the lots became saleable.italics added.
here there are objective characteristics and common transactional facts making the ultimate identification of class members possible hicks kaufman broad home th.the class members in the fraud and contract classes are park residents,an identifiable group.they can identify themselves as class members,and they can be identified from the park owners business records,park leases,and hbaa records.both classes stem from the same lot price offers.class members can determine if they fit within the fraud class because they know if they were induced to support the conversion because of the offers.
in denying class certification,the trial court said that the proposed class definition was vague as to time.it said,residents of the park as of what time when one or both the referenced agreements were made,when the cooperation agreement was ratified,when conversion was approved,when the action was filed,or when judgment is entered 
the class descriptions could be improved by including time periods to eliminate any confusion.but because residents of the park is an objectively identifiable group tied to park spaces,denying class certification on ascertainability grounds is not appropriate.hicks kaufman broad home,supra,th at.
defendants claim the class definition was overbroad as to whether the contract class included people who were residents of the park,who were members of hbaa,or both.but hbaa membership is not a requirement for membership in the contract class.the coa broadly defines residents as people whose homes are situated in the park and reside there.moreover,possible overbreadth is not fatal.c lass certification should not be denied on overbreadth grounds when the class definition is only slightly overinclusive.ghazaryan diva limousine,supra,th at,fn.in such cases,this is not a bar to class certification,as those improperly included may be placed in a or dismissed from the case.aguiar cintas.th.
overbreadth may be cured by modifying the class definitions,adding a more precise description of the residents of the park or using.park and hbaa records identify the park residents and the hbaa.moreover,this class is small and more easily defined than other larger and more complex classes that courts have found to be plainly ascertainable.see,clothesrigger,gte d,all persons nationwide subscribing to sprint since january,who were charged for one or more unanswered long distance calls.plainly such class is ascertainable.
the trial court reasoned,limiting the class to residents who are entitled to defendants performance of the commitment to sell within a given price range embeds within the class definition one of the central issues in the case it found that it was inappropriate to define the class in terms of the ultimate issue 
but the inclusion of an ultimate issue in the class definition does not defeat ascertainability.a class is still ascertainable even if the definition pleads ultimate facts or conclusions of law.hicks kaufman broad home,supra,th.in hicks,the appellate court cited an earlier case where t he class was defined as persons who owned policies issued by defendant which were purchased as a result of deceptive or fraudulent sales practices ibid.
plaintiffs contend the trial court erred by simply denying their motion.they claim it should have allowed them to amend the class definitions.we agree.
because there is an identifiable class,plaintiffs rights should not be forfeited because of counsel choice of words in the complaint or class certification motion.drafting class descriptions is not an easy task.amendments are permitted so that class cases may proceed on their merits.cho seagate technology holdings,supra,th at.t his state has a public policy which encourages the use of the class action device richmond dart industries,supra,cal d at.i f necessary to preserve the case as a class action,the court itself can and should redefine the class where the evidence before it shows such a redefined class would be ascertainable.cho,at.as it is the court duty to certify an identifiable and ascertainable class,the court is not limited to the class description contained in plaintiff complaint.id.at.plaintiffs should be given the opportunity on remand to amend the class descriptions.
community of interest for the contract class 
defendants claim this case can not proceed as a contract class action because the class members individual issues predominate.
the trial court noted,however,that there were a number of common class issues.these included the offers to sell lots,the range of prices,and the facts about the alleged breach.consequently,a major portion of the class contract claim is subject to common,as opposed to individual,proof.the court,however,said,e ven if plaintiffs prevail on the contract claims,individual trials on damages or specification of may be necessary.
but this prospect does not require denial of class certification.t hat each class member might be required ultimately to justify an individual claim does not necessarily preclude maintenance of a class action.citation.predominance is a comparative concept,and the necessity for class members to individually establish eligibility and damages does not mean individual fact questions predominate.sav on drug stores,superior court,supra,cal th at.
the focus is on management.individual issues do not render class certification inappropriate so long as such issues may effectively be managed.sav on drug stores,superior court,supra,cal th at.nor is it a bar to certification that individual class members may ultimately need to itemize their damages.ibid.
plaintiffs contend the relief and damage issues are manageable because the contract class judgment would involve lots within a set price range of to.for class members seeking enforcement of the agreement,there would be no need to prove individual damages.for those seeking monetary relief,plaintiffs claim the moa and coa identify the lots and prices,all class members fall within the coa five categories of lots,all class members received price offers within the to price range,and damages will be established by an allocation appraisal that will cover each of the lots.they argue that consequently there are no issues of damage that must be litigated by each class member.they have shown that this issue is manageable with minimal individual testimony and more reliance on documents,appraisals and expert testimony.vasquez superior court,supra,cal d at,fn.management here should present no problem because the class is small.on remand,the parties may present additional evidence to assist the court in deciding the most efficient procedure for proving the damage claims in a class format.
community of interest for the fraud class 
defendants contend there is no community of interest on the fraud class.they claim it is not subject to common proof.
but the trial court noted there were common class issues as to the representations made to the class,the people who made them,and the truth or falsity of the representations.a substantial portion of the fraud claim was subject to common proof.the court concluded,however,that the reliance and damage issues would necessarily require individual proof from each class member making class relief inappropriate.
plaintiffs contend the trial court erroneously assumed the reliance issue required testimony by each class member.they claim such individual testimony is not necessarily required.we agree.
the rule in this state is that it is not necessary to show reliance upon false representations by direct evidence.vasquez superior court,supra,cal d at.the fact of reliance upon alleged false representations may be inferred from the circumstances attending the transaction which oftentimes afford much stronger and more satisfactory evidence of the inducement which prompted the party defrauded to enter into the contract than his direct testimony to the same effect,italics added.
these principles apply to fraud class actions.vasquez superior court,supra,cal d at.the requirement that reliance must be justified in order to support recovery may also be shown on a class basis.id.at,fn.if the court finds that a reasonable person would have relied upon the alleged misrepresentations,an inference of justifiable reliance by each class member would arise.ibid.moreover,a presumption,or at least an inference,of reliance arises whenever there is a showing that a misrepresentation was material.in re tobacco ii cases cal th.
defendants suggest plaintiffs must prove the park owners made the representations directly to each class member.but the trial court correctly noted that representations may be actionable if the park owners made them to a third party,such as the hbaa.the maker of a fraudulent misrepresentation is subject to liability for pecuniary loss to another who acts in justifiable reliance upon it if the misrepresentation,although not made directly to the other,is made to a third person and the maker intends or has reason to expect that its terms will be repeated or its substance communicated to the other geernaert mitchell th,italics modified.
but here plaintiffs present evidence that all class members directly received and relied on the park owners representations.marler said they received offers to purchase lots within an established price range from to.plaintiffs detrimentally relied because the park owners gave them prices they did not intend to use,and raised them after the conversion vote when it was too late to challenge the conversion.
plaintiffs suggest there is no need to call every class member as a witness as marler and szewzuk testimony will prove the park residents were victims of a bait and switch and documents will prove there was a common representation to the class,such as keesler letter,which went to all park residents and included a fixed lot price representation.written misrepresentation claims provide an adequate basis for a finding of common questions within the class.richmond dart industries,supra,cal d at.
all class members also received a survey asking them to indicate whether they supported the conversion so the results of the survey could be provided to the governmental entities that approve conversions.the individual survey forms listed an estimated purchase price,estimated loan closing costs,and estimated maximum monthly payments,all within a lot price range of to.each form contained a request that each park resident check a box to indicate whether they agreed with the conversion of the park,b ased on those figures,and a request to have all adult members sign and date it.the forms alone are proof that park residents from of the park spaces supported the conversion.there is merit to plaintiffs claim that marler and szewzuk testimony,coupled with keesler letter,the moa,the coa,and the survey forms,may show evidence of class reliance without the need for testimony from many class members.
plaintiffs suggest that proving damages will not require individual because t he primary relief the fraud class seeks is specific performance.they are correct if the relief is so limited.but the trial court said it was not so limited because their prayer for relief seeks actual damages in an amoun
