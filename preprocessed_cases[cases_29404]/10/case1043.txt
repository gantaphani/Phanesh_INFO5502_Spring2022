the center for auto safety cas appeals from the district court order denying cas motions to intervene and unseal documents filed in a putative class action lawsuit between chrysler group,llc chrysler and certain named plaintiffs.because the district court applied the incorrect standard when evaluating the motion to unseal these documents,we vacate and remand for further proceedings.
factual background and procedural history 
in,plaintiffs filed a putative class action alleging defects in a part found in certain chrysler vehicles as part of the discovery process,the parties entered into a stipulated protective order.the protective order permitted each party to designate certain documents as confidential,and required any party that later wished to attach a confidential document to a court pleading to apply to do so under seal.
in,plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to require chrysler to notify the proposed class of the alleged risks its vehicles presented.plaintiffs and chrysler attached confidential discovery documents to their memoranda supporting and opposing the motion.consistent with the stipulated protective order,both parties applied to the district court to file the documents under seal,and the district court granted the motions.the district court eventually denied the motion for preliminary injunction.
shortly before the district court denied plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction,cas filed motions to intervene and unseal the confidential documents filed to support and oppose the motion for preliminary injunction.cas argued that only compelling reasons could justify keeping these documents under seal,while chrysler contended that it need only show good cause to keep them from the public view.
the district court reviewed the relevant ninth circuit case law and other district courts attempts to apply it to a motion for preliminary injunction.while ordinarily a party must show compelling reasons to keep a court document under seal,kamakana city county of honolulu,cir,the district court relied on language in our cases which provides that when a party is attempting to keep records attached to a motion under seal,it need only show good cause,id.at.while recognizing that t here is little clarity as to what,exactly,constitutes a dispositive motion,and that our circuit has not articulated the difference between a dispositive and nondispositive motion the district court decided to read dispositive to mean that unless the motion could literally lead to the final determination on some issue,a party need show only good cause to keep attached documents under seal.that was especially true in this case,the district court believed,as the motion for preliminary injunction here sought notice of potential problems to thousands of purchasers,and was not a motion to temporarily grant the relief ultimately sought in the underlying suit.accordingly,the district court found that the motion for preliminary injunction here was nondispositive,applied the good cause standard to the documents filed under seal,and concluded that good cause existed to keep them from the public view

iii.analysis 
standard to file documents under seal 
it is clear that the courts of this country recognize a general right to inspect and copy public records and documents,including judicial records and documents.nixon warner commnc ns,d.following the supreme court lead,we start with a strong presumption in favor of access to court records.foltz state farm mut.auto.ins,cir.the presumption of access is based on the need for federal courts,although independent indeed,particularly because they are independent to have a measure of accountability and for the public to have confidence in the administration of justice.united states amodeo amodeo ii,cir see also valley broad.dist.court,cir explaining that the presumption of public access promot es the public understanding of the judicial process and of significant public events.
accordingly,a party seeking to seal a judicial record then bears the burden of overcoming this strong presumption by meeting the compelling reasons standard.kamakana,at.under this stringent standard,a court may seal records only when it finds a compelling reason and articulate s the factual basis for its ruling,without relying on hypothesis or conjecture.id.at.the court must then conscientiously balance the competing interests of the public and the party who seeks to keep certain judicial records secret.id.quoting foltz,at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.what constitutes a compelling reason is best left to the sound discretion of the trial court.nixon,at.examples include when a court record might be used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal,to circulate libelous statements,or as sources of business information that might harm a litigant competitive standing.id.at.
despite this strong preference for public access,we have carved out an exception,foltz,at,for sealed materials attached to a discovery motion unrelated to the merits of a case,see phillips ex rel.estates of byrd motors,cir.under this exception,a party need only satisfy the less exacting good cause standard.foltz,at.the good cause language comes from rule c,which governs the issuance of protective orders in the discovery process the court may,for good cause,issue an order to protect a party or person from annoyance,embarrassment,oppression,or undue burden or expense.c.applying a strong presumption of access to documents a court has already decided should be shielded from the public would surely undermine,and possibly eviscerate,the broad power of the district court to fashion protective orders,and thereby undermine rule c.phillips,at see also seattle times rhinehart,d explaining that discovery is largely conducted in private as a matter of modern practice,so the public is not presumed to have a right of access to it anderson cryovac,cir there is no tradition of public access to discovery,and requiring a trial court to scrutinize carefully public claims of access would be incongruous with the goals of the discovery process.
when deciding what test to apply to a motion to unseal a particular court filing the presumptive compelling reasons standard or the good cause exception we have sometimes deployed the terms dispositive and.for example,in phillips,the los angeles times moved to unseal confidential settlement information that general motors produced in discovery under a protective order and was subsequently attached to a discovery sanctions motion.at.the district court granted the motion to unseal.id.at.in reversing that decision,we stressed the special role that protective orders play,that m uch of the information that surfaces during pretrial discovery may be unrelated,or only tangentially related,to the underlying cause of action,and reasoned that it made little sense to render the district court protective order useless simply because the plaintiffs attached a sealed discovery document to a nondispositive sanctions motion filed with the court.id.at quoting in part seattle times,at see also kamakana,at explaining that the sealed records in phillips were not directly relevant to the merits of the case.applying the good cause standard from rule c as an exception for motions makes sense,as the private interests of litigants are the only weights on the scale.kamakana,at.
in foltz,we again discussed dispositive and nondispositive motions.we recognized that t here are good reasons to distinguish between dispositive and nondispositive motions,as while motions are often unrelated to the merits of a case,t he same can not be said for materials attached to a summary judgment motion because summary judgment adjudicates substantive rights and serves as a substitute for trial.at quoting rushford new yorker magazine,cir.accordingly,we applied the compelling reasons standard to documents attached to a motion for summary judgment.see also kamakana,at reviewing phillips and foltz.
like the district court,chrysler urges us to read our case law to limit the compelling reasons test to only those cases in which the motion at issue is literally dispositive,meaning that it bring s about a final determination.black law dictionary ed.this would include motions to dismiss,for summary judgment,and judgment on the pleadings,but would not include other motions that go to the heart of a case,such as a motion for preliminary injunction or a motion in limine.in other words,the public would not be presumed to have regular access to much if not most of the litigation in federal court,as that litigation rarely falls into the narrow category of dispositive.
although the apparent simplicity of the district court binary approach is appealing,we do not read our case law to support such a limited reading of public access most litigation in a case is not literally dispositive,but nevertheless involves important issues and information to which our case law demands the public should have access.to only apply the compelling reasons test to the narrow category of dispositive motions goes against the long held interest in ensuring the public understanding of the judicial process and of significant public events.kamakana,at quoting valley broad,at internal quotation marks omitted.such a reading also contradicts our precedent,which presumes that the compelling reasons standard applies to most judicial records.pintos pac.creditors ass n,cir emphasis added.
when using the words dispositive and nondispositive,we do not believe our court intended for these descriptions to morph into mechanical classifications.rather,these descriptive terms are indicative of when a certain test should apply.for example,in kamakana,we wrote that there is a good reason why the public interest in accessing nondispositive motions is not as strong as dispositive motions because nondispositive motions are often unrelated,or only tangentially related,to the underlying cause of action.at emphasis added quoting seattle times,at.this statement implicitly acknowledges that nondispositive motions are not always unrelated to the underlying cause of action.the nondispositive discovery motion in phillips was unlikely to be related to the merits,while the motions for summary judgment in foltz and kamakana obviously were.nothing in phillips or any other case cited by chrysler or the dissent contemplates that the right of public access would be limited solely to literally dispositive motions,as none of those cases address the situation in which a nondispositive motion may be directly related to the merits of the case and where the good reason identified for treating nondispositive motions differently no longer applies.
the focus in all of our cases is on whether the motion at issue is more than tangentially related to the underlying cause of action.see phillips,at foltz,at kamakana,at pintos,at oliner,at.it is true that nondispositive motions are sometimes not related,or only tangentially related,to the merits of a case,as in phillips.but plenty of technically nondispositive motions including routine motions in limine are strongly correlative to the merits of a case 
particularly relevant here,a motion for preliminary injunction frequently requires the court to address the merits of a case,which often includes the presentation of substantial evidence.stormans selecky,cir.a motion for preliminary injunction may even,as a practical matter,determine the outcome of a case.see,miller rich,cir explaining how in this case,the denial of the preliminary injunction effectively decided the merits of the case citation omitted.in fact,because motions for preliminary injunctions are so significant,they are one of the few categories of motions that may be heard as interlocutory appeals.see see also.in certain circumstances,an appellate court may even choose to decide the merits of the case on an appeal from a motion for preliminary injunction as to the applicable rule of law.thornburgh am.coll.of obstetricians gynecologists,d overruled in part on other grounds by planned parenthood of se.casey,d gorbach reno,cir en banc.for the purposes of this opinion,however,we assume that the instant motion for preliminary injunction was technically nondispositive 
under chrysler view,the strong presumption of public access does not apply to any of the prior examples,but it would apply to a motion for summary judgment,which may contain the exact same materials.a motion for discovery sanctions that requests dismissal as a remedy would be dispositive under chrysler test,while the same motion attaching the same documents but seeking a remedy just shy of dismissal would be nondispositive.neither our case law nor the strong principles of public access to the courts supports such incongruity.
nor does the case law of other circuits,which rejects a mechanistic rule to determine when the presumption of public access applies.in the second circuit,for example,the weight given to the presumption of access is governed by the role of the material at issue in the exercise of article iii judicial power and the resultant value of such information to those monitoring the federal courts.amodeo ii,at.documents submitted to the court exist on a continuum,spanning those that play a role in determining litigants substantive rights,which are afforded strong weight,to those that play only a negligible role in performance of article iii duties such as those passed between the parties in discovery,which lie beyond the presumption reach.id.at.similarly,in the first circuit,the public has a right of access to materials on which a court relies in determining the litigants substantive rights which are distinguished from those that relate merely to the judge role in management of the trial and therefore play no role in the adjudication process.united states kravetz,cir citations omitted alterations in original.
the third and eleventh circuits directly reject a literal divide between dispositive and nondispositive motions.according to the third circuit,there is a presumptive right of access to pretrial motions of a nondiscovery nature,whether preliminary or dispositive,and the material filed in connection therewith we see no reason to distinguish between material submitted in connection with a motion for summary judgment and material submitted in connection with a motion for preliminary injunction leucadia,applied extrusion,cir.the rationale is that the presumption should apply to any motion related to a matter which the public has a right to know about and evaluate.id.alteration in original citation omitted.similarly,in the eleventh circuit,material filed in connection with any substantive pretrial motion,unrelated to discovery,is subject to the common law right of access,whether or not characterized as dispositive.romero drummond,cir citing amodeo ii,at.
given that preliminary injunctions are extraordinary and drastic remedies,lopez brewer,cir,they may certainly affect litigants substantive rights,see kravetz,at,amodeo ii,at.they also invoke important article iii powers,amodeo ii,at,so much so that magistrate judges may not even rule upon them,b a.a bright line rule that does not afford a presumption of access to a motion for preliminary injunction because it is nondispositive conflicts with the third and eleventh circuits and is,at best,in tension with the first and second circuits.
in re midland national life insurance company annuity sales practices litigation,cir,illustrates that our circuit looks past the literal label.in that case,an intervenor moved to unseal documents attached to a daubert motion.id.at.the district court,like the district court here,concluded that the documents should remain under seal because the daubert motion was,as it would not have been a determination on the merits of any claim or defense.id.at.we rejected the district court focus on whether the motion was literally dispositive that the records are connected to a daubert motion does not,on its own,conclusively resolve the issue.id.as the motion,in effect,pertain ed to central issues bearing on defendant summary judgment motion,we treated that motion as dispositive.id.we did not allow the technically nondispositive nature of the daubert motion to cloud the reality that it was able to significantly affect the disposition of the issues in the case.see also oliner,at applying compelling reasons test to motion to seal entire court record of an appeal from the bankruptcy court,even though motion did not result in a final determination on the merits.
case law is also replete with examples of motions for preliminary injunctions that reflect the need for the public right of access to provide the public with a more complete understanding of the judicial system and a better perception of its fairness.leucadia,at quoting republic of philippines westinghouse,cir.motions for preliminary injunctions have been utilized to test the boundaries of equal protection police the separation of powers in times of domestic and global instability protect one of our most valuable rights,the right to retain united states citizenship and even determine life or death people in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions with respect to such issues,but it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.richmond newspapers,virginia,d.in light of the strong presumption,these impactful motions should not be categorically shielded from the public right of access.
consistent with our precedent,we make clear that public access to filed motions and their attachments does not merely depend on whether the motion is technically dispositive.rather,public access will turn on whether the motion is more than tangentially related to the merits of a case.while many technically nondispositive motions will fail this test,some will pass.our reading of the public access cases is consistent with our own case law,and more importantly,comports with the old tradition of ensuring public access which antedates the constitution and is now beyond dispute.leucadia,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the dissent doomsday depiction of our opinion,in which we purportedly eviscerate rule c and its benefits,dissent at,not only ignores the real world intersection of rule c and the right to public access,but also the clear language from our previous decisions.as the dissent does not dispute,its reading of rule c in this context conflicts with virtually every other circuit to review this issue.the district courts in those circuits routinely apply a more nuanced test,and none has complained of staring at an ink blot.dissent at.we have full confidence that judges in our circuit are equally capable.the dissent convenient chessboard sweep of the experiences of our sister circuits responding only by calling them irrelevant in a footnote illustrates its shaky foundation.dissent at.and more importantly,the dissent indignation that we read certain language in our opinions as descriptive,rather than definitive,ignores that it does the same thing it chooses to interpret the language as a bright line rule,while painting the more than tangentially related to the merits of a case phrase as reasoning we used to justify the adoption of a bright line rule.dissent at.yet the dissent is the only opinion from any appellate court to read our caselaw in such stark terms.we choose to follow language in our case law that makes sense and is consistent with our fellow circuits.
b.the instant motion for preliminary injunction 
applying our circuit case law,we conclude that plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction is more than tangentially related to the merits.in the complaint,plaintiffs were seeking,in addition to damages,injunctive relief,including an order requiring chrysler to adequately disclose and repair the vehicle defect.in the preliminary injunction motion,plaintiffs requested that chrysler notify its customers that there was a part in their vehicle which could require replacement and be dangerous if it failed.as chrysler argued in its opposition to the preliminary injunction,once notice is given,it alters the status quo and can not be undone.if plaintiffs had succeeded in their motion for preliminary injunction,they would have won a portion of the injunctive relief they requested in the underlying complaint,and that portion of their claims would have been resolved.
chrysler counterarguments are unavailing.first,chrysler contends that because this motion for preliminary injunction was denied,the court should not apply the presumption of public access.but the common law right of access promotes the public interest in understanding the judicial process itself,foltz,at quoting hagestad tragesser,cir,and the bases or explanations for a court decision,oliner,at citation omitted.nothing in our precedent suggests that the right of access turns on any particular result.in fact,in kamakana,our circuit applied the presumption of public access to a summary judgment motion that was denied,in large part.at see also leucadia,at citing westinghouse,at explaining that papers filed in connection with a motion are not entitled to be shielded from public access merely because the district court denied the motion rather than granted it.
chrysler also argues that expanding the compelling reasons standard makes it easier for litigants to override protective orders.as a result,litigants will file more meritless motions.this argument is similarly unconvincing.district courts can use rule to impose sanctions on any party that files a motion for an improper purpose or who does so without a legal or factual basis.b c.
as the preliminary injunction motion here was more than tangentially related to the merits of the case,we vacate and remand for the district court to consider the documents under the compelling reasons standard.
iv.conclusion 
while simplicity has its virtues,it also has its vices.here,permitting the public right of access to turn on what relief a pleading seeks rather than on the relevance of the pleading elevates form too far beyond substance and over reads language in our case law.our precedent,which always has focused on whether the pleading is more than tangentially related to the merits,recognizes this essential point.to hold otherwise would permit the discovery exception to swallow the public access rule.due to the strong presumption for public access and the nature of the instant motion for a preliminary injunction,chrysler must demonstrate compelling reasons to keep the documents under seal.
vacated and remanded.
chrysler shall bear costs on appeal.
i fully concur in the majority opinion thoughtful analysis of ninth circuit precedent,and in its determination that public access to filed motions and their attachments hinges not on whether the motion is literally dispositive,but on whether the motion is more than tangentially related to the merits of the underlying case.i also concur in the majority conclusion that the preliminary injunction motion here was more than tangentially related to the merits of the case,and that the district court should therefore reconsider the documents under the compelling reasons standard.i write separately only to express my belief that reversal is warranted even under the binary approach endorsed by the dissent,for in my view the preliminary injunction motion at issue was literally dispositive of plaintiffs request that chrysler issue notice to its customers.
along with both the majority and the dissent,i accept that a motion is literally dispositive if it bring s about a final determination.see op.at quoting black law dictionary ed dissent at.a motion may bring about a final determination of one claim,however,without disposing of an entire case.indeed,it goes without saying that parties frequently file motions for partial summary judgment.and as the dissent writes,it is undisputed that summary judgment motions are dispositive.dissent at.thus,it appears to be uncontroverted that within a single case,a motion may be dispositive of some claims and nondispositive of others.
in the present case,plaintiffs complaint sought not only damages,but also injunctive relief,including an order requiring chrysler to adequately disclose and repair the vehicle defect.similarly,plaintiffs preliminary injunction motion requested that chrysler notify its customers that a part in their vehicles may be dangerous and require replacement.because notice can not be withdrawn once it is given,granting the preliminary injunction motion would have awarded plaintiffs a portion of their requested relief.for that reason,i find that the preliminary injunction motion here was literally dispositive of plaintiffs request that chrysler issue notice to its customers.
in sum,i fully concur in the judgment of the court for the reasons discussed in judge owens majority opinion.i add,however,that in my view the motion for preliminary injunction in the present case was literally dispositive of plaintiffs request for disclosure.as a result,even under the dissent approach,i would vacate and remand for the district court to reconsider whether the documents relevant to plaintiffs demand for notice should remain under seal using the compelling reasons standard.
according to the majority,the district court here erred because it relied on language in our cases which provides that when a party is attempting to keep records attached to a motion under seal,it need only show good cause.op.at.this comes as a surprise,because the language in our cases constitutes binding precedent.but no matter,the majority invents a new rule,namely that a party can not keep records under seal if they are attached to any motion that is more than tangentially related to the merits of a case,op.at,unless the party can meet the stringent standard of showing that compelling reasons support secrecy,op.at.because this decision overrules circuit precedent and vitiates rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure,i strongly dissent.
the right of litigants to protect certain documents disclosed in discovery from release to the public is embodied in rule c,which authorizes the district court to grant a protective order to protect a party or person from annoyance,embarrassment,oppression,or undue burden or expense.c.this includes requiring that a trade secret or other confidential research,development,or commercial information not be revealed or be revealed only in a specified way.c g.
when discovery material is filed with a court,we balance the protection afforded litigants under rule c with the presumption that the public has a right of access to public documents,including judicial records.see phillips ex rel.estates of byrd motors,cir.our cases,as well as supreme court decisions,have made clear that the common law right of access is not absolute,nixon warner commc ns,d see also seattle times rhinehart,d.the presumption in favor of access can be overcome by showing sufficiently important countervailing interests.phllips,at.
we have developed the following bright line rule to balance the common law right of access to court records with the protection afforded litigants under rule c 
if a party to a legal proceeding attaches a sealed discovery document to a nondispositive motion,the usual presumption of the public right of access is rebutted,and the party seeking disclosure must present sufficiently compelling reasons why the sealed discovery document should be released.phillips,at.
if a party attaches a sealed discovery document to a dispositive motion,the presumption of the public right of access is not rebutted,and the party seeking to protect the document must show compelling reasons to maintain the documents under seal.foltz,at.
there is nothing ambiguous about this rule,which we have recited numerous times.beginning in phillips,we explained that when a party attaches a sealed discovery document to a nondispositive motion,the usual presumption of the public right of access is rebutted,so that the party seeking disclosure must present sufficiently compelling reasons why the sealed discovery document should be released.at.we justified this bright line rule on the ground that the presumption of access to judicial documents should not eviscerate a district court protective order,and that m uch of the information that surfaces during pretrial discovery may be unrelated,or only tangentially related,to the underlying cause of action.id.quoting rhinehart,u.at.
we repeated this rule in foltz,quoting phillips verbatim for the proposition that when a party attaches a sealed discovery document to a nondispositive motion,the usual presumption of the public right of access is rebutted.at.foltz then added the second prong of our rule,holding that the presumption of access is not rebutted where,as here,documents subject to a protective order are filed under seal as attachments to a dispositive motion.id.at emphasis added.
we repeated this rule in kamakana city and county of honolulu,cir.we first explained that we have carved out an exception to the presumption of access to judicial records for a sealed discovery document attached to a motion,such that the usual presumption of the public right of access is rebutted.id.at citing phillips,at,and foltz,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.by contrast,t hose who seek to maintain the secrecy of documents attached to dispositive motions must meet the high threshold of showing that compelling reasons support secrecy.id.at emphasis added.
summing up,we treat judicial records attached to dispositive motions differently from records attached to motions.id.at.those who seek to maintain the secrecy of documents attached to dispositive motions must meet the high threshold of showing that compelling reasons support secrecy.id.by contrast,a good cause showing under rule c will suffice to keep sealed records attached to motions.id.
the majority boldly rejects this rule.it belittles the simplicity of our binary approach,which holds that the public presumed right of access applies to sealed discovery documents attached to a dispositive motion,but does not apply to sealed discovery documents attached to a nondispositive motion.op.at.
instead of following precedent,the majority creates a new rule w e make clear that public access to filed motions and their attachments does not merely depend on whether the motion is technically dispositive.rather,public access will turn on whether the motion is more than tangentially related to the merits of a case.op.at emphasis added.in plucking this more than tangentially related language from the reasoning we used to justify the adoption of a bright line rule,see,phillips,at,the majority improperly replaces the rule itself with a single phrase from our reasoning.
there can be no mistake that this new rule is inconsistent with our existing precedent.as the majority concedes,dispositive has a precise legal definition a motion is dispositive if it bring s about a final determination.op.at quoting black law dictionary ed.likewise,the majority concedes that this legal definition would include motions to dismiss,for summary judgment,and judgment on the pleadings,but would not include a motion for preliminary injunction or a motion in limine.op.at.and in this case,the majority assumes that the instant motion for preliminary injunction was technically nondispositive.op.at.under our existing precedent,therefore,the majority effectively admits it is wrong in holding that the documents attached to the preliminary injunction motion are subject to the public presumed right of access absent compelling reasons for secrecy 
the majority attempts to avoid this problem by relying on the casuistry that words have no fixed meaning,and therefore can also mean dispositive.surely,the majority argues,we did not intend to be bound by the literal meaning of the terms dispositive and nondispositive that we have sometimes deployed,op.at,because that would merely morph these words into mechanical classifications,op.at.nothing in our case law other than the words themselves,the majority claims,co
