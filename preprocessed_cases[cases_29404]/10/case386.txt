appellants filed a putative class action alleging that quest diagnostics i,a medical testing company,routinely overbilled patients.the district court denied certification as to all four of appellants proposed classes.following the denial,the court granted summary judgment against an individual appellant,denise cassese,as to her state law consumer deception claim.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the district court judgments.
background 
quest diagnostics is the country largest provider of diagnostic and clinical testing.in general,it tests a patient specimens upon the request of a referring physician.once quest bills a patient insurance provider,the provider reviews the claim and sends quest an explanation of benefits eob or an electronic remittance advice era,which informs quest of the amount,if any,that the patient is responsible for paying.quest then sends the patient a bill,and,if no response is received,it may turn the bill over to a collection agency.appellants advance numerous claims,but the heart of the case is the allegation that quest billed patients in excess of the amount stated on the eob or era.
appellants sought certification of several classes related to this alleged overbilling first,they proposed a class of all persons who were billed by quest and who paid an amount in excess of that stated on an eob or era provided to quest prior to the date of the bill hereinafter,post eob billing class.in addition,appellants sought to certify a class of those persons similarly overbilled by quest,who were members,participants,subscribers or beneficiaries of anthem blue cross and blue shield and the federal employee health benefits program hereinafter,anthem bcbs fehb program class.at oral argument,appellants acknowledged that this class is properly regarded as a subclass of the post eob billing class.appellants pled multiple causes of action for both classes and on appeal urge that the district court erred in denying certification as to two such claims state law consumer fraud and unjust enrichment.
because appellants proposed these two nationwide litigation classes as distinct from settlement classes,the district court engaged in a choice of law analysis for the state consumer fraud claim,and found that the law of the class members home states would apply.however,the court concluded that applying so many different fraud statutes would be unwieldy and inappropriate for class treatment at trial.it further held that appellants had not carried their burden to show precisely how the statutes could be grouped into a few categories for litigation,and accordingly denied certification to the post eob billing class and the anthem bcbs fehb program class as to their state consumer fraud claims.
concerning the unjust enrichment claim,the district court found that there were numerous explanations for overbilling that would not be wrongful or unjust.thus,the court held that the evidentiary showing required for each class member to show unjust enrichment would be highly individualized,such that common issues of fact did not predominate between the class members.the court further held that because the class definitions implicitly included a requirement of wrongful loss,given the attendant difficulty of determining liability,the classes themselves were not reasonably ascertainable.accordingly,the court denied certification for the post eob billing class and the anthem bcbs fehb program class as to their unjust enrichment claim.
separately,appellants proposed a class of all persons who received written demands from debt collectors retained by quest which i stated that the debt collector may engage in additional or further collection efforts or may report a delinquency to credit bureaus or ii added interest,charges or penalties in excess of the original amount billed by quest.app.hereinafter,debt collector victim class appellants state that they are now seeking certification as to only the second prong of that class,and only pursuant to a claim that the debt collectors violated the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa.on that issue,the district court found that the proposed representative plaintiff,richard grandalski,was not a member of the debt collector victim class because he had never received a written demand from debt collectors.without a representative plaintiff,the court denied certification as to prong ii of the debt collector victim class on the fdcpa claim.
finally,following the denial of class certification,the district court granted summary judgment against denise cassese,in her individual capacity,as to her claim under new york general business law.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to,inter alia,and we have jurisdiction under.we review a class certification order for abuse of discretion,which occurs if the district court decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.we review whether an incorrect legal standard has been used de novo.hayes wal mart stores,cir citation omitted.
separately,on review of summary judgment we employ the same standard as the district court pursuant to.a,that t he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
iii.analysis 
pursuant to.a,class representation is permissible if the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable there are questions of law or fact common to the class the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.further,a class action can be maintained if all above requirements are satisfied,and,as relevant to this case,the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.b.
appellants take issue with several of the district court rulings as to these requirements.first,appellants object to the denial of certification as to their state law consumer fraud claims.specifically,appellants contend that the district court should not have engaged in a choice of law analysis at the certification stage.appellants urge alternatively that the choice of law ruling was incorrect.as a further alternative,appellants argue that even if the local laws of states applied to the state claims,class treatment was warranted because the laws can be grouped for litigation purposes.
separately,appellants argue that certification should have been granted as to their claims of unjust enrichment,because common issues of fact predominated.appellants also argue that the district court erred in denying certification to the debt collector victim class.finally,appellants object to the dismissal of denise cassese individual claim.we address these arguments in turn.
state law consumer fraud claims 
choice of law analysis was not premature 
as noted above,the district court sought to determine which state law would govern the state consumer fraud claims for the proposed nationwide post eob billing class and anthem bcbs fehb program class.appellants argue that the district court should not have engaged in this choice of law analysis at the class certification stage,citing sullivan db investments,cir en banc.there,we noted that many courts find it inappropriate to decide choice of law issues incident to a motion for class certification.id.at citation and quotation marks omitted.
however,sullivan concerned settlement classes,which do not pose the types of management problems that can arise in a nationwide class action trial.we specifically stated in sullivan 
because we are presented with a settlement class certification,we are not as concerned with formulating some prediction as to how variances in state law would play out at trial,for the proposal is that there be no trial.as such,we simply need not inquire whether the varying state treatments of indirect purchaser damage claims at issue would present the type of insuperable obstacles or intractable management problems pertinent to certification of a litigation class.
id.at.we recognized that there may still be circumstances where i n a class action,variations in state law may swamp any common issues and defeat predominance.id.at citation omitted.
the nationwide classes proposed by appellants were for purposes of trial,not settlement.under such facts,it was reasonable for the district court to inquire at the certification stage as to whether the classes posed intractable management problems for trial.see id.at.indeed,we have found error where a district court failed to do so.see in re lifeusa holding,cir finding error where the district court failed to consider how individualized choice of law analysis of the different jurisdictions would impact on rule predominance requirement see also georgine amchem,cir b ecause we must apply an individualized choice of law analysis to each plaintiff claims the proliferation of disparate factual and legal issues is compounded exponentially.internal citation omitted.thus,it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to determine what law would govern the proposed state consumer fraud law claims.
choice of law analysis was not incorrect 
appellants next assert that the district court erred in concluding that the laws of putative class members home states controlled the state law claims.in its analysis,the district court applied the choice of law rules of the forum state,new jersey,to determine the controlling law.new jersey has adopted the most significant relationship test set out in the restatement second of conflict of laws.ex rel.camp jaycee.under this test,courts first inquire whether an actual conflict exists between the laws of the potentially relevant states.id.at.the parties do not dispute that an actual conflict exists between new jersey consumer fraud law and the consumer protection laws of other states.with an actual conflict,courts must then determine,by reference to the restatement,which state has the most significant relationship to the case and parties.id.at.the district court found that there are two distinct provisions in the restatement which could apply in this case.
first,of the restatement applies w hen the plaintiff has suffered pecuniary harm on account of his reliance on the defendant false representations and when the plaintiff action in reliance took place in the state where the false representations were made and received emphasis added.when this provision is satisfied,the law of the state where the representations were both made and received controls.the district court held that governed the case because quest misrepresentations demand for payment in bills were both made and received in the putative class members home states.the court apparently found that while certain of the misrepresentations were sent from quest headquarters in new jersey,they were nonetheless made when they were read at their destination the customer home state app.this reasoning was identical to that in the district court denial of appellants first motion for class certification,which was not appealed,agostino quest diagnostics,agostino i.
this reasoning has since been rejected by our court.in maniscalco brother int l usa,cir we held that c onstruing the location to which a representation is directed to be the same in which one is made as opposed to the location from which the representation emanated would render meaningless the restatement drafters careful distinction between made and received.we specifically cited agostino i as an instance in which such an incorrect reading had occurred.id.thus,both parties here agree that of the restatement second of conflict of laws does not apply.
when the misrepresentations were not made and received in the same state,the proper choice of law analysis instead involves of the restatement,which uses six factors to determine the state with the most significant relationship to the case.those factors are as follows 
a the place,or places,where the plaintiff acted in reliance upon the defendant representations,
b the place where the plaintiff received the representations,
c the place where the defendant made the representations,
d the domicil,residence,nationality,place of incorporation and place of business of the parties,
e the place where a tangible thing which is the subject of the transaction between the parties was situated at the time,and 
f the place where the plaintiff is to render performance under a contract which he has been induced to enter by the false representations of the defendant.
restatement second of conflict of laws.while the district court did not have the benefit of maniscalco at the time of its ruling,it actually did consider the appropriate analysis under as an alternative holding,and maintained that these factors still weighed in favor of using the law of individual class members states.the court held that the class members each paid money in their home states in reliance on the quest bill factor a,received the bill in their own states factor b,presumably obtained lab services in their home states factor e,and quest was expected to render performance in their home states factor f.the court held that factor d,the residence of all parties,was neutral.finally,the district court found that factor c,the place where the defendant made the representations,new jersey,was not enough to overcome the remaining factors favoring the use of class members home state consumer fraud law.
while we agree with appellants that the district court erred in weighing certain of the factors its analysis generally comports with our reasoning in maniscalco.in that case,a plaintiff sought to bring a class action pursuant to new jersey law,but the district court held that the law of plaintiff residence,south carolina,applied instead.we affirmed,finding that factors a and b,where the plaintiff acted in reliance and where he received the representations,weighed strongly in favor of applying south carolina law.at.factor e,the location of a tangible thing,weighed in favor of south carolina law,because the case concerned a defective printer purchased in that state.factor f was inapplicable because there was no contract.we held that factor d,the location of all parties,weighed slightly in favor of south carolina law,given that t he domicil,residence and place of business of the plaintiff are more important than are similar contacts on the part of the defendant.restatement second of conflict of laws cmt.i.we went on to note the further commentary in the restatement that i f any two of the contacts,apart from the defendant domicil,state of incorporation or place of business,are located wholly in a single state,this will usually be the state of the applicable law with respect to most issues.maniscalco,f d at quoting restatement second of conflict of laws cmt.j.
here,similar to maniscalco,factors a and b,where the plaintiff acted in reliance and where he received the representations,weigh in favor of applying the laws of putative class members home states.in addition,factor d,the residence of all parties,also weighs in favor of class members home state law,given that the domicil of the plaintiff is regarded by the restatement as more important than that of the defendant.see restatement second of conflict of laws cmt.
also similar to maniscalco,only factor c,where the representations were made,weighs in favor of applying new jersey law.as we held in maniscalco,n othing else about the relationship between the parties,other than the fortuitous location of the defendant headquarters,took place in the state of new jersey.plaintiff home state,in which he received and relied on the defendant alleged fraud,has the most significant relationship to his consumer fraud claim.maniscalco,at.the same conclusion applies here.
finally,in maniscalco we noted that the factors are to be construed in light of the principles set forth in of the restatement,which include the interests of interstate comity,the interests of the parties,the inter
