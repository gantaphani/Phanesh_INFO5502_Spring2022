a class of retirees and their union filed this action after their former employer unilaterally altered its retiree health benefits program.because the governing collective bargaining agreement does not provide for vested retiree health benefits,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the employer.
constellium rolled,llc operates an aluminum plant in ravenswood,west virginia.the individual plaintiffs have retired from working in that plant.the united steel,paper and forestry,rubber,manufacturing,energy,allied industry service workers international union the union represented the retirees during their employment.as far back as,the union negotiated collective bargaining agreements cbas with constellium or its predecessors on the employees behalf.
each individual class member retired during the operation of one of seven cbas between the union and one of constellium predecessors.these included the cba between the union and kaiser aluminum chemical corporation the cba between the union and ravenswood aluminum corporation of west virginia,the cba between the union and ravenswood aluminum the cba between the union and century aluminum corporation the cba between the union and pechiney rolled products the cba between the union and alcan rolled and the cba between the union and alcan.the cba expired on july.
article of each cba,which appears in substantially the same form across all seven,contained a provision for group health insurance benefits.the provision reads as follows 
the group insurance benefits shall be set forth in booklets entitled employees group insurance program and retired employees group insurance program,and such booklets are incorporated herein and made a part of the labor agreement by such reference.
it is understood that this agreement with respect to insurance benefits is an agreement on the basis of benefits and that the benefits shall become effective on july,except as otherwise provided in the applicable booklet,and further that such benefits shall remain in effect for the term of this labor agreement.
the booklet to which article refers,entitled retired employees group insurance program,serves as the summary plan description spd of the group health insurance benefits program for retirees.the first edition of the spd was issued in,with subsequent editions issued in,and.the spd provides that,with limited exceptions,t he benefits described in this summary are effective as of june,the date of the start of the cba,and that these benefits last for the term of the labor agreement.substantively identical language appeared in the previous editions of the spd.
in addition to the various editions of article of the cba and the spd,the union and constellium predecessors agreed,in another set of documents,which the parties call cap letters,to further parameters governing retiree health benefits.in november,one month before they signed the cba,the union and pechiney reached agreement on how they would allocate health care spending for employees who retired on or after january.the parties agreed that pechiney would annually contribute up to for each retiree under the age of and for those retirees age or over.the cap letter further provided that any costs above this cap shall be allocated evenly to all participants in such group,as an annual individual contribution.additionally,the cap letter mandated that the parties negotiate any cap on health benefits as part of subsequent collective bargaining negotiations.finally,this cap letter delayed implementation of the requirement for retirees until january,after the cba expiration date.
on august,roughly two months after the start of the cba,the union and pechiney signed a second cap letter,which adjusted pechiney contribution level for retirees.the cap letter took effect on january,after the cba expiration date.finally,on july,the same day they signed the cba,the union and alcan executed a third cap letter.this one kept the cap letter employer contribution limit,again only for retirees.unlike the previous two cap letters,which took effect after the implementation of their cbas,the cap letter took effect on january,over eighteen months before the expiration of the cba.
in july,during negotiations over a new cba,constellium proposed amending article to extend the cap on its contributions to retiree health benefits to employees who retired before january,and to freeze its medicare part b premium reimbursement amount for all hourly retirees at.the union,asserting that the retiree health benefits had vested,refused to bargain on this issue.constellium sent the union a written notice that it planned to make these changes beginning january.when that day came,constellium did so.
in february,the individuals who retired during one of the cbas and the union collectively the retirees initiated this litigation against constellium and its pension plan.on march,the retirees filed their first amended complaint,which contained both class and individual allegations.the class allegations were on behalf of two subclasses retirees whom the extension of the contribution cap affected and hourly employees whom the medicare premium contribution freeze affected who alleged a violation of section of the labor management relations act.the individual plaintiffs brought an additional claim for violation of section a of the employee retirement income security act,a b erisa.all of these claims rested on the contention that the retiree health benefits had vested.
following discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted constellium motion and dismissed the case.barton constellium rolled,llc,wl.the retirees subsequently noted this timely appeal.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.henry purnell,cir.en banc.summary judgment is proper only if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,there are no genuine disputes of material fact and the moving party demonstrates the right to judgment as a matter of law.id.
the retirees argue that the parties intended the article health benefits to vest,and so continue beyond the duration of the cba.accordingly,they contend,constellium unilateral alteration of those benefits breached its obligations under the cba.
the supreme court has recently held courts must interpret agreements,including those establishing erisa plans,according to ordinary principles of contract law,at least when those principles are not inconsistent with federal labor policy.polymers usa,llc tackett.thus,in tackett the court instructed w here the words of a contract in writing are clear and unambiguous,its meaning is to be ascertained in accordance with its plainly expressed intent.id.quoting lord,williston on contracts,at ed.
tackett involved review of a sixth circuit case that,in accord with prior circuit precedent,held for a class of plaintiff retirees.see at.that prior circuit precedent,international union,united automobile,aerospace,agricultural implement workers of america,directed courts to apply a presumption that,barring unambiguous evidence to the contrary,parties intended for benefits in a collective bargaining agreement to vest.id.at.in tackett,the supreme court reject ed the inferences as inconsistent with ordinary principles of contract law.id.at see also id.at explaining incompatibility with general contract principles.it explained that clashed with the traditional principle that contractual obligations will cease,in the ordinary course,upon termination of the bargaining agreement.id.at quoting litton fin.printing,litton bus,nlrb.indeed,the supreme court in tackett specifically mandated that when a contract is silent as to the duration of retiree benefits,a court may not infer that the parties intended those benefits to vest for life.id.
thus,we must interpret article using ordinary contract principles.and in doing so,we must recognize that these principles foreclose holding that the retiree health benefits have vested unless unambiguous evidence indicates that the parties intended that outcome.
article of the cba states that the retiree health benefits shall remain in effect for the term of this labor agreement.ar
