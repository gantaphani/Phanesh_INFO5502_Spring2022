fighter jet engines propel planes faster than the speed of sound,a sight that may be as exhilarating to watch as it must be to experience.not so the procurement process for awarding contracts to make jet engines.
in the early,the air force set up a bidding process to make fighter jet engines.attempting to win as many engine contracts as possible,united technologies manipulated its cost estimates to convince the air force to award the company a large share of the work.after the air force discovered that united technologies had played with its numbers,the united states filed a lawsuit under the false claims act and common law,seeking reimbursement for the fraud.the district court ruled for the government on liability under the false claims act but held that it had suffered no damages and ruled that the government administrative proceedings precluded it from raising its common law claims.we affirm the liability determination but reverse the district court damages determination and its ruling.
pratt and whitney is a division of united technologies corporation.for many years,the united states air force relied exclusively on pratt to provide it with and fighter jet engines.in,fearful of the risks of relying on just one company to produce the engines,the air force conducted a fighter engine competition fec for future fighter jet engine contracts.only pratt and general electric had the capacity to manufacture the air force desired fighter jet engines and thus only the two companies competed for the contract.
in may,the air force issued a request for proposal,seeking offers for the contract.each offer,the air force explained,should include three options a price for one purchase order covering three years and three price options for the air force to make annual purchases for an additional three years a price for a purchase order with one price option for the last year and a price option for a purchase order,firm options for annual purchases the second and third years and price options for the last three years.appeals of united techs,bca p,wl,finding initial asbca decision.
faced with the prospect of losing some of its fighter jet engine contracts to ge,pratt prepared an offer that made it difficult for the air force to enter into engine contracts with pratt and ge.pratt submitted its initial proposal in august.the air force reviewed the proposal,prepared some objections and met with pratt to go over its concerns.after the meeting,the air force gave pratt a list of questions about cost estimates for pratt to answer in its final proposal.pratt submitted its best and final offer in december.
as part of this final offer,pratt submitted a document exhibit.that explained the company cost estimates and responded to the air force questions.exhibit contained three false statements,all designed to drive up the prices for contracts and to discourage the air force from splitting up the work.one pratt said that it had used the most recent inflation forecasts to calculate the prices when it had used a different inflation index.two in preparing its cost estimates,pratt said that it had applied a decrement factor an estimate of how much the engine prices would decrease based on pratt prior negotiations with though pratt had not factored decrement data into the final offer.three pratt said that it had used the most current engine configurations to calculate its prices,even though it had relied on an earlier engine model without accounting for engine components that did not go into the updated engine.the method to the scheme was to drive up the prices for contracts,then provide a formula to reduce prices if the air force awarded a greater percentage of the engines to pratt.pratt does not dispute any of these facts.
based on pratt and ge proposals,and despite pratt efforts to discourage the air force from splitting the work,the air force chose to exercise a,option for the first year of the fec and executed the contract with pratt and ge.the contract allowed the air force to exercise,or options,the option allowing the air force to determine its engine quantities for one year,the option allowing the air force to determine its engine quantities for three years,and so on.the contract breaks each year into fy and fec terms,with for example corresponding with fec i and corresponding with fec ii.the contract obligated the air force to purchase at least engines from pratt in fec i,and at least engines from pratt for each of the remaining five years.
in february,the air force briefed congress on its decision to award engine contracts to pratt and ge on a competitive basis.after the hearings,congress passed the defense department authorization act for,which prohibited the air force from making a contract to purchase engines if the warranty is to say the costs the engine provider would have to pay the government if the engine percent of the total contract price.see,stat.
because pratt warranties in the final offer exceeded the statutory cap,the air force sent a letter to pratt indicating that the air force would review and consider any update or revision to pratt warranty offer.appx.at.the air force also suggested that pratt could use this opportunity to revise other terms and conditions of the contract.pratt responded with an offer to reduce its warranty prices in exchange for a million cap on its previously unlimited liability.pratt also offered several other improvements to the contract.the air force accepted the warranty modification and incorporated it into the contract.the air force also accepted several other modifications proposed by pratt,including one that reduced the air force minimum engine purchases.the air force exercised its option under these revised terms and awarded engines to pratt and engines to ge for fec 
to update and potentially improve the terms of the contract,as required under federal law,see c iii,d,f,the air force began a call for improvement process,initial asbca decision,finding.before the air force exercised its option for fec ii,it sent a letter to pratt asking if pratt had any updates or improvements to its option prices.the air force repeated this process for fec iii,iv,v and vi.before exercising its options for each year,the air force sent a letter to pratt offering the company an opportunity to update and improve the terms and conditions of options under contract.appx.at fec iii,fec iv,fec v,fec vi.the air force indicated that it would consider each improvement individually,requiring pratt to offer each revision on a stand alone basis,appx.at fec iii,fec iv,fec v,fec vi.the air force also explained that it did not intend to and will not conduct an additional formal competition,disclaiming any suggestion that pratt should treat the letter as a request for proposal,appx.at fec iii,fec iv,fec v,fec vi.
pratt responded with updated options for each fec cycle.pratt offered improvements on its engine prices,its warranty prices and other contract provisions.in each year,the air force accepted pratt improvements,modified the contract and exercised its options under the revised contract terms.due to these improvements,the air force awarded pratt an increasing percentage of the engines after fec 
as the jet engine contract drew to a close,the air force began an audit of the fec program,which uncovered handwritten notes by a pratt executive detailing the company plans to play with the numbers to win a contract.the air force looked into the matter but eventually closed the investigation.
in,a department of justice auditor investigated the engine contracts and noticed pratt false statements in its best and final offer.in response,the united states launched two proceedings against pratt an administrative action and a lawsuit.in,it sought a contract price reduction before the armed services board of contract appeals,arguing that pratt had furnished defective cost or pricing final offer and other preparatory violation of the truth in negotiations act.f.the board held that pratt final offer was not cost or pricing data within the meaning of the truth in negotiations act,that pratt preparatory work constituted cost or pricing data under the act and that pratt failure to disclose its preparatory work violated the act.the board,however,did not reduce the contract price because it determined that pratt understatements in its cost estimates offset its overstatements.
pratt moved for reconsideration.the board changed its mind in part,concluding that the air force had not relied on pratt cost or pricing data to determine the reasonableness of pratt offers,an affirmative defense under the truth in negotiations act.asbca reconsideration,bca p,wl.the air force appealed,and the federal circuit affirmed.wynne united techs.
in march,the government filed a lawsuit against pratt in federal district court for violations of the false claims act and for relief under three common law theories breach of contract,payment by mistake and unjust enrichment.because the false claims act has a statute of limitations,b,the united states sought to recover only for false claims act violations after march,which included the last three years of the contract.
for reasons that the record does not fully explain,the bench trial did not begin until october.the trial lasted through december,and the court heard closing arguments in april.in august,the court issued its decision,finding pratt liable for violations of the false claims act,a number that corresponds to the number of invoices that pratt submitted under the contract after march.the court concluded that,despite the calls for improvements process,the government had the legal right to award the entire contract to pratt and to have the contract performed based upon pratt final offer.at.at the same time,however,the court found that the government suffered no damages because pratt price reductions offset any cost overstatements in its final offer.it separately held that claim preclusion barred the government from bringing its common law contract claims because it litigated or could have litigated those claims before the board of contract appeals.both parties filed with respect to the liability ruling and the government with respect to the damages and rulings.
as to liability,the district court concluded that pratt violated two provisions of the false claims act a and a of title.in,congress amended.in this opinion,all references to are to the earlier version.section a prohibits an individual from knowingly present ing or caus ing to be presented,to an officer or employee of the united states government a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval.a.section a prohibits knowingly mak ing,us ing,or caus ing to be made or used,a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid a.the act defines a claim as any request or demand,whether under a contract or otherwise,for money or property c.
under the act,a false or fraudulent claim includes a false statement that is material to the government decision to pay a claim.see united states ex rel.a homecare,medshares mgmt.grp,cir.the parties do not dispute that pratt best and final offer may provide the basis for liability under the act.they do not dispute that pratt final offer contained three false statements.they do not dispute that those false statements were material to the government decision to enter into a contract with pratt.and they do not dispute that,in the abstract,an invoice submitted in connection with a contract premised on a false statement amounts to a claim under the request under a contract for money.c.
that leaves the possibility that liability does not exist when the relevant invoices are sent in connection with a contract like this one,as opposed to a or contract.that distinction,however,does not change things.see united states ex rel.marcus hess,harrison westinghouse savannah river,cir.hess establishes that an invoice,which itself does not contain a falsity,may supply the premise for a false claim if submitted in connection with a fraudulently obtained contract.at.why the invoices caused the government to pay claims under contracts found to have been executed as the result of fraudulent bidding.id.at.one variety of fraud is a knowingly false statement that has the natural tendency to influence,or is capable of influencing a government decision maker to pay the related invoice.a homecare,at.false statements underlying contracts generate a stream of related invoices and cause the government to pay all of the invoices related to the contract.
that is just what happened here.in its request for proposal,the air force asked that all proposals include cost estimates with fully supported cost data.after pratt submitted its initial proposal,the air force asked pratt why it failed to apply decrements.the air force met with pratt before the company submitted its final offer and asked it to explain the cost estimates.exhibit addressed the air force questions.on this record,pratt false statements had the potential to influence the government decision to sign the contract and thus to pay the invoices under it.see a homecare,at.
none of this matters,pratt submits,because it made the best and final offer well before march,when the window closed on its initial interactions with the government and above all well before several modifications to the contract.all that leaves,pratt urges,are invoices submitted after march,which did not themselves contain falsities and which were connected to six separate fighter jet engine contracts with the air force after it modified the original contract through the calls for improvements process.
but it is not that easy to separate the original contract from the modifications to it.the original contract set price windows for six years and obligated the air force to purchase a minimum number of engines in each of these six years.not surprisingly,as a result,all of the documentation through fec vi refers to the same one arising from the false statements in the best and final offer.in soliciting revisions,moreover,the air force indicated it would consider each revision on a stand alone basis,not that it would reconsider the entire contract,appx.at fec iii,fec iv,fec v,fec vi.the government recorded the new terms as contract modifications,not as new freestanding contracts.
pratt demurs,pointing to language in the government letters about canceling and superseding the original contract.but when read in context,this language cancels contract clauses or attachments,not the entire contract.see,appx.at fec iv,fec vi.confirming the point,the language appears in a section outlining enhancement s to be incorporat ed into the engine contract,appx.at fec iv,or is listed as one of several changes to the original contract,appx.at fec vi.
the nature of the revisions points in the same direction.they arose from the calls for improvements process,a federally mandated opportunity to facilitate further price competition between pratt and ge.the air force designed the process to benefit seek improvements to the contract from the government perspective,an opportunity to sweeten a deal that happened only because the air force entered into the contract based on fraud in the first place.the air force never issued a new request for proposal it sought only improvements from parties to the existing jet engine contracts.
also unavailing is pratt reliance on allison engine united states ex rel.sanders.construing a prior version of a,allison engine held that a plaintiff must prove that a defendant intended to use a false record to get the government to pay a claim.id.at.in response,congress amended the false claims act,retroactive to claims pending in june,providing that a claimant no longer has to prove that a defendant intended to get a false claim paid.see fraud and enforcement recovery act of,stat.even if the allison engine standard for liability under a applies to pratt,a point we need not decide,the government satisfied it.pratt intended the government to pay the fraudulent invoices that it submitted directly to the government,while allison engine had no such intent when it submitted invoices to a contractor,not the government.allison engine,at.even if that were not the case,moreover,pratt still violated a,a provision not at issue in allison engine,by submitting fraudulent invoices to the governme
