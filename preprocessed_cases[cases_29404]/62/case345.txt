four former civilian technician members of the puerto rico army national guard prang joined two labor organizations collectively the guardsmen in contending the district court erred in upholding the policy and practice of the united states,the secretary of the army,and the chief of the national guard bureau collectively the united states of recommending,rather than ordering,reinstatement of discharged members of a state national guard the guardsmen contend such authority is plainly conferred by,which authorizes the president to govern and issue orders to a state national guard.the plain text does not address reinstatement.the united states interpretation of its enforcement powers is consistent with the text read in light of the militia clause of the united states constitution and the statutory scheme and represents a reasoned judgment of its relationship with the states national guard.accordingly,we affirm the grant of summary judgment to the united states.
the guardsmen had dual status,by virtue of working as civilian technicians,which required them to be members of a state national guard.b.upon being notified of their proposed discharge from prang,pursuant to puerto rico regulation on involuntary separation,either the guardsmen or their unit commanders filed rebuttals.however,army regulation on administrative separations required prang to notify the guardsmen in writing of their right to request a hearing by an administrative board.none of the guardsmen received this notice or appeared before an administrative board prior to their discharges.instead,after filing rebuttals,they received honorable discharges from prang and were transferred to the army reserves or the retired reserves,depending on their length of service.
the guardsmen appealed their discharges to the army board for correction of military records the board requesting that their national guard records be corrected to show they were never discharged and they were not absent without leave when prang was activated after hurricane george.the board found that the discharges violated federal regulations,which required both notice of a right to a hearing or appearance before an administrative board prior to discharge for persons with over six years of service,and the approval of the discharge by the chief of the national guard bureau in the department of defense for any soldiers with over eighteen but less than twenty years of service concluding the discharges were therefore erroneous and unjust,but that it lacked authority to order the guardsmen reinstatement in prang,the board recommended that the adjutant general of puerto rico amend the discharge orders,reinstate the guardsmen with all pay,allowance,and retirement points,and correct prang records to show they were not discharged.the board ordered the correction of army reserves records to reflect the guardsmen proper amount of service in prang,assuming no discharge.prang declined to reinstate the guardsmen.the guardsmen thus remained in the army reserves following their discharges from prang but automatically lost their civilian technician jobs because they were no longer members of prang.
the guardsmen filed suit,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief that the united states ongoing policy and practice of refusing to order reinstatement of guardsmen and correction of state national guard records and related relief was based on an erroneous belief of lack of authority.compl.the district court ruled the guardsmen claim was cognizable under the administrative procedure act apa,and that the united states interpretation of its authority was reasonable and entitled to deference,granting summary judgment to the united states.ass of civilian technicians,united states,d.the guardsmen appeal,and our review of the grant of summary judgment is de novo.see fontana.white.
the guardsmen focus on,which provides the president shall prescribe regulations,and issue orders,necessary to organize,discipline,and govern the national guard.they contend section plainly authorizes the president to govern the prang,which necessarily includes the power to enforce federal regulations on discharge procedures.because congress placed this authority in the secretary of the army acting through the board,see,the guardsmen maintain that section authorization to govern and to issue orders means the board can order reinstatement and correction of prang records where separation from prang violated federal regulations.the guardsmen do not challenge the federal relief granted by the board.
the united states responds that it has interpreted govern in section to authorize regulations and orders that apply generally to all the states national guard while leaving control of the operations to the states.it maintains that its interpretation is due deference under chevron,natural resources defense council.the united states does not explain on what basis the court might conclude congress intended the board interpretation of a statute to be accorded the force of law,see united states mead,and the record does not indicate that the board interpretation of section was adopted in a rulemaking or formal adjudication the board rules of procedure call for informal proceedings,see,and the provisions of the administrative procedure act on adjudications do not apply to the conduct of military functions,a.however,it is undisputed that the united states policy and practice is longstanding,and under the circumstances the court considers counsel explanation of the statutory basis for the denial of the full relief sought by the guardsmen to represent the united states fair and considered judgment.ass of bituminous contractors,apfel.we conclude,regardless of the standard of review,that the denial of full relief to the guardsmen was correct.see fontana,at.
we look to the text of the statute,recognizing that words are to be read in the context in which they are used and in the broader context of the statutory scheme.see,robinson shell oil.the plain text of section does not address the nature and extent of the united states governance of the states national guard.although it authorizes the united states to govern,neither the text nor the context require that the word be given its most expansive meaning.the militia clause and the statutory scheme contemplate a shared responsibility for the national guard,although the precise nature of that relationship is not always obvious.as the fifth circuit has observed,in the federal scheme,the national guard has come to occupy a unique place.it has become,by design,a hybrid entity that carefully combines both federal and state characteristics,sometimes distinctly and sometimes not.lipscomb fed.labor relations,cir.this court has made a similar observation,noting t he national guard plays a dual role,operating under joint federal and state control.in re sealed case.
the militia clause of the constitution provides that congress shall have the power 
to provide for organizing,arming,and disciplining,the militia,and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the united states,reserving to the states respectively,the appointment of the officers,and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by congress 
art.i,cl.emphasis added.the militia in this clause is the national guard,see gilligan morgan,in re sealed case,at see also,and the clause expressly contemplates the reservation of powers to the states.the statutory scheme for the national guard appears in title,which addresses the armed forces generally and establishes the board,and title,which addresses the national guard specifically.title provides with respect to the army national guard of the united that,when not on active duty,its members shall be administered,armed,equipped,and trained in their status as members of the army national guard.see id.title provides,in turn,that when not called to federal duty by the president,a state national guard is under the command of the state governor and the state adjutant general,who is appointed by the governor.see charles rice,cir kise dep t of military veterans affairs.this command falls within a federal
