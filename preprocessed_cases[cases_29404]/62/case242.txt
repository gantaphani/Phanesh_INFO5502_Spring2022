chi tong kuok was convicted after a jury trial on four counts of conspiracy and attempt to export defense articles without a license,money laundering,and conspiracy and attempt to smuggle goods from the united states.kuok raises a variety of challenges to his conviction and sentence.we first conclude that venue was proper in the southern district of california.we disagree with kuok that the arms export control act violates the nondelegation principle.we next conclude that kuok conviction on count three must be vacated as a matter of law,because attempting to cause an export of a defense article is not a federal crime.likewise,kuok conviction on count four must be vacated for lack of jurisdiction.finally,because the district court should have allowed kuok to present evidence of duress to the jury,we reverse and remand for a new trial on counts one and two.given this disposition,we do not reach kuok arguments regarding his sentence.
kuok is a citizen of macau,a special administrative region of the people republic of china and,until recently,a colony of portugal.for roughly a decade,kuok engaged in efforts to import protected defense articles from the united states into china,without the licenses required by law.in the summer of,his activities caught up with him,and kuok was arrested by immigration and customs enforcement ice agents at the atlanta airport.the indictment,filed in july,charged,in count one,conspiracy to export items on the munitions list without the required license and conspiracy to buy items knowing they were intended for export in violation of law,a b.count two charged kuok with buying a kg taclane encryptor knowing that it was intended for exportation contrary to law.a.count three charged kuok with attempting to export the encryptor from the united states without the required license.b a.count four charged kuok with transmitting in funds with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity the smuggling and the export offenses charged in counts two and three.a a.
at trial,the government presented evidence that,over the course of a year period between and,kuok tried to purchase from vendors in the united states various types of communication equipment commonly used by the military.the government investigation began in december when kuok approached a british company to obtain materials for a device used to transfer data to and from aircraft.kuok contact at the company referred the case to ice,who proceeded to investigate kuok via undercover agents.as part of the investigation,ice subpoenaed kuok ebay records and discovered that kuok had purchased radios from a los angeles seller.after raiding the seller home,undercover ice agents took over and continued to discuss transactions for similar equipment with kuok.kuok eventually grew suspicious of the undercover agents,and broke off negotiations.ice continued in this vein,opening several other investigations into kuok ebay activity and tracking him via undercover agents until kuok broke off communications.
the crux of the government case lies in the encryptor described in the indictment a device called the kg taclane encryptor offered for sale on ebay by an arizona company.kuok attempts to purchase the device prompted another investigation by undercover ice agents,who pretended to be willing to sell this device to kuok.kuok arranged for a money order transfer to pay for the encryptor.the encryptor never showed up,and the undercover agent claimed it had been confiscated in customs in alaska.despite kuok repeated suspicions that he was dealing with law enforcement,he arranged to meet the agent in panama to obtain the encryptor.kuok promptly informed his contact that he would be traveling through atlanta to get to panama,which unsurprisingly resulted in his arrest in the atlanta airport.
at trial,kuok did not dispute the facts described above,nor the government evidence that the items kuok purchased or attempted to purchase required a license to export them from the united states a license which kuok did not possess.kuok also did not dispute that he knew his actions violated law.rather,kuok entire defense strategy rested on a theory of duress.
defense counsel raised the issue of duress in his opening statement.he described the facts supporting the duress defense to the jury,explaining that kuok had lived in macau all his life.kuok started his own business in,installing and maintaining building management systems.a few years before he opened this business,kuok developed contacts with a businessman who identified himself as a chinese cultural official,kung pen zheng.zheng began asking kuok to buy items from abroad that could not be obtained in china,and kuok cooperated in order to develop this business contact.the items were available on ebay,and kuok generally had no problems acquiring them,but troublingly,it would often take a long time for zheng to pay kuok back.
according to kuok counsel,what started out as a friendly relationship turned serious at one business dinner,when zheng after encouraging kuok to drink to excess pressured kuok into signing a note promising to locate and purchase certain items that could not be obtained in china.the next day,kuok realized that he might be in a bad situation and attempted to back out by telling zheng that his wife was ill and work needed his attention.zheng reminded kuok that he had signed the contract promising to find these items.zheng then contacted kuok wife,who was surprised to hear that she was supposed to be ill.kuok who had never given zheng his home telephone number was unhappy when he heard about zheng phone call to his wife,and spoke to zheng again later that day.zheng asked kuok why he had lied,and kuok asked zheng not to call his wife again.zheng replied why are you afraid we going to hurt her kuok interpreted this as a clear threat to harm his family,but by that point he knew that the threat was coming from the chinese government itself and that he could not go to the local police,who were under the chinese government control.
according to counsel,kuok situation only escalated from there he was presented with reports detailing his wife,and her employer name and address.kuok was shown reports of this type for the next several years,as well as photos of himself with his wife and child out in public,with the clear implication that his family was being tracked.zheng even sent kuok a gift after the birth of his son,although kuok had never told zheng that his wife was pregnant.
around,zheng stopped being subtle.he explained to kuok that others were doing the same things kuok was being made to do,and if they refused,a family member would be arrested and held in a black jail where the chinese government sends people to take them off the grid.in,kuok first learned that his actions could violate export laws.he went to zheng again and asked to stop.zheng refused to let him out of the deal,instead telling kuok that he had no choice.in,kuok was diagnosed with a tumor and hospitalized for a week,again begging to be let out of zheng schemes,but still zheng refused.
after opening statements concluded,kuok made a brady request for any materials in the government possession that would support his duress defense.the government objected to the brady request,and the district court denied it as untimely the government also objected to the duress defense on the grounds that kuok should have given notice of his defense before trial the district court ordered the parties to brief the duress issue.the government argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the duress defense,and the district court agreed.kuok filed a motion to reconsider,which contained a more detailed proffer of the defense case.for instance,he claimed that zheng told kuok that if his wife were taken to a black jail,she would be harmed and might not ever return.kuok also asserted that he had attempted to tell the ice agents at the airport that he had been forced to act.finally,kuok added details explaining how he knew that zheng and the other officials worked for the ministry of state security,china equivalent of the cia.
the district court denied the motion for reconsideration.the case proceeded to trial,and the jury found kuok guilty on all counts.prior to sentencing,kuok served another brady request on the government,asking for evidence to support an imperfect duress defense.the district court denied the request.at sentencing,the district court calculated the applicable guidelines range to be to months.the district court varied upward and sentenced kuok to months on counts two through four,and months on count one,to run concurrently.this appeal followed.
we first address kuok claims common to all counts that venue in the southern district of california was improper,and the statutory export control regime violates the nondelegation doctrine our review of both claims is de novo,united states bozarov,cir nondelegation doctrine united states ruelas arreguin,cir venue,and we reject kuok arguments.
kuok challenges venue on counts two through four,which are based on kuok purchase of the taclane encryptor the constitution requires that venue lie in the state and district where a crime was committed.const.art.iii,cl.const.amend.vi see also.the burden of establishing proper venue by a preponderance of the evidence rests with the government.ruelas arreguin,at.the government argues that venue was plainly proper in the southern district of california,because the undercover ice agent withdrew funds in a san diego bank from kuok money transfer.
kuok argues that venue is not proper because the government manufactured venue in the southern district of california by its own activities.this argument fails.kuok cites two cases in support of his argument,neither of which even mention the word venue.see united states coates,cir m anufactured jurisdiction can not form the basis for a federal prosecution.united states archer,cir whatever congress may have meant by a,it certainly did not intend to include a telephone call manufactured by the government for the precise purpose of transforming a local bribery offense into a federal crime.both cases deal with manufacturing jurisdiction for a crime,which is a distinct question from the manufacturing of venue.in fact,the fourth circuit has distinguished coates on this very ground there is no such thing as manufactured venue or venue entrapment.united states al talib,cir see also united states rodriguez rodriguez,cir holding that the entrapment doctrine does not apply to venue,and that the proper remedy for prosecutorial forum shopping is federal rule of criminal procedure b.
although we have not yet adopted a similar holding rejecting manufactured venue in this circuit,we need not decide the issue today.we have noted that archer can not offer generally applicable principles and that it has been limited to cases involving extreme law enforcement tactics.united states bagnariol,cir.we find nothing extreme about an ice undercover operation,based in san diego,deciding to cash kuok money order in a bank in san diego.therefore,because part of the conduct that formed the offense occurred in the southern district of california,even if that conduct was performed by an undercover government agent,venue there was proper.
kuok argues that the arms export control act aeca,invalidly delegates legislative authority.section a of title provides 
in furtherance of world peace and the security and foreign policy of the united states,the president is authorized to control the import and the export of defense articles and defense services and to provide foreign policy guidance to persons of the united states involved in the export and import of such articles and services.the president is authorized to designate those items which shall be considered as defense articles and defense services for the purposes of this section and to promulgate regulations for the import and export of such articles and services.the items so designated shall constitute the united states munitions list.
a see setting forth the munitions list.section b provides that no defense articles or defense services designated by the president on the munitions list may be exported or imported without a license.b.any person who violates b,or any rule or regulation issued under th at section,may be fined not more than or imprisoned for not more than years,or both.id.c.kuok argues that congress,in enacting the aeca,failed to clearly delineate the general policy,the public agency which is to apply it,and the boundaries of this delegated authority.mistretta united states,internal quotation marks omitted.
the argument is easily answered.the constitution provides that a ll legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the united states.const.art.i.from this language and first principles of separation of powers,the supreme court has announced a nondelegation principle congress may not constitutionally delegate its legislative power to another branch of government.touby united states.accordingly,when congress confers decisionmaking authority upon agencies congress must lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to act is directed to conform.whitman am.trucking ass ns,quoting hampton,united states.
the aeca authorizes the president to maintain the united states munitions list,which consists of those items which shall be considered as defense articles and defense services.a.although the defining principle for articles and services has not been set forth with particularity,it is intelligible the president is to designate those articles or services which shall be considered as defense articles and defense services.id.articles or services that are not regarded as belonging to defense may not be so designated.furthermore,congress prefaced the delegation to the president by referring to its shared interest in the furtherance of world peace and the security and foreign policy of the united states.id.the d elegation of foreign affairs authority is given even broader deference than in the domestic arena.freedom to travel campaign newcomb,cir.
the supreme court rejected a similar nondelegation challenge in united states curtiss wright exp.congress had authorized the president to prohibit the sale of arms and munitions of war in the united states to those countries now engaged in armed conflict in the chaco.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.congress made it a criminal act to violate the president prohibition.the supreme court recognized that it was dealing not alone with an authority vested in the president by an exertion of legislative power,but with such an authority plus the very delicate,plenary and exclusive power of the president as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations.id.at.the court commented on the unwisdom of requiring congress in this field of governmental power to lay down narrowly definite standards and declined to condemn legislation like that under review as constituting an unlawful delegation of legislative power.id.at see id.at t here is sufficient warrant for the broad discretion vested in the president to determine whether the enforcement of the statute will have a beneficial effect upon the of peace.this logic applies with equal force to the present case.the aeca does not violate the constitutional prohibition on delegation of legislative power.
we next address kuok argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction over count four of the indictment,which arises under the money laundering statute,we review jurisdictional questions de novo.see united states moncini,cir.
section a of title prohibits the transmission of funds from a place outside the united states to a place inside the united states with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity.the government theory at trial was that kuok violated this provision by transmitting funds in exchange for the taclane encryptor,in order to promote the violation of export control laws and laws.section comes with its own restriction on any assertion of extraterritorial jurisdiction.it provides 
there is extraterritorial jurisdiction over the conduct prohibited by this section if 
the conduct is by a united states citizen or,in the case of a states citizen,the conduct occurs in part in the united states and 
the transaction or series of related transactions involves funds or monetary instruments of a value exceeding.
at trial,the government established that the relevant conduct occurred in part in the united states.but the government did not establish that the transaction involved funds of a value exceeding.rather,the evidence established and the government concedes that the transaction involved a total value of only.
the government attempts to bypass subsection f entirely by arguing that subsection f is only invoked when the case involves purely extraterritorial conduct.the government argues that kuok case,because it involves conduct that occurred in part in the united states,does not invoke extraterritorial jurisdiction at all,arguing that the issue of extraterritorial jurisdiction arises only if no part of the offense occurred in the united states.
the government argument would render subsection f a nullity.if the government were correct that subsection f can only be invoked in cases that involve conduct taking place entirely outside of the united states,the second part of subsection f would be meaningless,and proscribe no possible set of conduct.that is,if extraterritorial jurisdiction only need be invoked when prohibited conduct by a citizen occurred entirely outside the united states,the statement in f there is extraterritorial jurisdiction over the conduct prohibited by this section if in the case of a states citizen,the conduct occurs in part in the united states could never be invoked.we presume that congress did not intend to enact a literally meaningless statute.because the government failed to satisfy the requirement of f,kuok conviction on count four must be vacated for lack of jurisdiction.
we now turn to kuok conviction on count three.count three arises under the aeca and its implementing regulations,specifically a.the government charged kuok with violating the aeca by asking the undercover agent to send him the taclane encryptor in exchange for a wire transfer.kuok challenges his conviction on the grounds that the aeca and its implementing regulations do not create liability for attempting to cause another person to violate the aeca we review de novo.see united states cabaccang,cir en banc.
section a makes it unlawful t o export or attempt to export from the united states by a person of any defense article or by anyone of any origin defense article for which a license or written approval is required without first obtaining the required license.a.kuok notes that the government evidence did not establish that he exported or attempted to export the taclane encryptor.rather,the government theory was that he attempted to cause an undercover ice agent to export the encryptor.kuok then argues that a does not make it illegal to cause a person to export or attempt to export a defense article.in response,the government points to b,which states whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the united states,is punishable as a principal.
by overlaying b on a,it becomes clear that b prohibits causing an export or an attempted export an export or an attempted export is an act which if directly performed by kuok would be an offense against the united states.however,the government case at trial did not establish that kuok caused an attempt to export it established that he attempted to cause an export.that is,kuok attempted to cause the undercover ice agent to export the encryptor without a license.neither an export nor an attempted export occurred the ice agent did not form the mens rea sufficient for an illegal export or an attempt,because he was an undercover agent working for the government the whole time.kuok,for his part,intended to import the device into macau,not export it from the united states.see a defining export as s ending or taking a defense article out of the united states in any manner.rather,there was an attempt to cause an export kuok tried to get the undercover agent to export the encryptor.
we have long recognized that t here is no general federal attempt statute.a defendant therefore can only be found guilty of an attempt to commit a federal offense if the statute defining the offense also expressly proscribes an attempt.united states hopkins,cir see also united states joe,cir i t is well settled that the only attempts to commit crimes which are made federal crimes are those specifically so proscribed by federal law.united states padilla,cir u nlike many state criminal codes,federal criminal statutes contain no general attempt provision.an attempt to commit a federal crime is punishable only where the section defining the crime specifically includes an attempt within its proscription.citations omitted.for the government theory to be viable,therefore,either b would have to contain an attempt provision,or would have to contain an attempted causation provision.since neither statute does so,kuok can not be convicted on this count based on the government evidence at trial.the government argument that attempt should rationally be read into b fails in light of the rule against reading an attempt into a criminal statute that does not explicitly include it.
the government cites to united states giese,in which we approved an indictment charging that the defendant conspired to commit and cause to be committed certain offenses against the united states,cir.the reasoning in giese is not analogous here because,unlike for attempt,there does exist a general federal statute for conspiracy.see.thus,for example,conspiracy to cause an export or attempted export would be a federal crime.
the united states also points to cases from the sixth and eighth circuits which approve of an attempt to cause theory.in united states may,the defendant placed a call to a retired general,asking him to destroy certain records,cir.the general attempted to do so by calling a friend,but the attempt failed when his friend refused.id.may was then charged with unlawfully attempt ing to cause to have concealed,obliterated,or destroyed government records in violation of u.id.we do not find may persuasive on this issue,because,while the indictment may have charged attempting to cause,it is clear that may actions in that case actually constituted causing an attempt that is,may caused the retired general to attempt to violate.the may court correctly characterized may position as arguing that causing an attempt is not prohibited by the statute,and relied on b to reject this proposition,noting that section b,like section a,is applicable to the entire criminal code.id.internal quotation marks omitted.this reasoning,however,is not helpful for purposes of the present case even if b is applicable to the entire criminal code,there is no general federal attempt provision that would be applicable to b.
similarly,united states zidell affirmed the defendant conviction on the charge of attempt to cause the possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine,but it is clear that this case also deals with causing an attempt,rather than attempting to cause,cir emphasis removed internal quotation marks omitted.in zidell,the defendant,living in texas,received a visit from his from tennessee.he distributed methamphetamine to both of them,and sent them on their way back to tennessee.id.at.as the court explained,t his conduct gave rise to an attempt charge,as opposed to a charge of a completed drug distribution offense,when the coconspirators were stopped by the police before they reached their intended destination.id.at.in other words,the defendant caused his coconspirators to attempt to commit a drug distribution crime.moreover,the defendant in zidell did not even raise a challenge to this language in the indictment rather,his argument was that venue in tennessee was improper.id.at.
therefore,both may and zidell are factually inapposite to kuok case whereas kuok attempt to cause illegal activity failed because he was working with an undercover law enforcement officer,the defendants in may and zidell successfully caused an attempt because the coconspirators in those cases had each formed the mens rea necessary to charge them with attempt,had the government so chosen.and to the extent may and zidell stand for the proposition advanced by the government based on the wording of the indictments,we disagree.
we hold that attempting to cause an export of defense articles without a license is not a violation of law,and vacate kuok conviction on count three.
kuok challenges his conviction on count two because he argues that the government did not satisfy all of the elements of,which criminalizes smuggling goods into or out of the united states.this count is based on kuok purchase of the taclane encryptor.we do not agree with kuok interpretation of the statute,and decline to vacate his conviction on count two.
the relevant section states 
whoever fraudulently or knowingly exports or sends from the united states,or attempts to export or send from the united states,any merchandise,article,or object contrary to any law or regulation of the united states,or receives,conceals,buys,sells,or in any manner facilitates the transportation,concealment,or sale of such merchandise,article or object,prior to exportation,knowing the same to be intended for exportation contrary to any law or regulation of the united states,shall be fined under this title,imprisoned not more than years,or both.
kuok argues,first,that he never took physical possession of the encryptor,thus making it impossible for the government to satisfy the element that he bought it second,because both kuok and the undercover ice agent lacked the intent to export the encryptor,the encryptor was not intended for exportation and third,that since the encryptor was not exported,the government could not satisfy the statutory requirement that the conduct occur prior to exportation.these arguments present issues of statutory construction,which we review de novo.cabaccang,at.
the indictment charged kuok with buy ing the encryptor,but kuok only wired money to the undercover agent and never actually received the encryptor,since it was never sent.the parties point to two different definitions of the word buy that support their respective cases.kuok cites to one definition of the word indicating that buy entails obtaining possession of the item paid for.see shorter oxford english dictionary ed defining buy as to g et possession of by giving an equivalent,usu.in money obtain by paying a price.the government cites to another definition of the word buy,which includes to get possession or ownership of by giving or agreeing to give money in exchange.see webster third new international dictionary emphasis added.kuok argues that competing definitions render the statutory text ambiguous and require application of the rule of lenity.see united states santos.
we think the government has the better argument.whatever ambiguity appears after consulting dictionaries fades when we construe the statute as a whole.section a applies to anyone who receives,or conceals,or buys,or sells any merchandise,article,or object contrary to law.if we were to adopt kuok definition of buy requiring receipt or possession then the term receive would become superfluous.see trw andrews.to avoid interpreting one phrase so as to render another superfluous,we accept the government interpretation of the statute 
kuok argues that a requires proof of his intent to export.the statutory language actually requires that a person buy an item knowing the same to be intended for exportation contrary to any law or regulation.a.the mens rea requires only knowing the item is intended for export,rather than an intent to export.because of the passive construction of the phrase intended for exportation,no specific actor need form the intent to export the item.thus,although kuok was not doing the exporting himself his scheme involved receiving an import,not sending an export,he certainly intended that another actor the undercover agent intend to export the item.in other words,the government case need not establish that the defendant intended to export the encryptor,because congress did not specify who must form the intent to export the item,only that the defendant know that the item was intended for export contrary to law.
kuok argues that since the statute applies to w hoever buys such merchandise,article or object,prior to exportation,knowing the same to be intended for exportation contrary to law,the government must prove that the item was actually exported,or else the condition prior to exportation can not be satisfied.the government responds that prior to exportation simply limits prosecutions to purchases that occurred during or before exportation.this is not superfluous with the phrase knowing the same to be intended for exportation contrary to any law,the government argues,because while the latter phrase does exclude prosecutions from taking place after the exportation has been completed,it does not exclude prosecutions against one who buys an item while it is in transit,whereas the former phrase does.
alternatively,the government argues that superfluity is not always to be avoided the hesitancy to construe statutes to render language superfluous does not require courts to avoid surplusage at all costs.it is appropriate to tolerate a degree of surplusage rather than adopt a textually dubious construction that threatens to render the entire provision a nullity.united states atl.research.
kuok replies that the portion of a under which he was charged lacks an attempt provision,and the government efforts to charge him under this statute,without proving that an export actually took place,constructively read an attempt provision into it.we do not agree with kuok,but we do note that the statutory text is challenging to parse.the operative phrase states 
whoever fraudulently or knowingly exports or sends from the united states,or attempts to export or send from the united states,any merchandise,article,or object contrary to any law or regulation of the united states,or receives,conceals,buys,sells,or in any manner facilitates the transportation,concealment,or sale of such merchandise,article or object 
a emphasis added.the emphasized or above divides this statute into two clauses the first applying to exporters,and the second to buyers.this might lend support to kuok reading that is,the attempt provision can be read only as far as the or,and thus applies uniquely to exporters,not buyers.on the other hand,the reference to such merchandise could be read as incorporating the entire exporters clause that is,such merchandise is merchandise that has been the object of an export ing or send ing from the united states,or attempt ed export ing or send ing from the united states contrary to any law or regulation.the latter interpretation is persuasive because there is no other phrase in the exporters clause indicating the type of merchandise at issue contrary to any law or regulation of the united states is an adverbial clause modifying the verbs exports and attempts to export,not an adjectival clause modifying the noun merchandise.without a phrase that limits or defines the merchandise,the second clause use of the word such is meaningless 
we find that the attempt provision spans the or.there is no extratextual reason to interpret the statute in a manner that treats exporters and buyers differently,and there are strong intratextual reasons for treating them similarly.kuok interpretation of prior to exportation render s the entire provision a nullity,and we reject it.atl.research,at.in sum,we have considered kuok objections to count two,and have found them without merit.
kuok brings multiple challenges to the jury instructions given in this case.we review de novo whether the jury instructions accurately define the elements of a statutory offense.united states summers,cir.
first,kuok argues that the jury instructions with respect to count two were improper for the same reasons that he argued his conviction on count two must be vacated.because we have rejected his arguments and concluded that kuok conviction under a need not be vacated as a matter of law,we disagree that the jury instructions were improper.
second,kuok argues that the instructions with respect to count one are invalid because they allowed the jury to convict based on the attempt to cause an export theory of count three.instruction,relating to count three,states in full 
count of the indictment charges the defendant with attempted export of a defense article without a license.in order for the defendant to be found guilty of that charge,the government must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt 
first,on or about april,the defendant intended to commit the crime of willfully causing the export of a kg taclane encryptor which was designated on the united states munitions list,without first obtaining a license or written approval from the department of state,directorate of defense trade controls,and,
second,the defendant did something which was a substantial step toward committing the crime,with all of you agreeing as to what constituted the substantial step.
mere preparation is not a substantial step toward committing the crime of exporting defense articles without a license.
an act is done willfully if it is voluntarily committed with the knowledge that it was prohibited by law and with the purpose of disobeying or disregarding the law.while the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to violate the law,it is not necessary for the government to prove that the defendant had read,was aware of,or had consulted the specific regulations governing his activities.in other words,in this case,while the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to violate the law,the government is not required to prove that the defendant had read or consulted the united states munitions list or the specific export licensing requirements of the arms export control act.
as discussed above,we vacate kuok conviction on count three because there is no crime of attempting to cause an export contrary to law.kuok argues that his conviction on count one was tainted by this invalid offense theory because the instruction on count one refers to the same substantive offense as that in count three exporting without a license.instruction,relating to count one,states in full 
as mentioned,count of the indictment alleges two possible criminal objects of the conspiracy.
the elements of the crime of buying merchandise,articles,or objects prior to exportation,knowing they would be exported contrary to the laws and regulations of the united states are 
first,the defendant knowingly bought merchandise,articles,and objects,prior to exportation,and 
second,at that time,the defendant knew the same to be intended for exportation contrary to any law or regulation of the united states.
the elements of the crime of exporting defense articles without a license are 
first,the defendant exported,or caused to be exported,from the united states an item or items designated on the united states munitions list 
second,the defendant did not obtain a license or written approval from the department of state to export the item or items and 
third,the defendant acted willfully.
the term willfully is defined in court instruction.
to willfully cause an act to be done means to intentionally bring it about,with knowledge that it is prohibited by law and with the purpose of disobeying or disregarding the law.
there is no taint here.instruction is invalid because it allowed the jury to convict on an attempt to cause an export theory,but instruction allowed the jury to convict on a conspiracy to cause an export theory.we have already concluded that because of the existence of a general federal conspiracy statute,a conspiracy to cause an act to be undertaken is prohibited by law in a way that an attempt to cause an act to be undertaken is not.see giese,at see also.the for the definition of willfully does not alter this analysis,as the meaning of the term willfully is entirely irrelevant to the question of whether instruction is invalid.this does not incorporate the attempt to cause an export theory.
kuok third argument fails for the same reason.he challenges the correctness of the phrase in instruction indicating that a possible object of the conspiracy for count one was that the defendant exported,or caused to be exported a defense article.kuok argues both that a causation theory was not charged in the indictment,and that no authority supports the causation theory in the context of conspiracy liability.we disagree.a n indictment need not specifically charge causing the commission of an offense to support a jury verdict based upon a finding of causation.united states armstrong,cir internal quotation marks omitted.and as discussed above,conspiracy to cause an export is a valid offense theory.see giese,at see also.
because we hold that the government theory on counts one and two is viable as a matter of law,we finish by considering kuok claim that he should have been permitted to present evidence of duress to the jury.we review the district court decision to exclude the duress defense de novo united states vasquez landaver,cir.
duress is not a statutory defense,but a defense that allows a jury to find that the defendant conduct is excused,even though the government has carried its burden of proof.see dixon united states.to establish duress,the burden of proof is on the defendant to show that he was under an immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury,he had a well grounded fear that the threat would be carried out,and he had no reasonable opportunity to escape.united states shapiro,cir see also dixon,at united states bailey.
factfinding is usually a function of the jury,and the trial court rarely rules on a defense as a matter of law.united states contento pachon,cir.because we consider this defense as a matter of law,we must accept kuok proffer as true in its entirety.here,the parties dispute concerns the first and the third elements 
the threat to kuok family was both immediate and serious.according to his counsel opening statement,zheng made it clear to kuok that his family was being monitored,through zheng actions in giving kuok reports on his wife daily activities,calling her at the family home phone number,and sending kuok various pictures of his wife and his son taken in public.when kuok attempted to get out of his dealings with the government,zheng explicitly threatened to send kuok wife to a black jail,and told kuok that this was somewhere where we take people off the grid if they do do what we ask them to do.
our decision in united states contento pachon is most similar to the present case.in contento pachon,a taxi driver was lured into a meeting with a drug dealer when the drug dealer promised him a job driving a private car.at.what the drug dealer actually wanted was a mule to smuggle drugs into the united states.id.the defendant protested,but capitulated in the face of threats to his family.id.the drug dealer revealed that he knew private details about the defendant life details that the defendant had never mentioned to the drug dealer.id.we held that this evidence supported a defense of duress because 
the drug dealer had gone to the trouble to discover that contento pachon was married,that he had a child,the names of his wife and child,and the location of his residence.these were not vague threats of possible future harm.according to the defendant,if he had refused to cooperate,the consequences would have been immediate and harsh.
id.at see also id.contento pachon contends that he was being watched by one of the drug dealer accomplices at all times during the airplane trip.
the government contends that the threats to kuok family were not immediate because kuok could not demonstrate that someone was present to enforce the threat immediately during the entire criminal conduct.united states sawyer,cir coercion over a period was insufficient to prove duress because defendant could not show that someone was present at all times the defendant was involved in illegal activity.
the government cites united states becerra in support of its position.cir.in that case,the defendant believed that his family was threatened when an undercover agent said he
