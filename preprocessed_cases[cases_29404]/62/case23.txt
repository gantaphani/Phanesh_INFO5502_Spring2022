this case presents an issue of the proper allocation of the burden of proof in cases of alleged discriminatory treatment under the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act of userra,et.this is the first time that we have been called upon to address this issue.carlos velázquez sued his former employer,horizon lines of puerto rico horizon,alleging that he had been fired from his job due to his military service,in violation of userra.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of horizon.because we find that the district court incorrectly applied userra analysis,we reverse.
background 
because this is an appeal from summary judgment,we review the facts in the light most favorable to velázquez,drawing all inferences in his favor.see coyne taber partners i,cir.
horizon is in the business of ocean shipping and transportation,and operates a marine terminal in san juan,puerto rico.velázquez began work at the terminal for horizon predecessor,csx lines,in september.he was first employed as a yard supervisor and later became a marine supervisor.both positions are essentially middle management,giving velázquez supervisory authority over horizon stevedores.
in december,velázquez enlisted as a reservist in the marine corps.he immediately reported for six months of basic training.he returned to his job after basic training,but continued to report for monthly weekend training sessions,as well as annual more intensive training sessions.velázquez was a shift employee at horizon and often had to work weekends,so horizon needed to adjust his work hours to accommodate his military schedule.in velázquez deposition he stated that his superiors complained and pressured him about the difficulty of rescheduling his shifts.he also stated that he was frequently the butt of jokes at work,being referred to as joe,little lead soldier,and girl scout.
during velázquez periods of military service,horizon continued to pay his full salary.as a result,when velázquez returned to work,horizon would deduct from his paycheck amounts necessary to offset velázquez military income for those days in which he received both a military and a civilian paycheck 
during this same time period,velázquez began operating a side business cashing the checks of horizon employees.before,horizon had paid its stevedores daily wages in cash.in,horizon began paying daily wages by check instead.seeing a business opportunity,around february,velázquez began cashing these employee checks for a fee.he did this almost exclusively during hours,though he testified to cashing one or two checks while on duty.he performed the service primarily outside horizon gate or in its parking lot 
around september,horizon finished recouping the salary that it was owed for the periods when velázquez was performing his military duties.on september,seven months after he began his side business,velázquez was observed cashing checks by horizon operations manager,roberto batista,one of velázquez supervisors and one of the people velázquez described as having trouble with his military schedule.batista reported this to several other horizon managers,and on september,batista fired velázquez.the termination letter did not state a reason,but velázquez was told that his side business was in violation of horizon code of business conduct code he was given no warnings or other prior discipline,and had an otherwise clean record as a good employee.
velázquez brought suit under userra,alleging that his firing constituted illegal discrimination due to his military service horizon moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted.the district court held that velázquez had not shown sufficient discriminatory animus,nor had he shown that the stated reason for his firing,the code violation,was mere pretext.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court summary judgment de novo.velez janssen ortho,llc,cir.in doing so,we recognize that w hen a motion for summary judgment is made an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party pleading,but the adverse party response,by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule,must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.e.the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.anderson liberty lobby,d emphasis in original.an issue is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party,id.at,and a fact is material if it has the potential to affect the outcome of the suit,centennial wireless,cir internal quotation marks omitted quoting sanchez alvarado,cir.neither wishful thinking nor conclusory responses unsupported by evidence will serve to defeat a properly focused rule motion.smith,cir citation omitted.
userra actions 
we have not previously addressed the mechanism of proving discrimination claims under userra.thus,we first turn to the statute and its history.userra provides,in relevant part,that 
a a person who is a member of,applies to be a member of,performs,has performed,applies to perform,or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment,reemployment,retention in employment,promotion,or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership,application for membership,performance of service,application for service,or obligation.
c an employer shall be considered to have engaged in actions prohibited under subsection a,if the person membership,application for membership,service,application for service,or obligation for service in the uniformed services is a motivating factor in the employer action,unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such membership,application for membership,service,application for service,or obligation for service.
the statute was passed in response to the supreme court decision in monroe standard oil,d,in which the court held under the predecessor of userra,the veterans reemployment rights act vrra that claims for employment discrimination would lie only if the employee could show that the discrimination was motived solely by reserve status.id.at.emphasis added.this,in effect,kept the burden on the employee to show that any offered reason by the company was actually a pretext.in the house report accompanying passage of userra,congress said that monroe misinterpreted the original legislative intent,which was to place the burden of proof on the employer,once a prima facie case is established,at,reprinted in.the house report called instead for application of the burden shifting framework of nlrb transportation management,d.id.
under transportation management,which addresses claims of unfair labor practices under the national labor relations act,the employee first has the burden of showing,by a preponderance of the evidence,that his or her protected status was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action the employer may then avoid liability only by showing,as an affirmative defense,that the employer would have taken the same action without regard to the employee protected status.leisek brightwood,cir alterations in original quoting transp,at.the circuit courts that have addressed the issue of under userra are unanimous in adopting this substantial or motivating factor test,rather than the sole motivating factor test of monroe,and in putting the burden on the employer to show lack of pretext.see coffman chugach support,cir gagnon sprint,cir leisek,at hill michelin,cir sheehan dep t of navy,gummo vill.of depew,cir.
we agree.the language of the statute and the legislative history make clear that the employee need only show that military service was a motivating factor in order to prove liability,unless the employer can prove that the adverse employment action would have been taken regardless of the employee military service.c emphasis added.therefore,we hold that in userra actions there must be an initial showing by the employee that military status was at least a motivating or substantial factor in the employer action,upon which the employer must prove,by a preponderance of evidence,that the action would have been taken despite the protected status.sheehan,at.
this analysis is markedly different from the analysis in title vii actions.under the mcdonnell douglas framework,the burden of persuasion in title vii actions always remains with the employee.therefore,after the employee establishes a prima facie case of discriminatory animus,the employer only has the burden of producing some legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the employee termination.mcdonnell douglas green,d.then the burden shifts back to the employee to show that the employer stated reason for terminating him was in fact a pretext.hodgens dynamics,cir.by contrast,under userra,the employee does not have the burden of demonstrating that the employer stated reason is a pretext.instead,the employer must show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the stated reason was not a pretext that is,that the action would have been taken in the absence of the employee military service.c emphasis added.
discriminatory motivation 
the district judge held that velázquez failed to produce sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to believe that velázquez military service was at least a motivating factor in horizon decision to fire him.that is,the judge ruled that velázquez was unable to show that horizon at least partially based its decision to fire him on his military service.the district judge gave three principal reasons for this ruling.first,he discounted velázquez testimony of remarks made by his,in part because he had not reported any harassment to horizon.second,he said that the evidence of the timing of his firing close to a return from training was of no probative value because he had returned from several other training sessions without being fired.third,he noted that other horizon employees in the military had not been demoted or fired.although the district judge correctly cited the motivating factor test of sheehan,we believe,after carefully reviewing the record,that the judge committed error on each of these three points.
first,the court discounted velázquez testimony of remarks because it was his own testimony and because he had not previously reported it or made a formal complaint.here,the distinction in rule between specific facts and mere allegations is important.e.had velázquez merely rested on allegations of military discrimination,this would be a different case.instead,he provided deposition testimony presenting specific instances of remarks,as well as complaints and pressure from his superiors,and it is for the jury,not the judge,to determine his credibility.see anderson,at.c redibility determinations,the weighing of the evidence,and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions,not those of a judge.
moreover,whether a nonmovant deposition testimony or affidavits might be is not dispositive.it is true that testimony and affidavits that merely reiterate allegations made in the complaint,without providing specific factual information made on the basis of personal knowledge are insufficient,at citing roslindale coop.bank greenwald,cir.however,a party own affidavit,containing relevant information of which he has knowledge,may be,but it is nonetheless competent to support or defeat summary judgment,at internal quotation marks omitted quoting cadle hayes,cir.therefore,provided that the nonmovant deposition testimony sets forth specific facts,within his personal knowledge,that,if proven,would affect the outcome of the trial,the testimony must be accepted as true for purposes of summary judgment.see napier deesie,cir simas first citizens fed.credit union,cir.
on appeal,horizon argues that the comments were just stray remarks,and as such can not be sufficient evidence of discriminatory animus.if true,that would undermine velázquez argument that the issues raised are genuine.see anderson,at.but horizon argument oversimplifies the analysis first,it is only true that stray workplace remarks normally are insufficient,standing alone,to establish the requisite discriminatory animus.gonzález el día,cir emphasis added see straughn delta air lines,cir.here,velázquez points not only to the remarks by,but also to complaints by batista and others about the difficulty of adjusting velázquez work schedule,and to the timing of his firing which we address below.see mcmillan.soc y for prevention of cruelty to animals,cir stray remarks may properly constitute evidence of discriminatory intent for the jury to consider in combination with other evidence,at decisionmaker comments and timing of firing are material facts for a jury to consider.
here,the remarks that velázquez testified to were not made by those who participated in the decision to fire him,and this does limit their probativeness.see mcmillan,at.but at least one such speaker,juan carrero,was shift marine manager and appears to be superior to velázquez.carrero was also in part responsible for scheduling,which was the source of horizon problems with velázquez.thus,his remarks could carry some weight with a jury.furthermore,stray remarks by nondecisionmakers,while insufficient standing alone to show discriminatory animus,may still be considered evidence of a company general atmosphere of discrimination,and thus can be relevant,at citing sweeney bd.of trustees of keene state,cir.s uch evidence does tend to add color to the employer decisionmaking processes and to the influences behind the actions taken with respect to the individual plaintiff.cummings standard register,cir internal quotation marks omitted quoting conway electro switch,cir 
finally,the fact that velázquez failed to report the remarks earlier is not dispositive.faragher city of boca raton,d holding that plaintiff failure to report sexual harassment is not an affirmative defense to a title vii claim where plaintiff was discharged.in an atmosphere such as a working seaport,it is reasonable for a person to avoid making a scene over such behavior,or even to believe that the behavior is only in jest,only to discover too late that it was a harbinger of worse discrimination to come.velázquez failure to report the behavior may be considered by a jury in judging his credibility,but it is evident to us that a jury could reasonably decide to place no weight on his prior silence.thus,it is a jury that should ultimately decide.
the district judge next discounted the timing of velázquez firing,saying that the fact that he was fired after returning from his military service is of no probative value,given that he had returned from other periods of service without being fired.but the emphasis of velázquez argument is elsewhere.the important factor,he argues,is not the time of his return from service,but rather the time of his final recoupment of the salary differential that he owed to horizon.horizon,according to velázquez,waited until velázquez had paid back the money he owed horizon for the periods when his civilian salary was supplemented by his military salary.once he had repaid the overage,he claims,horizon then found the pretext to fire him.
such facts,if true,could be considered evidence of discriminatory animus.the other userra cases that address the timing of firing look at proximity in time between the employee military activity and the adverse employment action.sheehan,at see maxfield cintas,cir.but that is not an exclusive test,and there is no reason to limit ourselves to looking only at the proximity of the adverse employment action to military activity.the proximity to other events may also be probative.if what velázquez alleges is true,horizon should not escape liability for making the tactical decision to wait until it recouped the salary it was owed before using a pretext to fire velázquez.
finally,the district judge held that the fact that the company had not fired other employees who served in the military demonstrated that they did not fire velázquez for discriminatory reasons.as an initial matter,the failure to treat
