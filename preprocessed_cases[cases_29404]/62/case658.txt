background 
this case arises in the factual context of the internment of persons of japanese ancestry during world war ii.on february,president roosevelt signed executive order,wl,which authorized military commanders to establish prohibited military zones in the united states and to exclude certain entire classes of citizens and aliens from these zones.ultimately,japanese americans became the only subjects of the mass exclusion,relocation,and detention authorized under executive order,even though no documented acts of espionage,sabotage,or fifth column activity committed by japanese americans were ever established.
on december,the united states rescinded the mass exclusion ordered under executive order.see public proclamation,persons of japanese ancestry exemption from exclusion orders,proclamation.proclamation became effective on january.however,the united states issued individual exclusion orders that excluded individual japanese americans from the west coast for additional time periods.
murakami father,noboru arthur murakami arthur murakami,was a united states citizen born and raised in los angeles and nearby terminal island,california.in,he and his family were relocated by the government to the manzanar internment camp in the desert near bishop,california pursuant to executive order.around july,the government permitted arthur murakami to move to chicago,but prohibited him from returning to the west coast.in,arthur murakami married aiko tani,who was also from los angeles.in late,aiko murakami became pregnant.
around february,arthur murakami received an individual exclusion order prohibiting him personally from returning to the west coast.in a letter dated july,from the headquarters western defense command,arthur murakami individual exclusion order was lifted when he was informed that he was now authorized to travel and reside within the west coast exclusion zone.at that time,aiko murakami was eight months pregnant.murakami was born in chicago approximately one month later,on august.murakami family moved from chicago to los angeles approximately ten years later,in june or july.
in october,murakami filed a claim form for a redress payment under the act with the department of justice justice department,civil rights division,office of redress administration redress office.in a letter dated july,the redress office advised murakami that he was not eligible for compensation under the act.in september,murakami submitted a statement with attached documents stating that his father was subject to an individual exclusion order,which was rescinded far too late for his parents to return to the west coast in time for his birth.on march,the justice department issued a decision denying murakami claim,concluding that on the date of murakami birth,neither murakami nor arthur murakami was subject to any legal restrictions preventing their return to los angeles.
in february,murakami filed a complaint with the court of federal claims,appealing the decision of the justice department affirming the redress office denial of his requested redress payment.murakami ii.at.after the government filed the administrative record with the court,murakami filed a motion requesting leave of the court to supplement the administrative record with certain documents,and requesting the court to take judicial notice of the documents submitted.on may,the court of federal claims denied murakami motion to supplement the administrative record and declined to take judicial notice of the documents.id.at.
on april,the court of federal claims issued a decision upon murakami motion for judgment upon the administrative record and the government.the court dismissed several of murakami arguments,murakami iii.at,but remanded the case to the redress office to consider fully whether murakami was otherwise deprived of liberty within the meaning of the act,id.at.
on remand,the justice department reconsidered murakami claim and concluded that murakami was still not entitled to a redress payment.after the justice department decision,murakami and the government again filed motions for judgment on the administrative record.on october,the court of federal claims granted the government motion.murakami iv.at.the court noted that on remand the redress office appeared to don blinders to much of what this court previously held.id.at.however,the court affirmed the underlying decision of the redress office that murakami could have traveled to los angeles once the individual restriction order on her husband was lifted.id.at.
murakami appealed these decisions of the court of federal claims to this court.we have jurisdiction from a final decision of the court of federal claims pursuant to a.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
statutory interpretation is a question of law reviewed de novo.imazio nursery,dania greenhouses,see also ishida united states.
we review legal determinations such as the court of federal claims decision to award summary judgment on the administrative record without deference,applying the same standard of review as the court of federal claims.dysart united states.in this case,the court of federal claims applied the standard of review prescribed by the act.see murakami iii.at.the act provides 
a claimant may seek judicial review of a denial of compensation under this section solely in the united states court of federal claims,which shall review the denial upon the administrative record and shall hold unlawful and set aside the denial if it is found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.
evidentiary determinations by the court of federal claims,including motions to supplement the administrative record,are reviewed for abuse of discretion.see air land forwarders,united states.
relevant statutes,regulations,and legislative history 
in,congress passed legislation establishing the commission on wartime relocation and internment of civilians to document the impact of the internment on japanese american citizens and permanent residents.see generally commission on wartime relocation and internment of civilians act,stat.the resulting civil liberties act of enacted the recommendations of the commission,including a formal statement of apology and a redress payment to each eligible individual.see app.a apology id.a redress payment ishida,at.the act then defined eligible individuals 
for the purposes of this title 
the term eligible individual means any individual of japanese ancestry who,during the evacuation,relocation,and internment period 
a was a united states citizen or a permanent resident alien and 
b i was confined,held in custody,relocated,or otherwise deprived of liberty or property as a result of 
i executive order numbered,dated february,
ii the act entitled an act to provide a penalty for violation of restrictions or orders with respect to persons entering,remaining in,leaving,or committing any act in military areas or zones,approved march,stat.or 
iii any other executive order,presidential proclamation,law of the united states,directive of the armed forces of the united states,or other action taken by or on behalf of the united states or its agents,representatives,officers,or employees,respecting the evacuation,relocation,or internment of individuals solely on the basis of japanese ancestry 
app.emphases added.
the justice department promulgated regulations to implement the act.see pt.see also redress provisions for persons of japanese ancestry,redress provisions.initially,the justice department regulations stated that children born after their parents had voluntarily relocated from prohibited military zones,assembly centers,relocation camps,and internment camps were not eligible for redress under the act.redress provisions.at see also redress provisions for persons of japanese ancestry guidelines under ishida united states,guidelines under ishida.however,after this court decision in ishida united states,held such individuals to be eligible under the act,the justice department revised its regulations and issued a notice of proposed rulemaking.redress provisions for persons of japanese ancestry,see also guidelines under ishida.at.the justice department considered,inter alia,comments regarding an extension of the proposed january,threshold date for eligibility.guidelines under ishida.at.some comments advocated the date should be extended by up to three months to accommodate a family inability to travel due to the advanced state of a woman pregnancy and other hardships.id.at.the justice department rejected such arguments,stating 
although the department is sympathetic to persons who were in this situation,it must be recognized that after january,the law ceased to act to deprive affected individuals of their liberty to travel and reside as they saw fit.without a doubt,there were a number of families who,for various reasons,were unable to return for some time to the former exclusion zones.however,the fact remains that after january,individuals were generally free under the law to decide for themselves whether and when they should return to the west coast.this is the basis for eligibility under ishida,and the department is bound by the court strictures.
id.the justice department then amended its regulations to add b,explicitly stating that individuals born on or before january,to parents who had been evacuated,relocated,or interned from their original place of residence were eligible for relief under the act.id.at.thus,the pertinent justice department regulations currently provide in relevant part 
a an individual is found to be eligible if such an individual 
is of japanese ancestry and 
was living on the date of enactment of the act,august,and 
during the evacuation,relocation,and internment period was 
i a united states citizen or 
ii a permanent resident alien who was lawfully admitted into the united states or 
iii an alien and 
was confined,held in custody,relocated,or otherwise deprived of liberty or property as a result of 
i executive order,dated february,
ii the act entitled an act to provide a penalty for violation of restrictions or orders with respect to persons entering,remaining,leaving,or committing any act in military areas or zones,approved march,or 
iii any other executive order,presidential proclamation,law of the united states respecting the evacuation,relocation,or internment of individuals solely on the basis of japanese ancestry.
b the following individuals are deemed to have suffered a loss within the meaning of paragraph a of this section 
individuals who were interned under the supervision of the wartime relocation authority,the department of justice or the united states army or 
individuals born on or before january,to a parent or parents who had been evacuated,relocated,or interned from his or her original place of residence in the prohibited military zones on the west coast,on or after march,pursuant to paragraph a of this section,and who were excluded by executive order or military proclamations issued under its authority,from their parent or parents original place of residence in the prohibited military zones on the west coast.this also includes those individuals who were born to a parent or parents who had voluntarily evacuated from his or her original place of residence in the prohibited military zones on the west coast,on or after march,pursuant to paragraph b of this section,and who were excluded by executive order or military proclamations issued under its authority,from their parent or parents original place of residence in the prohibited military zones on the west coast.
c paragraph b of this section is not an exhaustive list of individuals who are deemed eligible for compensation there may be other individuals determined to be eligible under the act on a basis by the redress administrator.

eligibility under the act 
murakami advances several arguments as to why he is eligible for a redress payment under the act.we address each of these arguments in turn.
otherwise deprived of liberty 
first,murakami argues that he is an eligible individual otherwise deprived of liberty under app.specifically,murakami alleges that his situation is analogous to the appellant in ishida united states,because he was deprived of liberty when he was excluded at the time of his birth from his parents home of los angeles.because his father,arthur murakami,was subject to an individual exclusion order until approximately one month before murakami was born,he argues that governmental action prevented his family from traveling from chicago to los angeles when aiko murakami was eight months pregnant.
the government responds that the court of federal claims correctly determined that murakami is not entitled to relief under the act.the government argues this case is analogous to higashi united states,which denied relief to a child born to parents of japanese ancestry seventeen days after the restrictions on her parents were lifted.the government argues that relevant precedent precludes relief and further that the redress office had a rational basis for denying murakami relief.
in ishida,appellant ishida was born in ohio in november after his parents were voluntarily relocated in march from their home in california to ohio.at.the government rejected ishida claim for redress under the act,stating that the implementing regulations did not provide that children were eligible for redress if they were born after their parents voluntarily relocated from prohibited military zones or internment camps.id.at.the government stated that ishida was ineligible because he was not personally confined,held in custody,or relocated.id.at.on appeal to the federal circuit,we held that congress clearly intended to include as eligible under the act anyone,including later born children,of japanese ancestry who has been deprived of liberty as a result of the laws and orders which caused them to be excluded from their family place of residence in a prohibited military zone.id.at.this court interpreted the statutory language otherwise deprived of liberty as an alternate basis in addition to being confined,held in custody,or relocated for recovery under the act,concluding that any other interpretation would render the statutory language superfluous.id.at.the court held that the act entitles to compensation all children who were deprived of liberty because they were excluded from their family homes as a result of executive order and who could not return to their homes without committing a crime under the criminal statute.id.the court observed that these children suffered a grave deprivation of liberty as a direct result of government action excluding them and their parents from their family homes.id.thus,ishida held that children born to parents of japanese ancestry who were excluded from their family homes in prohibited military zones during the statutory period from december,to june,are entitled to compensation,because these children were otherwise deprived of liberty within the meaning of the act when they were excluded by law from their parent or parents original place of residence.id.at.
in higashi,appellant higashi parents were first removed from their home in california to a relocation center under executive order.at.from there,they received government permission to again relocate to boise,idaho,where higashi was later born.id.higashi was born on february,seventeen days after the government rescission of executive order became effective on january.see id.the justice department regulations stated that eligibility for redress extends to persons born on or before january,as well as others that can establish their eligibility on a basis.id.at citing b,c.higashi argued that her family was constructively or actively restrained by governmental action after january,based on her family alleged belief they were under continued travel restrictions.id.at.the federal circuit considered whether the january,date in the regulations conflicts with the statutory eligibility period that extended to june.id.at.this court held that after january,newborns and other family members were no longer excluded by law under ishida from returning to their original residences 
in ishida,this court interpreted the act to extend compensation to newborns excluded by law from their parents original place of residence as a result of executive order.because all restrictions on travel and relocation were rescinded as of january,by proclamation,from that date forward newborns or other family members were no longer excluded by law from returning to their original residences.thus,the holding of ishida does not help plaintiff to obtain a redress payment.
id.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.this court observed that individuals living between the statutory period of december to june,must meet several requirements to establish their eligibility under the act.id.we held that the january,regulatory date was consistent with the act,and therefore the determination that no compensable deprivation of liberty occurred for individuals born after the united states had lifted all travel and relocation restrictions on or before january,was entitled to deference.id.this court further affirmed the court of federal claims finding that the government did not constructively deprive higashi of liberty after january,by inducing her family to believe they could not return home.id.at.the decision in higashi found no clear error in the court of federal claims finding that there was adequate public notice,including prominent newspaper articles and widespread community knowledge,to inform higashi family that the governmental restraints on travel and relocation had been lifted.see id.
in the present case,the court of federal claims observed that regulations promulgated by the redress office establish categories of individuals deemed to have been otherwise deprived of liberty,as well as a catchall provision covering other individuals deemed to be eligible by the redress administrator on a basis.murakami iii.at.the court stated that the redress office,at the least,inadequately considered whether,aside from applying the modified version of the ishida provision in the regulation,plaintiff was otherwise deprived of liberty within the meaning of the regulations and the act.id.at.the court observed that the redress office applied a faulty,overly narrow reading of ishida,and found no evidence that the redress office conducted the analysis required by c.id.at.instead,the redress office decided view was that a deprivation of liberty must result from a legal restraint,rather than from the practical hindrances flowing from a prior legal restraint.id.the court of federal claims concluded that the redress office approach appeared inconsistent with the plain language of app.that an individual is eligible for redress if deprived of liberty as a result of governmental laws or orders.id.at.the court observed 
t he plain language of the statute connotes that if the deprivation of liberty was caused by some prior action of the united states,redress might be obtainable even though the prior legal restraint was removed prior to the time the deprivation was actually suffered.as such,it is far from apparent that the congress intended that an otherwise eligible individual born an hour or perhaps a specific exclusion order was rescinded would be ineligible for redress even if it were shown that it was practically impossible or at least unreasonably dangerous for a woman in the advanced stage of pregnancy to have traveled so that her child could be born in the family home.
id.at.accordingly,the court remanded murakami claim to the justice department for a redetermination of murakami eligibility for redress under the act and its implementing regulations.id.at.
on remand,the justice department found that under the regulations,once the governmental proclamations and individual exclusion orders were rescinded,there was no legal bar prohibiting individuals of japanese ancestry from returning to the west coast.according to the justice department,children born after the rescission are not eligible for redress payments.the justice department concluded that because murakami was born several months after executive order was rescinded and more than one month after arthur murakami individual exclusion order was lifted,he was not entitled to a redress payment.in an alternative finding,the justice department conducted the analysis requested by the court of federal claims and concluded that aiko murakami unwillingness to travel based on her pregnancy was not attributable to governmental action.the justice department concluded that the murakami family decision not to return to the west coast was solely a personal decision based not only on aiko murakami unwillingness to travel during her pregnancy,but also on the family lack of housing and arthur murakami lack of employment in the los angeles area.
following the remand proceedings,the court of federal claims categorically rejected the notion that a deprivation of liberty must stem from a legal restraint.murakami iv.at.however,the court found that the redress office redetermination that aiko murakami decision not to travel to los angeles once the individual restriction on arthur murakami was lifted was for personal reasons not attributable to governmental action was within the bounds of reasoned.id.at.the court thus concluded that murakami was not eligible for relief under the act.
based on our review of the act,we conclude that the court of federal claims correctly interpreted the statutory provisions applicable to this case.ishida held that congress clearly intended to include as eligible under the act anyone,including later born children,of japanese ancestry who has been deprived of liberty as a result of the laws and orders which caused them to be excluded from their family place of residence in a prohibited military zone.at.higashi did not subsequently promulgate a per se rule that children born following the lifting of travel and relocation restrictions,including proclamation,are ineligible for redress under the act.higashi instead held that governmental regulations specifying january,as a date,after which children were no longer excluded by law from returning to their homes,was consistent with the language of the act.at.higashi expressly recognized that additional governmental regulations specified that individuals could also establish their eligibility on a basis.id.higashi left open the question of whether children born after the lifting of travel and relocation restrictions imposed on their parents might be eligible for redress if they were otherwise deprived of liberty as a result of governmental action under section of the act.we conclude that such children are potentially eligible for redress under the act.
the act provides that citizens and permanent resident aliens are eligible for redress if they were confined,held in custody,relocated,or otherwise deprived of liberty or property as a result of certain enumerated governmental actions.app.according to dictionary definitions,the verb result commonly means to proceed,spring,or arise as a consequence,effect,or conclusion.webster third new international dictionary.thus,the broad language of the act does not limit eligibility to individuals otherwise deprived of liberty only during the pendency of governmental action,but also to individuals otherwise deprived of liberty as a consequence or effect of governmental action.this interpretation is consistent with our prior construction of similar statutory language in gardner brown,which provided that the veterans administration would compensate veterans for an injury,or an aggravation of an injury,occurring as the result of hospitalization,medical or surgical treatment,or the pursuit of a course of vocational rehabilitation.supp.v emphasis added see also gardner,at.in gardner,we rejected the va interpretation that as the result of should be
