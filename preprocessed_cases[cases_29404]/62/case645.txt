james chambers chambers appeals the decision of the united states court of federal claims granting judgment upon the administrative record in favor of the united states the government.chambers united states.july.the trial court upheld the decision of the army board for correction of military records abcmr or board denying chambers request to reopen his honorable discharge from the military to assess whether he suffered from post traumatic stress disorder ptsd while on active duty such that he should have been retired for disability under with disability retirement or severance pay.
although neither the parties nor the trial court considered whether the court of federal claims had jurisdiction to hear chambers case,e very federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction,but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review,even though the parties are prepared to concede it.bender williamsport area sch,d citation omitted.given some years separating chambers discharge from the army and his suit in the court of federal claims,we requested jurisdictional briefing from the parties.we now hold that because the abcmr was the first competent military board to consider chambers disability retirement claim arising under,his claim did not accrue until the board rendered its final decision in september.chambers suit in the court of federal claims was,therefore,not barred by the statute of limitations in.however,because the court of federal claims correctly held that the decision of the abcmr was supported by substantial evidence,we affirm.
background 
chambers enlisted in the army in july.after completing training in fort bliss,texas,chambers served in the panama canal zone until he was reassigned to vietnam as a light air defense artillery crewman in december.he was promoted to the rank of sergeant grade in march.
prior to his discharge from active duty in july,chambers was hospitalized three times.in june,chambers was hospitalized for back pain resulting from a car accident.at that time,he was also diagnosed with transient stress reaction.the attending psychiatrist,however,concluded that no treatment was necessary.in january,chambers was readmitted to the hospital for headaches and chest pain,diagnosed with personality pattern disturbance,transient,situational,and prescribed valium.he returned to regular duty after eleven days in the hospital.in april,approximately three months before chambers discharge,chambers reported to a military hospital complaining of an earache and nervousness.upon referral to the neurological psychiatric clinic,chambers reported feeling agitated,and experiencing difficulty interacting with his fellow soldiers and superiors.chambers was diagnosed with mild situational anxiety and prescribed librium.he returned to regular duty the same day.
chambers returned to fort lewis,washington in july to complete his military obligation.at fort lewis,chambers medical records were examined,and he received a separation physical exam,which revealed no physical or psychological abnormalities.chambers was found medically qualified for separation and honorably discharged.
after separation from active duty,chambers first sought medical assistance from the veterans administration va in november.at that time,he was diagnosed with acute bronchitis,but made no mention of symptoms.from to,chambers served in the new york army national guard.
chambers was diagnosed with ptsd in february,while in the drug rehabilitation program at the va hospital in montrose,new york.chambers promptly filed a claim for va disability benefits based on ptsd and received a percent ptsd rating in july.that rating was ultimately increased to percent,effective june.
in july,chambers applied to the abcmr for disability retirement pay based upon his diagnosis of ptsd.specifically,chambers asked that the abcmr reopen his discharge to reassess his mental condition and evaluate his entitlement to disability retirement or severance pay.chambers argued that the army improperly discharged him as physically and mentally qualified,despite his medical history.he further claimed that the discharge was illegal,because he did not receive counseling about his right to have a medical evaluation board meb review his fitness for duty or his right to waive meb review.
the board denied chambers claim on march.the abcmr first determined that under army regulation ar in effect in,only a soldier commander,physician,or a military occupational retention board mmrb could request meb review or refer a soldier to an meb.chambers thus had no right to request review by an meb at the time of his separation.accordingly,chambers rights were not violated by him not being counseled concerning his right to a n meb or requirement to waive a n meb before he could be separated.
moreover,the board determined that the three medical incidents suffered by of them temporary in duration,medically treated,and followed by a return to full military not meet the requirements for reference to an meb.the board also noted that t he medicines prescribed in these cases,valium mg twice a day and librium mg three times a day for two weeks,are low concentrations according to the board medical doctor advisor.
the abcmr thus concluded that the physician administering chambers physical correctly found no basis for referring chambers to an meb based upon his medical condition and medical records.first,the board observed that chambers was performing his military duties at the time of separation and was thus presumed fit under the standards set by the army physical disability agency.second,according to the version of,transient personality disruptions of a nonpsychotic nature and situational maladjustments due to acute or special stress do not render an individual unfit.as such,the board ruled,the doctor was correct in stating that the applicant was qualified for separation.
the board declined to reconsider chambers claim on september.
on july,chambers filed a complaint in the court of federal claims,challenging the abcmr decision as arbitrary and capricious.chambers claimed,inter alia,he was entitled to a judgment awarding him disability retirement pay from april through june at the rate of of pay for enlisted grade,amounting to plus costs.
on the parties for judgment upon the administrative record,the trial court ruled in favor of the government.the court of federal claims explained that despite its arbitrary and capricious standard of review for administrative decisions affecting military pay,e ssentially,plaintiff asks this court to conduct a de novo review of the administrative record and find that the abcmr impermissibly denied plaintiff claim.this court,however,may not reweigh the evidence but may only ascertain whether the administration decision was based on substantial evidence.chambers,slip op.at.the trial court concluded that t he abcmr reviewed the record and rendered a rational decision that plaintiff was fit for duty at the time of his separation.id.
chambers timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction over an appeal from a final decision of the court of federal claims pursuant to a.
discussion 
we begin with subject matter jurisdiction.there is no dispute that chambers filed this suit under the tucker act,which authorizes certain actions for monetary relief against the united states to be brought in the court of federal claims and waives the government sovereign immunity for those actions.as we have explained,however,t he tucker act does not itself provide the substantive cause of action instead a plaintiff must look elsewhere for the source of substantive law on which to base a tucker act suit against the united states.martinez united states,en banc citations omitted.that source must be.see fisher united states,en banc in relevant part.here,chambers claims entitlement to military disability pay under,a statute.see id.at.section provides that upon the secretary determination that a service member is unfit to perform the duties of the member office,grade,rank,or rating because of physical disability incurred while entitled to basic pay,the service member may retire for disability.a.
claims under the tucker act are subject to the statute of limitations in,which provides that every claim of which the united states court of federal claims has jurisdiction shall be barred unless the petition thereon is filed within six years after such claim first accrues.a tucker act claim accrues as soon as all events have occurred that are necessary to enable the plaintiff to bring suit,when all events have occurred to fix the government alleged liability,entitling the claimant to demand payment and sue here for his money.martinez,at citation omitted.accordingly,to ascertain whether the trial court had jurisdiction to hear chambers claim,we must determine when that claim his discharge from the army in,when the abcmr denied his claim in,or at some point in between those two dates.
this court recently held en banc that a claim for wrongful discharge accrues upon the service member discharge rather than upon the final decision of the appropriate military corrections board.see martinez.in view of martinez,we asked that the parties jurisdictional briefing address whether the same rule applies in retirement disability cases.we now hold that it does not.
in martinez,the court of federal claims dismissed the plaintiff claim,filed more than six years after his separation from active duty,as under.this court affirmed.we explained that i n a military discharge case,this court and the court of claims have long held that the plaintiff cause of action for back pay accrues at the time of the plaintiff discharge.id.at citing,among other authorities,real united states.we observed that 
t his court and the court of claims have frequently addressed and rejected the argument that the cause of action for unlawful discharge does not accrue until the service member seeks relief from a correction board and the correction board enters a final decision denying relief.the reasoning underlying that line of cases is that,since their creation,the correction boards have been regarded as a permissive administrative remedy and that an application to a correction board is therefore not a mandatory prerequisite to filing a tucker act suit challenging the discharge.
id.at citing,among other authorities,friedman united states.we thus reasoned that martinez resort to the abcmr was permissive rather than mandatory to bringing a tucker act suit for monetary relief.id.at.accordingly,we held that martinez claim accrued not upon the board final decision,but upon his discharge.id.at.
unlike claims for unlawful discharge,however,claims of entitlement to disability retirement pay generally do not accrue until the appropriate military board either finally denies such a claim or refuses to hear it.see real,at citing friedman.the decision by the first statutorily authorized board that hears or refuses to hear the claim invokes the statute of limitations.id.the difference between the two types of claims stems from their respective statutes.in wrongful discharge cases brought under the military pay act,martinez explained,the service member can seek redress immediately upon separation from service an appeal to a correction board constitutes a permissive rather than a mandatory remedy.at.because the tucker act does not require exhaustion of administrative remedies,a plaintiff invocation of such a permissive remedy neither prevents the accrual of his cause of action nor tolls the statute of limitations.
disability retirement cases,however,are governed by as friedman explained,in the context of section,congress has entrusted the military boards with the task of determining whether a serviceman should be retired for disability and therefore no cause of action arises and the statute of limitations does not run until a proper board has acted or declined to act.at.as another decision of the court of claims artfully reasoned 
the principle of these cases is first,jurisdiction is conferred by congress,not on this court,but on retiring boards and the secretaries of the three armed services,to decide an officer right to retirement for physical disability,and his consequent right to retired pay second,it follows therefrom that we can not acquire jurisdiction of such a claim until after the board and the secretary have acted,or failed or refused to act,and not then unless the board and the secretary acted arbitrarily or capriciously or contrary to law third,since our jurisdiction could not be invoked until after the retiring board and the secretary had acted,the statute of limitations on a suit in this court did not begin to run until they had acted 
furlong united states.in other words,the court of federal claims has no jurisdiction over disability retirement claims until a military board evaluates a service member entitlement to such retirement in the first instance.therefore,if at the time of discharge,the service member requested review by an appropriate board and the request was denied,or if the board heard the service member claim and denied it,then the limitations period begins to run upon discharge.real,at.but where the claimant has not had or sought a retiring board his claim does not accrue until final action by the correction board which in that instance stands in the place of the retiring board as the proper tribunal to determine eligibility for disability retirement.friedman,at.thus where the service member was released from service without a board hearing and subsequently files a claim for disability retirement before a military correction board,the correction board becomes the first proper board to act or to be asked to act on the matter,and the claim does not ripen until that board action is final.id.at.the correction board proceeding becomes a mandatory remedy without it,the case in this court would be dismissed as premature on the ground that the plaintiff did not seek or obtain a final decision within the administrative hierarchy.id.emphasis added.
given the differences underlying claims for unlawful discharge and disability retirement,our holding in martinez did not disturb the first competent board rule of friedman.indeed,the government does not contend otherwise.the government instead argues that chambers case falls into an exception to the friedman rule addressed by this court in real.this exception,according to the government,applies to cases where the service member is aware of the prospect of disability retirement but does not obtain a decision entitling him to disability retirement from the appropriate board during service.the government contends that as of,chambers knew he had ptsd and,based on his percent disability rating from the va,knew that his ptsd was service connected.at that time,the government argues,chambers knew all of the facts supporting his disability retirement claim,yet failed to apply to the abcmr until,twelve years later.
we do not read real as broadly as the government.in real,the trial court dismissed the plaintiff claim for disability benefits as,holding that his claim accrued upon discharge from the navy in,not upon the final decision of the board for the correction of naval records in.the court of federal claims concluded that,even though real knew or should have known that he suffered from significant medical problems prior to discharge and understood that he would be ineligible for future disability benefits if he did not challenge the navy finding that he was fit for duty,he did not contest that determination and thus waived the right to further review.real united states,
on appeal,this court began by restating the general rule of friedman that if the service member had neither requested nor been offered consideration by a disability board prior to discharge,the later denial of his petition by a corrections board,not his discharge,triggers the statute of limitations.however,we explained,there are circumstances under which the service member failure to request a hearing board prior to discharge has been held to have the same effect as a refusal by the service to provide board review.at citing miller united states.huffaker.specifically,such failure can invoke the statute of limitations when the service member has suffic
