in this suit brought under the federal tort claims act ftca,janyce brown and her two minor children collectively,appellants appeal the district court order granting summary judgment to the government.as the wife and children of a veteran of the first persian gulf war,appellants claim that the united states department of veterans affairs the va is liable for failing to diagnose the veteran,arvid brown,with a parasitic disease called leishmaniasis and for failing to warn him that he could transmit the disease to his family.because there is insufficient evidence that the va owed a duty to appellants,we affirm.
background 
arvid walter brown,served in the united states army during the first persian gulf war.he was on active duty in saudi arabia from january,until june.during that time,appellants contend he contracted leishmaniasis,a parasitic disease common in certain parts of the middle east that is spread by the bite of infected sand flies.
three years after he returned from active duty,on september,brown married janyce brown.they had two children together asa brown,born august,and helen brown,born june.appellants allege that brown transmitted leishmaniasis to his wife via their daily personal and sexual contact,and that brown transmitted the disease to their two children in utero.
from until,brown received medical care from the va for various physical and psychological problems.in,the va conducted four blood tests to determine whether brown had leishmaniasis all of these tests were negative.
unaware of the tests conducted by the va,brown private health care provider,gregory forstall,also ordered blood tests in september to determine whether brown had leishmaniasis.both of these tests indicated that he was positive for the disease.a bone marrow biopsy conducted in august had indicated no parasitic infection,but it had also indicated atypical lymphoid aggregates.faced with what forstall believed to be equivocal bone marrow results and the positive blood tests,forstall treated brown with a day course of amphotericin b.according to forstall,he was not clear either way as to whether brown in fact had leishmaniasis.rather,he testified that at that point it was let treat him and see what happens.another bone marrow biopsy conducted in february indicated no evidence of parasitic infection.finally,blood tests performed in by an unnamed lab located in rio de janeiro,brazil,indicated that arvid is for sure negative.
unlike brown,it is undisputed that neither brown nor the children ever received treatment or care from the va or any of its medical personnel.they also were never patients of forstall.at forstall direction,however,blood was collected from brown and the children and sent to the unidentified lab in rio de janeiro in.the email from the lab indicated that brown and asa brown had test results that were above the cutoff,which indicated positivity although very discrete.helen brown was just near the although considered negative.the results of a second test from the same lab apparently indicated that both brown and asa brown were negative,and that helen brown had a very weak positive reaction.
on september,appellants filed suit against the united states under the ftca in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan they sought damages for harm caused by leishmaniasis,which they alleged they contracted from brown due to the government negligent failure to diagnose him with the disease or to warn him of the risks of transmitting it to his family.the government filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction based upon the feres doctrine,which precludes ftca claims for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.feres united states.the district court granted the government motion and dismissed the case.on appeal,however,this court affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded the case to the district court.brown united states,cir.feres,the court held,barred appellants claims deriving solely from military decisions incident to arvid service,but it did not bar their claims to the extent that they attribute d their injuries to medical examinations that took place after arvid discharge,and any duty to warn that arose from such examinations,id.at.yet the court express ed no opinion with respect to other possible hurdles to recovery by appellants,such as whether or not there was a duty or proximate causation.id.at.
on remand,appellants filed an amended complaint with the district court.the government moved for a more definite statement of the factual allegations in the complaint and to strike the portions of the complaint that were irrelevant in light of this court decision.the magistrate judge granted the government motion and appellants filed a second amended complaint alleging the following claims failure to warn,negligence,medical malpractice,and wrongful death of janyce brown.at that point,the government filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.it argued that appellants second amended complaint did not make sufficiently specific allegations to state a claim and,even if it did,michigan law did not recognize a general duty toward third parties such as appellants.the district court denied the government motion.
after completion of discovery,the government moved for summary judgment.on july,the district court granted the government motion.the district court first noted that appellants had abandoned their medical malpractice and wrongful death claims,a finding appellants do not contest on appeal.it then granted summary judgment to the government on appellants remaining claims for failure to warn and negligence.appellants filed a motion for reconsideration,which the district court denied.this timely appeal followed.

standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.white baxter healthcare,cir.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.to survive a motion for summary judgment,the nonmoving party must provide evidence beyond the pleadings set ting out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.e.the district court must construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.jones potter,cir.
liability under the ftca 
the united states is liable under the ftca in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.accordingly,the extent of the united states liability under the ftca is generally determined by reference to state law.molzof united states,d see also harris united states,cir.the parties do not dispute that michigan law applies in this case because the alleged instances of the va negligence all occurred in michigan.see b providing that district courts shall have original jurisdiction of claims under the ftca if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the places where the act or omission occurred.under michigan law,a plaintiff alleging a claim of negligence must demonstrate the following four elements a duty owed to the plaintiff by the defendant,breach of that duty,causation,and damages.case consumers power.
on appeal,appellants assert that the va owed them a duty to diagnose brown with leishmaniasis and to inform him of the risks of transmitting the disease to his family.the district court disagreed,holding that g enerally,michigan tort law does not recognize a duty to third parties and the court finds no exception to that rule here,despite the unfortunate facts of this case.surface united states,wl,at.july.
under michigan law,the question of whether a duty exists is one of law for the court resolution.welke kuzilla.duty arises from the relationship of the parties and involves a determination of whether the defendant has any obligation to avoid negligent conduct for the benefit of the plaintiff.duvall goldin.the existence of a duty is a separate inq
