discussion 
to establish that an agency failed to comply with the privacy act,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the information is a record within a system of records the agency disclosed the information the disclosure adversely affected the plaintiff and the disclosure was willful or intentional.g jacobs national drug intelligence center,cir.the air force moved for summary judgment on grounds that the summary judgment record demonstrated that pierce could not establish prongs one,two,or four.the district court held that pierce could not satisfy the first prong because duty titles used in lieu of names were not identifying particulars,and thus the use of duty titles did not make the final response letter and sroi records within a system of records.specifically,the district court found that the response that bryant received did not include pierce name and held that a duty title is not unique to an individual because many people have the same or similar duty titles.the district court reasoned that duty titles change over time and that individuals typically have both a predecessor and a successor at any specific duty title.thus,the district court found that although the newspapers were able to connect pierce to the allegations against him,the newspapers could not have made such a connection without information found outside of the final response letter and sroi.as such,the final response letter and the sroi were not protected records per the privacy act,and pierce claim failed to meet the first prong.as discussed below,we agree that the newspapers could not have identified pierce without additional information not released by the air force and that the duty titles released here are not the equivalent of names of particular individuals.
appellant first relies on the plain language of the privacy act which states that a record is any item that contains his name,or the identifying number,symbol,or other identifying particular assigned to the individual,such as a finger or voice print or a photograph.a.appellant argues that this language suggests that duty titles are the equivalent to the names of particular individuals.we disagree.although the privacy act protects more than just documents that contain a person name,it does not protect documents that do not include identifying particulars.here,the district court found that the duty titles were not numbers,symbols,or other identifying particulars.similarly,the district court found that duty titles were not comparable to captured immutable characteristics such as finger or voice prints or photographs.the district court reached these conclusions because an individual duty title changes over time,because multiple people can concomitantly have the same or similar duty titles,and because each individual has predecessor and successor holders of the same duty titles.we agree with the reasoning and conclusions of the district court.in circumstances where duty titles pertain to one and only one individual,such as the examples of identifying particulars provided in the statutory text finger or voice print or photograph,duty titles may indeed be identifying particulars as that term is used in the definition of record in the privacy act.for the reasons detailed by the district court,however,the duty titles in this case are not identifying particulars because they do not pertain to one and only one individual.see,permitting disclosure of an individual past and present position title and stateside duty assignments without written consent of that individual pt,app.h defining personal identifier as name,number,or symbol that is unique to an individual,usually the person name or ssn.and the plain language of the privacy act does not support the conclusion that duty titles are identifying particulars.
appellant next relies on an office of management and budget regulation to argue that to be a record under the privacy act,the information does not have to be unique to an individual,only that it be about that individual.guidance on the privacy act implications of call detail programs.april.this regulation was promulgated to provide guidance to agencies creating call detail programs that collect and use information relating to their employees use of long distance telephone systems.id.at.the regulation provides that call detail records that contain only telephone numbers are not records under the privacy act,but that when linked with a name they become such records.appellant correctly notes that the privacy act definition of record is thus not limited to purely unique or immutable identifying information,as telephone numbers can be protected.id.at.
the regulation,however,does not support the conclusion that the final response letter and sroi are records protected by the privacy act.the regulation states that identifying information alone,unless accompanied by a link between the identifying information and a specific individual,is insufficient to make a record protected.id.standing alone,a telephone number,is not a privacy act record.to achieve the status of a privacy act record,a telephone number must be maintained in a way that links it to an individual name or some other identifying particular such as a social security account number.when an agency assigns a specific phone number to an employee and maintains that information in a way that the name and number are inseparably connected,there is sufficient identification linkage that a privacy act record is created.thus,the regulation confirms what has been recognized by other courts to be a privacy act record,the information must be both about the individual and linked to that individual by name or identifying particular.see,tobey.the final response letter and sroi sent to bryant included the allegations and other information about pierce.this satisfies the first prong of the definition of record.the second prong,however,is unsatisfied.as explained above,the duty titles in this case do not qualify as identifying particulars.as such,the final response letter and sroi did not include the requisite linkage to pierce by his name or other identifying particular.the final response letter and sroi are thus not privacy act records.
in support of the argument that duty titles are not unique to an individual,appellee points out that at the time the newspaper articles were printed pierce no longer held the duty title of program manager,his duty title prior to.the newspaper articles were printed on october.at that time pierce held the duty title of counterdrug coordinator,his assignment after his program manager position,and against which only one allegation from the final response letter and sroi pertained.thus,pierce duty title had changed,and all but one of the eight allegations listed in the october,final response letter pertained to a duty title he no longer held.as such,appellee argues that the link to pierce was not so simple as identifying the current holder of the listed duty titles because that inquiry would not have identified pierce except for as to one of the allegations.the inclusion of one allegation involving pierce duty title does not mean that the report specifically identified only pierce for this allegation,because a person reading the report would have to know which allegations pertained to military personnel in their current positions instead of their previous positions.had the report included both duty titles and dates for the allegations,the report very well might have linked specifically to pierce because only one person could have held his duty title on those dates.but simply listing allegations by duty titles without specifying when the personnel involved held those duty titles is insufficient to turn pierce duty title into an identifying particular.
to answer this argument,appellant relies on quinn stone,cir.in quinn,the court determined that data stored in a hunting records database and accessible by the names of the hunters were privacy act records,despite the fact that some of the information was.id.at.as this case demonstrates,the meaningful privacy interest in a particular piece of information may be lessened by the passage of time,but such an interest is unlikely to be extinguished.we conclude that this home address was meaningful information and was protected by the privacy act.the hunting database stored information regarding where and when the plaintiffs had been hunting.critically,the stored information in question linked the plaintiffs names to their phone numbers and addresses.in relying on quinn,appellant both fails to respond to the relevant appellee argument and again fails to satisfy the second prong of the definition of record under the privacy act.appellee argument is that duty titles are not identifying particulars because they change over time.in the instant case,the duty title for all but one of the allegations was no longer temporally accurate.the quinn holding,that an individual may have a privacy interest in an outdated piece of information,does not respond to appellee argument.it is true that an individual may have a privacy interest in outdated information,but that privacy interest is limited to instances where the outdated information is linked to the individual by name or identifying particular.id.at holding that the definition of record pertains to information about an individual that is linked to that individual through an identifying particular.thus,appellant repeats the mistake addressed above and focuses on the first requirement of a privacy act record while failing to fulfill the second.it is true that the allegations are about pierce,but the duty titles in this case do not link the allegations to him.
in holding that the documents were not records,the district court relied on fleming united states ret,wl.in that case,an agency summary report,which listed the plaintiff by a description of his job rather than by his name,was published on its website listing information regarding an investigation of whether the plaintiff was conducting his private law practice during official government time.id.at.importantly,the investigation at issue was the only one described in the report,such that other employees at the agency would have no trouble identifying the subject.id.h is was the only disciplinary case described in the report and fellow employees who had been questioned knew that plaintiff was being investigated.the plaintiff claimed that the summary report was a privacy act record.the court held that the information did not constitute a record because the disclosure was about the plaintiff but was not linked to him by his name or identifying particular.id.the fleming court acknowledged that the privacy act definition of record includes the words such as before the list of example identifying particulars finger or voice print or photograph,which indicates the list is neither exclusive nor exhaustive.the court held,however,that the information in question plaintiff job description would have identified plaintiff only to an individual who had other information that would have caused that individual to infer from the report that plaintiff was the subject of the investigation.id.emphasis added.fleming supports that information about an individual is not a privacy act record unless it is linked to that individual by name or identifying particular and that a description of an individual job is not an identifying particular.id.thus,even when those with inside knowledge are able to infer who an undisclosed individual is,the fact that the insiders have to use other information to do so does not justify a conclusion that the released information is a record.
appellant argues that fleming is inconsistent with dep t of the air force rose,d.in rose,law review editors brought an action under the freedom of information act foia,to compel disclosure of case summaries of service academy honor and ethics hearings with personal references and other identifying material deleted.at.the case turned on exemption to foia,which exempts personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.b exemption.the district court concluded that exemption was inapplicable because 
disclosure of the summaries without names or other identifying information would not subject any former cadet to public identification and stigma,and the possibility of identification by another former cadet could not,in the context of the academy practice of distribution and official posting of the summaries,constitute an invasion of personal privacy proscribed by exemption.
rose,at.the court of appeals disagreed with this approach,and held that the district court and the agency must prod
