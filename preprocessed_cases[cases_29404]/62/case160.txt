factual and procedural background 
following the bench trial in this case,the district court set out the facts in detail,as follows 
kelly wayne hance hance enlisted in the national guard in december of and commenced employment at norfolk southern railway company nsrc in may of as a.throughout his employment at nsrc during active duty,hance averaged three to five days a week of work.as an employee conductor of nsrc,hance employment was at all times subject to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement cba,including provisions regarding employee discipline,nsrc operating rules,and also to the norfolk southern system teamwork and responsibility training start policies and procedures.
sometime in may of,hance was placed on furlough status in the knoxville district.in august of,hance requested and was transferred to the appalachia district,under the supervision of defendant,rick webster webster.hance was then released from work on the appalachia district on october,after having been called to duty on several military assignments,for allegedly having an unacceptable work record.despite the allegations of hance having an unacceptable work record,hance was not disciplined by nsrc during this period of time,but rather was placed on furlough status in his home seniority district in knoxville.
plaintiff challenged his release from work by filing a grievance through his united transportation union utu representative,gary mills mills.ultimately,the grievance was denied on grounds that hance had not been technically disciplined.during the appeal process related to hance release from work,mills was told by defendant webster that webster was upset with hance because hance was off too much time from work for military service.the court found mills testimony at trial to be credible.hance subsequently filed a complaint with the veterans employment and training service vets however,this was ultimately unsuccessful.
some nine months later,in june of,hance applied for a second voluntary transfer to the appalachia district.at the time,hance was still on furlough.in response,the appalachia district,the same district that had previously released hance,approved hance transfer,in spite of defendant webster concerns.on july,hance reported to webster.he arrived with a representative from the military guard,master sergeant general harold morrison,who communicated to webster that hance would be leaving for summer military training scheduled between july and july of.hance testified that webster was hostile toward him and continued his aggressive behavior toward hance throughout the meeting.he further states that webster refused to accept paperwork related to his military training from msg morrison.additionally,webster refused to allow msg morrison to record the meeting,via audio means,and made msg morrison leave the meeting.webster was irritated by msg morrison being present at the meeting.hance testified that webster advised that if he was interested in working again on the appalachia district he needed to travel to andover,virginia on july.the travel would be unpaid,and hance was not guaranteed a work schedule.the court finds the testimony of hance credible.
after the meeting,hance asserts that he contacted james clark clark,who was the general chairman of the utu,to seek clarification regarding webster instruction to report on july.according to hance,clark told him that he did not have to report on july,and that he could remain on furlough.hance then stated that he would rather not report to andover,virginia on july.in response,clark told hance that he would take care of the situation.
on july,hance did not report to andover,virginia.hance testified that he did not believe that he was required to report on july,notify webster of changed plans.further,hance indicates that he was ineligible to report to duty.in particular,nsrc policies state that individuals who are returning to duty from a work absence of six months or longer are required to have a complete medical examination.as the record reflects,hance had been absent from work longer than six months.nsrc contends that,although hance may not have been eligible to work before a medical examin ation,he was still required to report.
nsrc conducted an investigation,and nsrc ultimately found that hance was guilty of a charge of insubordination.thereafter,hance was dismissed from service on august.the utu filed a grievance under the cba on hance behalf challenging his dismissal.after hance exhausted his internal appeals under the cba,the grievance was submitted to a public law board plb for adjudication.the plb found that there was no violation of the cba and affirmed hance dismissal.thereafter,hance filed the subject action in this district court.
hance norfolk southern ry,slip op.at.
the district court found that,although hance termination was not based on his military service or status alone,his military service was a motivating factor in his dismissal.the court held,therefore,that hance had established a prima facie case of discrimination under userra that the defendant had failed to rebut by proof of a legitimate,nondiscriminatory basis for discharge in which military service was not a motivating factor.as a result,the district court ordered hance reinstatement and awarded him back pay,lost benefits,and interest in the amount of,as well as attorney fees.
discussion 
in an appeal from a bench trial,we review findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo.see overton,heritage bank,cir.a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states mabry,cir citing united states gypsum.awards of money damages are reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.see united states city of warren,cir.a court abuses its discretion when it relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact,or when it improperly applies the law or uses an erroneous legal standard.id.at.
liability under userra 
the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act was enacted to prohibit discrimination against persons because of their service in the uniformed services.curby archon,cir.userra provides,among other things,that a person who is a member of a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment,reemployment,retention in employment,promotion,or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership,application for membership,performance of service,application for service,or obligation.a.adverse employment actions are prohibited under userra if the person obligation for service in the uniformed services is a motivating factor in the employer action,unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such obligation for service.c.
in considering the history behind the passage of userra,we have observed that 
section is a congressional response to the supreme court decision in monroe standard oil,d.in monroe,the supreme court held that userra antecedent,the vietnam era veterans readjustment assistance act of,was enacted for the significant but limited purpose of protecting the against discriminations like discharge and demotion,motivated solely by reserve status.id.at.emphasis added.congress amended the statute in to provide that a violation occurs when a person membership in the uniformed services is a motivating factor,even if not the sole factor.stated otherwise,congress intended to lessen,but not eliminate,a plaintiff obligation to show that the employer adverse decision was related to his or her service in the armed forces.
curby,at internal citations omitted.userra thus requires the complaining soldier or veteran to demonstrate only that his or her military service was a motivating factor in an adverse employment action.see c.once the plaintiff has discharged this initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination,the employer then has the opportunity to come forward with evidence to show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the employer would have taken the adverse action anyway,for a valid reason.sheehan dep t of navy,internal citations omitted.
the plaintiff may prove the factual question of discriminatory motivation by direct or circumstantial evidence 
discriminatory motivation under the userra may be reasonably inferred from a variety of factors,including proximity in time between the employee military activity and the adverse employment action,inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer,an employer expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the employee military activity,and disparate treatment of certain employees compared to other employees with similar work records or offenses.
id.at.once the employee meets this burden,it shifts to the employer to prove the affirmative defense that legitimate reasons,standing alone,would have induced the employer to take the same adverse action.id.as the facts found by the district court in this case demonstrate,hance was able to establish several relevant factors,not the least of which were the expressions of hostility concerning his absences from work when called to military duty.
on appeal,norfolk southern argues that the district court erred in attributing animus to norfolk southern and in concluding that norfolk southern failed to prove that a nondiscriminatory reason actually motivated the discharge.regarding the attribution of animus to the company,norfolk southern argues that trainmaster rick webster,hance immediate supervisor,lacked the authority to investigate or terminate hance and,therefore,that webster animus can not be imputed to the company.but in addition to evidence of webster hostile attitude,testimony by union representative mills indicated that assistant superintendent bryson had also expressed concern about hance taking too much time off for the military.significantly,bryson was responsible for the decision to dismiss hance.this evidence of animus from a,combined with the close temporal relationship between hance leave for military service and his discharge was legally sufficient to support the district court finding that hance was discharged in violation of userra.as a result,we conclude that the district court did not err in attributing animus to norfolk southern.
we find equally unavailing norfolk southern contention that the district court erred in concluding that the record fails to reflect a valid,nondiscriminatory basis for hance dismissal.the company argues that hance failure to report for service in andover,virginia,constituted insubordination,an offense for which hance would have been fired even in the absence of his military service commitments.norfolk southern also argues that the district court was bound by the arbitration board decision that hance was discharged for just cause.
federal courts typically accord broad deference to arbitration decisions.see.family,serv.employees int l union local,cir en banc.however,we have previously recognized as an exception to this rule that district courts are not bound by arbitration decisions in employment discrimination cases under title vii or.see becton detroit terminal of consol.freightways,cir.we held in becton that a federal court may,in the course of trying a title vii or section action,reconsider evidence rejected by an arbitrator in previous proceedings.id.at.in the context of an employment discrimination case,deference is due to an arbitrator interpretation of provisions in a collective bargaining agreement or other employment contract,but becton cautions that an arbitrator decision regarding just cause for termination is not equivalent to the inquiry and framework mandated by congress in an employment discrimination case.see id.hence,a federal court should not consider an arbitrator decision binding in a discrimination suit,because to do so would unnecessarily limit the plaintiff opportunity to vindicate his statutory and constitutional rights.id.
in this case,the district court considered the arbitrator decision,the factual dispute over whether hance reporting instructions were clear,and the evidence of animus by hance superiors.because the district court was not required to consider the arbitrator determination as conclusive,that determination could not prevent the court from,we norfolk southern had failed to demonstrate a valid,nondiscriminatory basis for hance dismissal,as measured by the standard required under section c.
norfolk southern challenges the damages awarded to hance on several grounds.regarding the award,norfolk southern claims that the court erred in assuming that hance would have been recalled to work at the end of the summer of.the company also argues that the court erred by failing to reduce back pay to offset hance national guard pay in and by awarding back pay while hance was employed with the guard during,as well as during the period between the end of hance guard service and the entry of judgment.in addition,norfolk southern challenges the damages awarded for lost fringe benefits,arguing that the damages should have been calculated based on the actual costs incurred by hance in securing substitute benefits instead of the value of the policy he would have had under norfolk southern.finally,norfolk southern disputes the award of damages for lost retirement benefits,claiming that the award of retirement benefits constitutes an impermissible double recovery.
remedies provided under userra include requiring the employer to compensate the person for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by reason of such employer failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter.d b.because we have found no cases regarding damages under userra in this circuit,we look to our case law regarding damages available for other types of employment discrimination.in the title vii context,we have held that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving damages and is entitled to the amount claimed unless the defendant can prove otherwise.eeoc wilson metal casket,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.to challenge damages on appeal,a defendant employer must demonstrate that it proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff was not entitled to damages.id.we address each of norfolk southern arguments in turn.
norfolk southern first argues that hance has not presented competent evidence that he would have been recalled from furlough by september,the date from which the district court began to calculate his back pay.however,the record contains the testimony of mills,the local union chairman who had advised hance that he was likely to be called back to work during the summertime or later in the summer.hance testified that james clark,the union general chairman,had told him that he could either go back up there under their terms or remain furloughed in knoxville,and more than likely you be going back to work within the next month or two.
