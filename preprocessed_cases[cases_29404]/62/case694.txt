clary joined the united states navy on june,and remained on active duty until may.he achieved the rank of lieutenant commander in.in,clary began an relationship with the woman that is currently his wife.on january,as a result of this relationship,clary received his first punishment mast and a letter of reprimand for conduct unbecoming an officer despite the first mast,clary continued this relationship and on october,he received a second mast for adultery and failure to obey an order.following this second mast,a board of officers convened and determined that sufficient evidence of misconduct and substandard performance existed to require clary to show cause for retention in the navy.consistent with navy procedures,a board of inquiry boi met in april and recommended clary receive a general discharge from the navy.a board of review met in august and upheld the finding and recommendation of the boi.
while the boi recommendation was being reviewed,clary failed for a second time to be promoted.in july,clary was notified that officers who had been passed over twice were required to be discharged within six months unless they applied and were accepted for continuation of active duty.on august,clary spoke to his civilian personnel officer cpo,moffett,about continuation on active duty and his eligibility for early retirement.moffett,in turn,spoke to a lieutenant biron,the officer in charge of the navy continuation board section and clary personal detailer,lieutenant commander smith.both lieutenant biron and lieutenant commander smith told moffett that clary should be eligible for early retirement regardless of whether he was selected for continuation of his duties.moffett relayed that information to clary.based on this information,clary promptly applied for a continuation of active duty through august.
in a letter dated october,the navy notified clary that he had been selected for continuation of active duty.clary was also warned that he had been identified as an officer who should be required to show cause for retention,but that separation processing was not appropriate at that time.the navy informed clary that if he declined continuation,he would receive an honorable discharge and might be entitled to full separation pay or early retirement.finally,the navy warned clary that if he elected to continue his service,he might receive a general or less than honorable discharge,receive an adverse separation code,and lose entitlement to retirement or separation pay.despite these warnings,clary accepted continuation of active duty on october.
in a february,letter,the navy recommended that clary receive a general discharge.he was subsequently discharged on may.clary applied for a review of his discharge to the board of correction for naval records board on march.the board denied clary petition on february,finding that the evidence did not establish the existence of material error or injustice.
while the navy and clary were addressing clary disciplinary issues,congress,as a part of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year,enacted the temporary early retirement authority tera,a,stat.tera provided the secretary of defense with a temporary additional force management tool with which to affect the drawdown of military forces through.id.one of tera provisions gave the secretaries of the military branches temporary authority to lower the number of years of service required for an officer to be eligible to retire from twenty to fifteen years 
in july,the navy elected to utilize tera to facilitate drawdown of the navy forces.to implement tera,the chief of naval operations issued administrative message navadmin setting forth the eligibility requirements for tera.navadmin stated as follows 
this navadmin implements the navy year early retirement fleet reserve program for eligible officers and enlisted members.it is not an entitlement but a temporary early retirement authority tera,authorized until sep to help facilitate personnel drawdown tera offers early retirement at a somewhat reduced monthly stipend to eligible members prior to completing twenty years active duty service.officers and enlisted with at least years active duty service between oct and sep may be eligible for tera this voluntary offering is limited by competitive rating with caps for each since tera is not an entitlement,all eligible members may not be approved.

the court of federal claims agreed and determined that under,clary was entitled to a correction of his record to show that he was retired under b and that he receive back pay and interest for the period between his separation and the time he was placed on retirement.
the united states filed this appeal over which we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
the primary issue in this appeal is the interrelationship between and tera.we must determine whether the court of federal claims erred in interpreting b as mandating retirement of an officer under the provisions of tera,a temporary force reduction tool.we review issues of statutory interpretation de novo.united states,cathy united states.to interpret a statute we first look to the statutory language and then to the legislative history if the statutory language is unclear.allen principi,rigsbee united states,madison galleries,united states.we must first determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.robinson shell oil,d.our inquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.id.
