the victim was later identified as rickshella harrison.an autopsy of harrison body established the cause of death as a gunshot wound to the chest.
d.the investigation 
firearm evidence 
detective steven trojanowski participated in the investigation of both homicides.on june,he responded to a report that a firearm had been found near a restaurant in the same strip mall where secrets adult superstore was located.
the weapon was later identified as being a survival gun,because of the manner in which it could be taken apart and adapted.it was a caliber long rifle,meaning it required caliber long bullets,as opposed to caliber short bullets.if the wrong length of caliber bullet were used,the gun would still fire one shot,but the gun would then jam and have to be reset before the next shot could be fired.
sales records from the shooting gallery in vacaville showed that this firearm had been sold to defendant on may.at the time of purchase,defendant presented a military identification card and a louisiana state driver license,and gave his address at travis air force base.after the waiting period,defendant picked up the gun on may.
terry fickies,a ballistics expert,described defendant firearm as a caliber semiautomatic rifle.fickies examined the firearm,as well as other crime scene evidence.he opined that all of the bullets and shell casings found by the police at the crime scenes could have come from defendant gun,and that certain bullets and casings definitely came from defendant gun.

ii.discussion 
motion to suppress 
defendant contends the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress evidence that was the product of two warrantless searches of his barracks at travis air force base.he insists this evidence must be suppressed because it was obtained by an authorization to search and seize issued by the base commander of travis air force base,rather than by a civilian warrant issued by a magistrate.
background 
on august,fairfield detective cary blasingame requested a search warrant to search defendant vehicle and his person with respect to various different items,including a bandana and a black shirt with a round emblem on the chest.in support of his application,detective blasingame submitted a detailed affidavit setting forth the requisite probable cause to search 
on the afternoon of august,a search warrant was issued by a solano county superior court judge.that same day,special agent kenneth james of the air force office of special investigations requested an authorization to search defendant person,his dorm room,his work area,and any vehicles under defendant control.in support of his application,agent james submitted a detailed affidavit setting forth the reasons for the search and the items to be seized.agent james also presented an affidavit from detective blasingame.thereafter,colonel leonard patrick,a commanding officer at travis air force base,issued an authorization to search and seize with respect to the following property clothing to include but not limited to a black shirt with a large circular logo,ski masks,a black bandana,any large sums of money,and any ammunition including but not limited to caliber rifle ammunition,any firearm or firearm paraphernalia,a receipt for a firearm from the shooting gallery or any other gun store.
pursuant to the authorization to search and seize,detective blasingame searched defendant barracks at travis air force base on the evening of august.a number of items were seized as a result of this search,including notes referencing the shooting gallery,caliber ammunition,and two black with various stripes and insignias.a subsequent search of defendant barracks occurred in march,where the rap lyrics were found 
prior to trial,defendant raised numerous challenges to the evidence seized from his barracks including that the authorization to search and seize was not a legal substitute for a search warrant.relying on people miller d.miller,which held,among other things,that an authorization to search is not the equivalent of a search warrant id.at,defendant argued that a civilian warrant from a state court was required under the fourth amendment.finding miller to be factually distinguishable,the trial court ruled that the authorization to search was properly cognizable in the instant state court proceedings.in so ruling,the trial court noted that the authorization to search and seize,which was presented to the authorities at travis air force base,contained also the affidavit in support of the search warrant,which had been signed by the magistrate,so sort of a no harm,no foul even if one were to have found that it was not proper.the court further added the good faith exception see united states leon.was applicable to the search of defendant quarters.
defendant sole point of contention is the absence of a civilian search warrant at the time his quarters were searched.he does not question the existence of probable cause to procure a warrant or procedural compliance with military law.in other words,he would appear to have no quarrel with the admission of this evidence had he been tried and convicted by.rather,he maintains that since he was tried and convicted by a jury in state court,a search warrant founded in civilian law was the only legally cognizable basis for the search of his quarters.we disagree.
the fourth amendment to the constitution of the united states provides the right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated,and no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause,supported by oath or affirmation,and particularly describing the place to be searched,and the persons or things to be seized.our state constitution provides for similar safeguards against unreasonable searches and seizures.cal,art.i.as the united states supreme court has explained the touchstone of the fourth amendment is reasonableness.citation.the fourth amendment does not proscribe all searches and seizures it merely proscribes those which are unreasonable.florida jimeno,d see also brigham city stuart,d.
defendant misconstrues the applicability of the fourth amendment to military authorizations to search.the warrant clause does not apply to all searches.for example,a warrant is not required for searches incident to arrest chimel california,d,administrative inspections new york burger,d,and patdown searches terry ohio,d.a military authorization to search also does not require a warrant.reppert d,united states stuckey.nevertheless,the fourth amendment applies to military searches,and such searches must be reasonable.reppert,supra,d at.that said,the military implementation of that guarantee is different than that employed in civilian cases due to the unique circumstances surrounding military bases.chapman cir,chapman united states brown cir.the power to maintain order,security,and discipline on a military reservation is necessary to maintain military operations.cafeteria workers mcelroy,d.furthermore,the base commander is responsible for all military property located on a military installation.united states brown,supra,at.
thus,in the military system of justice,procedures have been adapted to balance the rights of servicemen against the needs of the military.chapman,supra,at,citing solorio united states,d.as such,an alternate procedure to a warrant issued by a magistrate has been developed,which is more compatible with the realities of military life.chapman,supra,at united states brown,supra,at.
under rule f of the military rules of evidence an investigatory search of a member quarters requires probable cause.see chapman,supra,at.the rule provides a definition of probable cause that is substantially identical to the one used in nonmilitary situations.compare rule f with people garcia th,d.searches conducted under this rule require except in limited circumstances an authorization to search.rule a,b,g.authorization to search is defined as an express permission,written or oral,issued by competent military authority to search a person or an area for specified property or evidence or for a specific person and to seize such property,evidence,or person.rule b.an impartial military base commander is competent to issue authorizations to search and seize for persons and property situated in places under the commander control.rule d see also united states brown,supra,at.
although scant california authority exists discussing the constitutional legitimacy of military searches,cases from other jurisdictions indicate that it is hardly a novel proposition.see chapman,supra,at united states brown,supra,at united states banks cir,wallis cir,united states grisby cir,reppert,supra,d at united states rogers,people coit,state long.indeed,we are unaware of any cases holding military authorizations to search as unconstitutional.since there is no evidence that the search was not supported by probable cause or that colonel patrick was so involved in the investigation of the crimes that his neutrality was compromised,the search complied with the fourth amendment.
nevertheless,defendant appears to suggest that even if the search complied with military law,state law enforcement officers were required to seek a search warrant.an analogous argument was raised and rejected in united states grisby,supra.there,evidence was seized in the defendant living quarters pursuant to a verbal order of the marine corps.chief of staff and the defendant was indicted in federal court.id.at.the defendant moved to suppress,apparently conceding that the search complied with military law,but arguing that the evidence should have been held inadmissible in a civilian criminal prosecution because it was warrantless.id.at.the court denied the motion to suppress,explaining grisby seems to contend,however,that even though the search was valid as a matter of military law,it can not be recognized by a district court as being valid.he seems to say that had he been tried and convicted by a court martial he would have had no basis for a contest over the admission in evidence against him of the property seized in his quarters,but that a district court can recognize as valid only a search,the legality of which is founded in civilian law.we find no basis for such a distinction.grisby was subject to military law at the time of the search.if the search was valid as a matter of military law when made,it was valid for all purposes,and admission of the fruits of the search ought not to be dependent upon the jurisdiction in which the subsequent trial is had.united states grisby,supra,at.
similarly,in chapman,supra,the seventh circuit upheld the admissibility of
