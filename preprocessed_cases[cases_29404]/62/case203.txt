this case requires us to determine whether the feres doctrine,which generally bars judicial review of military,precludes us from hearing a title vii suit brought by a national guard technician,whose position was both military and civilian in nature.while colonel nancy wetherill was initially granted a waiver of mandatory retirement from her military position,that waiver was later revoked.as a result,she was forced to quit her civilian position as a technician,and she was unable to obtain the full civil service pension attendant to the civilian aspect of that position.wetherill brought suit under title vii,alleging that the revocation of her military waiver constituted impermissible discrimination based on sex national origin.the district dismissed the action,holding that wetherill complaint was under the feres doctrine.
on appeal,wetherill presses two arguments.first,she argues that the feres doctrine does not apply at all to national guard technicians,by operation of a amendment to u.addressing funding for such positions.second,she argues that,even if feres applies to technicians generally,the district court applied the improper standard to her case and thus prematurely dismissed her action.exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
nancy wetherill is a woman she began working for the south dakota army national guard in,was commissioned as an officer on july,and was promoted to her highest rank of colonel on july.as for the events giving rise to this litigation,wetherill was employed as a national guard technician,which meant that she was paid as a civilian employee under the civil service system,but her job required her at all times to be an officer of the national guard,and she worked in uniform.see a b.
under b,national guard colonels who have not been recommended for promotion to a higher rank are required to retire from the military after years of service.this statute thus sets an officer mandatory retirement date mrd.wetherill mrd was july.under the regulations of the civil service retirement system,however,wetherill would not qualify for a full retirement annuity unless she continued working in her civilian capacity as a national guard technician until december,which she could not do once she was retired from the military.
faced with this predicament,wetherill asked major general michael gorman,then the of the south dakota army national guard,for a waiver of her mrd so that she could continue working until her civil service annuity matured.general gorman granted this request on may,and his decision was approved by the national guard on july of that year.in september,however,general gorman retired,and brigadier general steven doohen was appointed of the south dakota national guard.in january,general doohen asked the national guard to revoke the waiver given to wetherill in february,he informed wetherill of this decision and that it was being made for force management reasons.apl t app.at complaint.the national guard approved general doohen request,and wetherill mrd was to july,at this point,she was already serving beyond her original statutory mrd pursuant to the may waiver.
wetherill believed that general doohen revocation of her mrd waiver was motivated by sex national origin discrimination,and complained both informally and formally to the office of equal opportunity and civil rights of the national guard bureau.between may and july,wetherill was reassigned to a building where she worked in a room by herself,and was given work that no colonel would ever be required to perform.apl.at complaint.according to wetherill complaint,no other technician in the south dakota army national guard has had an mrd waiver revoked,and she is the only female officer and the only woman to have served at her level in the south dakota army national guard.wetherill did indeed retire from the guard on july,and thus had to relinquish her technician job as well.see b requiring that technicians must b e a member of the national guard.
after her appeal was denied by the national guard bureau,wetherill filed this action in the district of south dakota against the secretary of the army,the army national guard,general doohen and another general,and the south dakota army national guard collectively,the guard,alleging discrimination and retaliation based on sex national origin,in violation of title vii.a barring discrimination against any individual because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.all of the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under a variety of theories.the district court granted the motions to dismiss,holding that wetherill complaint was nonjusticiable under the feres doctrine,and thus that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.wetherill geren,d.wetherill timely appealed to this court.we review the district court grant of a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction de novo.blue cross blue shield little rock cardiology clinic,cir.
discussion 
genesis and development of the feres doctrine 
in order to understand the gravamen of wetherill arguments on appeal,a brief detour is in order to assess the origins and history of the feres doctrine.in feres united states,the supreme court held that members of the armed forces who sustained injury while on duty due to the negligence of other servicemembers or the military itself could not sue the united states under the federal tort claims act ftca.the court framed its decision in terms of statutory interpretation.while there was no language in the ftca expressly excluding servicemember claims against the indeed,some of the statutory language could have been construed as implicitly endorsing such the court nevertheless interpreted the statute in concert with the entire statutory system of remedies against the government.id.at.in the court view,the ftca was a narrow exception to the otherwise prevailing norm of sovereign immunity.congress enacted the statute in order to transfer the burden of examining tort claims to the courts,and thus stem the steadily increas ing tide of private bills in congress demanding relief for individuals who had suffered harm at the hands of the government.id.at.but,the court noted,congress was suffering from no plague of private bills on the behalf of military and naval personnel,because a comprehensive system of relief had been authorized for them and their dependents by statute.id.thus,in the court view,compensation for harms suffered by servicemembers while on duty was not within congress purpose in passing the ftca.
the court then turned to the language of the ftca providing the test for liability the united states shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances id.at quoting.this test did not create a new species of liability it merely adopted the standards of tort law as applied to private individuals.and because w e know of no american law which ever has permitted a soldier to recover for negligence,against either his superior officers or the government he is serving,the petitioners in the case could point to no analogous circumstance that a private individual might face that would give rise to liability private individuals,after all,can not maintain armies.id.thus,the ftca could not create liability in the united states for a harm which no private party could inflict under tort law.
in reaching its conclusion,the court distinguished one of its earlier precedents,brooks united states,in a manner that sheds light on the governing standard under feres.in brooks,a soldier who was injured when a and operated vehicle collided with a car in which he was a passenger,was allowed to recover from the united states under the ftca.feres,at.brooks could do so,however,only because he had been on furlough at the time of the accident t he injury to brooks did not arise out of or in the course of military duty.id.at.in contrast,feres was killed when his barracks caught on fire while he was on active duty.id.at.according to the court,the federal government can not be liable under the ftca for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.id.at emphasis added.
in a later case,chappell wallace,the supreme court further articulated the policy basis of feres and its progeny.underlying feres was a recognition of the peculiar and special relationship of the soldier to his superiors,and the effects on the maintenance of ftca suits on discipline.id.at quoting united states muniz,u,internal quotation marks omitted.the court counseled that c ivilian courts must,at the very least,hesitate long before entertaining a suit which asks the court to tamper with the established relationship between enlisted military personnel and their superior officers that relationship is at the heart of the necessarily unique structure of the military establishment.id.at.thus the court in chappell extended the reasoning of feres to bar suits by soldiers against their superiors for violation of constitutional rights under bivens six unknown named agents of the fed.bureau of narcotics,creating a cause of action for injuries sustained due to unconstitutional actions of federal agents.chappell,at.
the courts of appeals have extended feres to encompass title vii claims by servicemembers against the military.while the text of title vii makes its strictures applicable to employees in military departments,a,that provision has generally been interpreted to apply only to civilian employees of the armed forces.johnson alexander,cir n either title vii nor its standards are applicable to persons who enlist or apply for enlistment in any of the armed forces of the united states.see also d eeoc regulation noting that title vii applies to military departments,but not to u niformed members of the military departments.thus,as a general rule,the feres doctrine precludes claims brought by servicemembers under title vii arising out of activities that are incident to military service.see hupp dep t of the army,cir see also,overton state div.of military and naval affairs,cir brown united states,cir mier owens,cir.the feres doctrine also generally applies to members of the national guard,as well as members of the regular military.stencel aero eng g united states,applying feres to block a indemnity claim against the united states over the death of a national guard officer see also hupp,at.
ii.the feres doctrine applies to national guard technicians 
notwithstanding the unquestioned applicability of the feres doctrine to servicemembers generally,wetherill argues that we should not apply the doctrine to her national guard.this argument springs from the text of,which provides 
a in general.for purposes of this section and any other provision of law,a military technician dual status is a federal civilian employee who 
a is employed under section of title or section b of title 
b is required as a condition of that employment to maintain membership in the selected reserve and 
c is assigned to a civilian position as a technician in the organizing,administering,instructing,or training of the selected reserve or in the maintenance and repair of supplies or equipment issued to the selected reserve or the armed forces.
this provision was enacted as part of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year,stat,the essence of wetherill argument is that establishes that technicians are federal civilian employee s f or purposes of any other provision of law,which,she argues,would include title vii emphasis added.in her view,then,renders her position civilian,rather than military,and thus the guard should be amenable to her title vii suit notwithstanding the feres doctrine 
in support of this argument,wetherill points to jentoft united states.in that case,the federal circuit considered the interaction of and the feres doctrine in the context of an equal pay act claim,and came out on wetherill side of the question.for the federal circuit,the plain language of the a technician is a federal civilian employee for the purposes of any other provision of law was sufficient to indicate congress purpose to remove technicians from the ambit of doctrines such as feres.jentoft,at t here is no language in a limiting the circumstances in which a dual status technician can be considered a federal civilian employee.given the broad and unambiguous language contained in the statute,the federal circuit believed that application of feres to technicians was effectively foreclosed by the actions of congress.id.at noting that congress has the ultimate authority to regulate the military system of justice.
however,two of our sister circuits have considered and rejected the reasoning of jentoft.in walch adjutant general dep of texas,cir,the fifth circuit reaffirmed its precedent that the feres doctrine applies to national guard technicians,notwithstanding the amendments to.that court began by noting that the operative language of refer s to technicians civilian status as an introduction to provisions primarily concerned with the annual requests to congress for authorizing specific numbers of technician positions.walch,at.this statutory language classifying technicians was,in the fifth circuit view,nothing new.id.indeed,the court observed that the amendments to had not made technicians federal civilian employees rather,t he national guard technician act which created the position of technician in the first place did that.id.at.in sum,the fifth circuit did not believe that congress had intended a doctrinal revolution in amending in,and thus held that feres continued to apply.id.
the ninth circuit picked up and expanded upon this line of reasoning,while rejecting the conclusion of the jentoft court,in zuress donley,cir the zuress court examined the legislative history of the amendments to and discovered that the provisions at issue appear to have been primarily concerned with distinguishing between dual status and status technicians and with annual requests to congress for authorization of different categories of technicians.at.the any other provision of law language relied upon by wetherill and the jentoft court,in the ninth circuit view,was added to the statute in merely to eliminate inconsistencies in the nomenclature used to refer to dual status technicians,rather than to override settled case law on immunity,such as the feres doctrine.id.citing,at the national defense appropriations act for fiscal year and the national defense authorization act for fiscal year enacted provisions defining the term military technician which were not completely consistent with one another.this section would remove the inconsistencies.in light of this explanation for the any other provision of law language and the lack of any mention of title vii or the feres doctrine in the legislative history,the zuress court concluded that congress did not intend for the amendments to affect the application of that doctrine to technicians.id.
we are more persuaded by walch and zuress than by jentoft,and thus join the fifth and ninth circuits in holding that the amendments to do not remove national guard technicians from the strictures of the feres doctrine.like the fifth circuit,we had acknowledged the hybrid nature of technicians prior to the amendments to.see wood united states,cir.our recognition of the civilian aspect of the technician positions has given us no pause in applying the feres doctrine to the military aspects of that position.see id.at see also hupp,at uhl swanstrom,cir.thus,as the fifth circuit noted,the recognition in the amendments that technicians are federal civilian civilian employees which had as a condition of their employment that they remain members of the armed indeed nothing new.moreover,the ninth circuit analysis in zuress provides a convincing justification for the reference in the amendments to any other provision of law this language was designed to harmonize the nomenclature to be used for technicians throughout the.see zuress,at.
indeed,it would have been odd for congress fundamentally to alter the legal condition of technicians in,a statute that overwhelmingly just addresses the details of obtaining funding for national guard positions,see,b as a basis for making the annual request to congress c the secreta
