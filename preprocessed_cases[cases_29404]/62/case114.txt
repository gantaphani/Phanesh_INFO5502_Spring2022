this appeal requires us to consider the parameters of the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act of,west supp userra,enacted by congress to protect the employment and reemployment rights of veterans.cheryl francis brought suit against her former employer,booz,allen hamilton,bah,alleging discrimination,wrongful termination,and retaliation in violation of userra.the parties filed for summary judgment.on april,the district court granted summary judgment to bah on all counts,denying francis motion and dismissing her complaint with prejudice.francis timely appeals.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
given the procedural posture of this case,we summarize the facts in the light most favorable to francis.evans techs.applications serv,cir.francis began working for bah in crystal city,virginia in and was promoted to a position as a level ii senior consultant in.until march,francis worked as a computer technician pursuant to a contract with one of bah clients,the office of solid waste and emergency response oswer of the environmental protection agency epa.francis performed a variety of functions as required by oswer,categorized by bah as tier i call center work,tier ii work and problem solving,or tier iii networking assistance.because of the nature of the work,francis performed most tier i tasks at her desk and most tier ii and iii assignments elsewhere.her usual workday was from until,though she would,depending on oswer needs,sometimes work the late shift from to.during the performance of these duties,francis engaged in some conduct that bah found unprofessional and for which francis was formally reprimanded several times in.
during the time of her employment with bah,francis was also a petty officer in the united states naval reserves.as part of her military obligation,she was deployed on active duty beginning march.following her discharge from active duty,francis resumed her duties at bah on august.it is undisputed that francis retained the same title,salary,consulting engagement,and work location upon her return.
there were,however,certain changes in francis responsibilities and work schedule following her return from deployment.first,although francis continued to perform a mix of tier i and tier ii work,she performed almost no tier iii work.this change resulted from epa decision to consolidate its network operations and transfer the maintenance and administration of oswer network to another vendor.by the time francis returned from deployment,this consolidation was nearly complete,and no one at bah performed substantial tier iii work on the oswer contract.
a second change related to francis work schedule.on august,bah informed her that she would be permanently assigned to the late shift unbeknownst to bah,this revision created a conflict with evening undergraduate classes in which francis had enrolled on august.francis,however,arranged for various supervisors and to replace her when her work schedule conflicted with her classes.francis did not miss any classes as a result of her new schedule.she did,however,inform bah on august that she believed that her userra rights were being violated.
upon her return,francis engaged in certain behavior which bah found objectionable.for example,on various occasions,she left work early without authorization.she was also absent from a team conference call.a manager claimed to observe her slamming down the phone after exchanges with customers.lodged various complaints with the department project manager regarding francis behavioral and attendance issues.bah believed that francis actions violated bah core values an employee conduct policy that provides the framework of professional behavior for dealing with clients and colleagues at bah.consequently,on november,bah issued francis a notice of probation,which warned francis that failure to immediately address these issues would result in termination of employment.at.bah based this decision on francis conduct both and.bah subsequently provided francis with a plan for improvement wherein francis was put on notice that unless she displayed immediate,substantial,and sustained progress termination of employment would occur.at.
less than two weeks after receiving the notice of probation,francis again left the office without authorization in order to attend to a customer at an location.on december,bah terminated francis employment,and this action followed.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.evans,at.we apply the same legal standards as the district court and uphold the summary judgment only if the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the party,entitles the moving party to judgment as a matter of law.id.
francis brings three claims under userra,which we will examine in turn.she first claims that bah discriminated against her in violation of both a and.section a provides that a person such as francis shall not be denied any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of her membership in the armed services.a.under a,any person whose absence from a position of employment is necessitated by reason of service in the uniformed services shall be entitled to the reemployment rights and benefits of userra.a.francis discrimination claim alleges that bah denied her reemployment rights in violation of and benefits of employment in violation of.
francis second claim alleges improper discharge in violation of c of userra,which states in relevant part that a person who is reemployed by an employer under userra shall not be discharged from such employment,except for cause c.
finally,francis third claim alleges improper retaliation in violation of b of userra,which prohibits employers from tak ing any adverse employment action against any person because such person has taken an action to enforce a protection afforded any person under userra,or has exercised a right provided for in userra.b internal numeration omitted.specifically,francis third claim alleges that bah dismissed her in violation of this section because she indicated her desire to exercise her rights under userra.for the reasons stated below,we hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment to bah on all three claims.
francis first argues that the district court erred in holding that bah did not discriminate against her in violation of userra with respect to the changes in her work schedule and responsibilities.although francis alleges discrimination under both and,the procedural requirements of the two provisions differ.an employee proceeding under has the burden of proving that the employer discriminated against him or her based on a status or activity protected by userra.section imposes no such burden.we consider francis claims under both provisions 
we begin by noting that,b ecause userra was enacted to protect the rights of veterans and members of the uniformed services,it must be broadly construed in favor of its military beneficiaries.hill michelin,cir.in addition,while userra is a relatively recent statutory scheme,we can and should use relevant case law as a guide toward understanding userra i n enacting userra,congress emphasized that federal laws protecting veterans employment and reemployment rights for the past fifty years had been successful and that the large body of case law that had developed under those statutes remained in full force and effect,to the extent it is consistent with userra.
the first step in determining the meaning of a statute is to examine the statute plain language.in doing so,we look at the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.andrews united states,cir internal citation omitted quoting robinson shell oil,d.userra provides a and comprehensive remedial scheme to ensure the employment and reemployment rights of those called upon to serve in the armed forces of the united states.bd.of,cir discussing userra in the context of section claims.we analyze this comprehensive scheme holistically,careful to interpret each section in a manner that does not render any other sections inconsistent or superfluous.see soliman gonzales,cir.with this guidance in mind,we consider the relevant statutory sections.
in relevant part,states that any person whose absence from a position of employment is necessitated by reason of service in the uniformed services shall be entitled to the reemployment rights and benefits of userra.a.francis argues that protects her from discrimination with respect to the terms and conditions of employment after she has been rehired.conversely,bah argues that the reemployment rights protected by and apply only at the instant of reemployment,and that other sections of userra operate to protect employees after they are properly reemployed under and.we find bah interpretation to be more faithful to the statutory framework.
as noted above,is part of a comprehensive statutory scheme and must be read in context with the rest of,for purposes of our analysis,and.section provides that any person whose absence from a position of employment is necessitated by service in the uniformed services is entitled to reemployment rights.warren ibm,d.section prohibits discrimination with respect to any benefit of employment against persons who serve in the armed services after they return from a deployment and are reemployed.see id.at.finally,converts the otherwise employment status of covered individuals to one in which they are protected from dismissal except for cause for a period of time.id.at.
in short,requires an employer to rehire covered employees then operates to prevent employers from treating those employees differently after they are rehired and prevents employers from summarily dismissing those employees for a limited period after they are rehired.while combining to form comprehensive protection from the point of rehire to untimely dismissal,each provision is nonetheless functionally discrete.as one court has noted,
section serves only to guarantee service persons reemployment without question as to the employer intent.this interpretation is in keeping with congressional intent in enacting the userra.finding existing veteran right statutes overly complex and ambiguous,leaving veterans and employers confused as to their rights and responsibilities,congress acted to clarify,simplify,and where necessary,strengthen the existing veterans employment and reemployment rights provisions.lapine town of wellesley,fn.section places service people and employers on notice that,upon returning from service,veterans are entitled to their previous positions of employment.after being reemployed,the service person is protected by c and.
jordan air prods,d.put more simply,only entitles a service person to immediate reemployment and does not prevent the employer from terminating him the next day or even later the same day.id.the apparent harshness of this result is addressed by the fact that and operate to protect the employee as soon as she is reemployed.
francis interpretation of as requiring bah to provide all of the rights and benefits afforded to her under userra with no temporal limitation appellant reply brief at,emphasis in original would render and superfluous.if provided ongoing protection after reemployment,it would subsume the specific guarantees of and.w e are loath to read one statutory provision so as to render another provision of the same statute superfluous.gonzales,at quoting cooper indus.aviall,d.congress carefully constructed userra to provide comprehensive protection to returning veterans,while balancing the legitimate concerns of employers.we will not upset that balance and render userra sections meaningless by adopting the overly broad interpretation of that francis seeks.we therefore hold that applies to protect a covered individual only as to the act of rehiring.
we now decide whether bah violated when it reemployed francis.section states that bah had to provide francis with both reemployment rights and employment benefits.under its terms,bah must reemploy francis in either the position of employment in which she would have been employed if her continuous employment with bah had not been interrupted by military service,or a position of like seniority,status and pay,the duties of which francis is qualified to perform.a a defining the rights provided by.in addition,bah was required to rehire francis with her employment benefits,which include,in relevant part,any advantage,profit,or privilege that accrues by reason of an employment contract or agreement including the opportunity to select work hours or location of employment.we conclude that bah complied with both of these requirements.
the undisputed evidence demonstrates that francis was rehired with the same title,salary,consulting engagement,and work location upon returning.the actions francis complained of occurred significantly after her return to bah in august of.accordingly,they fall outside of scope.specifically,francis work hours were not changed until several weeks after she was rehired.she further admitted during her deposition that changes in her job responsibilities occurred in late october,in view of francis failure to present any evidence that bah improperly denied her either reemployment rights or employment benefits at the time it rehired her,we hold that does not provide francis with relief on her discrimination claim.
we now consider whether provides francis with any relief on her discrimination claim.section a states that a person such as francis shall not be denied any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of her membership in the armed services.a.as noted above,userra defines benefit of employment in relevant part as any advantage,profit,or privilege that accrues by reason of an employment contract or agreement including the opportunity to select work hours or location of employment.our analysis is guided by the fact that an employer shall be considered to have engaged in prohibited conduct under a only if the employee military status is a motivating factor.c.
francis first contends that,after being reemployed as a level ii senior consultant,she was gradually given more tier i work than she had and was no longer given any tier iii work.therefore,francis contends,even though her job title and salary remained the same,she was effectively demoted.see generally harris city of montgomery,d,noting that a significant change in job responsibilities,even when pay and title remain the same,can create a jury question as to whether a benefit of employment had been denied.the district court responded to this argument,noting that 
francis offers no support,beyond her own conclusory opinions,for the contention that her status and duties were changed and that such changes constituted the denial of a benefit of employment francis own deposition testimony reveals that she performed nearly identical duties before and after her deployment,that is,providing both tier i and tier ii support in the call center.
francis booz allen hamilton,dist.lexis at.we agree with the district court.the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to francis does indicate that the relative amount of tier i,ii,and iii work that francis received differed from her workload.this difference,however,was extremely slight and simply a continuation of her work always involved a mix of tier i,ii,and iii work depending on client needs,as did the responsibilities of other employees.
francis deposition testimony indicates that she performed tier i and tier ii duties both before and after deployment,noting that she performed tier i duties both before and after deployment acknowledging that she performed tier ii duties after returning from deployment.in addition,the reduction of tier iii work began before francis was deployed,was a direct result of the change in the oswer contract,and applied to all employees in francis position.in response to this evidence,francis provides naked speculation and rhetorical questions.see appellant brief at noting that it is hard to believe that tier iii work was not available anywhere within bah asking,but not answering,how many other jobs within bah on other contracts or locations required mainly tier ii type work.in short,the district court correctly held that,viewing the evidence in the light most
