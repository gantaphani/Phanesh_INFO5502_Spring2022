lance corporal aaron schoenfeld lost his leg while a passenger in his roommate car when it crashed into a previously damaged,but unrepaired,guardrail on a military base.the sole issue on appeal is whether the feres doctrine,which immunizes the government from suit for injuries arising incident to military service,bars schoenfeld claim against the government under the federal tort claims act ftca.the district court determined that the feres doctrine bars schoenfeld action and dismissed it for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
aaron schoenfeld was a lance corporal in the united states marine corps stationed at marine corps base,camp pendleton in southern california.he was generally on duty from monday to friday and had weekends off.on friday,july,schoenfeld finished up work in the afternoon and began his weekend liberty.liberty is a short period during which servicemen are permitted to leave the base at will.they are not required to seek permission in their comings and goings,or to report on their whereabouts.liberty status is subject to immediate cancellation.soldiers on liberty are still subject to the uniform code of military justice,et,and to camp pendleton rules and regulations.schoenfeld was not due to report back to service until the following monday.
on saturday morning,schoenfeld and his roommate,erik quamme,also a marine,decided to head for the day and drive to oceanside,a town abutting camp pendleton.according to schoenfeld,their plan was to mail some letters,have lunch,see a movie and hang out for the afternoon.before heading out,schoenfeld tossed his dirty laundry into the back of the car,figuring he would have it washed at a cleaners in oceanside.among the dirty clothes were some of his military uniforms the pair took quamme car,with quamme driving and schoenfeld sitting in the passenger seat.driving on stuart mesa road,quamme lost control of the car and crashed into a guardrail that had been badly damaged in a prior accident the collision severed schoenfeld right leg below the knee.
stuart mesa road is located within camp pendleton,a limited access federal military facility.all entrances to the base feature sentries and security gates.the base roads and entry gates are under the authority of camp pendleton commanding general.access to camp pendleton is restricted,but base regulations permit limited access to the public.civilians are allowed on base between and sunset every day,but they must first enter their names into the base visitor control log.civilian travel within the base is restricted to hard surface roads,including stuart mesa road.
the provost marshal,a military officer,is responsible for road maintenance in camp pendleton.however,civilian employees play a substantial role in managing the maintenance and repair of the base roads even though those tasks are under the ultimate authority of military officers.
passengers in cars driving through camp pendleton are subject to section of the base regulations.this section mandates,among other things,that passengers wear seatbelts,stay inside the vehicle while it is running,and ride in a manner such that no part of their body,clothing,or personal items protrude from the car.
following his injury,the government has paid for a significant portion of schoenfeld medical bills and also provided free air evacuation,emergency care,and medical treatment.schoenfeld is entitled to affordable healthcare and pharmacy services through the military tricare program.however,schoenfeld claims that he has not been reimbursed for several surgeries and that he was forced to purchase his own medical insurance.additionally,the government has represented to schoenfeld that any medical expenses paid for under any insurance,including medicare and tricare,will only be paid subject to a third party reimbursement agreement mandating that any benefits paid must be reimbursed from the proceeds of this action.
after the accident,schoenfeld continued to receive his regular military salary until,when he was placed on the navy temporary disability retirement list,which entitles him to a portion of his military pay.schoenfeld receives disability benefits from the department of veterans affairs totaling per month.he is also eligible for subsistence payments of per month while attending college and a car allowance.
in april,schoenfeld filed a complaint in the district court against quamme and jacobson.he subsequently filed an amended complaint,adding a ftca claim against the united states alleging that the government had knowledge of the damaged guardrail and negligently failed to repair or warn of the dangerous condition.quamme and jacobson eventually settled with schoenfeld and were dismissed from the case.on june,the government moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under feres united states,or in the alternative for summary judgment.in a reasoned order dated august,judge judith keep declined to find the feres doctrine applicable,following our opinion in dreier united states,cir.on september,the action was reassigned to judge hayes.the government again filed a motion to dismiss under feres,and this time it was granted.schoenfeld timely appealed.
we have jurisdiction over final judgments of the district court under.whether the feres doctrine applies to the facts in the record is reviewed de novo.factual findings are reviewed de novo,with all disputed facts resolved in favor of the party.costo united states,cir citations omitted.
the ftca is a broad waiver of the federal government sovereign immunity the united states shall be liable,respecting the provisions of this title relating to tort claims,in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances see also b.in feres,the supreme court carved out a significant exception,holding that the government is not liable under the ftca for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.at.this broad exception has been labeled the feres doctrine.costo,at.
the feres doctrine is rooted in three policy rationales the need for a uniform system of compensation for soldiers spread out across the country and the world the veterans benefits act vba provides soldiers with a generous alternative to recovery in tort and allowing soldiers to file lawsuits against the armed forces undermines military discipline.see mcconnell united states,cir citing costo,at.we have recognized that the third interest in maintaining military the most persuasive justification for the doctrine,and our feres cases have focused mainly on whether the serviceman activities implicate that interest.dreier,at quoting johnson united states,cir see also millang united states,cir per curiam noting that the key inquiry is whether the suit requires the civilian court to military decisions,and whether the suit might impair essential military discipline.quoting united states shearer,d.
we have identified four factors relevant to determining whether feres bars an action the johnson factors 
the place where the negligent act occurred 
the plaintiff duty status when the negligent act occurred 
the benefits accruing to the plaintiff because of his status as a service member and 
the nature of the plaintiff activities at the time of the negligent act.
bon united states,cir citing johnson,at.none of these factors is dispositive instead,we look to the totality of the circumstances.costo,at.
despite this framework,our feres jurisprudence is something of a muddle.w e have reached the unhappy conclusion that the cases applying the feres doctrine are irreconcilable,and thus,comparison of fact patterns to outcomes in cases that have applied the feres doctrine is the most appropriate way to resolve feres doctrine cases.id.internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,we now examine the ninth circuit cases that are most factually analogous to the case at bar to determine whether the feres doctrine bars schoenfeld suit.dreier,at.
in johnson,an active duty air force sergeant moonlighted as a bartender in the noncommissioned officers club nco club located on malmstrom air force base in montana.at.after the nco club closed at in compliance with montana law and military regulations one night,johnson and several other employees held a party until id.another employee,hay,who was intoxicated,agreed to drive johnson to his home.id.about a mile outside the entrance to the base,hay vehicle was involved in an accident which resulted in johnson becoming a quadriplegic.id.johnson was an active duty officer at the time of the accident,but he was for that day.id.at.the government denied johnson administrative claim.he brought suit under the ftca alleging that the government negligently allowed the nco club to stay open late in violation of montana and military law.
we held that feres was inapplicable,noting that the most persuasive policy justification for the feres doctrine is the potential impact of civil suits on military discipline,and that while the nco club location weighed in favor of a feres bar,the occurrence of government negligence on a military base should not automatically bar recovery.id.at.
instead of focusing narrowly on where the nco club was located,we considered the connection between the situs of the negligence and johnson military service id.at.we found that connection tenuous,because johnson was essentially acting in a civilian capacity while working at the nco club.id.the location of the nco club should not obscure the fact that johnson was performing a job in what was essentially a civilian context.
with respect to the second johnson serviceman duty gave little weight to johnson active duty status because he was at the time of the negligent act.id.at in and of itself,however,his active duty status is not relevant to our inquiry.noting that t he important question is whether the service member on active duty status was engaging in an activity that is related in some relevant way to his military duties,we concluded that johnson work as a bartender bears no such relevant relationship to the military disciplinary structure that the feres doctrine was meant to safeguard.id.
in particular,we emphasized that johnson was acting in a manner that did not meaningfully distinguish him from a civilian in short,he was in the same position that any civilian employee of the nco club might have been in at the time of the government negligence.id.therefore,we held that t he fact that johnson was for the day is,under the circumstances presented here,sufficient to eliminate any relevant links between his activities and his military service.id.
with respect to the third accruing to the plaintiff because of his status as a service drew a clear line between cases where the plaintiffs had access to the activity in question only because of their status as military personnel,and those where civilians might also have access.id.at noting that feres applies in cases where the plaintiffs would not have been privileged to take advantage of the benefits but for their military status.we held that johnson employment at the nco club could not be characterized as a privilege incident to his military service,because it was a second job of the type commonly held by civilians.id.at.johnson thus strongly suggests that nco club positions were not actually available to civilians,but rather that the essentially nature of the activity weighed against applying feres.id.johnson held a paying job at the nco club.the job is identified with those routinely performed by civilian bartenders.indeed,johnson employment at the nco club can not logically be distinguished from second jobs held by other military personnel.emphasis added.
our discussion of the fourth factor is perhaps the most illuminating and important to our decision here.in considering the nature of the johnson activities,we held that the most relevant line of inquiry is whether or not the service member activities at the time of the injury are of the sort that could harm the disciplinary system if litigated in a civil action.id.we concluded that johnson activities could not have adversely affected military discipline for three reasons.first,he was not subject in any real way to the compulsion of military orders or performing any sort of military mission he could just as easily have been injured had he never worn a uniform at all.id.quoting united states brown.black,dissenting.second,we noted the purely personal nature of johnson activity,which is noteworthy given that he was working in a bar.id.at quotation marks omitted.lastly,we emphasized that johnson employment at the nco club did not involve the sort of close military judgment calls that the feres doctrine was designed to insulate from judicial review.id.
dreier is another factually analogous case relied upon by schoenfeld.ronald dreier was on liberty for an afternoon,spent the day drinking beer and hanging out on a beach located on fort lewis,washington,and died after falling into a steep wastewater drainage channel.at.the beach was a restricted access area and civilians could enter only with a use permit id.dreier widow sued under the ftca,alleging the government knew that the area was hazardous but did nothing to make it more safe.we reversed the district court ruling that feres barred her suit.we reasoned that because civilians could gain access to the beach,dreier presence there made his activities indistinguishable from a civilian and weighed against applying feres.id.at.like johnson bartending job,dreier ability to use the beach area could hardly be characterized as a privilege or benefit incident to his military service.id.quoting johnson,at.although the fact that dreier was only for the afternoon weigh ed slightly in favor of a feres bar,we held that fact was not determinative.id.
in dreier the government argued,as it does here,that because dreier was subject at the time to various military regulations and also to immediate cancellation of his liberty,civil litigation could undermine discipline.id.we firmly rejected those arguments,noting that the government rationale would bar recovery against the government by any soldier injured on military property,an absolutist position rejected by johnson.id.because dreier was not acting under military orders or performing a mission,he was,like johnson,subject to military discipline only in the very remotest sense.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
we then observed that close military judgment call s were not involved when it came to providing adequate warnings about a dangerous drainage channel,and therefore that military discipline would not suffer if the suit went forward.id.at quoting johnson,at.we found relevant that many,if not all of the employees overseeing the site of the accident were civilians.id.
in bon,janice bon was an active duty member of the united states navy.at.she was injured when a government motor boat struck a canoe she was rowing and had rented from the navy special services facility at the san diego naval training center.id.bon was on authorized liberty at the time,though it is unclear for how long.id.although the parties disputed whether the accident occurred within the military base boundaries or just outside of them,we held that resolution of that issue would not affect the outcome of the case.id.at.
we held that feres barred bon ftca action.among other facts,we noted that bon canoe was struck by a motor boat driven by another active duty serviceman and that the accident occurred on or very close to military property.id.at.we also emphasized that the government offered canoe rentals as a benefit of military service,and that unlike in johnson,only servicemen could take advantage of that benefit.id.lastly,we analyzed the nature of the activity and found that its entire scope was subject to military orders and discipline,which weighed heavily on the side of applying feres.id.at.we also distinguished johnson,where plaintiff was subject to military discipline only in the sense that members of the military are at all times subject to the orders of their commanding and superior officers.id.at.the dispositive difference for us was that bon was subject to military orders and regulations for the particular
