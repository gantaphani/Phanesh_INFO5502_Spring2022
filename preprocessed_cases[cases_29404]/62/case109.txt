frederick aikens,formerly a colonel in the north carolina army national guard,commenced this action against his former colleagues,adjutant general william ingram and lieutenant colonel peter von jess,alleging that they violated his fourth amendment rights by wrongfully intercepting,reading,and forwarding his while he was deployed in iraq.the district court dismissed the action without prejudice,concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because of colonel aikens failure to exhaust any available intramilitary remedies.the court entered a judgment of dismissal on september.
when colonel aikens filed his claim with the army board for correction of military records abcmr,the board determined that it could not provide him with the relief that he sought.afterwards,rather than filing a new action,aikens sought to reopen the judgment entered in this case by filing a motion for relief from judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court denied the motion,reasoning that colonel aikens had failed to establish the extraordinary circumstances necessary for granting relief from judgment under rule b.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion and affirm.
after frederick aikens was promoted to colonel in the north carolina army national guard,lieutenant colonel peter von jess was selected to replace him as executive officer of the rear operations center.shortly thereafter,colonel aikens began receiving complaints about von jess from subordinate field officers,leading aikens to discipline von jess in a july officer evaluation report.aikens reiterated that evaluation in a december evaluation report.adjutant general william ingram,who had selected von jess to replace aikens as executive officer,invalidated colonel aikens evaluation of von jess,which provoked colonel aikens to file a complaint for undue command influence with the department of the army inspector general.the inspector general substantiated aikens complaint.
according to aikens,when he was later deployed to kuwait in april,two of his subordinate officers,under instructions from general ingram,illegally monitored and intercepted his personal from a computer system they had set up for him.these contained personal correspondence,including negative statements about general ingram and others.
thereafter,general ingram ordered two separate investigations of aikens,one in december and another in february,both of which were later determined to be unsubstantiated.but colonel aikens was later notified by the inspector general that he was the subject of yet another investigation for a hostile command climate and inappropriate relations with women.these charges were substantiated in part by use of the intercepted.colonel aikens asserts that as a result he resigned from the north carolina national guard in june and that his resignation amounted to constructive discharge from the united states army.after his resignation,he was transferred to the retired reserve.
colonel aikens commenced this action against general ingram and lieutenant colonel von jess,contending that the defendants violated his fourth amendment rights and army regulation.general ingram and lieutenant colonel von jess filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because colonel aikens had failed to exhaust his military remedies through the abcmr.aikens responded,arguing that exhaustion was unnecessary because the abcmr could not address fourth amendment violations and that general ingram and lieutenant von jess were,in any event,state actors not subject to the abcmr.
the district court granted the motion without prejudice,directing aikens to exhaust his administrative remedies with the abcmr.aikens ingram,d.the court noted that colonel aikens complaint,in making his fourth amendment argument,relied on army regulation and that the abcmr has authority to correct an error or remove an injustice in plaintiff military record,id.at quoting a,and to reinstate plaintiff in a comparable active federal reserve status,restore his pay and order compensatory back pay,id.quoting williams wilson,cir alteration in original.the court reasoned 
at bottom,plaintiff seeks to rescind the resignation letter contained in his military record.in so doing,he relies on the fourth amendment and on army regulation.however,plaintiff failure to exhaust intraservice administrative remedies makes his federal claim s a nonjusticiable military controversy.
id.quoting williams,at alterations in original.the court added,however,that if the abcmr did not have jurisdiction,it would take no action and colonel aikens could return to federal court.id.at.on the other hand,if the abcmr had jurisdiction,then the court would be limited to conducting judicial review of the administrative proceeding.id.
colonel aikens subsequently pursued administrative remedies but was denied relief.the abcmr wrote colonel aikens,upon review it has been determined that your application and the remedy you seek is not within the purview of the abcmr therefore,it is returned without prejudice and without action being taken by this board.
on march,more than six months after the district court entered its judgment of dismissal,aikens filed a motion for relief from the judgment,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.he argued that the judgment should be reopened because he had complied with the court requirement that he exhaust his administrative remedies and he now might face a statute of limitations defense if he were to file a new action.the district court denied the motion on the ground that colonel aikens had failed to show the extraordinary circumstances warranting relief from the judgment under rule b.the court noted that its judgment of dismissal without prejudice anticipated that colonel aikens would return to federal court through the filing of a new action.in response to aikens suggestion that he might now be faced with a statute of limitations defense,the court observed that any limitations problem was the result of aikens tactical decisions not to seek administrative review earlier and to file this action late in the limitations period.
from the district court order denying aikens motion for relief from judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b,aikens filed this appeal.
federal rule of civil procedure b authorizes a district court to grant relief from a final judgment for five enumerated reasons or for any other reason that justifies relief.b while this catchall reason includes few textual limitations,its context requires that it may be invoked in only extraordinary circumstances when the reason for relief from judgment does not fall within the list of enumerated reasons given in rule b.see liljeberg health servs.acquisition.as chief justice rehnquist noted in his separate opinion in liljeberg 
rule b authorizes a district court,on motion and upon such terms as are just,to relieve a party from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for any reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.however,we have repeatedly instructed that only truly extraordinary circumstances will permit a party successfully to invoke the any other reason clause of b.this very strict interpretation of rule b is essential if the finality of judgments is to be preserved.
at rehnquist,dissenting citations omitted.to give rule b broad application would undermine numerous other rules that favor the finality of judgments,such as rule requiring that motions for new trial or to alter or amend a judgment be filed no later than days after the entry of judgment rule b providing that a court may not extend the time to file motions under rules b and d,b,b,d,and e,and b and federal rule of appellate procedure a requiring that appeals be filed within days after judgment.
we have thus addition to the explicitly stated requirements that the motion under rule b be filed on just terms and within a reasonable time that the party filing the motion have a meritorious claim or defense and that the party opposing the motion not be unfairly prejudiced by having the judgment set aside.see credit union admin.bd.gray,cir.and if the reason asserted for the rule b motion could have been addressed on appeal from the judgment,we have denied the motion as merely an inappropriate substitute for an appeal.see dowell state farm fire cas.auto.ins,cir holding that the voluntary,deliberate,free and untrammeled choice not to appeal the original judgment or order can not establish a basis for rule relief quoting ackermann united states,alteration in original in re burnley,cir a rule b motion may not substitute for a timely appeal.see generally charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,at ed collecting cases.
we review the district court ruling on a b motion for abuse of discretion,see browder,dep t of corrections of,credit union,at,and an appeal from denial of rule b relief does not bring up the underlying judgment for review,browder,at.
with these principles in hand,we now turn to colonel aikens contention that the district court abused its discretion in denying him relief from its prior judgment of dismissal under rule b.
aikens asserts that he demonstrated extraordinary circumstances because he satisfied the district court erroneous exhaustion requirement and the defendants likely will assert a limitations defense to any refiled claim.he maintains that his predicament was caused by the district court erroneous exhaustion requirement and that he is therefore entitled to relief from judgment.alternatively,he argues that the district court should have treated his rule b motion as a new filing of an action rather than denying it outright.on his observation that the defendants would likely have filed a statute of limitations defense had he filed a new action,aikens speculates 
appellees most certainly again will attempt to preclude a hearing on the merits by raising a limitations defense.a three year limitations period applies to aikens claims.appellees will argue that the limitations period began to run on november,when he became aware of the claims.aikens timely filed his case in the district court on april,tolling the limitations period with days left,but appellees will argue that the limitations period began to run again on september,when the district court dismissed the claim for failure to exhaust and that the limitations period never was tolled again.
citations omitted.
several difficulties about aikens argument become immediately apparent.first,if he was convinced that the district court erred in dismissing his action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies,aikens could have appealed,but he did not alternatively,he could have asked the district court to stay the action pending exhaustion of administrative remedies,but again he did not,failing to recognize that such a stay would be an appropriate exercise of the district court discretion.we have readily ordered a stay of an ongoing federal action pending exhaustion of administrative or state proceedings,particularly to avoid statute of limitations problems.see,traverso penn,cir requiring a stay rather than dismissal of action to allow for exhaustion of pending state proceedings suggs brannon,cir abstaining from claim due to ongoing state prosecution,but ordering a stay rather than dismissal because of statute of limitations problem stubbs foley,table,wl at cir.july,vacating dismissal for failure to exhaust and remanding with order to stay pending exhaustion due to concern about a potential statute of limitations problem.finally,after exhausting administrative remedies,aikens could have filed a new action,rather than seeking relief from judgment or claiming that the district court should have treated his rule b motion as a new action.in short,aikens posited predicament was as much the result of his management of the action as the result of the district court allegedly erroneous judgment of dismissal.
moreover,at oral argument,aikens counsel could do no more than speculate on whether he would indeed be faced with a legitimate statute of limitations defense.it is not clear when aikens cause of action accrued,and aikens counsel agreed that he did not know what tolling provisions might apply or how they might apply.
the district court concluded that aikens can not avoid the statute of limitations problem he now faces by deft use of rule b.stated simply,extraordinary circumstances do not arise due to limitations that otherwise apply,and a plaintiff can not use rule b to evade such time limitations.we agree.this issue,raised by procedural choices that aikens made,was addressed directly by the supreme court in ackermann,where the petitioner decided not to appeal for tactical reasons.as the court stated 
petitioner made a considered choice not to appeal,apparently because he did not feel that an appeal would prove to be worth what he thought was a required sacrifice of his home.his choice was a risk,but calculated and deliberate and such as follows a free choice.petitioner can not be relieved of such a choice because hindsight seems to indicate to him that his decision not to appeal was probably wrong there must be an end to litigation some day,and free,calculated,deliberate choices are not to be relieved from.
ackermann,at.
to the extent that aikens rests his argument on the district court earlier purportedly erroneous dismissal of his case,his remedy was to appeal,not to file a rule b motion.it is well established that rule b does not serve as a substitute for appeal.see dowell,at citing ackermann,at burnley,at.the office of appeal is designed to correct perceived errors,and any appeal is governed by an independent set of rules and time considerations.see,fed.a providing,with exceptions,that a notice of appeal must be filed within days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.
in the circumstances of this case,we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying aikens motion to reopen the judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b.
with sincere respect for my friends of the panel majority,i write separately in dissent.the bottom line of this dispute is that frederick aikens was the district court was whether the exhaustion of intraservice remedies was necessary before aikens could pursue his claim.although he was ultimately vindicated on the exhaustion issue,colonel aikens found himself in a predicament absent rule b relief from the judgment of dismissal,his claim was vulnerable to a statute of limitations defense.and this predicament was the direct result of the court mistake,not any misjudgment by aikens or his lawyer.nevertheless,the district now my colleagues of the aikens to be ineligible for rule b relief.because i would vacate and remand,i wholeheartedly dissent.
colonel aikens asserts that,while he was deployed to the middle east supporting operation iraqi freedom,his personal email was illegally intercepted and used to compel his retirement from the north carolina army national guard the ncarng after years of service.those responsible,according to aikens,were ncarng adjutant general william ingram,and lieutenant colonel peter von jess.consequently,on april,aikens filed his claim in the eastern district of north with more than seven months left in the applicable limitations that ingram and von jess had contravened his fourth amendment rights.over aikens vehement objection,the district court dismissed the claim on the mistaken belief that aikens was required,but had failed,to exhaust remedies with the army board for correction of military records the abcmr.see aikens ingram,d,the dismissal order.
generally speaking,if a plaintiff fails to exhaust available intraservice remedies,his federal claim against the military is a nonjusticiable military controversy.williams wilson,cir.significantly,however,we have recognized an exception to the exhaustion requirement if the outcome would predictably be futile,the doctrine of exhaustion will not apply.guerra scruggs,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here,colonel aikens contended in the district court that there were no available intraservice remedies and the outcome of an abcmr application would predictably be futile because the abcmr lacked jurisdiction to accord him any relief.see cfr e iii providing that an application may be returned without action if t he abcmr does not have jurisdiction to grant the requested relief guerra,f d at observing that the inability of the abcmr to give the plaintiff all the relief he seeks does not automatically excuse the failure to exhaust citing williams,at.aikens principally citation to numerous supporting his separation from the ncarng was a state matter for which no federal abcmr remedies existed.the court disagreed,however,analogizing to our decisions where some abcmr relief was thought to be available and thus exhaustion was deemed to be required.see aikens,d at.
once the district court issued its dismissal order,colonel aikens was faced with two obvious choices.first,he could proceed directly to the a far more suitable and definitive arbiter of its own jurisdiction than any federal court.see randall united states,cir recognizing that,to the extent federal courts may review abcmr decisions,such decisions can be set aside only if they are arbitrary,capricious,or not based on substantial evidence quoting chappell wallace.alternatively,aikens could appeal to this court and,if we affirmed the district court,end up before the abcmr anyway.aikens selected the obvious and more efficient option filing the abcmr application.four months later,just as aikens had predicted,the abcmr determined that it was powerless to act on aikens application because the relief sought therein was not within its purview.
this development brought colonel aikens to another crossroads.on the one hand,because his claim had been dismissed without prejudice,he could reassert it in a newly filed action.such a course was problematic,however,because ingram and von jess were asserting that the limitations period on the claim had already expired though aikens believed some tolling provisions might render the claim timely.on the other hand,aikens could seek relief from the dismissal order under rule b.the rule b path was attractive because it would place aikens in the same position he had occupied prior to the district court erroneous exhaustion the proponent of an indisputably timely claim.moreover,in its dismissal order,the court had explicitly assured aikens that,if his position was shown to be correct,and the abcmr does not have jurisdiction,he could return to federal court.aikens,d at.in these circumstances,aikens understandably chose to file his rule b motion.in so doing,he explained to the court that rule b relief was necessary to avoid any statute of limitations problem,and he reminded the court of its explicit assurance that,if he was proved right about the abcmr jurisdiction,he could return to the court.the crux of aikens position was he was entitled to rule b relief because the court had erred in ordering exhaustion of intraservice remedies and had thereby caused his limitations period predicament.
in assessing the rule b motion,the district court recognized that the statute of limitations on the claim had seemingly expired.see aikens ingram,slip op.at,the rule b order the court observed that,according to colonel aikens complaint,he discovered the facts underlying his cause of action on or about november.id.at.the court further observed that the statute of limitations seemingly began to run on that date,and it seemingly expired three years later,on november.id.at.obviously,if the limitations period ended on november,the court expired prior to not only the abcmr determination of february,but also before the erroneous dismissal order of september,
notwithstanding its supposition that colonel aikens was from his claim in a new action before the dismissal order was entered,the district court refused to vacate the judgment under rule b.the court justified its denial of relief by attributing the statute of limitations predicament to two tactical decisions with adverse affects sic made by aikens decision not to exhaust intraservice remedies before filing suit and his decision to wait to file suit over two years into the statute of limitations,leaving little time if a court were to determine that exhaustion was required.rule b order.even though aikens had accurately concluded that such an exhaustion effort was unnecessary because the abcmr lacked jurisdiction to accord relief,in the court view aikens should have foreseen that it would incorrectly rule to the contrary.and,having anticipated the court error,aikens should have acted to ensure that his claim would not thereby be rendered untimely.
to its credit,the panel majority has not ratified the district court surprising position.but the majority nevertheless blames colonel aikens and his lawyer for other faulty strategic choices,including their decisions to first proceed directly to the abcmr rather than appealing to this court,and to file the rule b motion in lieu of initiating a new civil action.significantly,however,these choices were not the source of aikens statute of limitations quandary,nor would different tactical decisions necessarily have solved the timeliness problem.in these circumstances,i can not join the panel majority in affirming the denial of rule b relief.
simply put,the district court abused its discretion in rejecting colonel aikens request for rule b relief.indeed,none of the reasons relied on by the district court and the panel majority for their denial of such relief can withstand scrutiny.and,to make matters worse,their hang on condemning colonel aikens for losing an unwinnable game of gotcha discredit our system of justice.
in pursuing relief,colonel aikens has specifically invoked clause of rule b,which authorizes a court to relieve a party from a final judgment for any other reason not spelled out in clauses that justifies relief.of course,to be entitled to rule b relief,the movant must demonstrate extraordinary circumstances.see valero terrestrial paige,cir explaining that the difference between rule b and rules b is that extraordinary circumstances are required to bring the rule b motion within the other reason language of that rule internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.significantly,however,our court has had no difficulty recognizing the existence of extraordinary circumstances district court erroneously issued the underlying judgment.see white investors mgmt,cir compton alton steamship,cir 
in white,a dispute over the amount due the plaintiff on a stock redemption,the district court had awarded summary judgment to the defendant without notice and without a hearing,even though there was an outstanding order issued by the magistrate judge compelling the defendant to produce a critical document in the determination of the case.see at.we reversed the court denial of rule b relief,explaining 
when the court overlooks the dispositive issue in a case and proceeds to decide a case summarily before discovery is concluded and before an order of discovery has been complied with,there has been a mistake and inadvertence and one that works an injustice.rule b especially as amended in by the addition of b clearly covers the plaintiff motion to vacate the summary judgment entered here.

in seeking appellate relief,colonel aikens also relies on similarly decided rule b decisions from other jurisdictions,specifically involving erroneous dismissals for failure to exhaust.see thompson bell,cir whitmore avery.in thompson,the district court had dismissed several of the petitioner federal habeas claims because,in prior state proceedings,he had failed to seek discretionary review of those claims in the supreme court of tennessee.see at.following the tennessee supreme court promulgation of a rule clarifying that state habeas petitioners need not appeal to that court to exhaust their claims,the thompson petitioner unsuccessfully moved in the district court for rule b relief from its dismissal order.see id.the sixth circuit reversed the denial of the clause motion,however,concluding that the promulgation of the new tennessee supreme court rule was an extraordinary circumstance warranting such relief.see id.at.notably,the sixth circuit distinguished thompson from gonzalez crosby,wherein the supreme court deemed clause relief inappropriate based on a recent change in federal decisional law regarding the interpretation of a federal habeas procedural statute.the thompson court explained that,unlike the change in federal law in gonzalez,the change in tennessee state law was an extraordinary circumstance because refusing to recognize it would disserve comity interests by ignoring the state court view of its own law.thompson,at internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted.
finally,in whitmore,after dismissing the petitioner federal habeas claim for failure to exhaust state remedies,the district court itself recognized that it had made a mistake worthy of rule b relief.see at.the court observed,inter alia,in terms that are strikingly applicable here,that the petitioner could not have followed my instructions and exhausted his remedies,because the claim was not one that could be exhausted or that federal law requires to be exhausted.id.at.accordingly,the court concluded that this is the type of case that warrants the exceptional relief contemplated by rule b.id.
likewise,the extraordinary circumstances demonstrably present here demand that colonel aikens be afforded rule b relief from the district court erroneous dismissal order.as aikens has aptly emphasized,
appellees possibly aikens privacy by monitoring and intercepting his,while he was serving his country in a combat zone,in violation of the fourth amendment and.aikens has yet to be heard on the merits of his claims and,without relief,may never be.aikens first timely attempt to have his case heard was dismissed for failure to exhaust intraservice remedies,despite the fact that no intraservice remedies were available.his second attempt,this time before the abcmr,as directed by the district court,was rejected because,as aikens predicted,the abcmr lacks authority to provide the relief aikens seeks.aikens third attempt,to revive his first lawsuit through rule b after exhausting intraservice remedies with the abcmr as required by the district court,was denied.aikens now faces a statute of limitations defense to any future attempt to file a new lawsuit.these circumstances are exceptional.
reply br.of appellant footnote omitted.indeed,in these circumstances,the court has committed a mistake that works an injustice,see white,at,and fundamental fairness and considerations of justice command that the judgment be vacated,see compton,at.notably,in addition to accomplishing justice for aikens,rule b relief would serve comity interests by recognizing that the abcmr is entitled to define its own jurisdiction.thompson,at concluding that rule b relief furthered comity interests by recognizing and accepting the state court view of its own habeas corpus law internal quotation marks omitted.
to be sure,not all mistakes made by a court are sufficient to warrant rule b relief.we have admonished that w here the motion is nothing more than a request that the district court change its mind,it is not authorized by rule b.united states williams,cir.furthermore,we have said that we may not review the merits of the underlying order in reviewing the denial of rule b relief.mlc,llc town of pines,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here,however,colonel aikens was not asking the district court to change its mind about its exhaustion ruling,or seeking our independent review of the merits of the dismissal order.rather,he is asking for the simple recognition,based on the abcmr assessment of its jurisdiction,of the fact that the district court itself erred in concluding that he was required to exhaust intraservice remedies.these extraordinary circumstances warrant rule b relief 
neither the district court nor the panel majority disputes that the court mistake in issuing the erroneous dismissal order could entitle colonel aikens to rule b relief.rather,they largely ignore the court culpability for the statute of limitations predicament and then point the finger at aikens and his lawyer for poor strategic decisions.i theories in turn.
as explained above,the district court blamed colonel aikens for failing to foresee the erroneous dismissal order and then taking action,spurred by such foresight,to ensure the timeliness of his claim.in the court view,aikens needed only to have exhausted remedies with the abcmr before filing suit within the statute of limitations.he did not and can not now find comfort within rule b.rule b order.this premise for denying clause relief is fundamentally flawed as a matter of fact and law.
first of all,the district court failed to acknowledge its primary role in creating the statute of limitations predicament.at the time of the dismissal order,colonel aikens zealously objected to the proposition that abcmr remedies were available and thus had to be exhausted.and the court itself recognized the possibility that its exhaustion ruling might be wrong,assuring aikens that if his position was correct,and the abcmr does not have jurisdiction,he could return to federal court.aikens,d at.once his position had been validated by the abcmr,aikens sought to accept the court invitation to return to federal court,filing his rule b motion rather than a new action because of the potential statute of limitations problem.in disposing of the rule b motion,however,the court made a turn.it disclaimed ever implying that plaintiff could return to court in this action.rule b order.rather,according to the court,it was making the unremarkable observation that if the abcmr determined that it lacked jurisdiction,nothing in the court dismissal would prevent plaintiff from filing a new action against ingram and von jess.id.in the very next paragraph of the rule b order,however,the court contradicted its assertion that the dismissal order did not foreclose a new action,recognizing that the statute of limitations on aikens claim had likely expired well before the dismissal order was even entered.see id.at.surprisingly,the court blamed aikens,rather than itself,for creating the statute of limitations issue.as the court would have it,the timeliness problem resulted from aikens failure to anticipate the erroneous dismissal order,and not from the court own mistake.
there is simply no basis,however,for the district court theory that colonel aikens should have foreseen the erroneous dismissal order and proceeded accordingly.although the court found that aikens and his lawyer must have known that aikens would face the abcmr exhaustion issue in his case,rule b order,that finding stops well short of the proposition that aikens should have expected the court to erroneously dispose of that issue and indeed,once aikens assessed the exhaustion issue,he the abcmr was powerless to award him relief.
the district court also points out that,in dismissing colonel aikens claim for failure to exhaust intraservice remedies,it acted in accordance with a veritable wall of fourth circuit precedent requiring such exhaustion.rule b order.in this regard,the court suggests that its dismissal order was perhaps goes so far as to suggest that it did not actually err in its exhaustion ruling a proposition pursued on appeal by ingram and von jess.see br.of appellees contending that there can be no rule b relief premised on a mistake made by the court,because the court conclusion that aikens was required to exhaust his intraservice administrative remedies was correct under fourth circuit precedent.
notwithstanding our court precedent,however,colonel aikens correctly concluded that he could not obtain relief from the legal conclusion confirmed by the abcmr itself.indeed,a federal court view of the abcmr jurisdiction is
