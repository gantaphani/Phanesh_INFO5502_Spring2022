a group of protestant navy chaplains sued the navy,alleging that the navy operation of its retirement system discriminates in favor of catholic chaplains in violation of the establishment clause.but the plaintiffs do not claim that the navy actually discriminated against any of them.we conclude that plaintiffs lack standing to bring this claim,and we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
the navy maintains a chaplain corps of commissioned navy officers to meet the spiritual needs of those who serve in the navy and their families.like other officers,chaplains are subject to military regulations with respect to hiring,promotion,and retirement.
the navy divides its chaplains into four,liturgical protestant,protestant,and special worship.as we explained in a previous opinion in this litigation,liturgical protestant includes protestant denominations that follow an established liturgy in worship services and practice infant baptism,such as lutheran,episcopal,methodist,presbyterian,and congregational.chaplaincy of full gospel churches england,chaplaincy.protestant includes protestant denominations that do not follow a formal liturgy in worship services and that baptize at the age of reason,such as baptist,evangelical,pentecostal,and charismatic.id.at.the special worship category refers to other religious faiths,both christian and,and it includes jewish,christian science,adventist,mormon,buddhist,hindu,muslim,jehovah witness,and unitarian.id.at.
plaintiffs are protestant navy chaplains,both current and retired plaintiffs filed suit,alleging that the navy discriminates in favor of catholic chaplains in certain aspects of its retirement system.see in re navy chaplaincy,d.plaintiffs also sought a preliminary injunction.
the district court initially denied plaintiffs preliminary injunction motion,finding that the chaplains had not shown the necessary irreparable injury to support a preliminary injunction.see adair england,slip op.at.on appeal,this court reversed,explaining that,for purposes of a preliminary injunction,the allegation of an establishment clause violation itself demonstrates sufficient harm to satisfy the irreparable injury prong of the preliminary injunction,of course,that the party has standing to allege the violation in the first place.see chaplaincy,at.the court therefore vacated the denial of a preliminary injunction and remanded for the district court to consider the remaining factors in the preliminary injunction analysis,including likelihood of success on the merits.see id.at.
on remand,in a opinion,the district court concluded that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring this claim.this appeal followed.
article iii of the constitution limits the judicial power to deciding cases and controversies.one of the controlling elements in the definition of a case or controversy under article iii is standing.hein freedom from religion foundation,d internal quotation marks and alteration omitted the three factors establishing the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing are well established.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.first and most relevant here is a plaintiff must have suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest that is i concrete and particularized rather than abstract or generalized,and ii actual or imminent rather than remote,speculative,conjectural or hypothetical.id.internal quotation marks omitted see also pub.citizen,highway traffic safety.second is causation the asserted injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant.lujan,at.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.third is redressability it must be likely that a favorable decision by the court would redress the plaintiff injury.id.at.
t he law of art.iii standing is built on a single basic idea of separation of powers.allen wright,d.the doctrine is founded in concern about the properly of the courts in a democratic society.warth seldin,d.the federal courts are not empowered to seek out and strike down any governmental act that they deem to be repugnant to the constitution.hein.at.vindicating the public interest including the public interest in government observance of the constitution and laws is the function of congress and the chief executive.lujan,at.see also valley forge christian coll.americans united for separation of church state,d.
those critical and bedrock principles of separation of powers inform our approach to plaintiffs claim.
in reviewing the standing question,we must be careful not to decide the questions on the merits for or against the plaintiff,and must therefore assume that on the merits the plaintiffs would be successful in their claims.city of waukesha epa.for purposes of our analysis in this case,we therefore must assume arguendo that the navy operation of its retirement system favors catholic chaplains and disfavors protestant chaplains in violation of the clearest command of the establishment clause that one religious denomination can not be officially preferred over another.larson valente,d.even assuming that plaintiffs allegations are accurate,however,they do not have standing to bring this claim against the navy because they have not sufficiently demonstrated their own.
if plaintiffs had alleged that the navy discriminated against them on account of their religion,plaintiffs would have alleged a concrete and particularized harm sufficient to constitute for standing purposes.but plaintiffs have conceded that they themselves did not suffer employment discrimination on account of their religion.they have conceded that the navy did not deny them any benefits or opportunities on account of their religion.see in re navy chaplaincy,d.rather,they suggest that other chaplains suffered such discrimination.
plaintiffs argue that they nonetheless have standing for either of two reasons i they are taxpayers who object to the navy allegedly discriminatory operation of its chaplaincy program,or ii they have been subjected to the navy message of religious preference as a result of the navy running a retirement system that favors catholic chaplains.we disagree.because plaintiffs claim does not fit within the narrow confines of establishment clause taxpayer standing permitted by flast cohen,d,they do not have standing as taxpayers.see hein freedom from religion foundation,d.nor do plaintiffs have standing based on their exposure to the navy alleged message of religious preference.
as the supreme court has repeatedly held,a taxpayer interest in ensuring that appropriated funds are spent in accordance with the constitution does not suffice to confer article iii standing.see hein.at.back in frothingham mellon,taxpayers sued the government,arguing that the maternity act of improperly invaded powers reserved to states by the tenth amendment.the supreme court rejected taxpayer standing in that case the administration of any statute,likely to produce additional taxation to be imposed upon a vast number of taxpayers,the extent of whose several liability is indefinite and constantly changing,is essentially a matter of public and not of individual concern.if one taxpayer may champion and litigate such a cause,then every other taxpayer may do the same id.at.see also doremus bd.of educ.of hawthorne.
in,years after frothingham,the supreme court carved out a narrow exception to the general constitutional bar on taxpayer suits the court held that federal taxpayers had standing to bring an establishment clause challenge to federal financing for parochial schools.see flast.but according to flast,taxpayers may bring an establishment clause challenge only when they challenge legislation passed pursuant to the taxing and spending clause in article i,of the constitution.see id.at.
the court has subsequently made clear that flast is a very narrow exception to the general bar against taxpayer standing.in valley forge,for example,the plaintiffs argued that the government violated the establishment clause when it transferred a tract of surplus property to a christian college.valley forge christian coll.americans united for separation of church state,d internal quotation marks omitted.the court found that the plaintiffs,a group composed of taxpayer members,did not have standing both because the challenged action was executive rather than legislative and because the property transfer was an exercise of executive authority pursuant to legislation passed under the property clause in article iv,of the constitution rather than the taxing and spending clause in article i.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
in bowen kendrick,the supreme court allowed a group of federal taxpayers to challenge the adolescent family life act,a statute appropriating funds for religious organizations,among others,to fight teen pregnancy,d.the court found that plaintiffs claim challenged a program expressly authorized by congress under the taxing and spending power,thus fitting within flast.id.at.the key to bowen conclusion,as the court has subsequently explained,was that the statute was at heart a program of disbursement of funds pursuant to congress taxing and spending powers and that plaintiffs claims were concerned with the expenditure of funds pursuant to the afla statutory mandate.hein.at quoting bowen,at.emphasis omitted.
in its recent decision in hein,the court declined to expand flast to encompass discretionary executive branch spending because almost all executive branch activity is ultimately funded by some congressional appropriation,extending the flast exception to purely executive expenditures would effectively subject every federal it a conference,proclamation or establishment clause challenge by any taxpayer in federal court.id.at.although hein did not eliminate the flast exception to the bar against taxpayer standing,the case forcefully emphasized the exception extremely limited contours it is significant that,in the four decades since its creation,the flast exception has largely been confined to its facts.id.at.as hein explained,the court has limited the expansion of federal taxpayer and citizen standing in the absence of specific statutory authorization to an outer boundary drawn by the results in flast.id.at internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted 
in this case,plaintiffs claim does not fit within the narrow flast exception.no legislative enactment expressly authorizes or appropriates funds for the navy to favor catholic chaplains in its retirement system.plaintiffs cite,for example,the statutes establishing the navy chaplain corps,but those statutes make no reference to denominational category,only to chaplains generally.see.and plaintiffs,who themselves are chaplains,obviously do not contend that congressional legislation establishing the navy chaplaincy itself violates the establishment clause they merely want the navy to operate the chaplain corps differently.katcoff marsh,cir approving military chaplaincy program.
as in hein,the challenged expenditures salary and benefits allegedly provided to catholic chaplains were not expressly authorized or mandated by any specific congressional enactment.hein.at.indeed,plaintiffs contend that the chaplain corps is being operated by the navy in contravention of the law,not in accordance with the law.see plaintiffs br.appellees have not followed either the law or the dod regulations.under the supreme court precedents,that contention directly undermines any claim to taxpayer standing.in sum,plaintiffs do not have standing as taxpayers.
plaintiffs alternatively contend that they have standing because establishment clause injury flows from the forbidden messages of preference or disapproval inherent in the navy denominational preference.plaintiffs br.in so arguing,they rely primarily on this court decision in chaplaincy,which explained that for the purposes of a preliminary injunction,the mere allegation of an establishment clause violation is always sufficient to show irreparable harm.chaplaincy of full gospel churches england.plaintiffs claim that because their allegations demonstrate irreparable injury for preliminary injunction purposes,they have necessarily shown for standing purposes.
but the court in chaplaincy merely held that the allegation of an establishment clause violation is sufficient to satisfy the irreparable harm prong of the preliminary injunction that a party has standing to allege such a violation.see id.at.a per se rule defining automatic for every plaintiff who claims an establishment clause plaintiffs strain to find in the chaplaincy run counter to decades of settled jurisprudence setting forth the requirements for standing in establishment clause cases.jurisdictional requirements are not disposed of so easily,and the court in chaplaincy did not purport to make the sweeping change attributed to it by plaintiffs.
apart from citing chaplaincy,plaintiffs also claim from their being subjected to the message of religious preference conveyed by the navy allegedly preferential retirement program for catholic chaplains.the program,they say,makes them feel like citizens within the navy chaplaincy even if they themselves have not suffered discrimination on account of their religion.
as the supreme court has often stated,mere personal offense to government action does not give rise to standing to sue.allen wright,d see also lujan defenders of wildlife,d.by the mere bringing of his suit,every plaintiff demonstrates his belief that a favorable judgment will make him happier.but although a suitor may derive great comfort and joy from knowing that the government is following constitutional imperatives,that psychic satisfaction is not an acceptable article iii remedy because it does not redress a cognizable article iii injury.steel citizens for a better env t,d.recognition of standing in such circumstances would transform the federal courts into no more than a vehicle for the vindication of the value interests of concerned bystanders.allen,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
plaintiffs respond that their claim is similar to religious display and prayer cases where courts have found or at least apparently assumed standing.see,mccreary county aclu,d ten commandments displays that were readily visible to citizens conducting civic business internal quotation marks omitted van orden perry,d ten commandments display on the grounds of the texas state capitol that petitioner frequently encountered county of allegheny aclu,d crèche display in county courthouse and menorah display outside building suhre haywood county,cir ten commandments display in county courtroom noting that display cases are particularized subclass of establishment clause standing jurisprudence see also lee weisman,d governmental prayer at school graduation marsh chambers,d daily prayer at opening of state legislature sch.dist.of abington township schempp,d daily bible reading in class engel vitale,d official state prayer in class.
these supreme court cases do not all directly discuss the standing issue.it is a rule that cases in which jurisdiction is assumed sub silentio are not binding authority for the proposition that jurisdiction exists.john doe,dea,internal quotation marks omitted.in any event,accepting those cases as precedents on standing we nonetheless find significant differences between plaintiffs case and the religious display and prayer cases.in the religious display and prayer cases,the government was actively and directly communicating a religious message through religious words or religious other words,it was engaging in religious speech that was observed,read,or heard by the plaintiffs in those cases.here,by contrast,the navy is not communicating a religious message through religious words or religious symbols.plaintiffs objection here is more akin to the objection to the property transfer in valley forge,where the court stated that the plaintiffs failed to identify any personal injury suffered by them as a consequence of the alleged constitutional error,other than the psychological consequence presumably produced by observation of conduct with which one disagrees.that is not an injury sufficient to confer standing under art.iii,even though the disagreement is phrased in constitutional terms.valley forge,at.emphasis added and omitted see also suhre,at quoting valley forge and stating a mere abstract objection to unconstitutional conduct is not sufficient to confer standing.
plaintiffs argument would extend the religious display and prayer cases in a significant and unprecedented manner and eviscerate standing limitations.under plaintiffs theory,every government action that allegedly violates the establishment clause could be as a governmental message promoting religion.and therefore everyone who becomes aware of the message would have standing to sue.the neighbors in valley forge,the hotel workers at a conference for organizations in hein,the list goes could have obtained standing to sue simply by targeting not the government action,but rather the government alleged message of religious preference communicated through that action.indeed,as plaintiffs counsel acknowledged at oral argument,under plaintiffs standing theory any recipient of the navy message in this case,including the judges on this panel,would have standing to bring suit challenging the allegedly discriminatory chaplain corps.oral arg.tr.at.the jurisdictional requirements of article iii are not so manipulable.they do not allow anyone who becomes aware of a government action that allegedly violates the establishment clause to sue over it on the ground that they are offended by the allegedly unconstitutional message communicated by that action.in the government employment context at issue here,it thus comes as no surprise that neither plaintiffs nor the dissent has cited any case holding that a plaintiff can maintain a religious employment discrimination suit under the religion clauses when complaining about employment discrimination suffered by others,not by the plaintiff himself or herself.we think the reason for the dearth of precedent is evident when plaintiffs are not themselves affected by a government action except through their abstract offense at the message allegedly conveyed by that action,they have not shown to bring an establishment clause claim,at least outside the distinct context of the religious display and prayer cases.
to be sure,we recognize that plaintiffs creative analogy to the religious display and prayer cases has some surface logic.but the implications of plaintiffs theory for standing doctrine are quite radical plaintiffs seek to use the religious display and prayer cases to wedge open the courthouse doors to a wide range of plaintiffs alleging establishment clause violations who were previously barred by bedrock standing that are essential to preserving the separation of powers and limited judicial role mandated by the constitution.we decline the invitation to transform establishment clause standing doctrine in this way.what the supreme court said last year in hein applies just as well to plaintiffs reliance on the religious display and prayer cases here it is a necessary concomitant of the doctrine of stare decisis that a precedent is not always expanded to the limit of its logic.hein.at.
we affirm the judgment of the district court.

as members of protestant churches and fellowships,appellants assert that the navy has singled out the catholic faith as the preferred religious tradition in its chaplain corps by choosing over several decades to allow only catholic chaplains to serve beyond the required separation dates this sends a message of denominational preference for catholics and marginalization for adherents,causing appellants to suffer psychological harm while serving as chaplains.compl,e.by endowing naval officer status in a preferential manner upon the representatives of a particular type of religious ministry who then,as part of their naval service duties,use words and symbols to serve their religious cause,the navy allegedly has take n sides in a religious matter,effectively discriminating in favor of one religion view,commack.kosher meats,weiss,cir,of the type of religious ministry that is most appropriate to serve the religious needs of sailors,in re england.see,mccreary county,at.kiryas joel,at.

to reach the opposite conclusion,the court ignores both the nature of appellants charge and binding precedent.first,the court describes the charge as if it concerns only religious discrimination in traditional monetary terms,such as retirement benefits not denied to appellants or discrimination suffered by others.see op.at.yet appellants do not so delimit their charge rather,they allege that the navy program violates the establishment clause by creating a government religious preference,see chaplaincy,at appellants standing thus does not hinge upon the mistreatment of any individual chaplain but upon the navy alleged endorsement of a preference for another religious faith that directly affects them.the court narrow focus ignores the constitution requirement that,in assessing constitutional injury,we keep in mind the myriad,subtle ways in which establishment clause values can be eroded,and that in addition to the mistreatment of an individual,we must guard against other different,yet equally important,constitutional injuries,such as the unconstitutional implementation of a government policy.santa fe indep.sch.dist.doe,d quoting lynch,at,concurring.
second,the court states that mere personal offense or emotional injury is never enough for article iii injury,op.at,but that is not the law as the supreme court acknowledged in association of data processing service organizations,camp,d,a person may have a spiritual stake in first amendment values sufficient to give standing to raise issues concerning the establishment clause if directly affected by the challenged governmental practice,id.at.citing schempp,d see valley forge,at.later,in allen,at,while holding that a plaintiff alleging an equal protection violation generally must claim a personal denial of equal treatment,the supreme court observed that t here can be no doubt that noneconomic injury such as stigmatizing injury is one of the most serious consequences of discriminatory government action and is sufficient in some circumstances to support standing.in fact,the supreme court has reached the merits in numerous establishment clause cases where mere personal offense,op.at,resulting from a plaintiff connection to a challenged practice appears to have provided the main possible injury to ground standing as the fourth circuit has observed 
t he establishment clause plaintiff is not likely to suffer physical injury or pecuniary loss.rather the spiritual,beliefs of the plaintiffs are often most directly affected by an alleged establishment of religion.accordingly,rules of standing recognize that noneconomic or intangible injury may suffice to make an establishment clause claim justiciable.

equally problematic is the court attempt to contrast appellants case with those where the government has,in the court words,actively and directly communicat ed a religious message through religious words or religious symbols,op.at.establishment clause precedent is not so conveniently cabined into the narrow circumstances described by the court,where the government itself engag ed in religious speech,id.for one thing,the government need not intentionally favor one religious denomination over another in order to violate the establishment clause if its action has such an effect when considering whether a government action has the effect of conveying a denominational endorsement,t he question of governmental neutrality is not concluded by the observation that a policy on its face makes no discrimination between religions.gillette united states,d.equally important,there also is no requirement that the government go so far as to use religious words or religious symbols,op.at,to establish an unconstitutional religious endorsement.rather,the establishment clause forbids subtle departures from neutrality,religious gerrymanders,as well as obvious abuses.gillette,at.quoting walz tax comm n,d harlan,concurring.and,the most basic command of the establishment to prefer some religions and thereby some approaches to indoctrinating religion to others does not apply only to a government action such as a prayer or ceremony that explicitly adopts a denomination chosen religious symbols,but also to other action taken in the usual course of government regulation or operation.of great falls nlrb,citing larson valente,d see,royal joint venture,at littlefield forney indep.sch,cir.thus,government action that draws a line around a religious denomination in a community can send a symbolic message of preference that needs no words just as easily as the government direct presentation of a religious symbol.see,kiryas joel,at.citing larkin,at.
the court ignores all of this precedent in adopting the novel conception that appellants are not harmed for purposes of standing under the establishment clause unless the navy itself directly uses religious words or symbols as occurred in the religious display cases,op.at.rather than distinguish precedent in a reasoned manner,the court holding is the assertion that w hen plaintiffs are not themselves affected by a government action except through their abstract offense at the message allegedly conveyed by that action,they have not shown to bring an establishment clause claim,at least outside the distinct context of the religious display and prayer cases.id.at emphasis in original.yet,t he establishment clause,at the very least,prohibits government from appearing to take a position on questions of religious belief or from making adherence to a religion relevant in any way to a person standing in the community,county of allegheny,at.quoting lynch,at,concurring emphasis added,and so directs the government to avoid a practice that may appear to the nonbeliever or dissenter to be an attempt to employ the machinery of the government to enforce a religious orthodoxy,lee,at.emphasis added.moreover,when a court reaches the merits i n cases involving government participation in a religious activity such as the employment of navy chaplains as religious ministry question is whether an objective observer would perceive its action as a governmental endorsement of religion.santa fe indep.sch,at.quotation marks omitted.even so secular an act as the grant of a copyright,this court held,ran aground because providing exceptional copyright benefits to a particular religious institution bestowed upon the church symbolic recognition as guardian of the contested text,with consequent practical advantages,and ha d the unmistakable effect of advancing the church cause.united christian scientists,at.although the religious institution alone used religious words and symbols,the government unusual treatment of one church unequivocally and unqualifiedly endorsed it as first interpreter and guardian of th e copyrighted work.id.at see also commack,at.

in any event,whether the navy program sends a prohibited message is a merits question that is not before the court,see info.handling,def.automated printing.of course,the court premature determination of this issue may arise from the realization that if a personally observed religious message causes harm there would be traditional standing,as the navy counsel acknowledged,oral arg.tr.at see also id.at.at this point in the proceedings in determining article iii standing,however,the court must assume the merits of appellants charge that the navy program d oes,in fact,convey a message of denominational preference directly harming them as chaplains.vasquez,at see warth,at.info.handling,at city of waukesha epa.

accordingly,i would reverse the denial of the motion for a preliminary injunction and leave for the district court to determine upon remand whether appellants have otherwise met the requirements for obtaining a preliminary injunction,see chaplaincy,at,and respectfully dissent.because appellants have article iii standing,i do not reach the question whether they also have taxpayer standing.

to the extent the court seeks to avoid this precedent by interpreting a footnote in chaplaincy to indicate that the court was presupposing appellants standing,op.at,and thus addressing the request for injunctive relief without satisfying itself that appellants had standing,its approach is contrary both to the principle in steel,at,and to the more natural reading of the footnote as merely recognizing,as this court has done before,that this prong of the preliminary injunction inquiry and the entirety of the article iii standing inquiry overlap somewhat,but are not coextensive,see taylor,at.
according to appellants,the program has three parts illegal appointments to active duty through age waivers for catholic clergy,the consequent illegal continuation of such clergy as chaplains to the age of,and the eventual illegal transfer of such clergy to the retired reserve and subsequent recall to active duty as designated reservists.the program is designed in part to allow catholic chaplains who have reached their statutory separation age to continue to serve until they have completed twenty years of service and become eligible for pensions.see,see also chaplaincy,at.at the time appellants filed their complaints,the age limit for the appointment of chaplains,like other officers,was,see a while this provision is no longer applicable to chaplains,id.at d as amended by ronald reagan national defense authorization act for fiscal year,stat,the statutory separation age for chaplains and other officers remains in effect.
