background 
on july,the agency determined that smith could not work in his position as a welder because a disability prevented him from wearing required hearing protection.over the next several months,smith engaged in a prolonged process with the agency seeking to have the agency recognize his condition as an occupational injury and secure assignment to a position.smith was willing and able to work a light duty position that did not require the use of hearing protective equipment but was repeatedly told no such position existed.see decision,slip op.at.
on april,smith filed a mixed case appeal to the board new york regional office in his initial complaint,smith alleged that he was constructively suspended as of july,due to a series of actions and inactions resulting in a total failure on the part of the agency to provide him with any consistent information about his employment status and to provide him with reasonable accommodation for his handicap appropriate compensation.statement of appellant in support of appeal to,at april.smith alleged that these actions violated his due process rights by placing him on enforced leave for more than fourteen days without the proper procedural requirements.id.at.smith also alleged that the actions stated a claim for disability discrimination under,inter alia,the americans with disabilities act ada because the agency refused to acknowledge that his disability was and had refused to place him in a position accommodating his disability.id.at.
in an initial decision,the administrative judge found that smith had been on enforced leave for more than fourteen days beginning on july,conferring the board with jurisdiction over his appeal.decision,slip op.at t he appellant absences were not voluntary and were a single,continuing action stemming from the problem relating to hearing protective equipment.on the discrimination issue,the administrative judge held that smith had not proven his claim because he failed to prove that a suitable position was available to accommodate his disability during the time of his involuntary suspension,slip op.at.regarding the due process argument however,the administrative judge agreed with smith,finding that the agency had deprived him of required procedural protections in enacting the suspension,slip op.at.therefore,the administrative judge ordered the agency to cancel smith suspension and provide back pay from july,the date his suspension began,slip op.at.
in response to this order,the agency cancelled smith suspension,reinstated him to his previous position as welder,and paid him back pay from july,through the date of his reinstatement.shortly thereafter,on may,the agency proposed smith removal based on a permanent disability.as one basis for the removal,the agency cited smith inability to perform his position as a welder because he could not wear the required hearing protection,the very disability which formed the basis of smith disability claim.the agency also cited the lack of any vacancy to which smith could be reassigned.smith separation became effective june.
on april,smith appealed the board decision that the agency actions did not constitute disability discrimination to the eeoc following proceedings lasting over six years,the eeoc disagreed with the board finding,concluding that the agency had indeed engaged in disability discrimination.eeoc decision,slip op.at.the eeoc found that the position of material expediter became available in november and that the agency failure to assign smith to this position as a reasonable accommodation was discrimination in violation of the ada.id.slip op.at.because the eeoc disagreed with the board finding regarding the existence of discrimination,it referred the case back to the board for further consideration.id.
thereafter,the board concurred and adopted the eeoc decision.order,slip op.at holding that that board could not disagree with the eeoc finding where,as here,the eeoc decision rested solely on an interpretation of discrimination law.the board ordered the agency to carry out eeoc decision and to pay the appellant the correct amount of back pay,interest on back pay,and other benefits under the back pay act.id.the agency was also ordered to notify smith once it believed it had fully complied with the order,at which point smith could file a petition for enforcement with the administrative judge if he believed that the agency had not fully complied,slip op.at.
based on the order,smith sought relief from the agency.the agency responded on august,that it believed it was already in full compliance with the order.the agency first stated that it was not required to restore smith to the material expediter wg position 
the appellant separated from federal service effective june.the appellant did not file an appeal or complaint regarding the separation,and now the time to pursue same has expired.therefore the appellant period of entitlement for restoration is from november,thru june,a period which has expired therefore the agency obligations as regards restoration to the position material expediter have been fulfilled.
the agency then stated that it had also already complied with the order regarding the payment of any back pay due smith 
the agency has complied with all back pay requirements ordered by the mspb the case giving rise to the eeoc decision is the constructive suspension effective july,which was reversed by the mspb on april.that decision was not appealed by the agency,which awarded full back pay under cfr for the position of welder.
because the agency had already paid smith from july,the date the constructive suspension began,to june,the date smith was removed from the agency,the agency asserted that nothing more was due.id.
smith petitioned the board for enforcement of its order,arguing that if the agency had not,as the eeoc and board concluded,discriminated by refusing to reassign him to the open material expediter position in november,his employment would not have been terminated in june by reason of medical disqualification for the welder position.therefore,smith asserted that he was entitled to compensation under the back pay act from november,the date of the discrimination,through at least december,the date that the agency claims the material expediter position was abolished due to a.
the administrative judge denied smith petition for enforcement holding that smith was not entitled to compensation after june,the effective date of his removal.smith dep t of army,slip.op.at,decision.the administrative judge stated that providing relief beyond the date of removal would permit the appellant to use enforcement proceedings to obtain relief as to a separate agency action,his unappealed removal.id.because the agency had paid smith compensation through his removal date,the administrative judge reasoned,no further relief was due,slip op.at.the board denied smith petition for review making the administrative judge denial of the petition for enforcement the final decision of the board.final order,slip op.at.
smith timely appealed to this court.as this appeal comes from a final order of the board,this court has jurisdiction under a.

the board decision at issue here is the denial of smith petition for enforcement of the order requiring the agency to carry out the eeoc decision finding disability discrimination and provide him with back pay under the back pay act.the board is required to ensure agency compliance with its orders.a the merit systems protection board shall order any federal agency or employee to comply with any order or decision issued by the board and enforce compliance with any such order.the board enforcement power is and functions to ensure that employees are returned to the status quo ante upon reversal of the agency action.this includes the authority to resolve disputes over back pay.crippen postal,see also kerr endowment for the arts,the inclusion of a was meant to be a broad grant of enforcement power.
here,the board order required the agency to carry out eeoc decision and pay the appellant the correct amount of back pay,interest on back pay,and other benefits under the back pay act.order,slip op.at.in its denial of the petition for enforcement,the board found that smith could not receive back pay beyond the date of the removal because he did not appeal the removal.decision,slip op.at.therefore,the main issue presented in this appeal is whether smith removal in june terminated his right to receive any compensation for discrimination which occurred in november.
on appeal,smith argues that the board erred by basing its denial on the theory that he is collaterally appealing his,he states that he is merely seeking compensation for the illegal discrimination the board already found that he endured,where his injury from that discrimination continued beyond his removal.the agency responds that the back pay act only permits compensation for the period of the personnel action,here the period during which the constructive suspension was in effect.the agency also argues that jurisdictionally,the board may not provide compensation for a date beyond the end of the adverse action for which it took jurisdiction.
the board found that no relief was due past smith june,removal because he did not separately appeal that removal.the board stated that smith may not use enforcement proceedings to obtain relief as to a separate agency action,and that extending relief for smith discrimination beyond the date of his removal would amount to enforc ing a compliance order against a party in a matter that has not been heard on the merits.decision,slip.op.at.while these may be correct statements of law,neither is applicable to prevent smith from obtaining relief beyond june.
here,smith is using enforcement proceedings to obtain relief for disability discrimination that occurred in november.as the eeoc and the board found,a material expediter position became available in november that could have accommodated smith disability and which he was ready and willing to undertake.thus,smith argues that if the discrimination had not occurred,he would have been in the material expediter position from which he would not have been removed.instead,when the board issued its decision finding that smith was improperly suspended and ordering his reinstatement,the agency reinstated smith to the same welder position which he had been unable to perform previously due to his disability.smith is not contending that his subsequent removal from the welder position in july,due to his inability to wear the required hearing equipment,was improper on its merits.the improper action at issue is that he was not placed in the material expediter position to accommodate his disability when it became available almost a year earlier,in november.the eeoc and board have already held that the agency failure to assign smith to the material expediter position at that time resulted in disability discrimination in violation of the ada.therefore,the action for which smith seeks relief,the illegal discrimination,was clearly adjudicated on its merits.by basing its denial of smith petition for enforcement on the grounds that his later removal was not adjudicated on its merits,the board erred.
this case constitutes an unusual situation in which an appealable adverse action that began due to one improper agency act continued due to another.the agency improperly began the constructive suspension in july by denying smith the required procedural due process.however,the constructive suspension continued past november due to disability agency failure to place him in the then available material expediter position to accommodate his disability.the petition for enforcement now before the board relates only to the relief due for the discrimination.therefore,we discuss below the relief due smith under the board order to compensate for the agency discrimination.
as compensation for discrimination,the board ordered the agency to carry out eeoc decision which the board recognized as at least requiring the agency to reinstate smith to the position he was denied due to discrimination.order,slip op.at,n.the board also required the agency to pay smith the correct amount of back pay,interest on back pay,and other benefits under the back pay act,slip op.at.reinstatement,back pay,and benefits are routinely awarded by the board and the eeoc as relief for disability discrimination.see,stewart postal,wl,at,eeopub lexis,at,payne dep t of vet.affairs,wl,at,eeopub lexis,at,schrodt postal,gonzales dep t of the treasury.
on appeal,the parties disagree as to the time period for which the back pay act permits compensation.the language of the back pay act states generally that an employee who has suffered an unwarranted personnel action and properly appeals the action is entitled to back pay for the period for which the personnel action was in amount equal to all or any part of the pay which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred b a emphasis added.the agency argues that the personnel action for purposes of the back pay act was the constructive suspension resulting from the army failure to place smith in an available light duty position as a materials expediter.as the act only requires compensation while that action was in effect,the agency contends,smith was due no compensation after the date his constructive suspension ended.smith argues that the personnel action for purposes of the back pay act is the discriminatory failure to place him in the available material expediter position in november.although the constructive suspension may have ended with his removal,smith contends that the harm to him due to the wrongful discrimination did not end with his removal.if he had been placed in the available material expediter position in november,he would not have been removed in july from the welder position.therefore,smith argues that the period during which the personnel action was in effect continued beyond the date of his removal,and he is thus entitled to back pay beyond that date.as discussed further below,we agree with smith that the back pay act does not limit his compensation due to discrimination to the period of his constructive suspension,as the agency contends.
t he basic purpose of a back pay order is restoration of the situation,as nearly as possible,to that which would have obtained but for the illegal discrimination.kerr,at quoting phelps dodge nlrb.
the back pay act itself does not address specifically how an agency is to calculate a back pay award and under what circumstances an employee who otherwise might be entitled to back pay is not to be awarded back pay by an agency.rather,congress authorized the office of personnel management opm to prescribe specific regulations to carry out the back pay act.pursuant to this authority,opm has issued implementing regulations concerning the computation of back pay 
martin dep t of the air force,citations omitted.the opm regulations instruct 
when an appropriate authority corrects or directs the correction of an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that resulted in the withdrawal,reduction,or denial of all or part of the pay,allowances,and differentials otherwise due an employee 
the employee shall be deemed to have performed service for the agency during the period covered by the corrective action 
emphases added.these regulations do not specify any particular termination of entitlement for relief,but only that the relief continues during the period covered by the corrective action.we are left to determine the period for which the discrimination found by the eeoc and the board was in effect for purposes of the back pay act.
in determining the period for which the unwarranted personnel action was in effect under the back pay act,it is instructive to look to a prior eeoc case providing an employee relief for an agency failure to accommodate.in payne department of veterans affairs,an employee was placed in a position which did not accommodate her disability for over two years,requiring her to take substantial leave from her position.wl at,eeopub lexis at.the employee filed a discrimination claim partially based on the grounds that the agency failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation.some time after she filed the claim,the employee took disability retirement.the eeoc found the agency had discriminated by failing to accommodate the disability and ordered the agency to reinstate her and pay various damages.id.at,eeopub lexis at.the agency provided her with pay only for unpaid leave taken prior to retirement,contending that neither back pay nor reinstatement were warranted after the date of retirement because the employee did not separately appeal that she was constructively discharged.id.at,eeopub lexis at.
on appeal,the employee argued that she was due back pay beyond the date of her retirement regardless of whether she appealed the retirement because she only took disability retirement due to her inability to continue working at her position without an accommodation.id.at,eeopub lexis at.the eeoc found for the employee,stating the agency failed to rebut complainant contention and provided no evidence to show that she would have gone on disability retirement even if the agency had provided her with a reasonable accommodation for her disability.id.at,eeopub lexis at.therefore,the eeoc held that the employee was entitled to back pay from the date she took disability retirement until the date the discrimination was remedied through reinstatement.id.
similarly,here the eeoc held that smith was subject to disability discrimination based on a failure to accommodate his disability.the board adopted this finding and ordered the agency to reinstate smith and provide back pay.as in payne,smith has proven that he left the agency,here by removal,for inability to perform the very position from which the agency failed to accommodate him.also as in payne,the agency has thus far failed to provide any evidence to show that smith would have been removed even if the agency had provided a reasonable accommodation for his disability.therefore,as in payne,smith too may be entitled to back pay after the date of his removal.
another consideration for the eeoc in payne was the irony that had the agency conducted the eeo process in a timely and fair manner,complainant complaint may have been resolved before she left the agency on disability retirement.id.at,eeopub lexis at.the same irony applies here.had the board realized in april,when it issued its decision finding no disability discrimination,that smith should have been accommodated in the material expediter position in november as ultimately held by the eeoc,and ordered his appointment to that position,the complaint would have been resolved before smith was removed from the agency.because of the board initial error in failing to find disability discrimination and the prolonged appeals process,the agency was not required to reinstate smith and award back pay until august.the agency can not benefit from removing smith for the very disability for which it failed to provide an accommodation,and then contend that it need not provide any relief for the discrimination because it removed him.
in payne,with circumstances very similar to those before us,the eeoc found that the appropriate measure of back pay as a remedy is that which will make the employee whole.see id.at,eeopub lexis at the purpose of a back pay award is to restore complainant to the position she would have occupied,but for the discrimination.citing albemarle paper moody,d.payne demonstrates that the relief provided by the eeoc under the back pay act solely for a failure to accommodate is such relief as would return smith to the position he would have been in absent the unlawful discrimination.while payne is not binding precedent for our court,we agree with its analysis of the intended remedy under the back pay act in a discrimination case.therefore,we agree with smith that the personnel action of discrimination is in effect and an employee may receive relief under the back pay act while he continues to suffer an injury flowing from the discrimination.in smith case,he showed that the effects of discrimination continued beyond his reinstatement to the welder position because he should have been reinstated to the material expediter position from which he would not have been removed.consequently,the right to relief for discrimination under the back pay act did not terminate merely because the constructive suspension formally ended.
smith right to reinstatement also did not arbitrarily terminate when his constructive suspension ended.smith had the right to placement in the available material expediter position in november.his right to placement in that position did not end when the board erred in finding no discrimination in april,allowing him to be reinstated to a position from which he could be removed.this right may have ended when the material expediter position was eliminated in december,but the board must make this determination in the first instance.
accordingly,we conclude that the board erred by not determining the appropriate relief owed smith due to disability discrimination.as discussed below,the board jurisdiction also does not limit its ability to provide relief in this case.
the agency contends that the board limited jurisdiction precludes an award of back pay beyond the period of the constructive suspension because the board may not provide relief beyond the end of the adverse action under appeal.the agency,however,cites no case law for the proposition that when an employee has been discriminated against while constructively suspended,the relief for the discrimination ends if he or she is removed prior to final adjudication of the discrimination claim.indeed,as discussed below,the cases cited by the agency do not require the result the agency urges here.
in mattern department of treasury,the only case from our court cited by the agency,the board found that an employee was improperly removed and ordered the agency to award the employee back pay.the employee filed a petition for enforcement arguing that the agency was required to pay him back pay for a time prior to his removal when he was placed on administrative leave or restricted duty,two actions he could not appeal to the board because the board lacked jurisdiction to hear appeals from those actions.id
