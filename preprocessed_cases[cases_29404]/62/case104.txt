in this qui tam action,the relators,on behalf of the united states,alleged fraud perpetrated by custer battles,llc,in making fraudulent statements or submitting fraudulent invoices on two contracts entered into in with the coalition provisional authority in iraq,in violation of the false claims act.the coalition provisional authority was a temporary governing body that was created by general tommy franks,the commander of coalition forces,and recognized by a united nations security council resolution.it was staffed by personnel mostly from the united states but also from over a dozen countries,and it governed iraq from may to june.
the district court limited the relators fraud claim in connection with the first contract to a claim for million,which was the amount paid to custer battles with a united states treasury check and,as so limited,submitted the claims to the jury.after the jury found custer battles liable for fraud and returned a verdict of million against it,the district court granted custer battles motion for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure a on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that custer battles presented the fraudulent invoices to an officer or employee of the united states government or a member of the armed forces of the united states,as required by the false claims act.
on the fraud claim made in connection with the second contract,the court did not submit the claim to the jury but instead granted custer battles motion for summary judgment.the court found that the relators evidence was insufficient to demonstrate any fraud.
on appeal,the relators,supported by the united states as amicus curiae,contend that the district court erred in limiting the applicability of the false claims act to a claim for funds paid from the united states treasury in concluding that government personnel detailed to the coalition provisional authority were not officer s or employee s of the united states government for purposes of the false claims act and in granting summary judgment in favor of custer battles on the fraud claim alleged in connection with the second contract.
for the reasons that follow,we reverse the district court order limiting the relators claim on the first contract to million we reverse its order granting custer battles rule a motion because substantial evidence was presented that the persons at the coalition provisional authority,to whom the fraudulent invoices on the first contract were presented and who processed and approved them,were united states personnel detailed to the coalition provisional authority as part of their official duties and we affirm the district court summary judgment on the claim made in connection with the second contract.accordingly,we remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the coalition provisional authority in iraq coalition authority governed iraq from may to june,when it turned over governing authority to the interim government of iraq.the coalition authority administrator,paul bremer,was appointed by the president and the secretary of defense,and the large majority of the coalition authority personnel were either civilian contractors and employees or in the military.the remainder of the coalition authority personnel were from other countries in the coalition occupying iraq,including australia,the czech republic,denmark,italy,japan,poland,romania,spain,the united kingdom,ukraine,and others.
at the time of the coalition authority formation,the iraqi currency,the dinar,bore the portrait of saddam hussein,the deposed ruler of iraq.in early july,administrator bremer announced an initiative to replace all of these dinars with a new dinar that would not bear saddam hussein portrait.the exchange was a massive undertaking.the new dinars were shipped into iraq on boeing cargo planes,and the exchange required the services of multiple contractors,ranging from providers of machines to transportation providers.
to build,equip,and service three hubs of the dinar exchange be located in baghdad,mosul,and coalition authority entered into a contract the dinar exchange contract on august,with custer battles,llc.custer battles was founded,managed,and owned by two former army rangers,scott custer and michael battles,and described itself as a leading international risk management firm with extensive experience assisting large organizations reduce and manage risk in extremely volatile environments.as of,it had offices in washington,dc,new york city,newport,las vegas,amman and kuwait city and claimed that it had assembled an international team with an unparalleled level of experience,training and success in managing risk and providing specialized security solutions.
the dinar exchange contract was a contract,meaning that custer battles would be reimbursed for its actual expenses,plus of its actual expenses to cover overhead and provide a profit.on the day the contract was signed,the coalition authority paid custer battles an advance of million.although the coalition authority was funded from multiple sources,it paid custer battles the advance with a treasury check funded by its seized assets account,consisting of assets seized from iraqi government sources as part of the war effort.the check was signed by a lieutenant colonel in the military.the invoices that custer battles thereafter submitted under the contract,however,were paid from the coalition authority development fund for iraq,which was recognized by united nations security council resolution and included funds from various sources but also included million confiscated by the united states from iraqi bank accounts and transferred to the development fund,as well as funds appropriated by congress.
during the course of custer battles performance of the dinar exchange contract,which began in august and continued to early,custer battles submitted invoices for payment to personnel who were detailed to work with the coalition authority.specifically,the invoices were typically submitted to patricia logsdon,a government employee detailed to the coalition authority,who then forwarded the invoices to a contractor and military personnel for approval and ultimately to the finance office of the coalition authority for payment.the invoices were paid from the development fund usually by wire transfers or with bricks of cash.under this practice,custer battles was paid approximately million in addition to the million initially advanced,for a total of approximately million.
problems developed with the quality of custer battles performance,leading to a meeting on october,between representatives of the coalition authority,the military,and custer battles michael battles and scott custer.after this meeting ended,battles accidentally left behind an astonishing spreadsheet,which contained rows listing items invoiced under the dinar exchange contract and separate columns listing the actual cost for the items and the amounts invoiced for the items.this document showed,for example,that for the baghdad hub of the dinar exchange program,custer battles provided two flatbed trucks,for which it paid but invoiced the coalition authority.to provide life support,basic level at the bagdad hub,it provided generators that cost but for which it invoiced the coalition authority.and for the basra hub,it spent to provide laundry facilities but invoiced the coalition authority for.thus under the dinar exchange contract,custer battles improperly received the difference between the actual costs and the inflated invoiced amounts and also of the inflated invoiced amounts.
in addition to the dinar exchange contract,the coalition authority entered into a separate contract with custer battles for the provision of security at the baghdad international airport the airport contract.as coalition authority officials were determined to open the airport for commercial flights as soon as possible,its ministry of transportation issued a request for proposals on june,defining the security requirements primarily in terms of opening the airport promptly rather than in terms of a specific number of security personnel needed.custer battles submitted a comprehensive proposal five days later,which included the provision of armed patrols and checkpoints,an airport police force,and baggage screeners certified by the transportation security administration.the proposal initial cost estimate of approximately million was based partly on the salaries of personnel.
because custer battles proposal was not only the lowest bid but also the only one addressing the coalition authority demanding timetable for opening the airport to commercial traffic,the coalition authority accepted custer battles proposal.on july,it entered into a temporary letter contract with custer battles,and custer battles began performing security services for the baghdad international airport that same day.on july,the letter contract was extended by another month in an extended letter contract.not until august,did the coalition authority and custer battles enter into a final contract,which covered the next ten months,ending june.
the airport contract was a price contract in the amount of.as a result of the structure,custer battles did not include the cost of personnel as part of the invoices submitted to receive payment,but rather received advances and subsequent monthly fees,as specified in the contract.neither the request for proposal nor the contract itself specified a fixed number of personnel to perform the contract,but at least at the start,custer battles provided more than personnel,a number that fluctuated thereafter as needs changed.
custer battles received high marks for its performance of the airport contract,and the coalition authority minister of transportation,franklin hatfield,found custer battles performance,far above and beyond what was required by the contract.
drc,incorporated,a leading provider of management services,with considerable experience and contacts throughout the middle east,acted as a subcontractor on custer battles contracts in iraq,and robert isakson was drc managing director.based on their belief that custer battles defrauded the united states,drc and isakson,acting as relators under the false claims act,commenced this action against custer battles,its subsidiaries,related entities,and employees collectively hereafter,custer battles,claiming that custer battles submitted inflated invoices to the coalition authority and that it understaffed its airport contracts by not providing a consistent level of at least persons,in violation of the false claims act.in addition,william baldwin,a former custer battles employee,claimed that he was discharged in retaliation for his whistleblowing activity in connection with the contracts.
in count i of their amended complaint,the relators alleged that custer battles knowingly presented to a government official false claims for both the dinar exchange contract and the airport contract,in violation of a.in count ii,they alleged that custer battles knowingly made or caused to be made false records in the form of altered purchase orders or invoices,receipts,wire transfer reports,or the like,in an effort to ensure that the false claims for payment submitted to the coalition authority for the dinar exchange contract would be paid,in violation of a.in count iii,they alleged a conspiracy among the defendants to defraud the united states under the dinar exchange contract,in violation of a.and in count iv,they alleged that the relator baldwin had been discharged in retaliation for his efforts to investigate the defendants fraud,in violation of h.
although the united states was provided notice of the complaint,in accordance with b,it declined to intervene in the case.nonetheless,it filed numerous briefs in the district court as amicus curiae,supporting the relators.it also submitted an amicus curiae brief to this court and participated in oral argument.
on custer battles motion for summary judgment,the district court granted the motion in part.see united states ex rel.drc,custer battles,llc drc i,d.it dismissed count iii,which alleged a conspiracy under a because e very defendant named in the complaint in addition to custer battles itself is an employee of custer battles,a related entity or subsidiary thus a conspiracy among the defendants is a legal impossibility.id.at quoting marmott.lumber,cir.it also limited the relators claims in counts i and ii,finding that custer battles liability for damages under the dinar exchange contract was limited to a claim for million.id.at.it reached this conclusion after conducting a thorough analysis,concluding that of the approximately million paid on the dinar exchange contract,only the advance came from government funds.id.at.
the district court thereafter severed the dinar exchange contract and retaliation claims from the airport contract claim and proceeded to trial on the dinar exchange contract and retaliation claims.the jury returned a verdict in favor of the relators,finding all of the defendants liable under both a and a,regardless of whether the coalition authority was or was not a government instrumentality.and the jury found the maximum amount of damages allowed by the district court million.in addition,the jury awarded baldwin in damages for custer battles retaliation against his whistleblowing.
before entering judgment on the verdict,the district court considered custer battles motion for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure a,filed earlier in the proceedings when the relators had completed the presentation of their case,which the court had deferred,and granted the motion,entering judgment for custer battles on counts i and ii.see united states ex rel.drc,custer battles,llc drc ii,d.with respect to claims made under a,the court found that the relators did not prove that the invoices were presented to government employees or officers,as required by that provision,but rather to the coalition authority.id.at.for the same reason,the court granted judgment as a matter of law on the claims under a,which the court concluded had an implied requirement that the false record or statement be presented to the government.id.at.
with respect to the severed claim on the airport contract,count iv of the complaint,the district court granted custer battles motion for summary judgment.united states ex rel.drc,custer battles,llc drc iii,d.the court concluded that the elements of a false claim had not been fulfilled and rejected the relators efforts to take the complaint as constructively amended at that late date.id.at.
the relators now appeal,contending that the district court erred in conducting its analysis that resulted in limiting the relators claim to a claim for damages of million on the dinar exchange contract that the relators introduced evidence sufficient to prove that presentment was made to an officer or employee of the united states government under the dinar exchange contract and that the district court erred in granting summary judgment with respect to the airport contract.
the relators contend that the district court erred in ruling that claims paid ultimately from the development fund for iraq are not actionable under the false claims act,thereby limiting their claims to a claim for damages.they argue that the district court position is not supported by the language of the act or case law.
the district court made two findings to reach its conclusion that r equests for payment from funds in the development fund were requests for iraqi funds and thus did not constitute a false claims act claim.drc i,d at.first,the court found that a claim under the false claims act is defined in part by the source of funds from which the claim is to be paid 
in sum,therefore,a requires a claim,or a request or demand for payment that if paid would result in economic loss to the government fisc,a request for payment from government funds it does not extend to cases where the government acts solely as a custodian,bailee,or administrator,merely holding or managing property for the benefit of a third party.the significance of this conclusion for this case is that if the funds used to pay the custer battles contracts were iraqi funds,even if administered or held in the possession of the united states,then the presentment of a fraudulent request for payment from these funds does not constitute a claim within the meaning of the false claims act.on the other hand,if the funds used to pay for the contracts belonged to the united states,then false claims act liability may attach if custer battles knowingly presented a false or fraudulent claim to a united states government officer for payment from these funds.thus,it is necessary to consider each source of funds separately to determine whether a request for payment therefrom constitutes a claim.
id.at.second,it found that the united states did not provide funds that could determine the scope of a claim if the united states relinquished control of those funds 
yet,once the vested funds funds were transferred to the development fund for iraq,the united states relinquished control of those funds and they ceased to be united states government property.therefore,the united states did not provide a portion of the money or property requested or demanded from the development fund of iraq.
in reaching its holdings,the district court conducted a analysis,analyzing each of the four sources of funds used by the coalition authority funds appropriated by congress and its counterparts in the coalition countries vested funds seized funds and the development fund for iraq.id.at.because the parties agreed that no appropriated funds were used in connection with the dinar exchange contract,the court addressed only the other three funds in its analysis.
it concluded that vested funds consisted of iraqi funds held in bank accounts in the united states that were legally confiscated by executive order and thereby became property of the united states government.see drc i,d at.it classified as seized funds those that were physically located in iraq but legally confiscated by and coalition forces as occupying forces and that also,under the laws and usages of war,became property of the united states government.id.at.these assets included dollars,euros,iraqi bonds,iraqi dinars,and other property,much of which was found hidden near saddam hussein presidential palaces.id.at.finally,it concluded that the development fund for iraq belonged to the iraqi people.the development fund was formally recognized by united nations security council resolution,and the coalition authority had responsibility for administering the fund during the time that it exercised governmental powers in iraq.see res,doc.may,see generally drc i,d at.the district court found that although the united states contributed million of its vested funds to the development fund for iraq during the summer of,the united states government no longer had title to the million when the development fund was used to pay claims submitted under the dinar exchange contract.see drc i,d at.
because the advance made to custer battles on the dinar exchange contract was drawn from seized funds and the remaining million was drawn from the development fund for iraq,the district court held that of the total payments made under the dinar exchange contract,only the advance drawn from seized funds supported a claim under the false claims act,and it so instructed the jury.
the relators argue that this was error and that custer battles liability should not have been so limited.they ground their argument on the text of the false claims act.
the false claims act provides in pertinent part 
any person who 
knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,to an officer or employee of the united states government or a member of the armed forces of the united states a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval or 
knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government 
is liable to the united states government for a civil penalty and treble damages.
a emphasis added.the act in turn defines claim as follows 
for purposes of this section,claim includes any request or demand for money or property which is made to a grantee,or other recipient if the united states government provides any portion of the money or property which is requested or demanded,or if the government will reimburse such grantee,or other recipient for any portion of the money or property which is requested or demanded.
c.the act thus addresses a false or fraudulent claim even if the claim is made to a grantee,or other recipient of money so long as the claim would draw on money of which the government provides any portion.
textually,therefore,a claim made to a grantee of money is not defined by the amount of money that the government paid directly to the claimant.so long as any portion of the claim is or will be funded by money given to the grantee,the full claim satisfies the definition of claim as used in a or a.the district court thus erred when it concluded that it is necessary to consider each source of funds separately to determine whether a request for payment therefrom constitutes a claim.drc i,d at emphasis added.and its conclusion that if the funds used to pay the custer battles contracts were iraqi funds,even if administered or held in the possession of the united states,then the presentment of a fraudulent request for payment from these funds does not constitute a claim within the meaning of the false claims act was also erroneous.see united states ex rel.marcus hess.noting that the false claims act does not make the extent of funds safeguard dependent upon the bookkeeping devices used for their distribution.
the district court also erred in imposing a control of funds requirement.the court concluded that when funds the million in vested funds were transferred to the development fund for iraq,the united states relinquished control of those funds and they ceased to be united states government property,such that the united states did not provide a portion of the money or property requested or demanded from the development fund for iraq,as c requires,even if it,at one time,provided a portion of the money now held in the development fund for iraq.drc i,d at.this interpretation overlooks the false claims act language that includes claims made to a grantee,or other recipient of funds,so long as the united states provides any portion of the funds that the grantees or recipients would use to pay the claim.c.this statutory language precludes an interpretation requiring that the retain control over funds used to pay claims by extending the reach of the act to money in the hands of a government grantee or other recipient.a grantee is one to whom the money is given,and the need no longer have control over the funds.
in this case,the record demonstrates that over and above the advance it received,custer battles made claims to a grantee of money,the coalition authority,and that the claims were paid from the grantee funds,the development fund for iraq,a portion of which was provided to the grantee by the government,million.
custer battles contends that the language of the dinar exchange contract itself precludes a finding that its requests for payment under that contract are claims.that contractual language provides,no funds,appropriated or other,of any coalition country are or will be obligated under this contract.
this language,however,provides no support to custer battles.section c does not define a claim in relation to the obligation of the united states government but rather to the provision of united states funds.for the dinar exchange contract the united states provided funds not only directly but also to the development fund for iraq,a portion of which was used to pay the claims.
custer battles also argues that their requests or demands were not claims because custer battles was not in privity with the united states government.but the statutory language provides no indication that congress intended to require privity.indeed,the supreme court recently rejected the very notion in allison engine united states ex rel.sanders,d.in allison engine,the court held that a subcontractor could be liable for submitting a false claim to a prime contractor of the united states.id.at.of course,a subcontractor is by definition not in pr
