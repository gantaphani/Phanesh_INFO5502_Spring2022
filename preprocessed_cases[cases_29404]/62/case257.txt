ysauro munoz appeals an adverse summary judgment ruling on two claims arising from a single dispute over whether a title vii predetermination settlement agreement required the navy to provide him a particular type of training.munoz foremost brings a breach of contract action,over which the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction,and we therefore vacate summary judgment on count and remand with instructions to dismiss.munoz also alleges that the denial of training was in retaliation for filing his underlying age and race discrimination complaint.we have jurisdiction over this count and affirm.
background 
munoz has been employed for a number of years at the naval ship repair facility ship repair in yokosuka,japan.as an engineering technician in the combat systems department,weapons system division,munoz provides technical,repair,and modernization services to the navy ships and weapons systems.munoz has worked on a variety of weapons systems over the course of his career,prominently including the mk guided missile launcher system.
in response to the command instructions to reduce its personnel by two,the combat systems department decided in not to renew munoz overseas travel arrangement and to eliminate his position or billet upon his departure.munoz consequently enrolled in the priority placement program ppp for return to the united states when a job for which he qualified became available.while enrolled in the ppp,munoz was granted repeated extensions of his tour at ship repair,but his lead responsibilities were gradually reassigned to other employees.this prompted munoz to file a formal equal employment opportunity eeo complaint alleging longstanding discrimination on the basis of age and race,including discriminatory denial of training.rather than having this claim processed through eeoc review mechanism,munoz and the navy voluntarily entered into a february,settlement agreement to resolve the discrimination charges.under the terms of the agreement,the navy was required to provide training to enhance munoz career within months from the date of th e agreement.in exchange,munoz agreed to withdraw his discrimination complaint and not pursue further action.the agreement also included an integration clause and provided that any alleged noncompliance be processed in accordance with.
soon after execution of the agreement,munoz requested training on a new missile launch system vertical missile launch system,or vls,which was in the process of replacing the mk missile.only certified systems maintenance technicians smts,who have completed a specialized course,are permitted to supervise vls work.peter rita,munoz supervisor and combat systems director,denied the request for vls training,explaining that ship repair had no vacant vls positions nor any need for additional vls technicians in any event,even if a position were available,munoz would not qualify until he acquired years of necessary experience in addition to the training and the requested training was cost prohibitive,amounting to of the annual training budget for the entire department.
munoz made several additional requests for vls training,all of which were denied on similar grounds.meanwhile,however,the navy sent munoz to a variety of other training programs,at least two of which munoz acknowledges were,though he insists that the settlement agreement entitles him specifically to vls training 
ii.procedural history 
munoz filed a request with the navy eeo officer to enforce the settlement agreement,alleging that the denial of vls training violated its terms.upon review of munoz training records,the agency determined that three of the five classes munoz had attended since execution of the settlement agreement rigging gear inspection,mk machine gun training,and the mk engineering working group conference were directly related to his duties as an engineering technician,and therefore satisfied the navy obligations to provide training.munoz timely appealed this decision to the eeoc office of federal operations.
while his first complaint remained pending,munoz filed a formal complaint,this time alleging retaliatory breach as well as seeking enforcement of the settlement agreement.the navy eeo officer issued a report finding no breach.after an eeoc administrative law judge alj dismissed munoz hearing request for lack of jurisdiction because the office of federal operations was already processing an identical claim,the navy issued a final decision finding that ship repair had not discriminated against munoz on the basis of race or age nor retaliated against him for his prior eeo activity in denying his requests for vls training.munoz appealed to the eeoc,which consolidated the two appeals and issued a decision finding that the settlement agreement did not specify any particular training sessions and that no breach had occurred,thereby disposing of munoz retaliation claim as well without separately addressing it.munoz england,wl,at july.
dissatisfied with the eeoc decision,munoz filed a complaint in district court alleging breach of the settlement agreement and violation of sections and of title vii of the civil rights act of,a,and of.b.the district court held a hearing on the parties for summary judgment,at which the court also raised sua sponte whether it had subject matter jurisdiction over the breach of contract claim.concluding that title vii conferred jurisdiction,the district court granted defendant motion for summary judgment on both counts.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court subject matter jurisdiction,interpretation of statutes,and grant of summary judgment.see singh clinton,cir schnabel lui,cir.summary judgment is proper if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is clearly entitled to judgment as a matter of law.photomedex,irwin,cir.
discussion 
count breach of predetermination settlement agreement 
although not raised by the parties,we have an independent obligation to address subject matter jurisdiction before turning to the merits of the case.williams united airlines,f d,cir.whether munoz claim to enforce a predetermination settlement is one over which the district court had jurisdiction because the claim was brought under title vii remains an open question in this court see f.we now join our sister circuits in holding that congress waiver of sovereign immunity under title vii does not extend to suits to enforce settlement agreements entered into without genuine investigation,reasonable cause determination,and conciliation efforts by the eeoc.see lindstrom united states,cir frahm united states,cir hansson norton,holding that a claim for attorney fees was a contractual claim,not one brought under title vii.the district court therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction over count,the breach of settlement agreement claim.
text of the regulation 
the navy can not be sued absent an express congressional waiver of sovereign immunity.see united states sherwood.such waiver can not be implied but must be unequivocally expressed.united states king.furthermore,any legislative waiver of immunity must be strictly construed in favor of the sovereign and not enlarged beyond what the language requires.united states nordic,internal alterations and quotations omitted accord dep t of army blue fox.
section of title vii protects federal employees and provides an express waiver of sovereign immunity in suits against the government for discriminatory employment practices.see f.the eeoc is authorized to enforce the provisions of section and to issue rules and regulations as it deems necessary.id.b see also et eeoc regulations concerning the federal sector.title vii and the eeoc implementing regulations set forth specific administrative procedures that a complainant must first exhaust before gaining access to the federal courts on a discrimination complaint.the employer and employee may,however,choose instead to resolve the discrimination complaint voluntarily with a settlement agreement,see,in which case the employee,as munoz has done here,withdraws his formal complaint an
