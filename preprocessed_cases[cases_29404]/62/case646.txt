background 
on july,the agency opened vacancy announcement,soliciting applications for the position of general in its office of the solicitor in pittsburgh,pennsylvania.the announcement stated that the position was in the excepted service and,among other things,requested that applicants submit information pertinent to whether they qualified for a veterans preference.patterson submitted an application on july.his application stated that he had served on active duty with the navy from may through july.
on august,patterson sent a letter to the agency inquiring as to the rating assigned to his application.the agency responded by informing patterson that although it had not yet completed the preliminary review of the applications,no numerical score will be assigned,as i t is not the practice of this office to assign numerical scores to attorney applications.after about one month,patterson sent a second letter to the agency,inquiring as to the status of his application.the agency subsequently informed patterson that it had filled the position.
on october,patterson wrote the agency,requesting that it furnish him with the reason or reasons for his pursuant to c.in addition,patterson filed a complaint with the department of labor dol,alleging that the agency decision not to select him for the position resulted in a violation of his veterans preference rights and amounted to discrimination on the basis of his prior military service,in violation of userra.on november,the agency provided patterson with the following explanation for his 
while your academic record appeared good,your resume did not indicate any experience specifically relevant to the work of this office.your veteran preference was given consideration as a positive factor in the evaluation process,but as you are aware,selecting a person for an attorney position is a process that requires a careful weighing of a large number of variables.in significant part,i did not feel the preference overcame the lack of relevant experience background.
emphasis added.about a week later,dol notified patterson that it had decided to close the investigation into his discrimination complaint based upon its determination that his claims lacked merit.
on november,patterson filed an appeal with the board,asserting that his by the agency violated his veterans preference rights under the veoa and that,by not selecting him,the agency had discriminated against him on the basis of his prior military service,in violation of userra.on december,the administrative judge aj assigned to the case issued a jurisdictional show cause order,requiring patterson to come forward with allegations to support his claims.patterson dep t of interior.patterson and the agency both filed responses to the show cause order.
with respect to his veoa claim,patterson alleged that the agency violated his veterans preference rights by,inter alia,not adding additional points above his earned rating,as required by.for its part,the agency argued that attorney positions are excepted from the rating and ranking procedures applicable to veterans preferences,and that therefore it was not required to follow the scoring procedures set forth at.the aj agreed with the agency,reasoning that attorney positions are specifically excepted from the competitive service,and that the agency was therefore not required to rate and rank the applicants for the position.the aj held that patterson failed to support his veoa claim with any factual assertions which show that the agency violated any statute or regulation relating to veterans preference.initial decision,slip op.at.accordingly,the aj dismissed patterson veoa claim for lack of jurisdiction.id.
as far as his userra claim was concerned,patterson alleged that the agency reason for not selecting him was a pretext,and that,in actuality,the agency decided not to select him because of his prior military service.in support of his claim,patterson argued that,while the agency purported reason for not selecting him was that it received applications from more qualified individuals,the person actually selected for the position did not have any notable academic distinction or particularly relevant work experience.the aj rejected this argument,stating that patterson did not set forth any specific facts which show that the agency treated him more harshly or disparately in non sic selecting him for a position when compared to a similar situated individual who did not have prior military service.id.slip op.at.rather,the aj concluded,patterson contention that he was more qualified than the person who received the position merely amounted to vague and generalized statements and was not sufficient to make out a claim of discrimination based on prior military service.id.consequently,the aj also dismissed patterson userra claim for lack of jurisdiction.id.
the board denied patterson petition for review of the aj initial decision,final decision,and patterson subsequently appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

on appeal,patterson contends the board erred in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction over his veoa and userra claims.he contends that the board had jurisdiction over his veoa claim because he established that the agency violated his veterans preference rights.he contends that the board had jurisdiction over his userra claim because he asserted a allegation of discrimination on the basis of his prior military service.we address each of patterson contentions in turn,starting with his veoa claim.
the veoa provides redress for a preference eligible veteran who alleges that an agency has violated his or her rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans preference.a a supp veterans preference rights are defined by the veterans preference act of vpa,stat.codified at,and its attendant regulations,see.the vpa generally gives a qualifying veteran,known as a preference eligible,various preferences in applying for civil service positions within the competitive and excepted services 
for example,and of relevance to this appeal,section of title provides preference eligibles with additional rating points in applying for positions in the competitive service.it reads 
a preference eligible who receives a passing grade in an examination for entrance into the competitive service is entitled to additional points above his earned rating,as follows 
a preference eligible under section c g of this points and 
a preference eligible under section a of this points.
in addition,although on its face section appears to apply only to positions within the competitive service,congress,through,has extended veterans preference rights to the excepted service as well 
the nominating or appointing authority shall select for appointment to each vacancy in the excepted service from the qualified applicants in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service by sections of this title.this section does not apply to an appointment required by congress to be confirmed by,or made with the advice and consent of,the senate.
emphasis added.
congress delegated the responsibility for implementing section to the office of personnel management opm.see c.accordingly,opm has issued regulations setting forth procedures for applying veterans preference rights to the excepted service.see pt.opm regulations state that the general rating and ranking procedures of apply to nominations and appointments in the excepted service when an agency uses numerical scoring in evaluating applicants.
when numerical scores are used in the evaluation and referral,the agency shall grant additional points to preference eligibles under section a and b of title and additional points to preference eligibles under section c through g of that title.
a.however,not all appointments within the excepted service are made using numerical rate and ranking procedures.for these positions,opm regulations provide for a more qualitative accounting of veterans preference rights.see id.b when eligible candidates are referred without ranking,the agency shall note preference as cp for preference eligibles under c,as xp for preference eligibles under d through g,and as tp for all other preference eligibles under that title.
in addition,opm has wholly exempted some positions within the excepted service from the appointment procedures of part.see id.c.for these exempted positions,opm simply directs agencies to follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible.id.as already seen,in this case the agency treated patterson status as a veteran as a positive factor.opm views the positive factor test as consistent with the requirement of section c that,in hiring for certain positions in the excepted service,agencies follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible.br.of appellee at.opm includes attorney positions within this exemption.id.c.
patterson veoa claim appears to be that the agency violated his veterans preference rights by failing to rate and rank his application and by failing to accord him additional rating points under as a preference eligible.the government response is that the agency properly accounted for patterson status as a preference eligible by counting it as a positive factor under c in its review of his application.patterson rejoins that the agency still violated his veterans preference rights in applying the positive factor test because opm regulation at c,from which the positive factor test flows,is invalid as contrary to the plain language of.
patterson emphasizes that the plain language of states that t he nominating or appointing authority shall select for appointment to each vacancy in the excepted service from the qualified applicants in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service by sections of title.moreover,patterson continues,section expressly entitles a preference eligible to an additional or points in his or her qualifying rating and ranking.accordingly,patterson asserts that c,which merely requires an agency to follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible,is invalid as contrary to and.patterson further asserts that the positive factor test,which is opm test for implementing c,is similarly invalid.patterson contends therefore that the agency violated his veterans preference rights by following the administratively feasible and positive factor tests and thereby failing to properly account for the additional points to which he was entitled under as a preference eligible.
the government,on the other hand,contends that c was promulgated pursuant to opm delegated authority to administer the vpa and is thus entitled to deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d.the government further contends that,in promulgating c,opm struck a reasonable balance between the vpa goal of affording veterans hiring preferences in the excepted service and the excepted service goal of providing agencies with flexibility in hiring for certain specified positions.in fact,the government asserts,accepting patterson interpretation of the vpa and,specifically,and,would effectively eliminate the purpose of the excepted service,by requiring agencies to follow formal examination,rating,and ranking procedures before filling any vacancies in that service.the government similarly contends that the positive factor test,embodying opm interpretation of how to implement c,is also valid.
as reflected by the arguments of the parties,patterson veoa claim concerns the procedures used by the agency in filling attorney vacancies.it is undisputed that attorney positions are within the excepted service and that,in making appointments to attorney positions,the agency does not examine and numerically rank applicants it also is undisputed that,through c,attorneys fall within opm exemption,which merely requires application of veterans preference rights as far as administratively feasible.therefore,the specific issue before us is whether opm acted within its delegated authority in promulgating c.
when we review the validity of an agency interpretation of a statute,our first task is to determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.that is because,i f the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter,because we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.however,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.see also doe united states.
the precise question addressed by c is how an agency should apply veterans preference principles in making hiring decisions for filling attorney vacancies.we do not think congress has addressed this question.it is true that states that nominations and appointments to the excepted service are to be made in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service by sections of title.it also is true that,relating to the examination of preference eligibles for positions in the competitive service,states that a qualifying preference eligible is entitled to an increase of points in his or her rating score points if the preference eligible is disabled.however,section also provides that the increased rating is conditioned on the preference eligible receiv ing a passing grade in an examination for entrance into the competitive service.emphasis added see also meeker merit.prot,the veterans preference act makes clear that veteran preference points,as applicable,are added to the score of a candidate who receives a passing grade in an examination for entrance into the competitive service.in addition,while examinations are commonly required for appointments in the competitive service,see,the president is specifically authorized to make exceptions to the examination requirement,see id.id.b.therefore,is silent on the issue of how agencies should apply veterans preference rights to a preference eligible in the competitive service who is not required to pass an examination.as seen,section of title refers to examinations and appointments to the excepted service being made in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service by sections of title.it therefore necessarily follows that congress has not spoken on the issue of how to apply the principles of veterans preference to positions within the excepted service that are not subject to examination.in other words,congress left a gap in the vpa on this issue,and the regulations issued by opm to fill this gap are therefore entitled to deference under chevron.cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d chevron premise is that it is for agencies,not courts,to fill statutory gaps.see also chevron,at.opm regulation at c fills this gap,since applicants for attorney vacancies in the excepted s
