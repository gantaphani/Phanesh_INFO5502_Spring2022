carl hayden hayden seeks review of the merit systems protection board the board decision denying his request for corrective action under the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act of userra,et.specifically,hayden alleged that the department of the air force air force violated userra when it denied him a promotion due to his military service denied him the benefit of reemployment in the position he would have obtained had the agency processed his position upgrade and retaliated against him after he sought userra protections.the board rejected all three of hayden claims.hayden dep t of the air force,no.ch i,wl,final decision.we agree with the board that hayden failed to meet his burden of proof with respect to his reemployment and retaliation claims.with respect to his claim of discrimination based on military service,however,we vacate the board decision and remand for further factfinding.
background 
factual background 
hayden is a member of the air force reserve and has worked as a protocol specialist at the wright patterson air force base since march.the wright patterson air force base is geographically divided into area a and area b each of which has its own protocol office.when hayden began working at the base,he worked in b flight,which is responsible for all protocol support arising on area b of the base.at that time,his position was classified as gs.final decision,wl,at.
in,hayden transferred to the protocol office in a flight,which is responsible for protocol support for area a as well as the air force security assistance center afsac.id.because he acquired new duties during the transfer,the agency upgraded hayden position from gs to gs.id.
the b flight protocol office lost two gs positions in november.id.at.the employees in those positions were declared as surplus,meaning that they were not working in permanently authorized positions.id.while one of those employees was subsequently placed in another position,the other became a mandatory placement priority and was still in that status when the appellant filed the petition for review.id.
on march,hayden supervisor submitted a request to upgrade his position to gs,based on accretion of duties at the higher grade level.id.at.to justify the upgrade,his supervisor wrote 
over abundance sic of events to work and not enough gs to perform the duties.often assign carl events that are above gs duties due to both requirements and to develop his growth.he is working above his pay grade and has shown he is capable of performing at a gs grade level.
at the end of march,hayden received military orders to begin active service on april.his duty was subsequently extended in july.in may,a human resources position classifier notified hayden supervisor that she needed to conduct a desk audit before upgrading his position.the position classifier explained that she needed to interview hayden in person for the audit,and was unable to do so while he was on extended active duty.id.at.hayden supervisor notified him that the upgrade had been cancelled because he was in nonpay status,but o nce you return in january we will id.in july,however,protocol support duties for the afsac were transferred from the a flight protocol unit to another unit,thus reducing the need for gs level employees in the unit.id.
hayden returned from active duty in december,and returned to his gs position.although he received his increase,his supervisor did not resubmit the request to upgrade his position.id.at.according to hayden,his supervisor was unable to explain why the upgrade was not being processed.id.hayden performed additional reserve duty from march.he subsequently met with his supervisor on march,and asked her to resubmit the upgrade request.according to hayden,she informed him that she did not recommend his promotion because he had been absent too often for his reserve duties.id.hayden immediately sought assistance from the base employer support of the guard reserve esgr office.id.
the next day,hayden met with his supervisors to discuss his performance.during the meeting,the chief of protocol raised concerns about hayden performance that,he alleged,had never been raised before,though he admitted at the hearing that the concerns did not lack foundation.id.at.on may,hayden received a performance feedback memorandum which stated that he was no longer working at the gs level.id.at.the agency did not request an upgrade to hayden position.
procedural history 
on may,hayden filed a request for corrective action with the board,alleging userra violations.hayden argued that he was denied a promotion due to his military service he was denied a benefit of reemployment in the position he would have obtained had the agency processed his upgrade and the agency retaliated against him after he sought userra protections.
in response,the agency argued that,due to organizational restructuring in july,while hayden was on reserve duty,there was a reduced need for gs protocol officers in the a flight protocol office.the agency also explained that it could not have placed hayden in a gs position without allowing other officers at his same level to compete and it was obligated to place the remaining surplus gs employee.final decision,wl,at.
after a videoconference hearing,the administrative judge aj denied hayden request for corrective action,finding that he had not shown by preponderant evidence that his military service was a substantial or motivating factor in the agency failure to promote him.id.at.indeed,the aj found that hayden produced no evidence whatsoever that his military service was considered adversely when the agency failed to promote him.hayden dep t of the air force,no.ch i,mspb lexis,at,initial decision.during the hearing,there was testimony that the chief of protocol requested a desk audit and that the audit could not be completed because hayden was not at work for the interview.id.at.the aj found that,even if a desk audit had been performed,hayden would still have been required to compete for the gs position.id.finally,the aj found that hayden failed to meet his burden of proof with respect to retaliation.id.at.
hayden filed a petition for review to the full board.the board vacated the initial decision,but denied hayden request for corrective action.final decision,wl,at.as to hayden first claim that he was denied a benefit due to his military service the board found that,contrary to the aj decision,there was evidence from which one could conclude that hayden military service was a motivating factor in the agency decision not to upgrade his position.id.at.the board found a temporal link between the appellant extended period of reserve duty and the agency decision not to upgrade his position.id.at.in particular,the board pointed to testimony from hayden supervisor that none of her prior position upgrade requests had required desk audits,and that she had participated in a telephone audit for hayden earlier position upgrade to gs.id.the position classifier who examined the upgrade request testified that she was aware of only about ten requests that had not been granted out of the hundreds she had processed.id.and hayden testified that,during his march,conversation with his supervisor,she informed him that his position had not been upgraded because he spent too much time out of the office for reserve duties.id.at.the board concluded that the evidence showed that the agency considered hayden absence in making its decision not to upgrade his position.
although the board found that the aj had erred,it nonetheless concluded that hayden userra claims failed.though there was sufficient evidence to shift the burden of proof for hayden first claim to the agency,the board found that the agency met its burden to establish that it did not deny the upgrade request because hayden was on military duty.id.at.the board found that the agency delayed processing the upgrade request because hayden was unavailable for an desk audit,which the position classifier testified was typically conducted when the upgraded position was at or above the gs level.id.at.and,when hayden returned,the workload in the office had changed such that additional gs protocol officers were not needed.id.at.the board concluded that the agency showed that it decided not to pursue the upgrade both during and after the appellant absence based on valid reasons other than the appellant service in the air force reserve.id.
as for hayden second claim that he was denied reemployment rights when he returned from military duty the board found that hayden was not entitled to return to a gs position.the board explained that the a flight protocol office lost its additional duties about months after the upgrade request was submitted and after the b flight protocol office had declared two gs protocol officers in surplus status a few months earlier.id.at.the record showed,therefore,that the protocol office no longer needed another gs protocol officer.id.in any event,the board found that hayden would have had to compete for the upgraded position because there was another gs protocol officer in a flight.id.accordingly,the board found no guarantee that hayden would have received the upgraded position but for his military service.id.at.
finally,the board rejected hayden third claim that the agency retaliated against him for seeking assistance from the esgr to enforce his userra rights.the board found that hayden adduced no evidence that the agency bore any discriminatory animus towards him and he thus failed to meet his initial burden of proof.id.at.to the contrary,the board found that the agency established that hayden supervisors were concerned about helping him overcome a decline in his performance and prepare for eventual promotion to gs.id.
hayden timely appealed the board decision to this court,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a and b.by letter dated october,counsel for hayden informed the court that hayden was promoted to a gs protocol specialist position effective september.that promotion moots some of the relief requested in this appeal.hayden continues to seek an award of back pay,interest,and other benefits to which he is entitled,including attorneys fees and litigation expenses,however.pet r br.citing.
discussion 
the scope of our review in an appeal from a decision of the board is limited.we must affirm the board decision unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence.c.
hayden maintains that the agency committed three separate userra violations and that the board erred in its analysis of each.first,he argues that the board failed to apply the requisite burden shifting framework to his discrimination claim.according to hayden,the board rejection of his discrimination claim is premised on hindsight that allows the air force to justify its discrimination based on the later results of that discrimination.pet r br.next,hayden argues that the board erred in finding that he failed to meet his burden to demonstrate that he was entitled to reemployment at the gs level when he returned from military service.finally,hayden argues that the board analysis of his retaliation claim is unsupported by substantial evidence and ignores its own recognition of discriminatory animus in its analysis of the discrimination claim.we address each of these issues in turn.
discrimination claim 
userra prohibits employers from discriminating against their employees because of their military service,and affords certain protections to military service members with respect to their civilian employment.a.it provides,in relevant part,that 
a person who is a member of,applies to be a member of,performs,has performed,applies to perform,or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment,reemployment,retention in employment,promotion,or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership,application for membership,performance of service,application for service,or obligation.
we analyze userra discrimination claims under a framework.sheehan dep t of the navy.applying this framework,an employee who makes a discrimination claim under userra bears the initial burden of showing,by a preponderance of the evidence,that his military service was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action.id.as we have explained,military service is a motivating factor for an adverse employment action if the employer relied on,took into account,considered,or conditioned its decision on the employee absence or obligation.erickson postal,quoting petty metro.gov t of nashville davidson,cir.
discriminatory motivation or intent may be proven by either direct or circumstantial evidence.sheehan,at.in sheehan,we explained that 
discriminatory motivation under the userra may be reasonably inferred from a variety of factors,including proximity in time between the employee military activity and the adverse employment action,inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer,an employer expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the employee military activity,and disparate treatment of certain employees compared to other employees with similar work records or offenses.
id.in determining whether the employee has proven that his protected status was part of the motivation for the agency conduct,all record evidence may be considered,including the agency explanation for the actions taken.id.
where an employee makes the prima facie showing of discriminatory motivation or intent,the employer can avoid liability by demonstrating,as an affirmative defense,that it would have taken the same action without regard to the employee military service.erickson,at see c.an employer therefore violates section if it would not have taken the adverse employment action but for the employee military service or obligation.erickson,at.
here,the board found that the agency considered hayden absences for reserve duty when it decided not to process the upgrade request during his absence and not to pursue the upgrade upon his return.final decision,wl,at.weighing all of the evidence,the board concluded that the agency considered the appellant military absences to be problematic,and the absences were a motivating factor in the agency failure to provide the position upgrade.id.accordingly,the board found that hayden satisfied his initial burden.
the board then purported to shift the burden to the agency to demonstrate,by preponderant evidence,that it would have taken the same action without considering his military service.id.at citing erickson,at.the agency explained that it did not upgrade hayden position because the position classifier had the practice of conducting desk audits for any position at the gs level or above and by the time hayden returned,the a flight protocol office had a reduced workload.id.at.the agency further argued that hayden would have had to compete for the upgraded position,and that the gs employees from b flight who had been declared as surplus would have had internal priority over the applicant.id.at.
the board found that,taken as a whole,the evidence does not show that the agency denied the upgrade request because the appellant was on military duty.instead,it shows that processing of the request was delayed because the appellant was temporarily unavailable for part of the consideration process and was on leave without pay.id.at.the board concluded that the agency has thus shown that it decided not to pursue the upgrade both during and after the appellant absence based on valid reasons other than the appellant service in the air force reserve.accordingly,the agency met its burden of proof under section a.id.
on appeal,hayden contends that the board failed to properly shift the burden to the agency to justify its actions in not promoting him and that,if it had,the agency could not have met its burden.in particular,hayden argues that the board erred in finding that a desk audit was required to process his position upgrade the board erred in determining that he would have had to compete for the promotion and the board finding that the protocol office no longer needed gs employees is irrelevant because at the time hayden upgrade request was placed there were not enough gs to perform the duties of the office and thus his position needed to be upgraded.pet r br.as explained below,we agree with hayden that the board did not hold the agency to its burden.
first,as the board noted,the office of personnel management opm classifier handbook explains that a desk audit is no more than a conversation or interview with the person in the job,or with the supervisor of the position,or with both to gain as much information as possible about the position.final decision,wl,at.the position classifier testified that she normally conducted an desk audit when the upgraded position would have been at or above the gs level.id.it is undisputed,however,that the decision to conduct a desk audit is discretionary.id.indeed,hayden supervisor testified that none of her prior position upgrade requests had required desk audits and that she had participated in a telephonic audit for hayden position upgrade to gs.id.at.
although the board recognized that a desk audit was not necessary for hayden position upgrade,it nonetheless credited the agency argument that it was unable to complete the desk audit and process the upgrade because hayden was unavailable.id.at.the board then concluded that the agency had shown that it denied the upgrade request in part because hayden was temporarily unavailable for part of the consideration process.id.at.we agree with hayden that his inability to complete an optional procedure can not form a legally cognizable basis to discriminate against him because of his military service.pet r br.
this court has made clear that an employer can not escape liability under userra by claiming that it was merely discriminating against an employee on the basis of his absence when that absence was for military service.erickson,at.and we have recognized that the overarching goal of userra is to prevent those who serve in the uniformed services from being disadvantaged by virtue of performing their military obligations.id.as we explained in erickson,the most significant and predictable consequence of reserve service with respect to the employer is that the employee is absent to perform that service.id.although an agency is entitled to remove an employee for prolonged leaves of absence an employer can not treat employees on military duty like those on leave of absence.id.at quoting allen postal.erickson thus stands for the proposition that an employee military absence can not be held against him,and that employers can not treat employees on military leave like those on nonmilitary leave of absences.
hayden was not available for an desk audit precisely because he was performing his military obligations.that the agency may otherwise be entitled to cancel a position upgrade request when an employee on leave fails to attend a requested interview is of no moment.see erickson,at.the fact remains that hayden was absent from work because of his military service,and userra protects against adverse employment actions resulting from such absences.
the mere fact that the position classifier preferred to conduct an desk audit for an upgrade at or above the gs level is irrelevant.under erickson,she was not entitled to impose that mere preference on a person who is on military leave.the bottom line is that an desk audit was not required.to say that hayden was not eligible for an upgrade because he was unavailable for a discretionary audit that could have been performed via telephone or by interviewing his immediate supervisor violates userra.see id.at permitting an employer to take an adverse action against an employee because of his military absence would eviscerate the protections afforded by userra.accordingly,the board erred in finding that the agency could avoid liability for failing to process the position upgrade request because hayden was unavailable for an desk audit.
next,hayden argues that the board erred in determining that he was not entitled to a noncompetitive position upgrade at the time his supervisor requested the upgrade.in support,hayden points out that opm regulations give agencies discretion to except certain actions from competitive procedures.c.one such exception is for a promotion resulting from an employee position being classified at a higher grade because of additional duties and responsibilities.id.at c ii.hayden also argues that he qualified for a noncompetitive upgrade under the air force civilian staffing rules as the board recognized,hayden supervisor submitted the upgrade request because he was performing additional duties and responsibilities at the gs level and because there were not enough gs sic to perform the duties.final decision,wl,at.hayden submits that,in these circumstances,he was entitled to a noncompetitive position upgrade.
the agency responds that,even if the agency proceeded with the upgrade request,hayden would have had to compete for the gs position.in particular,the agency submits that there was another gs protocol specialist in the office who would have been eligible to compete and the surplus employee whose gs position had been eliminated would have had priority over hayden for any such position.according to the agency,the board properly determined that those employees status constituted evidence supporting the agency claim that it would not have promoted hayden even if it had not considered his military absence when it decided not to upgrade the position.resp t br.
as counsel for the agency conceded at oral argument,the agency had the burden to show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that hayden would have had to compete for the position upgrade and that he would not have received it,regardless of his military service.oral argument at,available at.careful review of the board decision reveals that it did not hold the agency to that burden,however.
in the context of hayden discrimination claim,the board merely noted the agency argument that it could not upgrade the position noncompetitively because there were two protocol specialists at the gs level,which would have triggered competition under the agency regulations and even if the position were filled competitively,surplus employees would have had internal priority over the appellant.final decision,wl,at.in the next sentence,however,the board stated that,appellant thus could not show he would have been placed automatically in the upgraded position or whether the position upgrade would have been approved.id.emphasis added.but the burden was not on hayden to show he would have won any competition for the upgrade position.having demonstrated that his military service was a motivating factor in the agency decision to cancel his upgrade,hayden satisfied his burden with respect to the discrimination claim,and the burden shifted to the agency to show it would not have processed the upgrade without regard to his military service.erickson,at sheehan,at.
on this record,we conclude that the board failed to make sufficient factfindings with respect to whether hayden would have had to compete for the position and whether he would have been successful in doing so.there are no findings as to whether the position could have been noncompetitively upgraded at the time the upgrade was requested.nor is there any evidence or factfinding as to whether the surplused employee necessarily would have been chosen over hayden.although the board states that hayden would have had to compete for the upgraded position such that it is not certain he would have been selected,those findings were in the context of hayden reemployment claim which,as discussed below,requires application of a different standard and different burden of proof.final decision,wl,at.the fact remains that,in the context of hayden discrimination claim,the agency had the burden to show that its decision to cancel the upgrade request would have remained the same even if his military leave was not a factor.because there is insufficient evidence that,had the agency processed the upgrade at the time it was requested,hayden would have had to compete for the position and would no
