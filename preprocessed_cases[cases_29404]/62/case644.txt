crater corporation crater sued lucent technologies,and at t company collectively,lucent in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri,alleging that lucent infringed crater patent the patent.the patent is directed to an underwater coupling device the crater coupler.crater also asserted state law claims against lucent for misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of contract.
in an earlier decision,we affirmed the district court dismissal of crater patent infringement claim.see crater lucent,order dismissing crater claims crater i crater lucent,affirming the dismissal of crater patent infringement claim crater ii.however,we vacated the court dismissal of crater state law claims and remanded the case for further consideration of those claims.crater ii,at.on remand,the district court determined that the government proper assertion of the military and state secrets privilege the state secrets privilege made it impossible for crater to engage in discovery or to make out a prima facie case of misappropriation of trade secrets or breach of contract.crater lucent,crater iii.at the same time,the court held that the government assertion of the privilege made it impossible for lucent to defend against crater claims,slip op.at.the court therefore dismissed crater remaining claims.crater now appeals the district court decision.
on appeal,crater makes essentially two arguments.the first is that the district court erred in allowing the government to assert the state secrets privilege.the second is that,assuming the privilege was properly asserted,the court nonetheless misapplied the privilege in its discovery ruling and in its decision to dismiss the case.as far as the first issue is concerned,we see no error in the court decision sustaining the government assertion of the state secrets privilege.however,for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the district court did err in dismissing crater suit.we therefore reverse the court decision and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the technology involved in this dispute relates to underwater connectors for fiber optics.the crater coupler can be incorporated into an underwater fiber optic wetmate.crater describes a wetmate as essentially a device which connects and disconnects fiber optics beneath the sea.
in its complaint,crater alleged the following facts,which,for purposes of this appeal,we accept as true lucent employees contacted the crater inventors and asked them to provide technical data,drawings,and other information relating to the crater coupler.the information and drawings are crater confidential trade secrets.lucent expressly agreed not to reveal the information to third parties.it further agreed that lucent would only use crater confidential information for further research and that it would not produce the crater coupler until a license agreement was finalized.lucent also agreed to produce and to provide crater with copies of design cad drawings and solid models of crater technology.lucent violated its agreement with crater by producing an infringing coupler,by disseminating crater confidential information and trade secrets to third parties,and by failing to provide crater with the requested cad drawings and solid models.
crater filed suit against lucent in the eastern district of missouri in may of.crater first amended complaint alleged patent infringement and asserted state law claims of misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of contract.on march,the government moved to intervene in the case in order to assert the state secrets privilege.specifically,the government sought to prohibit crater from conducting any discovery or serving any subpoena for information relating to the manufacture or use of crater coupling device,or any coupling device,by or on behalf of the united states.the government urged that disclosure of such information would gravely damage national security.
in support of its motion,the government submitted two declarations one classified,one public from richard danzig,of the navy.danzig public declaration explained 
my statements in this declaration are based on my personal knowledge,on information provided to me in my official capacity,and on my evaluation of that information.
p laintiff discovery in this case could be expected to cause extremely grave damage to national security.requiring defendants and the private subpoena recipients to respond to plaintiff discovery would,directly or indirectly,provide adversaries of the united states government with information concerning the operations and programs described in my classified declaration.those operations and programs are currently ongoing.it is therefore my opinion that disclosure of information concerning them would permit potential adversaries to adopt specific measures to defeat or otherwise impair the effectiveness of those operations and programs.
based on my personal consideration of the matter,requiring responses to plaintiff discovery reasonably could be expected to cause extremely grave damage to the vital national security interests of the united states.accordingly,i formally invoke the military and state secrets privilege 
danzig also submitted a classified declaration to the district court for inspection in camera.on march,the district court granted the government motion to intervene.subsequently,on march,after reviewing secretary danzig classified declaration,the court granted the government request for a protective order.the court stated 
having reviewed the documents in the possession of the government in camera,the court concludes that the united states is entitled to assert the state secrets privilege in this case.the court finds that exposure of the information sought by plaintiff discovery requests would cause extremely grave damage to national security.
accordingly,the court ordered that crater was prohibited from conducting any discovery or serving any subpoena for information relating to the manufacture or use of plaintiff coupling device,or any coupling device,by or on behalf of the united states.
subsequently,lucent moved to dismiss crater suit,citing a lucent argued that any potentially infringing use of crater device was exclusively for the united states,and that crater proper remedy was to sue the government in the united states court of federal claims.thus,lucent argued that the district court lacked jurisdiction over crater patent infringement claim.in addition,lucent argued that without federal question jurisdiction,the district court did not have jurisdiction over crater state law claims because the parties lacked diversity.
ruling on lucent motion,the district court determined that it lacked jurisdiction over all of crater claims.see crater on appeal,we affirmed the dismissal of crater patent infringement claims,although for a different reason.see crater ii,at.we held that a provides a private party performing contract work for the government with an affirmative defense against patent infringement.as such,dismissal of a lawsuit against a private party pursuant to a is a dismissal because of the successful assertion of an affirmative defense rather than a dismissal because of the district court lack of subject matter jurisdiction over the patent infringement claim.id.at.we held that dismissal of crater patent infringement claim on summary judgment was proper because lucent had successfully asserted section a as an affirmative defense.id.at.
however,because the district court had original jurisdiction over crater patent infringement claim,the court had supplemental jurisdiction to adjudicate crater state law claims of misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of contract.we therefore vacated the dismissal of those claims and remanded the case for the district court to consider,in its sound discretion,whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over those claims.id.at.thus,our decision in crater ii did not reach the merits of crater state law claims,nor did it reach the issue of whether the government had properly invoked the state secrets privilege.see id.
on remand,the district court chose to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.see crater iii,slip op.at.in due course,crater moved for the court to dissolve the protective order entered on march.in its motion,crater contended that the government had consented to disclosure of some of the information subject to the order.id.specifically,crater argued that lucent employees had testified in depositions that i the crater coupler and the wetmate of which it was a part did not constitute a classified government secret and ii the had been shown at internal company meetings to individuals without security clearances.lucent responded that,to its knowledge,none of the incidents to which crater referred involved the disclosure of information subject to the state secrets privilege.
at a november hearing,the district court ordered crater to submit discovery requests to lucent and the government.after reviewing the approximately documents responsive to the requests,the government took the position that it could not satisfy any of crater discovery requests without jeopardizing national security.at another hearing in may of,the district court agreed to conduct an in camera inspection of the documents.crater iii,slip op.at.when the court completed its inspection,it ordered the government to disclose some of the documents to crater.the government resisted,arguing that releasing even a small portion of the documents would harm national security.id.following a hearing for the government to show cause why it should not be required to turn over the documents,the court reviewed the classified declarations of then acting secretary of the navy johnson and another government official.
following its review of the classified material,the district court rendered its decision dismissing crater complaint.see crater iii.the court reasoned that,although crater would not have to prove the particular use of its trade secrets in order to prevail on its misappropriation of trade secrets claim,it would have to show that lucent somehow incorporated its design information in a classified government device.the court also determined that all of crater breach claims except one require crater to prove what the defendants did for the government,slip op.at.with regard to the remaining claim that defendants breached a promise to give crater cad drawings and solid claim accuses the defendants of failing to provide drawings and models of a device that the government has asserted is a state secret.id.the court also noted that,in light of the government proper invocation of the state secrets privilege,lucent would not be able to adequately defend itself because it would not be able to disclose what it did or did not do for the government,slip op.at.crater timely appealed the district court final decision.although crater patent infringement claim has been dismissed with prejudice,we have jurisdiction over the pendant state law claims because the district court original jurisdiction was based in part on a.see a chamberlain group,skylink.
discussion 
in challenging the district court dismissal of its complaint,crater raises two issues,which we address in turn.
crater argues first that the government did not properly invoke the state secrets privilege.the military and state secrets privilege allows the united states to block discovery in a lawsuit of any information that,if disclosed,would adversely affect national security.crater ii,at.indeed,even the most compelling necessity can not overcome the claim of privilege if the court is ultimately satisfied that military secrets are at stake.united states reynolds.see also mcdonnell douglas united states,ellsberg mitchell.however,because of the broad sweep of the privilege,ellsberg,at,the supreme court has advised that the privilege is not to be lightly invoked,reynolds,at.the privilege does not protect from discovery material that is not strictly necessary to prevent potential harm to national security.ellsberg,at.
for the privilege to be properly asserted,the head of the pertinent government department must formally invoke the privilege on behalf of the government.then,after reviewing the declarations of government officials and the circumstances surrounding invocation of the privilege,the court must determine whether assertion of the privilege is appropriate.mcdonnell douglas,at.
crater contends that t he government failed to meet the threshold requirements for asserting the privilege because the government official charged with asserting the privilege never reviewed the materials sought to be protected or made any attempt to disentangle the secret from the.br.of appellant at.the government responds that,in order to properly invoke the privilege,the department head is not required to have personal knowledge of the contents of every document at issue.the government urges that the privilege was properly invoked in this case 
we agree with the government that secretary danzig and acting secretary johnson were not required to personally review each and every one of the documents at issue in order for the government to properly invoke the state secrets privilege.although reynolds requires that there be actual personal consideration by the head of the pertinent government department,at,we think it sufficient that the secretary of the navy and later the acting secretary were informed of the nature and scope of the documents sought in discovery,and that each then made the ultimate policy determination,based on his personal knowledge,that disclosure of the material sought would jeopardize a legitimate state secret and would pose a threat to national security.see northrop mcdonnell douglas,holding that the state secrets privilege was properly invoked when the department head stated that he had reviewed a representative sample of the documents as well as affidavits of staff members who had received all of the documents.
we have reviewed both the public and classified declarations submitted to the district court in connection with the government invocation of the state secrets privilege.having done so,we are satisfied that the government claims a legitimate state secret.we therefore agree with the district court that in this case there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose military matters which,in the interest of national security,should not be divulged.mcdonnell douglas,at quoting reynolds,at.accordingly,we see no error in the district court determination that the government has properly invoked the state secrets privilege 
the second issue on appeal is whether,in light of the government proper invocation of the state secrets privilege,the district court correctly determined that none of crater claims could proceed without impinging upon the privilege.the district court dismissed crater complaint after it determined that in view of the assertion of the privilege,crater would not be able to prove its state law claims.the court reached this determination because it concluded that the march protective order prevented crater from discovering any relevant evidence related to its state law claims.as far as lucent was concerned,the court stated 
t here is no question that if the case proceeds,the defendants will be unable to adequately defend themselves.the defendants may not disprove crater allegations by stating what work they did for the government,nor could they show that they did not benefit from any alleged misappropriation.in short,the defendants may not be able to disclose what they did for the government,nor will they be able to deny what they did not do for the government,with respect to crater coupler.
crater iii,slip op.at.
crater contends that the district court misapplied the state secrets privilege.focusing upon the protective order,it argues that the order improperly shielded from discovery information and documents that were not secret,as well as documents that previously had been disclosed.further,crater urges,this error carried over to the court dismissal of its complaint.crater contends that much of the evidence the court determined could not be presented either was not secret in the first place or previously had been disclosed.
the government responds that
