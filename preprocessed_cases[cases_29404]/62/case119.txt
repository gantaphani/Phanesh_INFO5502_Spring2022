charles willenbring appeals from the district court dismissal of his habeas corpus petition with respect to a judgment entered by a military trial court.willenbring was in the late,while serving in the army reserve component,for three rape offenses committed in the late,when he was serving in the army regular component in pursuing habeas corpus relief under,willenbring contends that he was not subject to prosecution because he had experienced a complete termination of military service by his honorable discharge from the army regular component,and only later entered its reserve component and the uniform code of military justice the ucmj did not otherwise provide jurisdiction.as explained below,we conclude that willenbring was subject to jurisdiction and prosecution,and therefore affirm the district court.
in order to properly assess and resolve this appeal,it is essential to understand the complexity of these proceedings specifically the background of willenbring service in the army regular and reserve components and the underlying rulings made by the military and federal courts.we review these aspects of the proceedings in turn.
on january,willenbring enlisted in the army regular component for a period of four years.he twice extended that enlistment and reenlisted for a period on september.during the latter reenlistment,willenbring received an attractive job offer and thrice requested an early separation from the army regular component.more specifically,he sought to be discharged from such service in early,thirty months before his reenlistment was to be completed.when his first on january,denied,willenbring promptly filed an updated request for an early separation,altering his initial submission and agreeing to serve the remaining portion of his enlistment contract in the army reserve component,if it would grant his release from the regular army in order to take a civilian job.willenbring second request was also denied,however,because he had failed to secure the proper recommendation.on march,willenbring submitted his third request for an early separation,which was identical to the second request except that it was supported by his commanding officer recommendation.the army approved his early separation request on march,and willenbring discharge from the regular component was fixed for march.three days after such approval,on march,willenbring signed a enlistment contract with the army reserve component,with his reserve duty to begin on april.
pursuant to the foregoing,willenbring was honorably discharged from the army regular component on march.his enlistment in the army reserve component took effect the next day,and he served as a reservist until,by virtue of three enlistment,a subsequent reenlistment,and,finally,a reenlistment that began on february.in february,near the end of his final reenlistment as a reservist,willenbring was ordered to active duty to face proceedings for the rape offenses that had occurred in and,during his service in the army regular component the specifications were preferred on february,alleging three violations of article of the ucmj,codified at single rape offense in september near champagne,illinois,plus two rape offenses in november at fort belvoir,virginia 
the ucmj spells out the statutory processes by which a military trial court may exercise jurisdiction over a member of the reserve component,specified primarily in article of the ucmj,and supplemented by article.article,codified at,spells out the general circumstances under which a member of the reserve component may be called to active duty to face proceedings of relevance here,article a identifies those persons subject to jurisdiction,that is,m embers of a regular component of the armed forces and other persons lawfully called or ordered into,or to duty in or for training in,the armed forces.additionally,article d b specifies that a reservist who is not on active duty and who is made the subject of proceedings under the ucmj may be ordered to active duty involuntarily for the purpose of trial by.pursuant to article d a and b,however,a military trial court possesses jurisdiction over an army reservist only when the alleged offense was committed while the servicemember was on active duty or on training.
in,willenbring moved to dismiss the specifications lodged in the proceedings,asserting that the military trial court lacked jurisdiction under both article and article.he contended,inter alia,that the military trial court lacked such jurisdiction because he had experienced a complete termination of military service between his discharge from the army regular component,on march,and his enlistment in the army reserve component,effective april.the court declined to dismiss the specifications,however,and willenbring sought an interlocutory review of that decision in the army court of criminal appeals the army appeals court.on july,such review was denied without opinion.the army appeals court specified,however,that its denial of interlocutory review was without prejudice to willenbring right to pursue his contentions in the regular appellate process.willenbring then appealed further,to the court of appeals for the armed forces.
on june,the court of appeals for the armed forces affirmed the army appeals court denial of interlocutory review,but remanded for findings and conclusions on the issue of willenbring asserted termination of service.see willenbring neurauter,willenbring i during further proceedings in this case,it will be necessary for the military judge to make findings of fact and conclusions of law specifically directed to the issue of termination of service.on remand,willenbring pleaded guilty to the three specifications of rape,and the judgment was entered on march,
the military trial court thereafter made the findings and conclusions mandated in by the court of appeals for the armed forces in relevant part,those findings were as follows 
around february or early march,willenbring received a civilian job offer and requested an exception to policy in the separation regulation,ar,chapter,for a civilian job offer.that request was denied.willenbring on mar submitted a department of the army form personnel action requesting reconsideration of his request for release from active duty and stated i am willing to serve my remaining time in service in the active reserves.his ets at the time under his then current enlistment was september his commander recommended approval of that request on mar,and department of the army separations and appeals branch on mar approved that request with a separation date of mar.on mar,willenbring enlisted in the army reserve for a term of year under a transition enlistment.he enlisted for specific assignment to co d,bn tng,spt bde,jones point,usarc,alexandria,va,requesting reserve component assignment orders for assignment to that unit.those orders were issued that day,mar,assigning him effective apr to that unit.willenbring in his request for component assignment orders requested to continue his sgli coverage.in his enlistment contract of mar,willenbring acknowledged and initialed his understanding that this enlistment will require that i commence training with a troop program unit immediately.i will be required to maintain satisfactory participation in the ready reserve for the entire period of service stipulated in the enlistment document to which this is attached.willenbring department of defense dd form reflected his transfer to his reserve co,bn willenbring acknowledged in february on a retirement points calculation that he had served on active duty until mar and began his reserve duties on apr.
united states willenbring,willenbring ii on the basis of the foregoing factual recitation,the military trial court concluded that willenbring did not have a complete break in service and that his military service was continuous.id.at.
on appeal from the judgment,the army appeals court affirmed willenbring convictions and adopted the military trial court conclusion that he had not experienced a complete termination of service between his discharge from the army regular component on march,and his enlistment in the reserve component on april.see willenbring ii,at.the convictions were thereafter also affirmed by the court of appeals for the armed forces.see united states willenbring.willenbring then sought relief in the supreme court of the united states,where certiorari was denied.see willenbring united states,d.
on january,after exhaustion of his military court remedies,willenbring petitioned in the eastern district of north carolina for habeas corpus relief,pursuant to,raising not only challenges to the judgment on the ground that the military trial court lacked jurisdiction,but also several challenges in june,after the government moved for dismissal,the court dismissed the habeas corpus petition.see willenbring united states,wl june,the order willenbring then appealed to this court,and we affirmed the order resolution of the issues.we remanded,however,for the district court to further consider two of willenbring claims that the military trial court lacked jurisdiction because willenbring had been honorably discharged from his army enlistment prior to the institution of the proceedings and that the was not entitled to exercise continuing jurisdiction over the specifications under article a of the ucmj.see united states willenbring,app x,cir unpublished per curiam decision.on remand,the government again moved to dismiss,contending that,as a legal proposition,the military trial court possessed jurisdiction.the district court treated the motion to dismiss as a request for summary judgment and,concluding that the military trial court possessed jurisdiction under article d,granted summary judgment to the government and denied habeas corpus relief.see willenbring united states,at,the order willenbring now pursues this appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review de novo the legal rulings made by a district court in habeas corpus proceedings,see billings polk,cir,recognizing that a military court is a statutory creation,vested with special and limited jurisdiction,see runkle united states.as a result,a proceeding must be convened and constituted in conformity with the applicable statutes,specifically the ucmj otherwise the military court lacks jurisdiction.see mcclaughry deming.the federal courts possess authority to consider and determine habeas corpus challenges to the jurisdiction of the military courts.see a writs of habeas corpus may be granted by the district courts and any circuit judge within their respective jurisdictions.schlesinger councilman,d recognizing lack of jurisdiction as proper basis for collateral attack on judgment mcclaughry,at.same.
in this appeal,willenbring contends that the judgment is void for lack of jurisdiction because he experienced a complete termination of military service on march,and article d of the ucmj does not otherwise provide jurisdiction on the specifications lodged against him we examine these contentions in turn.
first,we assess willenbring contention that he experienced a complete termination of military service on march.in this respect,the parties seem to agree that a complete termination of military service from either of the army two components bars the subsequent exercise of article d jurisdiction over offenses committed while on active duty in that component.on the other hand,they disagree on whether willenbring,on march,experienced a complete termination of military service that dispute has been resolved by the military courts,however,and we agree with their resolution.
a discharge,in military terms,is generally understood to be a complete termination of military service,but does not include a discharge conditioned upon acceptance of further military service.see murphy dalton,cir discussion to d,manual for the manual this legal principle is derived from the supreme court decision in united states ex rel.hirshberg cooke,which decided that the military was not entitled to institute proceedings against a servicemember for offenses committed during an earlier had expired and from which he had been honorably though he had reenlisted the day after being discharged.see.see also united states ex rel.toth quarles.concluding that it is unconstitutional to former he had severed all relationship with the military for offenses committed in military service.the manual recognizes this legal proposition in the following terms 
a member of the reserve component at the time disciplinary action is initiated,who is alleged to have committed an offense while on active duty or training,is subject to jurisdiction without regard to any change between active and reserve service or within different categories of reserve service subsequent to commission of the offense.this subsection does not apply to a person whose military status was completely terminated after commission of an offense.
d,manual for emphasis added.
in light of the foregoing,the military courts and the district court each concluded that willenbring march,discharge was conditioned on his earlier contract to enlist in the reserve component,entered into on march,and effective on april,and that he had not been completely terminated from military service.the issue of whether willenbring experienced a complete termination of his military service on march,has both legal and factual aspects.see willenbring ii,at observing that whether willenbring experienced complete termination of service is mixed question of law and fact.to the extent such a willenbring did not experience such a termination of military a question of law,however,we assess it de novo.see billings polk,cir recognizing de novo review of district court legal conclusions in habeas proceedings fricke sec y of navy,cir recognizing that federal court review of jurisdictional issues is independent of the military courts consideration of such issues 
the degree to which a federal court may properly assess the factual determinations made by a military court with respect to its jurisdiction is not entirely apparent.it is clear,however,that a federal court reviewing a military habeas petition is normally not at liberty to revisit a military court evidentiary rulings or findings.see burns wilson.observing that federal court,in assessing habeas challenge to judgment,must take account of the fair determinations of the military tribunals after all military remedies have been exhausted,and is not entitled to grant the writ simply to the evidence.in its burns decision,however,the court did not explicitly distinguish between a military court findings,and its findings concerning other issues.indeed,the burns court indicated that its decision did not involve a jurisdictional question.see at.observing that petitioner contentions included alleged constitutional violations by military courts,and district court had satisf ied itself that the had jurisdiction over the petitioner at the time of trial in any event,we need not decide whether we are obliged to make our own assessment of jurisdictional of the military de novo or clear error review,or simply accept such jurisdictional.put simply,the military courts properly decided the complete termination of service issue,and indeed,willenbring does not dispute the essential facts relied upon by the military courts in making that determination thus,we need not,in this proceeding,definitively resolve the issue of to what federal court is obliged to accept the jurisdictional of the military courts.because the military courts were correct in this situation regardless of the standard of review that may be utilized we will proceed to assess the legal aspects of that issue.
the legal conclusion made by the district court on this willenbring did not experience a complete termination of military neither a misinterpretation nor a misapplication of law.put succinctly,this situation is readily distinguishable from the underlying decisions on which willenbring primarily relies,hirshberg and murphy.in hirshberg,the navy had granted the petitioner an honorable discharge on march,because of the expiration of his prior enlistment,and he reenlisted on march,obligating himself to four additional years of service.see at.approximately a year later,the navy charged hirshberg with offenses allegedly committed during his prior enlistment.id.the supreme court then concluded that a discharged servicemember,whether reenlisted or not,was not subject to jurisdiction for offenses occurring during prior military service.id.at.
more recently,in murphy,a marine captain had been honorably discharged at the end of his service in the regular component of the marine corps and immediately transferred to its reserve component.see at.although murphy accepted a commission as an officer in the marines reserve component simultaneous with his discharge from its regular component,he had been completely terminated from service in its regular component and had no further statutory or contractual commitment to the marines.id.at.on these facts,the third circuit concluded that murphy discharge from the regular component was not conditioned on his reenlistment in the reserve component of the marines.see id.at murphy was under no obligation to accept a reserve commission.therefore,because murphy had experienced a complete termination of his military status,he was not subject to proceedings after his discharge from the marines regular component for offenses committed prior thereto.id.at.
the jurisdictional facts found by the military courts in these proceedings,however,are readily distinct from those in both hirshberg and murphy.put simply,willenbring to his discharge from the army regular contractual obligation to enter its reserve component.indeed,willenbring signed his reserve component enlistment contract more than two weeks before his early separation from the regular component,and thereby agreed to enter the reserve component upon that early separation.no such arrangement was present in either hirshberg or murphy.
willenbring situation is more analogous to that of united states clardy,where a servicemember was discharged solely for the purpose of reenlistment and his military service was uninterrupted.there,the court of military appeals concluded that,when a servicemember is discharged before his enlistment expires and immediately reenlists,he may be tried for predischarge offenses occurring during the prior enlistment.see id.at concluding that where the person discharge or other separation does not interrupt his status as a person belonging to the general category of persons subject to military law,jurisdiction does not terminate,and the criterion is not the mere fact of discharge but the termination of military service internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the clardy case reinforced the military tradition that,when an enlisted servicemember is discharged in order to reenlist before the expiration of his service,military jurisdiction continues,when there is no hiatus between the two enlistments.id.at quoting legal and legislative basis,manual for.therefore,the conditional nature of a military in willenbring jurisdiction to be exercised after such a discharge 
our determination that willenbring experienced continuous military service is not sufficient to fully dispose of the issue of whether the military trial court had jurisdiction to enter the judgment.we must also assess whether the applicable provisions of the ucmj yet apply to the specifications.in this respect,willenbring maintains that article d does not apply to his offenses because the phrase on active duty in subpart a only to those offenses committed while the servicemember was on active duty in the army reserve component.see supra note.willenbring relies for this proposition on the third circuit murphy decision,which concluded that the phrase on active duty in subpart a refers only to active duty in the reserve component.see at.the court of appeals for the armed forces disagreed with murphy reasoning,however,and concluded that the phrase on active duty refers to active duty in both the army regular and reserve components.see willenbring i,at.as explained below,we agree with the court of appeals for the armed forces.
willenbring first asserts that the language of article d supports his contention on appeal.he argues that,when the term active duty is used in article d other than in subpart a it plainly refers to active duty in the reserve component only.see,article d a member of a reserve component who is not on active duty emphasis added article d a member of a reserve component may not be ordered to active duty emphasis added.according to willenbring,because the phrase on active duty as found in subpart a is contained within article d,where active duty is elsewhere limited to the reserve component,it should also be restricted to reservist active duty only.
the government contends,on the other hand,that although subpart a limits jurisdiction to offenses committed while a reservist was on active duty,it does not distinguish between regular or reserve status with respect to the prior period of active duty service during which the offense was committed.br.of resp t.consequently,the government asserts,willenbring construction of subpart a places a limitation on jurisdiction that simply is not authorized by its plain language.as explained below,we agree with the government.
our first step in such a statutory interpretation is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.united states goforth,cir quoting robinson shell oil,d.indeed,w hen the words of a statute are unambiguous,then,this first canon is also the last judicial inquiry is complete.barnhart sigmon coal,d quoting.nat.bank germain,d.however,recognizing that s tatutory construction is a holistic endeavor,koons buick pontiac gmc,nigh,d internal quotation marks omitted,we must evaluate the statutory language itself,the specific context in which such statutory language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole,see palisades collections llc shorts,cir citing robinson,at.
on the statutory language itself,provides a general definition of the term active duty applicable to all of title,including the ucmj.section defines active duty as 
active duty in the active military service of the united states.such term includes training duty,annual training duty,and attendance,while in the active military service,at a school designated as a service school by law or by the secretary of the military department concerned.such term does not include national guard duty.
d.this definition thus encompasses active duty in both the army regular component and its reserve component.the definition excludes only the national guard from its scope,and it specifically includes the training duties in which army reservists participate.and,because there is a statutory definition of active duty in applicable to the ucmj,we are obliged to adhere to it.as we recently concluded,
a definition which declares what a term means excludes any meaning that is not stated,a nd as a necessary corollary to this principle,where congress has used a statutorily defined term in a manner seemingly inconsistent with the term statutory definition,an interpreting body is not entitled to adopt the seemingly inconsistent use of the term in lieu of the term express statutory definition.
aremu dep t of homeland security,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
turning to the context of the phrase on active duty,willenbring maintains that the definition of active duty in does not require every use of the term in title to include active duty in both of the army components.in assessing the term active duty in the broad context of title,however,congress expressly referenced the reserve component when it meant to restrict its application.see,d a the term active guard and reserve duty means active duty performed by a member of a reserve component of the army,navy,air force,or marine corps.emphasis added d the term active status means the status of a member of a reserve component who is not in the inactive army national guard or inactive air national guard,on an inactive status list,or in the retired reserve.emphasis added.in the specific context of article of the ucmj,congress expressly referenced particular military components when it sought to confine its application to such components.see,article a,indicating
