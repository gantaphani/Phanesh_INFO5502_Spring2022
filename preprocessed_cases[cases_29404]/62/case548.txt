appellant doris rice appeals from a decision of the merit systems protection board.the board dismissed rice appeal from the decision of the office of naval intelligence to remove her from the position of information technology specialist.we affirm the board dismissal order.
in december,rice was appointed to a competitive service position in the naval communications unit,an agency within the department of the navy.as an employee in the competitive service,she was entitled to appeal adverse actions against her to the board either after one year had passed or after she had completed any applicable trial or probationary period.a a.the naval communications unit does not perform intelligence activities.
in november,rice voluntarily accepted a new appointment to an excepted service position with the naval intelligence processing system,a predecessor of the office of naval intelligence.that agency and its successor performed intelligence activities.in connection with the new appointment,rice signed a statement acknowledging that her acceptance of the new position meant that she was voluntarily separating from the competitive service and that she was being appointed to an excepted service position.the statement read as follows 
by accepting this position,the following information is understood 
a that i will be given an excepted appointment 
b that this position can not be filled by competitive service and 
c that i will be taken out of the competitive service and 
d that i volunteer to be separated from the competitive service.
in the following years,rice held a number of other positions with the office of naval intelligence and related intelligence components.in april,however,the office of naval intelligence terminated her for allegedly adulterating a urinalysis sample.she subsequently filed a discrimination complaint with the navy equal employment opportunity office,alleging that her removal was the result of discrimination based on race and sex.the navy rejected her claim of discrimination,referring to a decision by the equal employment opportunity commission in which an administrative judge ruled that the navy had not discriminated against her.the notice of decision informed rice that she had appeal rights to the merit systems protection board or to a united states district court.the navy subsequently notified rice by letter that it had erroneously advised her that she had appeal rights to the board and that in fact her appeal rights were limited to the equal employment opportunity commission or a united states district court.before receiving that notice,rice filed an appeal of the removal action with the board.
the navy filed a motion to dismiss the board appeal,contending that the board lacked jurisdiction to entertain the appeal because,under b,rice was not entitled to appeal to the board from an adverse action against her.section b states that sections through of title,which govern adverse actions by agencies and authorize employees to take adverse action appeals to the board,do not apply to a employee such as rice whose position is within an intelligence component of the department of defense.the administrative judge who was assigned to the case issued an order advising rice that she had the burden of proving that the board had jurisdiction over her appeal and ordering her to file evidence and argument to establish the board jurisdiction.
in response,rice argued that,as an excepted service employee who had completed more that two years of continuous service in the same position,she was entitled to appeal her removal to the board under a c.she argued that section b did not exclude her from the board jurisdiction because,under the rationale of czarkowski merit systems protection board,the navy had failed to show that the secretary of defense had explicitly designated the office of naval intelligence as an intelligence component of the department of defense.additionally,rice argued that under clarke department of defense,the board retained jurisdiction over her removal appeal because office of naval intelligence had not given her actual notice of the potential loss of her appeal rights when she accepted a reassignment to an excepted service position from her previous position in the competitive service.finally,rice contended that her appeal rights to the board were preserved under the grandfather clause of b.that provision,she alleged,affords an employee appeal rights if the employee transfer into an excepted service position in an intelligence unit was immediately preceded by a position within the same agency that was subject to board appeal rights.
the administrative judge dismissed rice appeal for lack of jurisdiction.the administrative judge found that the office of naval intelligence is an intelligence component of the department of defense and that czarkowski is inapposite because that case involved a c ii,a different statute with a different standard than b,the jurisdictional statute at issue in this case.the administrative judge noted that section a c ii exempts employees from the right to appeal to the board in whistleblower cases if they work for an agency the principal function of which is the conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities as determined by the president.the administrative judge found that section b requires no such explicit exemption by the president.
the administrative judge found clarke distinguishable because rice had received express written notice that she was relinquishing her rights as a competitive service employee to accept an excepted service position.the administrative judge also rejected rice argument that b preserved her board appeal rights because she did not previously work in a position with board appeal rights that was reestablished as an excepted service position under.concluding that rice had failed to satisfy her burden to show that the board had jurisdiction in the case,the administrative judge dismissed the appeal.
an individual who appeals to the board under bears the burden of proving that the board has jurisdiction.see monasteri merit.prot,a i.to satisfy that burden,the appellant must first make a allegation of facts sufficient to establish jurisdiction if such a showing is made,the appellant is entitled to a hearing at which the appellant bears the burden of showing board jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.see garcia dep t of homeland,en banc.the board held,and we agree,that rice failed to make a allegation of facts sufficient to prove jurisdiction.
rice argues that the office of naval intelligence does not qualify as an intelligence component of the department of defense under b,and that she was therefore not excluded from the definition of an employee for purposes of adverse action appeals.the board,however,correctly ruled that an order issued by the department of defense,directive,establishes that the office of naval intelligence is an intelligence component of the department of defense within the meaning of section b.
as she did before the board,rice bases her argument on this court decision in czarkowski.she interprets czarkowski to mean that in order for an agency to qualify as an intelligence component of the department of defense within the meaning of section b,the document designating the agency as having that status must specifically reference the two statutory provisions,b and,that render inapplicable the provisions of title governing adverse action appeals.
we decline to read czarkowski so broadly.the statute at issue in czarkowski required the president or his delegate to decide that a particular agency had as its principal function the conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities.czarkowski,at,quoting a c ii.this court rejected the government argument that the board could make that determination for the president by reviewing documentary evidence suggesting that an agency has been determined to have the principal function of conducting such activities.the court pointed out that many agencies have some authority to conduct intelligence activities,but that the statute assigns to the president the task of identifying which agencies meet the principal function test.czarkowski,at.that determination,the court added,surely is a delicate call in some circumstances,and it certainly is a call that congress has left to the president or his delegate.id.the court then set forth its ruling as follows 
the statutory language does not suggest that the board can effectively make a determination for the president by reviewing documentary evidence that may suggest an agency has been determined to have the principal function of conducting foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities.documents that suggest to the board that a presidential determination should or could have been made can not stand as a proxy for an actual presidential determination that references the statute.the burden is on the agency to show that the president,or his delegate,has explicitly exempted an agency or unit thereof under section a c ii.
seizing on the reference in the portion of the czarkowski opinion quoted above to an actual presidential determination that references the statute,rice argues that department of defense directive was insufficient because it failed to cite b and.however,nothing in section b or section requires that the determination by the secretary of defense that an agency is an intelligence component of the department of defense be accompanied by a citation to the pertinent statutes or else be deemed insufficient.section b requires only that the employee position be within an intelligence component of the department of defense as defined in section of title.b.section defines intelligence component of the department of defense to include any component of the department of defense that performs intelligence functions and is designated by the secretary of defense as an intelligence component of the department of defense.d.the determination that the naval intelligence service is an intelligence component of the department of defense was made in haec verba in department of defense directive.in particular,directive designates the office of naval intelligence as one of the named department of defense intelligence components and identifies it as a component of the department of defense that conduct s intelligence activities.the directive therefore explicitly identifies the office of naval intelligence as a designated intelligence component of the department of defense that performs intelligence functions.finally,directive was issued by the deputy secretary of defense,the lawful delegate of the secretary of defense.that is all that is required by section b and section.
it is true that the court in czarkowski stated that an actual presidential determination that references section a c ii would suffice to satisfy the statutory exemption,while d ocuments that suggest to the board that a presidential determination should or could have been made would not.at.while the court clearly indicated that a determination that included a statutory reference would be sufficient,it did not hold that an express presidential determination would be invalid absent an explicit reference to section.because there was no presidential determination at all in czarkowski,it was not necessary for the court to decide whether a statutory reference is a sine qua non of such determination.at least in the context of the determination referred to in section b,which merely requires a statement that the agency in question is an intelligence component of the department of defense,we hold that such a statutory reference is not required.just as in czarkowski the critical question was whether the president or his delegate has explicitly exempted an agency or unit thereof under section a c ii,at,the critical question in this case is whether the secretary of defense or his delegate has designated the agency as an intelligence component of the department of defense under sections b and.that determination was plainly made,and an express reference to the pertinent statutes would add nothing of substance to that determination.accordingly,we hold that the board properly ruled that rice position fell within b and that she was not an employee who would be entitled under d to appeal an adverse action to the board 
rice also contends that she was not given sufficient notice at the time she accepted the appointment to the naval intelligence command that she would no longer have the right to appeal to the board from any adverse action.she argues that the notice that she was moving from a competitive service position to an excepted service position and the form that she signed acknowledging that she was voluntarily separating from the competitive service were not sufficient to advise her of the change in her board appeal rights because the notice she was given was not sufficient to give rise to a knowing and voluntary waiver of those rights.
rice first contends that in light of mccall united states postal service,riese postal service,and ferby united states postal service,she can not be deemed to have waived her board appeal rights unless she signed a written statement indicating that she knowingly waived those rights.we reject that argument.the cases on which rice relies all deal with waivers signed in the context of last chance agreements.last chance agreements are used to settle conflicts between employees and agencies the employee typically agrees to waive board appeal rights in exchange for favorable settlement terms allowing the employee a last chance to perform according to the agency expectations.a last chance appeal waiver is very different from a change in appeal rights that accompanies the voluntary acceptance of an excepted service position.the former is a waiver of a right that attaches to the employee ongoing position the latter simply reflects a difference in the rights associated with one position occupied by the employee and another to which the employee has chosen to transfer.we decline to apply the same standard to the waiver of an existing statutory right to appeal to the board as in a last chance agreement and to the waiver of board appeal rights when an employee voluntarily accepts appointment to a position that carries different statutory appeal rights as in the case of a transfer to a defense department intelligence agency.
relying on a line of board decisions that includes clarke department of defense,park department of health and human services,and exum department of veterans affairs,rice next argues that she could not lawfully be deprived of her right to appeal to the board unless she was explicitly notified that she was losing her board appeal rights when she accepted a position with the naval intelligence command.she contends that because there is no evidence that she was notified of the loss of appeal rights,she retained her board appeal rights from that time until her removal.
before the administrative judge,rice did not deny that she was informed of the change in her board appeal rights she simply stated that she did not recall having been so advised.unsurprisingly,the agency was unable to introduce any evidence regarding any oral statement that may have been made at the time of rice appointment to the excepted service in regarding her appeal rights the agency evidence was limited in this regard to the written statement that rice signed acknowledging that she was entering the excepted service and was being taken out of the competitive service,and volunteer ed to be separated from the competitive service.based on that evidence,the administrative judge distinguished the cases on which rice relied on the ground that she did receive notice that she was relinquishing her rights as a competitive service employee to accept an excepted service position.under those circumstances,the administrative judge held that she did not retain a right to appeal from her removal during the years after her transfer to the excepted service.
rice responds that the administrative judge opinion is contrary to the board decisions in cases such as clarke,park,and exum.rice is correct that the board cases on which she relies set forth a broad rule that,if applied in this case,would appear to accord board appeal rights to a per
