background

on october,the navy issued guillebeau a notice of unsatisfactory work performance,which set forth numerous examples of her unacceptable performance.final order,at.in addition,the notice included a performance plan that the navy had developed to aid guillebeau in achieving an acceptable level of performance.the performance plan set forth four quality standards by which her performance was to be judged id.at.
initially,guillebeau was assigned to develop two sets of web pages by december.the performance plan deadline was twice extended,to january,and february,respectively.id.at.the navy removed guillebeau effective march,because she had completed only one of her five specified tasks.
guillebeau filed an appeal of the navy decision to remove her on april.upon guillebeau request,this appeal was dismissed without prejudice on september,so she could retain legal counsel.guillebeau refiled her appeal on november.on june,an administrative judge reversed the navy decision to remove guillebeau,holding that the navy performance standards were absolute,and therefore,invalid.guillebeau dep t of the navy,no,slip op.at june,initial decision.the initial decision required the navy to provide interim relief to guillebeau in accordance with b a if either party filed a petition for review,slip op.at.guillebeau was returned to pay status on june,and,on july,the navy certified to the board that it had provided guillebeau with the interim relief as ordered.the navy stated that it had returned guillebeau to pay status however,because of the undue disruption that would be placed on the navy due to her lack of access to classified information she has not been physically returned to duty.app.at.on july,the navy petitioned the board for review of the initial decision.

discussion 
we must sustain the board decision unless it is found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence.c.
guillebeau first argues that the board erred in declining to dismiss the government appeal from the initial decision for failure to comply with the interim relief order.the pertinent statute provides that an employee who prevails in an initial decision shall be granted the relief provided in the decision effective upon the making of the decision,and remaining in effect pending the outcome of any petition for review.b a.the statute further provides 
if an agency makes a determination that returning the employee to work would be unduly disruptive to the work environment that prevents the return or presence of an employee at the place of employment,such employee shall receive pay,compensation,and all other benefits as terms and conditions of employment during the period pending the outcome of any petition for review 
id.b b.the initial decision ordered the navy to cancel guillebeau removal and ordered interim relief if either party filed a petition for review.guillebeau argues that the order was violated when,after the initial decision,the navy suspended her pay on september,however,the board pertinent regulation merely provides failure by an agency to provide evidence of compliance in response to a board order may result in the dismissal of the agency petition or cross petition for review.b emphasis added.on its face,the regulation simply gives the board discretion to dismiss an appeal if the government does not comply with an interim relief order.
this interpretation is bolstered by the history of the regulation itself,which was originally drafted to require dismissal of an appeal,providing failure of the agency to submit evidence that it has complied with the granting of interim relief,or that it has provided notification that interim relief will not be granted fully,will result in the dismissal of the agency petition or cross petition for review.b emphasis added.we considered the earlier version of this regulation in delaughter united states postal service.in that case,we held that b ecause the postal service failed to comply with the directives contained in b a,the board had no choice but to dismiss the postal service petition for review.id.at.accordingly,we remanded the case to the board with directions to dismiss the postal service petition for review pursuant to b a and b.id.the board amended the regulation on may,after the delaughter case,replacing the word will with may.see fed.reg,may.the amendment was clearly designed to eliminate the mandatory dismissal requirement and to give the board discretion to dismiss or not dismiss an appeal if the government fails to comply with an interim relief order.
the petitioner here argues that,although dismissal of the navy petition for review was not mandatory,the board was required to provide a more specific explanation for its action.we disagree.the board stated 
the appellant has filed a motion to dismiss the agency petition for review for failure to comply with the administrative judge interim relief order.although the appellant acknowledges that she was initially restored to pay status,she asserts that the agency subsequently suspended her without pay and that the suspension violated the administrative judge order
