this tort case is a suit stemming from a personal tragedy.nollie costo and christopher graham drowned during an rafting trip,and their estates sued their employer for negligence.but their employer is not an ordinary one.it is the united states navy.thus,the suit is barred unless the united states has waived its sovereign immunity.to determine whether the suit can properly proceed,we must feres doctrine,which limits the united states waiver of sovereign immunity.we conclude that this suit falls within the doctrine reach.we reach this conclusion only reluctantly,bound by circuit precedent to apply this doctrine to yet another case that seems far removed from its original purposes.
factual and procedural background 
nollie costo and christopher graham were sailors in the united states navy,stationed at naval air station whidbey island,in oak harbor,washington.on july,they participated in a recreational rafting trip on the nooksack river in whatcom county,washington.both were off duty and on liberty at the time.the trip,which included three rafts,was led by brian benjamin,a civilian in charge of the base rafting program.
the rafting program was operated within the command structure of the military.the navy sponsors various recreational programs that are intended to effectively contribute to the morale,and quality of life of naval personnel and their family members.department of the navy,bureau of personnel instruction buperinst b july,available at.among these are the morale,welfare and recreation mwr programs.
according to navy regulations,the administration,supervision,and operation of local mwr programs supporting all eligible personnel is a command function and is the responsibility of cognizant commanding officers.id.at authorities and responsibilities.here,the commanding officer was captain john schork.underneath schork was the mwr director,thomas lindscott,a civilian.lindscott was accountable to schork for the program content,financial integrity,and health and successful accomplishment of the mwr mission.id.at authorities and responsibilities.
beneath lindscott in the chain of command was richard score,also a civilian,who headed the recreation division of mwr.score,in turn,supervised edward dunning,a civilian,who managed the outdoor recreation center.it was dunning who implemented the rafting program.he advertised in local papers for a lead raft guide,and eventually hired brian benjamin to head the rafting program.benjamin hired tim herron,first as a guide,then eventually to handle logistics and training.
prior to the tragic trip,benjamin and cathy civilian guide trained by the route.when they did,they observed a log blocking the river,and determined that the rafts would have to pass through a narrow channel to avoid the log.
on the trip itself,the three rafts reached the log shortly after the trip had begun.the first raft negotiated the narrow channel without difficulty.as the remaining two boats prepared to negotiate the channel,they pulled too close to one another for both to pass safely,and one boat hit the log and flipped over.all of the boat passengers fell into the water.costo and graham were trapped beneath the water in the log submerged branches and drowned.
costo parents and personal representative and graham personal representative collectively referred to as the estates brought suit against the united states in federal court in washington in their complaint,brought under the federal tort claims act,they alleged that mwr breached its duty to the plaintiffs by failing to obtain a rafting permit failing to hire trained guides and failing to properly supervise those guides.they further alleged that mwr breached its duty by failing to scout out the river,to warn the rafters of the river condition,to properly equip the rafts,to properly instruct the rafters,to rescue the rafters,and to administer life saving aid.
the united states moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court granted the motion,holding that,because the estates claims fell within the feres doctrine,the suit was barred by sovereign immunity.
whether the feres doctrine applies to the facts in the record is reviewed de novo.dreier united states,cir.factual findings are reviewed de novo,with all disputed facts resolved in favor of the party.id.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
ii.the feres 
the passage of the federal tort claims act ftca in resulted in a broad waiver of the federal government sovereign immunity the united states shall be liable,respecting the provisions of this title relating to tort claims,in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,but shall not be liable for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages.however,this blanket waiver contained an exception,by which the government withheld consent to be sued for a ny claim arising out of the combatant activities of the military or naval forces,or the coast guard,during time of war.id.j.only two years later,this exception was broadened significantly by the supreme court,which held in feres united states that the government is not liable under the federal tort claims act for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.this broad exception has been labeled the feres doctrine.
the supreme court has enunciated three policy rationales for the feres doctrine the distinctively federal nature of the relationship between the government and the armed forces requires a uniform system of compensation for soldiers stationed around the country and around the world a generous compensation scheme for soldiers the veterans benefits act serves as an ample alternative to tort recovery and permitting military personnel to sue the armed forces would endanger discipline.see united states johnson,d.
these policy justifications and the doctrine itself have been heavily criticized by commentators and by this court.see,estate of mcallister united states,cir in affirming the district court,we follow a long tradition of reluctantly acknowledging the enormous breadth of a troubled doctrine.the goal of uniformity has been criticized as textually unsupported,johnson,at scalia,dissenting,and illogical,id.at.scalia,dissenting nonuniform recovery can not possibly be worse than what feres provides uniform nonrecovery.further,it has been observed that if uniformity is the goal,it makes just as much sense to establish a federal common law of torts as it does to bar all tort suits.taber maine,cir.the second rationale for the bar to tort existence of the veterans benefits been criticized as incoherent,given the fact that in certain cases,soldiers have been permitted to recover under both the vba and the ftca.johnson,at.scalia,dissenting.
the third policy danger to been identified as the best explanation for feres.united states shearer,d johnson united states,cir this rationale has not,however,escaped criticism.if the danger to discipline is inherent in soldiers suing their commanding officers,then no such suit should be permitted,regardless of whether the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.but feres itself imposes this limitation.if the fear is that civilian courts will be permitted to military decisions,then even civilian suits that raise such questions should be barred.but they are not.see johnson,at.scalia,dissenting.
perhaps because of these criticisms,circuit shied away from attempts to apply these policy rationales.see taber,at citing cases from the fifth and eleventh circuits.instead,we have outlined four factors to consider in determining whether a particular suit should be barred by the feres doctrine 
the place where the negligent act occurred 
the duty status of the plaintiff when the negligent act occurred 
the benefits accruing to the plaintiff because of his status as a service member and 
the nature of the plaintiff activities at the time the negligent act occurred.
dreier,at citations omitted.
even this test must be qualified.first,none of these factors is dispositive.rather than seizing on any particular combination of factors,we have focused on the totality of the circumstances.see,dreier,at millang united states,cir second,we have reached the unhappy conclusion that the cases applying the feres doctrine are irreconcilable,and thus,comparison of fact patterns to outcomes in cases that have applied the feres doctrine is the most appropriate way to resolve feres doctrine cases.dreier,at citing estate of mcallister,at.with these competing considerations as well as the four factors in mind,we consider the case at hand.
iii.application of the feres doctrine 
our inquiry,in large measure,bon united states,cir,a closely analogous ninth circuit case.in bon,we considered claims brought by a navy servicewoman who rented a canoe for recreational purposes from a recreational center,and was hit and injured by a serviceman driving a recreational motorboat also rented from the base.id.at.we noted that both parties to the accident were on active duty when it occurred that the activity was provided as a benefit of bon military service and that the activity was incident to military service because the boat rental was governed by military regulations,and the program was under the command of the base commanding officer.id.at.thus,we held that the feres doctrine barred suit.
bon resembles the case at bar in each of these particulars.like janice bon,costo and graham were on active duty but on liberty at the time of the accident.like the canoe rental in bon,the rafting trip was provided as a benefit of military service.and,as in bon,the mwr program here was under the command of the base commanding officer.on these facts alone,bon would be dispositive.
the estates efforts to distinguish bon are unavailing.it is of no consequence that the alleged tortfeasors were civilians.this much is clear from the supreme court decision in johnson,at applying the feres doctrine,in a case involving the alleged negligence of civilian federal aviation administration employees.nor is our decision affected by the fact that the accident occurred.the appropriate consideration is the situs of the negligence,not the location of the accident.johnson united states,at.here,much of the alleged negligence was supervisory,and occurred on base.moreover,this factor is not dispositive,id.at,and does not overcome the factors in this case that weigh to the contrary.
beyond just bon,it has long been our court,at activities fall within the feres doctrine,regardless of whether they are related to military duties.thus,in uptegrove united states,we held that the family of uptegrove a soldier could not sue the military for uptegrove death in a military plane crash,despite the fact that uptegrove was on leave,on his way to vacation with his family,and aboard the military aircraft only as a space available passenger,cir.likewise,in the context of medical malpractice suits,we have consistently barred when the injury did not arise out of the course of duty.see,estate of mcallister,at persons united states,cir although he was,kelly persons enjoyed the use of the naval hospital solely by virtue of his status as a serviceman,millang,at,and the doctors who treated him were subject to military orders.atkinson united states,cir barring a medical malpractice suit arising from the prenatal care given to a soldier in a military hospital.indeed,the feres case itself involved medical malpractice.
cases from outside the ninth circuit mirror this approach.in a range of factual situations,the courts of appeals have held that recreational activities sponsored by the military fall within the feres doctrine.see,pringle united states,cir soldier beaten by gang members after being ejected from military mwr club the relationship between the army and service personnel engaged in recreational activities under the army mwr program is distinctively federal in character.jones united states,cir medical malpractice suit against military physicians arising from an injury suffered while training for the olympics in fact,courts have often concluded military personnel acted incident to service and applied the feres bar in cases arising from servicemembers taking advantage of recreational military activities or other military perquisites because their use of the facilities was a consequence solely of their status as members of the military.walls united states,cir crash of airplane belonging to recreational aero club rayner united states,cir elective surgery woodside united states,cir crash of airplane belonging to recreational aero club hass ex rel.united states united states,cir injury while riding a horse rented from a marine stable recreational activity provided by the military can reinforce both morale and health and thus serve the overall military purpose.chambers united states,cir death in swimming pool as a matter of fact,airman chambers use of the pool,which was a part of the base,was related to and dependent upon his military service otherwise,he would not have been privileged to use it.
in citing this litany of cases,it bears note that the supreme court has not had occasion to apply feres nearly so broadly as have the circuit courts.indeed,it has been suggested that the supreme court cases could be interpreted to fall within the very based on military the estates urge us to apply here.taber,at,analogizing feres to workers compensation systems,and suggesting that feres be interpreted to bar suit for personal injuries sustained in the performance of the soldier duty.quoting a.as the estates contend,the supreme court cases typically involve activit ies incident to service that implicate military duty,see,johnson,d,or situations where military discipline was important precisely because it so fundamentally implicated the functioning of the military,see,shearer,at.none of these cases involve recreation.but whatever the original scope of the feres doctrine,it is clear that it has been interpreted throughout the lower,specifically,by our include recreational programs.therefore,we are compelled to hold that the estates suit is barred.
iv.conclusion 
as we noted at the outset,we apply the feres doctrine here without relish.nor are we the first to reluctantly reach such a conclusion under the doctrine.rather,in determining this suit to be barred,we join the many panels of this court that have criticized the inequitable extension of this doctrine to a range of situations that seem far removed from the doctrine original purposes.see,mcallister,at persons,at atkinson,at monaco united states,cir.but until congress,the supreme court,or an en banc panel of this court reorients the doctrine,we are bound to follow this path.
i begin this dissent with the understanding that i and this court of appeals must abide by the decisions of the supreme court.i write to demonstrate that the feres doctrine is unconstitutional and to present the supreme court with a case and controversy in order for it to be able to review the doctrine.see united states johnson,d scalia,dissenting.
i believe that the feres doctrine violates the equal protection rights of military service men and women.i also believe that feres violates our constitutional separation of powers.
in passing the federal tort claims act ftca,congress chose to place all americans on an equal footing in litigating the civil liability of the federal government for claims of tort injuries.from this unprecedented,albeit limited,waiver of sovereign immunity,congress excluded claims arising out of a number of government activities,including a ny claim arising out of the combatant activities of the military or naval forces,or the coast guard,during time of war.j.this exception of liability for injuries in times of war was expanded by the feres doctrine to all injuries of military personnel where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.feres united states.this doctrine represents judicial legislation,effectively negating the congressional limitations that the excluded claims must arise from combatant activities during time of war.j.the doctrine effectively declares that the members of the united states military are not equal citizens,as their rights against their government are less than the rights of their fellow americans 
this classification runs afoul of the equal protection clause of the and amendments.clearly,had congress barred all claims by members of the military it would have been within its constitutional powers to do so.see,rostker goldberg,d holding that congress acted within its constitutional authority in authorizing the military registration of men but not women.indeed,as the feres court noted,congress was cognizant of potential military claims when drafting the ftca and,had it chosen to do so,could have explicitly excluded them.see feres,at.noting that all but two of the eighteen drafts of the ftca considered by congress barred suits by members of the military specifically including members of the military or naval forces of the united states acting in the line of duty in its enumeration of individuals and acts for which the united states may be liable.likewise,as congress enacted the ftca,its decision to bar suits by military members arising in combat during times of war easily passes equal protection scrutiny.because service men and women are not a suspect class,and their access to federal court under the ftca is not a fundamental right,see miller united states,cir,congress classification needed merely to be rationally related to a legitimate government interest.see vacco quill,d.this standard does not allow us to substitute our personal notions of good public policy for those of congress.schweiker wilson,d.it is not for the judiciary to sit as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations made in areas that neither affect fundamental rights nor proceed along suspect lines.city of new orleans dukes,d.see also united states johnson,d scalia,dissenting arguing that the only possible justification for the chaos created by the feres doctrine would be if it reflected a decision grounded in the democratic process.
when considering the feres doctrine,however,we are not dealing with a legislative action,but rather with a judicial of an unambiguous and constitutional statute.even to the courts that have considered it,the feres decision stands not for an interpretation of statute but rather a judicially created exception to the ftca.stencel aero eng g united states,d marshal,dissenting schoemer united states,cir pringle united states,cir romero by romero united states,cir.this judicial runs against our basic separation of powers principles and complicates a equal protection analysis of the resulting feres doctrine.see the federalist james madison were the power of judging joined with the legislative,the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary controul,for the judge would then be the legislator quoting montesquieu city of cleburne cleburne living,d courts have been very reluctant,as they should be in our federal system and with our respect for the separation of powers,to closely scrutinize legislative choices.valley auth.hill,d our individual appraisal of the wisdom or unwisdom of a particular course consciously selected by the congress is to be put aside in the process of interpreting a statute.once the meaning of an enactment is discerned and its constitutionality determined,the judicial process comes to an end.we do not sit as a committee of review,nor are we vested with the power of veto.
i do not suggest that judges never alter legislation,but that they should never overrule the plain language of congress unless there is a constitutional violation.see marbury madison,cranch.although the constitution clearly delegates activities to the legislature and activities to the judiciary,the reality of our judicial system is that courts must occasionally take more active roles in order to interpret an ambiguous statute,comm r of internal revenue asphalt prods,d judicial perception that a particular result would be unreasonable may enter into the construction of ambiguous provisions,but can not justify disregard of what congress has plainly and intentionally provided,or to prevent a statute from running afoul of the constitution,elfbrandt russell,d.legislative silence on an issue may also require judges to determine,through history or analogy,the most appropriate legal rule in a particular situation.see,united states envtl.prot.agency,cir farouki emirates bank int l,cir.
feres presented neither ambiguity nor constitutional violation nor legislative silence instead,feres took a fairly small,clearly defined,classification and broadened it considerably.as the supreme court has noted repeatedly,this kind of classification inevitably requires that some persons who have an almost equally strong claim to favored treatment be placed on different sides of the line,and the fact that the line might have been drawn differently at some points is a matter for legislative,rather than judicial,consideration.fcc beach communications,d quoting united states ret.bd.fritz,d emphasis added.the result raises both equal protection and separation of powers concerns and,i believe,violates our constitution.
there is no authority suggesting a standard of review for an act of judicial legislation,and i hesitate to propose one.surely,however,a more stringent standard than rational review applies to classifications created by the judiciary rather than the legislature,as the constitutional implications are greater.bearden georgia,d noting that in cases considering the constitutionality of court fees the court applies a hybrid of its due process and equal protection analyses.the supreme court,in protecting another balance of constitutional powers,that between state and federal governments,has created an exacting standard requiring congress to convincingly articulate concerns of sufficient urgency before encroaching on state immunity.see,board of trustees of of alabama garrett,d.prepaid postsecondary educ.expense bd.college sav.bank,d.even if the relationship between the ends and means need merely be rational,the judiciary should articulate a reason that it is necessary to ignore the balance of federal powers.this feres failed to do.
a brief history of the fate of the four feres rationales illustrates my point the feres court initially proffered three rationales for the feres decision.it subsequently rejected the first rationale,indian towing united states,and noted that the other two rationales were no longer controlling,united states shearer,d.in the meantime,the court developed a fourth rationale,not considered by feres,and labeled it the best justification for the feres decision.id.at.this fourth negative effect of lawsuits on military discipline and not do much to support a feres bar in the court most recent feres case,which involved a civilian tortfeasor.united states johnson,d.the court instead revived the second and third rationales from feres and stated that all three surviving rationales applied.id.at.if congress had engaged in such inconsistent and post hoc rationalization to invade the spheres of executive,judicial,or state powers,the constitution would not have permitted it.northern pipeline const.marathon pipe line,d finding that the bankruptcy act of was invalid because it threatened to encroach upon article iii courts despite characterization to the contrary by congress metro.washington airports auth.citizens for abatement of aircraft noise,d finding congressional oversight committee effectively encroached on executive branch alden maine,d finding that congressional legislation impermissibly encroached on state immunity.
we can speculate forever upon reasons why feres refused to apply a law written by congress.it is clear that feres recognized that the direct and unambiguous command of congress created liability for claims caused by members of the military or naval forces of the united states,feres,at,and that the direct and unambiguous command of congress exempted only claims arising out of combatant activities during time of war,feres,at.j.if a statute is ambiguous then it is a necessary judicial function to clarify it.but feres did not take this approach in reaching its conclusion.instead,it appears to have the law.for example,the court declared
