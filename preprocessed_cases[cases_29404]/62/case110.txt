peter taylor appeals from the district court dismissal of his negligence action against kellogg brown root services,incorporated kbr.on july,taylor,an enlisted united states marine,was electrocuted and severely injured while serving on an american military base in iraq.taylor filed suit in the eastern district of virginia,alleging that his injuries were proximately caused by the negligence of kbr,a private contractor of the army.kbr sought dismissal of taylor action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,contending that his negligence claim is barred by the political question doctrine,or,in the alternative,preempted by the combat activities exception to the federal tort claims act the ftca.by its decision of april,the district court accepted both of kbr contentions and dismissed taylor negligence claim.see taylor kellogg brown root,cv,the opinion as explained below,we affirm the judgment on the basis that an adjudication of taylor claim against kbr would necessarily implicate a political question,which the federal courts lack jurisdiction to decide.accordingly,we need not reach the ftca preemption issue and we vacate that aspect of the district court opinion.
on july,taylor initiated this civil action,alleging a single common law negligence claim against kbr when the underlying events occurred in july,taylor was stationed at marine camp fallujah near the city of fallujah,iraq the camp,where he served as a hospital corpsman.inside the camp were a tank ramp and a related assault vehicle ramp collectively,the tank ramp.the tank ramp was used for the general maintenance of marine tanks,amphibious assault vehicles,and humvees,and was the only camp facility where tank maintenance occurred.
on july,the tank ramp main generator malfunctioned.because there had been several such power outages,a group of marines,including taylor,decided to install a wiring box at the tank ramp and hook up their own generator.when the marines began installing the wiring box,the tank ramp main generator had been turned off.while the marines were working,however,several kbr technicians arrived at the tank ramp to perform repairs.they were promptly advised by the marines that work was being accomplished on the tank ramp main generator,which was not to be turned on until the marines confirmed that it was safe to do so.although the technicians agreed to the marines request,one of them nevertheless turned on the main generator while the marines were working on the wiring box as a result,a powerful electrical current surged through the wiring box where taylor was working,causing him to be badly electrocuted and suffer severe injuries.
on november,kbr filed its rule b motion to dismiss taylor negligence claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction kbr essential assertions were twofold that adjudication of taylor claim would require a judicial assessment of military operations and military decisions made in fighting the iraq war and thus presented a political question and that taylor claim is preempted by the combat activities exception to the ftca,spelled out in j.with the motion supporting memorandum,kbr filed nine exhibits,including the declarations of the camp mayor,marine major omar randall,and two enlisted marines 
on december,taylor filed in the district court a legal memorandum opposing kbr rule b motion.taylor therein contended,inter alia,that the political question doctrine does not apply because his negligence claim was lodged against a private corporation and no decisions of the legislative or executive branches were implicated.more particularly,taylor maintained that any military orders should be taken as external constraints within which kbr negligent conduct against taylor could be independently considered.on december,kbr responded to taylor opposition,contending that kbr defenses to taylor negligence claim would require the court to military policies,thus implicating decisions of the executive branch.
on february,the district court conducted a nonevidentiary proceeding concerning kbr rule b motion,and kbr specifically advised the court that it would be presenting a contributory negligence defense in response,the court requested additional submissions on two subjects the characteristics of the tank ramp and the situation on the ground in fallujah,specifically the nature of the military hostilities,during the relevant time period.the following day,the court entered a conforming order authorizing the parties to conduct limited jurisdictional discovery.then,on february,the court clarified its february order and directed,inter alia,that the deposition of major randall be completed by the end of the month,and that kbr produce,to both taylor and the court,the relevant contract between kbr and the army the contract.
pursuant to the district court discovery orders,the parties conducted the deposition of major randall,and it was filed in connection with the rule b motion.the parties also filed a map of the camp,a copy of a freedom of information act request regarding taylor injuries,and the contract itself.kbr then made what it called a supplemental submission on the rule b motion,describing the hostilities in fallujah and the camp role therein,and explaining its contentions concerning the political question doctrine and the ftca combat activities exception.taylor made his own supplemental submission opposing the rule b motion,maintaining that the political question doctrine was not applicable for at least three reasons taylor injuries had not occurred during a combat operation kbr technicians were not under the plenary control of the military when they arrived to conduct repairs on the tank ramp main generator and there was a relevant factual dispute concerning whether the marines actions in installing the wiring box were authorized 
by its opinion of april,the district court granted kbr rule b motion to dismiss,ruling in kbr favor on both the political question doctrine and the ftca combat activities exception.as the opinion related,the camp is located approximately fifteen miles outside fallujah and combat activities were ongoing in.the military forces at the camp included a marine combat logistics battalion,a naval construction regiment,a marine communications battalion,a marine transportation company,and iraqi army units.other than the iraqi army units,the camp housed approximately personnel,with approximately of them being members of a marine corps regimental combat team.the military units at the camp were directly involved in combat operations and came under fire at least once or twice a month.among their other duties,the marines at the camp provided support for supply convoys.the support functions of the camp were overseen by a group of marine personnel called the mayor cell.during taylor service at the camp,major randall commanded the mayor cell.however,the camp and its personnel depended on military contractors to keep things running.kbr was one of the several contractors providing support to the military operations at the camp.
on december,kbr was awarded the contract to provide maintenance and management support at military bases in iraq the contract specified that kbr was to provide support for the multi national force iraq,which serves as the overall headquarters of all coalition forces in iraq.as such,although the contract was made with the army,kbr provided support for personnel as well.of relevance here,kbr was obliged to install,inspect,operate,repair,and maintain the electrical generators at the camp.the contract delineated a statement of work for kbr and provided,inter alia,that 
kbr shall be responsible for safety of employees and base camp residents during all kbr operations conducted in accordance with this statement of work and the army and occupational safety and health administration osha safety regulations and guidance as it applies to the iraq theatre of operations.
the camp employed two methods for supplying electric power to its various facilities.the first of those methods,termed prime power,utilized a connection to the camp primary power plant,while the alternative method involved connecting a particular user to an individual generator.certain critical facilities of the camp were authorized to use redundant power sources,typically in the form of secondary and backup generators.the use of such secondary or backup power,however,had to be authorized by the mayor cell.a facility might be denied an authorization of backup power due to limited resources or priority of resources.for example,the camp battle square was powered by multiple backup generators,while certain facilities at the camp had no backup power at all.the tank ramp was among the latter group it was powered solely by an individual generator and had not been authorized by the mayor cell for secondary or backup power.
in assessing kbr political question contention,the district court explained that the key inquiry is whether a court will have to consider the wisdom of military operations and,or whether it need only consider the private contractor performance.opinion internal quotation marks omitted the court also recognized that,in making its rule b analysis,it was entitled to look beyond the allegations of the complaint and consider how taylor negligence claim would be litigated.
the opinion concluded that taylor negligence claim gave rise to a nonjusticiable political question that the court was not permitted to assess.specifically,kbr had placed the district court on notice that it would raise a contributory negligence defense,requiring a judicial assessment of military operations and decisions made in the iraq combat theatre.as emphasized by the court,
kbr has indicated that it will defend this action,at least in part,by raising a defense of contributory negligence.this defense will inevitably force the court to question the judgment not only of taylor himself,but also of the united states military.
id.at.as the opinion explained,a judicial assessment of the contributory negligence defense would require the court to decide whether the marines made a reasonable decision to install a wiring box at the tank ramp.id.at.the court rejected taylor contention that kbr actions could be isolated and the military orders treated as external constraints,because doing so would completely eliminate the political question doctrine in contractor suits.id.at.the court drew legal support for its conclusion from the eleventh circuit recent decision in carmichael kellogg,brown,root services,cir.there,the court of appeals concluded that determining the amount of control that the military exercised over a contractor was merely a game of semantics,since kbr in that case was operating at all times under the orders and determinations made by the military.carmichael,at.
in further explaining its political question ruling,the district court emphasized that 
the military determined how power should be supplied to the tank ramp.the military authorized certain individuals to perform electric maintenance work,and forbade others from doing so.members of the military acting without proper authorization decided to install a backup generator.
opinion.an assessment of the contributory negligence defense,according to the district court,would therefore require an evaluation of several command decisions,such as whether power should have been supplied to the tank ramp.id.at.because it was the military that decided how to supply electric power to the tank ramp,and authorized who could work on the camp generators,the opinion concluded that it was not possible to view this case in a vacuum,nor is it possible to resolve this case without questioning actual sensitive judgments made by the military.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.as a result,the district court ruled that taylor negligence claim was barred because it presented a nonjusticiable political question dismissal under rule b was thus warranted,and a judgment to that effect was entered in favor of kbr on april,
taylor filed a timely notice of appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review de novo a district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b.see pitt cnty,cir.
in pursuing this appeal,taylor contends that his negligence claim is not barred by the political question doctrine and that the district court erroneously ruled to the contrary because an adjudication of the claim would not require any assessment of the army retention of kbr or the terms of the contract.kbr,in turn,maintains that the court correctly ruled that taylor negligence claim is barred under the political question doctrine because our adjudication of the claim would require a judicial assessment of military decisions made in a combat theatre that is,decisions with respect to whether backup power was to be supplied to the tank ramp and whether the marines should have been authorized to install a backup generator at the tank ramp on their own accord.
the political question doctrine had its genesis in the supreme court decision of marbury madison,where chief justice marshall explained that q uestions,in their nature political,of which are,by the constitution and laws,submitted to the executive,can never be made in this court.cranch.more recently,in baker carr,the court articulated a test for assessing whether a particular claim presents a nonjusticiable political question.see.three of those factors the first,second,and fourth are pertinent here 
first,an assessment of whether there has been a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department 
second,whether there is a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving the question and 
fourth,whether there is an apparent impossibility of a court independent resolution of the question without expressing lack of the respect due to coordinate branches of government.
id kbr contends that an adjudication of taylor negligence claim would implicate a judicial assessment that runs afoul of these three baker factors.specifically,the district court would be required to assess the military decision on how to supply power to the tank ramp first factor there is no manageable judicial standard for assessing whether the marines involved in the underlying incident had been trained properly second factor and,finally,an adjudication of taylor claim would show a lack of respect to the executive branch fourth factor.
in evaluating whether taylor negligence claim against kbr presents a nonjusticiable political question,we must recognize that kbr is not a part of the military.nonetheless,we are obliged to carefully assess the relationship between the military and kbr,and to look beyond the complaint,and consider how taylor might prove his claim and how kbr would defend.lane halliburton,cir see carmichael kellogg,brown,root,cir deeming political question doctrine applicable because kbr would defend on ground that military decisions caused accident.
we begin our inquiry by identifying the applicable legal principles concerning political questions and military operations.our decision in tiffany united states is helpful in this respect.see cir.there,a private pilot had utilized an unauthorized flight plan,and,as a result,several military planes scrambled over north carolina to determine whether the private plane was hostile.during their encounter,one of the military aircraft collided with the private plane,causing it to crash.because the government defended the estate ftca claim by asserting that the decision to scramble fighter planes was related to the national defense,our court was called on to decide whether the political question doctrine applied.we concluded that the ftca claim presented a nonjusticiable issue,emphasizing that the plaintiff could not reshape the national response to threats of hostile air attack through the mechanism of tort law.id.at.as judge wilkinson cogently explained,however,our decision did not stand for the proposition 
that any time a branch of the military asserts a national defense interest to justify its acts,the court must avert its eyes.the military does not enjoy a blanket exemption from the need to proceed in a manner.when conducting training exercises,for example,or acting in a civilian arena,national defense interests may be more remote and the military faces different restrictions.
because the military and certainly a military contractor is not,as a matter of course,insulated from liability when it asserts a national defense interest,we must,to resolve this appeal,gauge the degree to which national defense interests may be implicated in a judicial assessment of taylor negligence claim.insofar as tiffany did not address the justiciability of a negligence claim initiated by a serviceman against a private contractor concerning events that occurred in a combat theatre,we look to our sister circuits for some guidance.
in assessing the applicability of the political question doctrine,the district court identified and relied on the eleventh circuit decision in carmichael.there,a negligence claim initiated by carmichael wife against kbr for injuries that her husband,an army sergeant,had suffered in iraq was held barred by the political question doctrine.see at.carmichael had been injured when a truck driven by a kbr employee wrecked while moving in a military convoy,and it was alleged that kbr had negligently failed to safely navigate a dangerous curve.the convoy had been travelling through notoriously hostile territory and was heavily militarized.furthermore,the kbr truck driver was under the plenary control of the military,which had decided when the convoy would take place,where it would travel,and how fast it would move.id.at.the court concluded that the political question doctrine therefore barred carmichael claim.pursuant to carmichael,if a military contractor operates under the plenary control of the military,the contractor decisions may be considered as de facto military decisions.
taylor contends that we should evaluate the reasonableness of kbr acts within the parameters of the military orders that is,deeming such orders to be external constraints within which kbr allegedly negligent acts should be assessed.by way of analogy,carmichael wife alleged that kbr employees rather than the military controlled the truck in which carmichael had been injured and,notwithstanding military regulations,the kbr driver could have avoided the accident by slowing down or coming to a stop as he approached the curve where the accident occurred.carmichael,at.the eleventh circuit rejected her contention,however,concluding that the political question doctrine barred her negligence claim against kbr because its driver was under military orders and the defense would inevitably rely on such orders.id.at.
more specifically,the court of appeals concluded that carmichael claim ran afoul of the first and second baker factors.on the first factor,the court recognized that an adjudication of her negligence claim would involve assessing issues constitutionally committed to the executive branch,b ecause the circumstances under which the accident took place were so thoroughly pervaded by military judgment and decisions.carmichael,f d at.assessing the second baker factor,the court observed that there were no judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving the dispute that is,because the claim was for kbr negligence,the court had no way of assessing reasonableness in the context of military orders and regulations.id.
a similar tack to the application of the political question doctrine was taken in the fifth circuit decision in lane halliburton,cir.there,the plaintiffs were all personnel.specifically,civilian truck drivers,as well as their spouses and dependents,were pursuing claims against kbr for injuries sustained while working for kbr in iraq.their complaints alleged,inter alia,fraud and misrepresentation,and the litigation centered on kbr promise of a safe work environment.the district court had dismissed the consolidated cases because they raised nonjusticiable political questions,in that kbr was operating under orders of the military.on appeal,the fifth circuit reversed and remanded.in so ruling,the court of appeals concluded that,although the military was involved in kbr operations in iraq,the plaintiffs have presented a plausible set of facts as to the fraud and misrepresentation claims that might allow causation to be proven under one tort doctrine without questioning the army role.lane,at.as such,at least on the fraud and misrepresentation claims,jurisdiction was not necessarily barred by the political question doctrine and additional discovery was warranted.
in this case,the district court did not directly rely on the baker factors,but deemed the carmichael decision to be persuasive and ruled that taylor negligence claim was barred by the political question doctrine,explaining that both plaintiff and defendant were operating at all times under orders and determinations made by the military.opinion internal quotation marks omitted.the court reasoned that i t is simply not possible to view this case in a vacuum,emphasizing that kbr was under orders of the military on how electric power would be supplied to the tank ramp and concerning who could work on the generators.id.
although the district court may have correctly recognized that taylor negligence claim could not be viewed in isolation nonetheless,that kbr was acting under orders of the military does not,in and of itself,insulate the claim from judicial review.in disposing of this appeal,we must also assess,first,the extent to which kbr was under the military control,and,second,whether national defense interests were closely intertwined with the military decisions governing kbr conduct.
unlike the situation in carmichael,where the kbr truck driver was under the military plenary control,the contract specifies that t he contractor shall be responsible for the safety of employees and base camp residents during all contractor operations.moreover,the contract provides that the contractor shall have exclusive supervisory authority and responsibility over employees.id.at.in other words,unlike in carmichael where the military had plenary control over both the convoy and kbr in this case the military was not exercising direct control.
because of the manner that responsibility was delegated to kbr,the district court may have been incorrect in concluding that treat ing the military decisions as external constraints would completely eliminate the political question doctrine from contractor suits.opinion.indeed,with respect to generator maintenance at the camp,kbr was nearly insulated from direct military control and was itself solely responsible for the safety of all camp residents during all contractor operations.j.
nonetheless,the district court correctly concluded that a decision on the merits of taylor negligence claim would require the judiciary to question actual,sensitive judgments made by the military.opinion internal quotation marks omitted.more specifically,an analysis of kbr contributory negligence defense would invariably require the court to decide whether the marines made a reasonable decision in seeking to install the wiring box to add another electric generator at the tank ramp.id.internal quotation marks omitted.in assessing the contributory negligence defense and the reasonableness of taylor conduct,the court would be obliged to evaluate military decisions made by the mayor cell,including whether power should have been supplied to the tank ramp area.id.as the application of our tiffany decision makes clear,such an assessment,especially the issue of whether to provide a backup generator for the tank ramp,is beyond the scope of judicial review in these circumstances,therefore,the political question doctrine deprived the district court of jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of taylor negligence claim.
finally,because we agree with the district court that the political question doctrine applies here,the second appellate issue whether taylor negligence claim is preempted by the ftca combat activities exception is rendered moot.and,as we recently explained,our customary practice when a case is rendered moot on appeal is to vacate the moot aspects of the lower court judgment.norfolk ry.city of alexandria,cir citing alvarez smith.typically,however,such a vacatur is only
