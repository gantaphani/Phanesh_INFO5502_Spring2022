background 
in,louisville optometric centers ii loc ii hired landis as an optometrist.landis signed an employment agreement with loc ii.in article vii of the employment agreement,he agreed to resolve any controversy,dispute or disagreement arising out of or relating to the agreement through negotiation or,if negotiation proved unsuccessful,through arbitration governed by the american arbitration association in,loc ii was succeeded by louisville optometric centers iii loc iii.landis executed another employment agreement with loc iii that was identical in all material respects,including the arbitration clause.
rallo was loc primary doctor of optometry throughout this time period.schmitt worked for loc as a manager.in,rallo formed a new management company,pinnacle eye care,llc.since,rallo has directed loc officers under the management of pinnacle eye care.these companies do business as visionfirst,which is not registered as a separate business entity.
in april,landis was ordered to report for duty in afghanistan as a member of the indiana national guard.he claimed that he negotiated his employment upon return with schmitt before leaving for afghanistan,but the employment agreement was not amended to include these alleged terms.landis claimed that the terms were as follows during deployment in afghanistan,visionfirst would preserve his hodgenville,kentucky,practice by hiring additional optometrists to care for his patients,visionfirst would deduct three percent of the gross earnings of the hodgenville office from his overdraw debt to loc when he returned,and visionfirst would make his last draw payment on may.he alleged that upon his return from afghanistan,schmitt refused to honor these terms and visionfirst demoted him and threatened that any further involvement with the military would adversely affect his career.

the district court granted defendants motion to stay the matter and order it to arbitration.it held that landis claims were within the scope of the employment agreement,userra did not preempt the arbitration clause,the claims against some appellees who were not parties to the employment agreement should be arbitrated,and the claims against visionfirst and schmitt were not properly before a federal court.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo a district court decision to compel arbitration.bratt,noble,cir.we must determine whether the dispute is arbitrable,meaning that a valid agreement to arbitrate exists between the parties and that the specific dispute falls within the substantive scope of the agreement.id.
scope of the employment agreement and claims against other parties 
the claims in landis complaint fall within the scope of the employment agreement since article viii,section of the agreement states that t his agreement constitutes the entire agreement between practice and optometrist pertaining to the employment relationship between practice and optometrist.therefore,any termination or modification of employment necessarily relates to the employment relationship and is subject to the arbitration clause.
the district court correctly held that the claims against rallo,schmitt,and pinnacle eye care were subject to the arbitration clause of the employment agreement.these parties were employers within the meaning of userra,a,and the claims against them arose in their capacities as managers of loc offices.
arbitrability of userra claims 
federal law favors arbitration.federal arbitration act,et.faa.while the supreme court has not addressed the arbitrability of userra claims,it has repeatedly held that statutory claims are arbitrable.district courts are divided on the arbitrability of userra claims,but the only court of appeals to address the question,the fifth circuit,held that userra claims are arbitrable.
in gilmer lane,d,the court concluded that an age discrimination claim brought pursuant to the age discrimination act of can be subjected to compulsory arbitration.statutory claims may be the subject of an arbitration agreement,enforceable pursuant to the faa.id.at.the court held enforceable arbitration agreements relating to claims arising under the sherman act,b of the securities exchange act of,the civil provisions of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,and of the securities act of.id.although all statutory claims may not be appropriate for arbitration,having made the bargain to arbitrate,the party should be held to it unless congress itself has evinced an intention to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory rights at issue.id.internal quotations and alteration omitted.the burden is on the party opposing arbitration to show that congress intended to preclude a waiver of a judicial forum for the particular claim.id.if such an intention exists,it will be discoverable in the text of the statute,the legislative history,or an inherent conflict between arbitration and the statute purposes.id.all questions of arbitrability must be addressed with a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration.id.
garrett circuit city stores,cir held that userra claims are arbitrable.garrett alleged that he was fired from his job at circuit city as the american military was preparing for combat in iraq because of his supervisors hostility toward his status as a reservist.id.at.the arbitration agreement between garrett and circuit city provided that claims arising out of cessation of employment would be settled by final and binding arbitration,enforceable by and subject to the faa.id.
relying heavily on gilmer,the fifth circuit concluded that userra claims are arbitrable.id.at.first,nothing in the statutory language of userra demonstrated a congressional intent to preclude arbitration.id.at.the court rejected the argument that userra b precludes arbitration.id.at.this section reads 
this chapter supersedes any state law contract,agreement,policy,plan,practice or other matter that reduces,limits,or eliminates in any manner any right or benefit provided by this chapter,including the establishment of additional prerequisites to the exercise of any such right or receipt of any such benefit.
id.quoting b.by agreeing to arbitration,a party does not forego the substantive rights provided by the statute,but rather it submits its claims to an arbitral forum instead of a judicial forum.id.at.nothing in b mentions mandatory arbitration or the faa,notwithstanding the gilmer decision issued three years before the enactment of b.id.congress was presumptively aware of gilmer but chose not to include text exempting userra from the policy favoring arbitration.id.
second,the legislative history of userra does not prevent arbitrability of claims.id.at.garrett argued that a portion of the legislative history of b from the house committee report confirmed congressional intent to forbid binding arbitration id.at.after noting a powerful line of supreme court authority suggesting that legislative history should rarely be used in statutory interpretation,the court stated that the text of userra was unambiguous,rendering resort to legislative history unnecessary.id.it also noted that there was no comparable report from t
