plaintiff john eastman appeals from the decision of the district court granting the defendant motion for summary judgment on an ohio claim of retaliatory employment discharge in violation of public policy.the complaint,originally filed in an ohio state court,identified federal law as the source of the public policy violated by the defendant,and it was on that basis that the defendant claimed in its removal notice that the case arose under the constitution,treaties or laws of the united states,b,and thus was removable without regard to the citizenship or residence of the parties.b.we hold,however,that the plaintiff employment claim alleging wrongful discharge in violation of federal public policy does not raise a substantial federal question over which federal courts may exercise original or removal jurisdiction,because accepting such cases would be in consistent with congressional judgment about the sound division of labor between state and federal courts governing the application of.grable sons metal,darue eng g,d.because we find that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim,we will vacate the district court judgment and remand with instructions to remand the matter to the state court whence it came.
john eastman,a resident of ohio,began his employment with trw,a corporate predecessor of the defendant,in.he was trained in metallurgy at case western reserve university,and he began in a position as a metallurgical engineer.the defendant,marine mechanical corporation,manufactures component parts for nuclear reactors used on vessels of the united states navy.it is an ohio corporation.
marine mechanical supply contract with the navy prime contractor calls for a demanding quality assurance program because the parts face exposure to extreme temperature,pressure,and irradiating conditions and must conform to the navy maintenance requirements.all employees must read and sign acknowledgments that they will adhere to marine mechanical quality assurance program by reporting any contractual violations.marine mechanical emphasizes its expectations for employee adherence to this obligation in a procedure manual that specifically provides that employees must bring possible violations of this policy to a supervisor or officer of the company.at.
over the last ten years of his employment,eastman received high performance ratings and significant pay increases from the defendant each year.the defendant praised eastman in a performance appraisal issued eight months before termination.eastman advanced to the position of manager of the materials engineering section.
eastman alleges,however,that he became a victim of a shift in his employer business focus because of his steadfast adherence to quality control requirements,while the company turned its priorities toward production schedules and profitability at the expense of quality.on november,he claims marine mechanical president demoted him from manager of materials engineering to principal engineer after being informed that the company wanted to be doing things faster.eastman claims that the demotion was precipitated by his refusal to test a part in a way he believed would produce inaccurate results.marine mechanical contends the title change resulted from a new organizational structure but acknowledges that the change put eastman under the supervision of mark centa,who previously had worked in a position subservient to eastman.
on february,eastman in his new position submitted a written memorandum notifying marine mechanical supervisors of quality control deficiencies,which included warnings that a certain process possibly violated marine mechanical contractual obligations,the purchase of substandard fasteners used in products,and the receipt of certain component parts after a vendor inaccurately tested their hardness strength.marine mechanical conducted an investigation and concluded that eastman notification made unfounded allegations of fraud against centa,eastman supervisor.on february,eastman submitted a revised memorandum to clarify some unsupported statements made in the earlier memorandum.marine mechanical contended that the memoranda only identified problems that caused delay and cost increases and personally attacked centa.it chastised eastman with a written disciplinary warning on february.

according to marine mechanical,the july letter amounted to an act of misconduct in the same vein as eastman prior transgression in february for which he received his disciplinary warning.the defendant decided to fire him.two company officers notified eastman of the termination on september.when discussing the reasons for the action,the officers stated that eastman was terminated for making more unfounded and meritless allegations.
on may,eastman filed a complaint in the cuyahoga county,ohio court of common pleas alleging that marine mechanical committed a tort under ohio law by wrongfully firing him in violation of public policy.the public policy eastman set forth had its source entirely in the federal statutes cited in the complaint.he contended that his expressed concerns over the quality of the parts the defendant was manufacturing as a government contractor caused his employer to silence him by first reassigning him and removing his responsibilities for quality control and,ultimately,terminating his employment.compl,at.eastman then alleged
