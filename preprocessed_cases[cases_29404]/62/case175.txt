tracy fisher plaintiff appeals the district court order granting summary judgment to defendant.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court judgment.
facts and procedural history 
during the relevant period of time,plaintiff worked at the mcghee tyson air national guard base.as an accounting technician,she served as a federal civilian employee of the united states air force at the level.in addition,she served as a guard technician in the tennessee air national guard holding the rank of technical sergeant plaintiff duties as an accounting technician included paying invoices for services provided to the base and processing travel vouchers.as a guard technician,plaintiff was required to participate one weekend per month in unit training assemblies or guard duty days.guard technicians at the mcghee tyson guard base are required to wear uniforms during the week as well as on the weekend assemblies.military courtesies such as saluting superior officers are observed.
during the performance appraisal rating period of,msgt kenneth bud knight,an active guard reservist,served as the supervisory accounting technician and as plaintiff immediate supervisor for purposes of both plaintiff technician work and her guard duties.lt col gary wade served as plaintiff supervisor in both her technician and guard duties,and col knable served as plaintiff supervisor for both duties during that appraisal period,plaintiff received a single performance appraisal which covered both her technician and guard duties.msgt knight was the appraiser lt col wade was the reviewing authority and col knable was the approving official.
in her complaint,plaintiff alleges that on or about january,lt col wade downgraded her technician performance appraisal and forwarded it to the support personnel management office without plaintiff signature.according to plaintiff,msgt knight permitted plaintiff to prepare her own evaluation.plaintiff,who rated herself outstanding,claims that her immediate supervisor initially agreed with this rating.plaintiff alleges that lt col wade subsequently changed this outstanding rating to an excellent rating.
in approximately august of,plaintiff applied for the position of supervisory accounting technician,the position previously held by msgt knight.the applicants for that position were directed to submit a military service resume as well as a resume describing work experience,education,awards.lt col wade served as the recommending official in filling msgt knight vacancy.lt col wade selected a male candidate who plaintiff described as far less qualified than her.under the perception that lt col wade discriminated against her by failing to select her,plaintiff filed an administrative complaint with the equal opportunity office claiming gender discrimination.
on or about march,plaintiff applied for the position of supply management officer.the supply management officer is the person ultimately accountable for all government property on the base,other than real property and aircraft.the officer responsibilities encompass all requisition activities leading to the acquisition of government property on the base.the position also requires an officer appointment in the guard.applicants for the position were directed to submit a military service resume as well as a resume describing work experience,training,awards.major bruce lonas served as the recommending official in filling the vacancy for the position.in assessing the candidates for the position of supply management officer,major lonas considered both their military and technician qualifications.major lonas considered military bearing to be significant because the position required membership in the tennessee air national guard it was a management position,and its occupant would therefore be a company representative of the air national guard and the greater total air force.according to plaintiff,major lonas selected a male with far less qualifications.plaintiff,contending that this decision was discrimination based on her gender and retaliation for filing the prior discrimination complaint,filed an administrative complaint.
on or about june,plaintiff applied for a promotion to general schedule logistics management specialist.that position involves being responsible for the transport of personnel,equipment,and supplies to and from deployment locations as well as maintenance of all personnel,equipment,and supplies while deployed.major wallace houser,who held this position,considered it to be inherently military in nature.specifically,the logistics management specialist is the installation deployment officer for the base and works on behalf of the base commander as the single point of contact for all deployment functions.applicants for the position were directed to submit a military service resume as well as a resume describing work experience,training,awards.in addition,an officer appointment was required for the position as well as a top secret clearance in the guard and a minimum of months of experience in mobility programs or execution.according to plaintiff,a male with far less qualifications was selected for this position.plaintiff alleges that defendant failure to select her constitutes discrimination based on her gender and retaliation for having filed the prior charges of discrimination.
in addition,plaintiff claims that her supervisors made derogatory remarks about female employees and sexually offensive remarks which created a hostile work environment.plaintiff alleges to have heard lt col wade state that females should not be in the military and that women should be at home where they belong.plaintiff alleges that lt col wade continuously made sexually offensive and derogatory remarks about female employees in plaintiff presence.plaintiff reported the conduct but contends that defendant dismissed her complaints and failed to take remedial action.defendant denied plaintiff request for transfer.
throughout this time,plaintiff sought remedies through the civilian rather than the military system.this is understandable in light of misleading regulations and defendant response to plaintiff allegations and complaints.
the national guard regulation which sets forth the national guard civilian discrimination complaint system states that the regulation applies to national guard technician personnel,as well as other personnel.ngr ar ngr af.under the of who may file a complaint,this regulation provides that any national guard technician who believes that he has been illegally discriminated against in an employment matter subject to the control of the national guard may file a complaint.id.however,the regulation later prohibits national guard members from filing a complaint under this regulation if the alleged discrimination relates to the member military status.id.
the regulation establishing the national guard military discrimination complaint system provides that i ndividuals who believe that they have been discriminated against in technician employment must process such complaints under the regulation providing for the national guard civilian discrimination complaint system.ngr ar ngr af.
the regulation establishing the civilian system provides that the national guard bureau acts as the agency within the meaning of and therefore is responsible for the propriety of the acceptance and dismissal of complaints of discrimination.ngr ar ngr af.representatives in the equal opportunity office accepted each of plaintiff complaints and investigated them.in a narrative report prepared in response to one of plaintiff complaints,title vii and case law interpreting title vii is cited and applied.in a final report issued in response to plaintiff first complaint,the director for equal opportunity,finding no discrimination,instructed plaintiff that she could file a civil action in an appropriate district court.the area director of the equal employment opportunity commission indicated that plaintiff complaint was properly filed pursuant to title vii.on three separate occasions three different individuals informed plaintiff that she must seek a remedy though the civilian system.
plaintiff filed each of her four administrative complaints on forms provided by the equal opportunity office of the national guard bureau.the form cited as authority public law amending and stated as its principal purpose u sed by national guard technicians in filing a formal complaint of discrimination.
defendant did not directly address these points in his brief but did respond to some of these issues in oral argument.counsel addressed the regulation provision covering the military system which directed national guard technicians to the civilian system.conceding that the regulations were confusing,he explained that there are two categories of national guard technicians,and technicians.technicians are civilian,employees who can pursue remedies in the civilian system.plaintiff is a technician.in response to plaintiff contention that officials and the regulations misled her as to the proper system for her complaint,defense counsel stated that for the last two out of the three years that plaintiff has pursued her complaints,defendant has offered plaintiff the opportunity to file her charges in the military system.that opportunity remains available to plaintiff.
plaintiff filed a complaint pursuant to title vii of the civil rights act of,as amended,in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee.she alleged that defendant discriminated against her on the basis of gender,that defendant retaliated against her for filing administrative charges of discrimination,and that she was sexually harassed.defendant filed a motion to dismiss or,in the alternative,for summary judgment.the district court,treating defendant motion as one for summary judgment,granted defendant motion.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.see,holloway brush,cir.summary judgment is proper when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in deciding a motion for summary judgment,the court must view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.see matsushita indus.zenith radio,d quoting united states diebold,d.the judge is not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.anderson liberty lobby,d.a genuine issue for trial exists only when there is sufficient evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.id.at,d.
justiciability 
the first issue concerns whether plaintiff,as a national guard technician,may seek relief in a united states district court under title vii.the united states supreme court has held that soldiers could not bring a suit for damages in civilian court alleging racial discrimination by their superiors.coffman state of michigan,cir citing chappell wallace,d.
the special status of the military has required,the constitution has contemplated,congress has created,and this court has long recognized two systems of justice,to some extent parallel one for civilians and one for military personnel.chappell,at.at.the court noted that congress has plenary authority over the military,and has exercised that authority to establish statutes regulating military life and to provide for a comprehensive internal system of justice.that system provides for the review and remedy of complaints and grievances of uniformed members of the armed forces.id.at.at.
consistent with the reasoning in chappell,courts of appeals have consistently refused to extend statutory remedies available to civilians to uniformed members of the armed forces absent a clear direction from congress to do so.thus,uniformed members of the armed forces have no remedy under title vii of the civil rights act of.
coffman,at.
a precludes the military departments from engaging in acts of employment discrimination.the equal employment opportunity commission and the circuits that have considered this statute have interpreted it to apply only to suits by civilian employees of the military departments,and not members of the armed forces.brown united states,cir.thus,we must resolve whether plaintiff constitutes a civilian employee and thus must seek relief in a civilian court under a or whether she is a member of the armed forces and must pursue relief in the military system.
sixth circuit precedent supports the proposition that national guard technicians occupy military positions.in leistiko stone,cir,leistiko was employed as a national guard supervisory aircraft pilot,a federal civilian technical position subject to the provisions of.this technician position was a hybrid position that required leistiko to maintain dual status as a member of the ohio national guard and as a federal civilian technician.leistiko secretary of the army.additionally,leistiko was required to maintain status as a rated aviator.id.during an ohio national guard helicopter flight,leistiko suffered an apparent grand mal seizure.id.due to medical concerns related to that incident,an army doctor recommended that leistiko be medically disqualified from further aviation service.leistiko,at.in response,the national guard bureau removed leistiko from flight status.id.leistiko then received a notice that his employment as a federal civilian technician would be terminated for failure to meet a requirement of his position,that he remained on flight status.id.
leistiko filed suit alleging,among other claims,that the secretary of the army discriminated against him in violation of the rehabilitation act.id.the district court acknowledged that the rehabilitation act applied to the department of the army.leistiko.at citing a,a.however,the court also recognized that every court of appeals that has construed this section in a military context has held that it creates a right of action only in civilian,not military,employees of the armed forces.id.citations omitted.this court upheld the district court grant of summary judgment to the secretary of the army and specifically voiced approval for the lower court conclusions.
a s the district court correctly held,the rehabilitation act has no application to employees occupying hybrid positions that are irreducibly military in nature.leistiko.at.the district court was correct in observing that e very court having occasion closely to consider the capacity of national guard technicians has determined that capacity to be irreducibly military in nature,id.at citations omitted,and we are satisfied that leistiko technician job was of this nature.
leistiko,at.
in the case at hand,plaintiff attempts to distinguish leistiko by emphasizing that leistiko dismissal from his civilian employment was precipitated by a military decision.while that distinction may be accurate,plaintiff ignores the unambiguous statements made in leistiko that the positions of national guard technicians are irreducibly military in nature.in affirming the grant of summary judgment,this court did not discuss the facts of the underlying employment action taken which precipitated the suit.rather,we simply confirmed that national guard technician positions are irreducibly military in nature and that the rehabilitation act does not apply to hybrid positions that are irreducibly military in nature.
since the ruling in leistiko,this court has indicated its approval of that opinion on at least two occasions.in bradley stump,wl cir unpublished,bradley held dual status in the michigan air national guard and the united states air national guard.as a base commander during the week,bradley was considered a grade federal technician pursuant to.bradley stump.when participating in active state duty on weekends,during annual training,or on special call up duty,bradley served both as base commander and as commander of the fighter group,a unit of the michigan air national guard.id.bradley wife had been employed on the base since.bradley,wl.
during a performance review,bradley was informed that either he or his wife would have to leave as it was inappropriate for his wife to remain employed on the base within bradley ultimate control.id.bradley filed an action alleging,among other claims,a violation of his constitutional rights under.id.the district court dismissed the suit as,stating that 
guard technicians challenges to discharge by the guard and termination from technician employment are nonjusticiable because judicial review would seriously impede the military in performance of its vital duties.
bradley.at quoting christoffersen washington state air guard,cir,cert.denied,d.on appeal,this court referred to leistiko in affirming the dismissal.bradley,wl.this court held that 
t he national guard is irreducibly military.an executive decision by an adjutant general to relieve a guard officer of command is simply an adverse personnel action.damages are not available for adverse personnel actions in the military.
plaintiff attempts to distinguish bradley by offering that bradley position as a base commander,level,was irreducibly military.however,this court did not conclude that only the base commander position was irreducibly military,but that the national guard as a whole was irreducibly military.id.
in hoffman stump,wl cir unpublished,hoffman was a member of the united states national guard and the michigan national guard.while hoffman was on federal national guard duty,an incident occurred which resulted in discipline.id.at.during an eagle scout camping trip,hoffman found a wallet,removed the money,turned the wallet in to the post office,and then took steps to cover up his actions.id.at.
hoffman initiated a suit challenging,on state law and constitutional grounds,the national guard disciplinary decision.id.at.the district court dismissed the constitutional challenges as because they challenged an internal military discipline decision.id.this court affirmed,citing leistiko and bradley as examples,and stating that since chappell,this court has dismissed officers federal claims when the officers challenge internal military disciplinary or personnel decisions.id.at.
plaintiff argues that hoffman was on military duty at the time of the incident which gave rise to his lawsuit.hoffman did not dispute the fact that his federal claims required the court to review an internal military discipline decision.while the facts of hoffman are distinguishable from the present case,hoffman is relevant to the extent that we cited leistiko and bradley as holding that national guard technicians are irreducibly military in nature.
the fifth circuit,deciding a case involving an air reserve technician,examined the facts of the challenged employment actions and concluded that the actions were military in nature.brown united states,cir.the plaintiff,brown,served as a air reserve technician art for the united states air force.id.at.because the art position required that brown also serve in the military reserves,brown served as a captain in the air force reserve.id.while serving as an art,brown filed an informal grievance.id.after the grievance was closed,brown was transferred from his civilian position twice.id.during this same period of time,brown commanding officer ordered him to active duty and required him to submit to a psychiatric evaluation which revealed that brown suffered from a severe personality disorder.id.the evaluation concluded that despite this disorder brown was qualified for worldwide duty.id.subsequently,brown was charged with misconduct and substandard performance and was honorably discharged from the air force reserve.id.after his discharge,brown was relieved of his civilian art responsibilities because he failed to meet the position requirements,maintaining reserved duty status in the air force.
brown sued the united states air force,alleging that the events leading up to his discharge and his actual discharge were discriminatory and retaliatory.id.the fifth circuit determined that and d governed the case and acknowledged that applied only to suits by civilian employees of the military departments and not to suits by members of the armed forces.id.at.the court concluded that claims arising purely from an art civilian position are provided for under title vii while claims that originate from an art military status are not cognizable.id.at.thus,employment discrimination claims involving arts,who are required to maintain both a civilian position and a military position,must be categorized as either arising from the position as a civilian employee of a military department or the position as a uniformed service member.id.at.
the appellate court concluded that brown discrimination claim constituted a claim made by a member of the uniformed services.id.the court reasoned that brown sought review of actions taken by the military that formed the basis of his military discharge and that while these actions had a civilian component,as his discharge made him ineligible for his civilian position,they were actions taken within the military sphere.id.
in leistiko,we upheld the grant of summary judgment because we found the position of a national guard technician to be irreducibly military in nature.the fifth circuit in brown suggests that the national guard technician position is not inherently military,and thus,a court may need to determine whether a plaintiff seeks review of actions that are civilian or military in nature.to some extent,plaintiff,while not citing brown in her brief,adopts the approach taken in brown,arguing that her civilian position and military position are separate and the challenged conduct in this case involves her civilian position.plaintiff contends that none of her claims relating to promotions,sexual harassment,or retaliation are related to her weekend military service.defendant responds that plaintiff is challenging conduct of superior officers which infringes on the military relationship and she is challenging promotion decisions which are central to the military hierarchy.
the ninth circuit has also analyzed the issue by focusing on whether the personnel action taken was integrally related to the military structure.in mier owens,cir,cert.denied sub,mier van dyke,d,the plaintiff was a civil service technician employed in the arizona army national guard.he served in a civilian capacity as a supply management officer and in a military capacity as a commissioned officer not on active duty.id.to maintain his civilian position,the plaintiff was required to be a member of the national guard and hold the commensurate military position.id.the plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that the adjutant of the arizona army national guard and the secretary of the army discriminated against him in violation of title vii.id.according to the plaintiff,the defendants discriminatorily denied him military promotions and suspended him from civilian employment as a result of the denial of the requisite military promotions.id.
the ninth circuit held that the discriminatory actions were personnel actions integrally related to the military structure.id.at.the mier court reasoned that 
m ilitary promotion is one of the most obvious examples of a personnel action that is integrally related to the military structure.decisions regarding who is promoted and why are central to maintenance of the military hierarchy.title vii does not allow this court to review decisions regarding the military promotion of individuals serving as guard technicians.because suspension from civilian promotion resulted from denial of the military promotion,the suspension likewise can not be reviewed.
id.concerning personnel actions in general,the court stated that c ourts regularly decline to hear lawsuits involving personnel actions integrally related to the military unique structure.id.at.the court also offered some examples of lawsuits that would involve personnel actions integrally related to the military unique structure,such as suits by an enlisted military personnel against a superior officer to recover damages for alleged constitutional violations a guard technician challenge to a military transfer a guard technician challenge to discharge by the guard and termination from technician employment suits challenging enlistment procedures suits involving concerns regarding military hierarchy
