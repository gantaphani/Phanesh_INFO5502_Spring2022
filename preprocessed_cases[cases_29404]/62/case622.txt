background 
factual background 
the facts of this case are in the court of federal claims decision.see metz.only those facts most relevant to the issues before us are repeated here.metz enlisted in the air force in,and his primary duty station was robins air force base rafb in georgia.on april,metz provided a urine sample as part of a routine,random drug screening conducted by the air force.two weeks later,he was informed that his test had returned positive for marijuana.on may,metz was formally charged with wrongful use of marijuana in violation of article of the uniform code of military justice ucmj,codified at.the charge sheet setting forth the averments against metz indicated that his case was to be tried by special.
on august,after consulting counsel,metz signed a request for discharge in lieu of trial by request in which,as the title suggests,he requested discharge in lieu of trial by.additionally,the request stated,inter alia,that metz had consulted counsel,that he was aware of the adverse nature of a discharge under other than honorable conditions,loss of veterans benefits,and that he was not requesting lengthy service probation consideration.the request was also accompanied by a second page stating that the request was metz voluntary decision made after being counseled about his rights and privileges and the possible effects of discharge under those circumstances.
in accordance with the request,metz received a discharge under other than honorable conditions from the air force on september,at which time he was credited with over sixteen years of active federal service.in,about a year after his discharge,metz had his urine sample tested for dna at a private laboratory.the laboratory technician who tested metz sample concluded that the sample contained metz dna as well as the dna of another person.
procedural history 
after receiving the results of the dna testing,metz filed a petition with the afbcmr.in his petition,metz asserted that the dna test results showed that his sample was tainted and that it could not serve as a basis for his discharge.he also requested that he be reinstated in the air force,given back pay and allowances from the date of his separation until the date of his reinstatement,and that he receive credit for the time between separation and reinstatement for purposes of pay,promotion,and retirement,and that all materials relating to the positive urinalysis results be expunged from his records.
on july,the board denied metz request without conducting a hearing,relying upon two separate grounds.first,the board found that metz had failed to produce sufficient relevant evidence to demonstrate the existence of probable error or injustice.specifically,the board focused on the lack of evidence challenging the chain of custody of metz urine sample between the time of collection and the original urinalysis screening.second,the board relied upon metz decision to submit the request rather than face 
in addition,the applicant had an opportunity to establish his innocence when the charge was preferred against him by demanding trial by thereby requiring the prosecution to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.however,he chose not to pursue instead.applicant has not provided any evidence to sufficiently convince the board that the discharge action was based on erroneous information,that pertinent regulations were violated or that he was not afforded all rights to which entitled at time of his discharge.therefore,in the absence of evidence to the contrary,we find no compelling basis to recommend granting the relief sought in this application.
in re metz,slip op.at july,initial decision.
although metz attorney,myers,had requested that the air force hold metz urine sample indefinitely,and the air force indicated that it agreed to do so,his sample was destroyed on june.after learning of his sample destruction,metz petitioned the afbcmr for reconsideration of its denial of his petition in light of the fact that the air force had destroyed his urine sample.
the board denied his reconsideration request,concluding that there was no evidence of error or injustice because the destruction of metz urine sample was a good faith mistake metz waived his right to review the laboratory procedures when he opted not to have a trial by and chose not to submit an application for lengthy service probation consideration the presence of another person dna in his sample did not prove that the positive results were tainted because the air force did not collect the sample in a environment and metz had again failed to present sufficient evidence to challenge the chain of custody.in re metz,slip op.at july.
while his request for reconsideration was pending before the board,metz filed a complaint in the court of federal claims and the proceeding was temporarily stayed pending the outcome of his reconsideration petition before the board.in his complaint,metz invoked the tucker act as the basis for that court jurisdiction.following the board reconsideration decision,the court of federal claims lifted the stay and undertook to resolve the motions that had been filed by the parties in the case,namely the government motion to dismiss or,in the alternative,for judgment upon the administrative record,and metz motion for judgment upon the administrative record.in its motion,the united states challenged the court of federal claims jurisdiction to hear metz claim based upon his voluntary withdrawal from the military and asserted that the administrative record did not justify granting the relief that metz had requested.in response to the government motion,metz asserted,for the first time,that his separation from the air force was not voluntary because he had received ineffective assistance of counsel in responding to the charges brought against him.
in considering the motions,the court of federal claims observed that the voluntariness of metz separation was an issue that tippett united states,had characterized as jurisdictional.based on its view that voluntariness was jurisdictional in nature,the court held an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether metz received ineffective assistance of counsel,even though he had failed to raise the issue before the board and the administrative record was therefore silent.the court noted that in order to possess subject matter jurisdiction over metz case,metz was required to identify some independent basis,aside from the tucker act,that entitles him to monetary payment from the federal government.the court recognized that our precedent had described the military pay act as a source of subject matter jurisdiction up to the time of a plaintiff voluntary separation or discharge,but treated the military pay act as for the period of time following a plaintiff voluntary separation.thus the result of a voluntary separation is that the court loses subject matter jurisdiction over the case.see,carmichael united states,if a discharge from service is voluntary,then the court of federal claims lacks jurisdiction to review the discharge or any back pay damages claims.adkins united states,if,however,plaintiff retirement was voluntary he retained no statutory entitlement to compensation,and thus no provision would support tucker act jurisdiction over his claim.based on evidence presented at the hearing,the court of federal claims found that metz received ineffective assistance of counsel and that therefore his request for discharge and resulting separation from the air force was involuntary.the court proceeded to rule on the parties motions for judgment upon the administrative record,ultimately granting metz motion,denying th
