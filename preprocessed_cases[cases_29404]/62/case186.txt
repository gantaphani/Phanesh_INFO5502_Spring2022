charles middleton served in the united states air force from until he was honorably discharged in december.almost four years later,in,he applied for two positions with the city of chicago.despite interviewing for both positions,middleton received neither.the city informed him in november that he had not been selected for the first job,and he never heard back about the other.
nearly thirteen years later,on july,middleton sued the city,claiming that it refused to hire him because of his military service in violation of the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act of userra,stat.codified as amended at et.on june,the district court held that middleton userra claim was barred by the catch all statute of limitations provided by a,and it granted the city motion to dismiss his fourth amended complaint.middleton filed his notice of appeal on july.
approximately three months later,on october,congress enacted the veterans benefits improvement act vbia,stat.codified in scattered sections of.relevant to this appeal,the vbia contained a provision stating that no limitations period applies to userra claims if any person seeks to file a complaint or claim with the secretary of labor,the merit systems protection board,or a federal or state court under this chapter alleging a violation of this chapter,there shall be no limit on the period for filing the complaint or claim.vbia,b.
middleton appeal raises two issues whether statute of limitations barred his claim and even if it did,whether the vbia recent amendment retroactively revives this lawsuit.we review de novo the district court order granting a rule b motion to dismiss based on the statute of limitations.dominguez hendley,cir.we accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint,see cole capital,cir,meaning that,for purposes of this appeal,we must assume that the city refused to hire middleton because of his prior military service.middleton complaint does not allege that the city engaged in improper conduct after november,and if the statute of limitations applies and is unaffected by the vbia,his claim is barred.
applicability of a to userra claims 
middleton first argues that the statute of limitations found in did not apply to his userra claim against the city.the district court disagreed and held that middleton claim was indeed.we agree with the district court.
on december,congress enacted in response to criticism regarding the lack of a uniform federal statute of limitations.see jones donnelley sons,d.among other purposes,congress sought to minimize the federal courts practice of borrowing statutes of limitations from the states.see id.the result was a catch all statute of limitations for federal claims 
except as otherwise provided by law,a civil action arising under an act of congress enacted after the date of the enactment of this section may not be commenced later than years after the cause of action accrues.
a.this text makes clear that any action arising under a federal statute enacted after december,is subject to.see jones,at.
nearly four years later,on october,congress passed userra.the statute did not include an express statute of limitations.congress only reference to a limitations period was that n o state statute of limitations shall apply to any proceeding under this chapter.userra,c.userra did not mention the federal statute of limitations in,nor did it expressly provide that claims under the new law were exempt from any limitations period altogether.
at first blush,the answer to our question appears fairly straightforward.after all,when interpreting a statute,we must begin with its text and assume that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.engine mfrs.ass coast air quality mgmt,d quotations omitted.unless congress expressed a clear intention to the contrary,a statute language is conclusive.lamie,d it is well established that when the statute language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.quoting hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,d.simply applying the language of a to userra indicates that the latter was subject to the former this is a civil action userra is an act of congress it was enacted well after a and it did not otherwise provide for a different limitations period.
as with many legal issues,however,clear solutions are easily clouded.middleton offers two arguments in an attempt to salvage his userra claim.first,he avers that userra was not enacted after,as the supreme court defined that phrase in jones,d.second,he claims that userra legislative history and the department of labor interpretation of the law indicate that congress never meant for a statute of limitations to apply.in the end,the clouds clear,and we find nothing that overcomes the plain meaning of the statutory text.
userra created a new cause of action 
we must first determine whether a cause of action under userra aris es under an act of congress enacted after december.a.although congress passed userra in,it was the latest in a series of federal laws seeking to protect the ability of our veterans to obtain employment upon returning to civilian life.according to middleton,userra did not establish a new cause of action in,but instead amended its predecessor statute,commonly referred to as the veterans reemployment rights act of vrra.see,a,stat,codified at et recodified at et by the veterans benefits act of,stat,amended by userra.because the vrra predated,middleton argues that the federal statute of limitations does not apply.
in jones,the supreme court held that a cause of action aris es under an act of congress enacted after december,therefore is governed by statute of the plaintiff claim against the defendant was made possible by a enactment.at.alteration in original.this principle governs even if the new law amended a preexisting law congress often creates new causes of action by amending existing statutes,and a is not limited to entirely new sections of the united states code.id.at.what matters is the substantive effect of an creation of new rights of action and corresponding the format in which it appears in the code.id.as the court directed,we must determine whether the plaintiff has alleged a violation of the relevant statute as it stood prior to december,or whether her claims necessarily depend on a subsequent amendment.id.at.
to answer that question,we return to the vrra,which congress passed in.the vrra provided veterans with certain rights and protections upon their return to the workforce,and it barred employment discrimination based on a reservist military service.see,a b,b,stat.the only remedy available under the vrra was injunctive relief and recovery of lost wages and benefits.id.
in,congress replaced the vrra with userra to clarify,simplify,and,where necessary,strengthen the existing veterans employment and reemployment rights provisions.i,at emphasis added,as reprinted in,see also,at noting that userra would restructure,clarify,and improve the vrra emphasis added.among other improvements,if an employer engaged in willful discrimination,userra permitted a plaintiff to seek liquidated damages,a form of relief unavailable under the vrra.see userra,c a iii.with that new provision,congress converted what had been an equitable claim into a legal one,which brought along the corresponding right to a jury trial.see maher city of,d,holding that liquidated damages under userra are punitive and therefore subject to trial by jury calderon witvoet,cir holding that actions seeking liquidated damages under a different statute are suits at common law for purposes of the seventh amendment right to a jury trial troy city of hampton,cir holding that claims under the vrra are equitable and a plaintiff is not entitled to a jury trial.consequently,userra established additional rights and liabilities that did not exist under the vrra.
middleton refers us to an unpublished district court case,decided before jones,holding that userra claims were not subject to.see akhdary city of chattanooga,wl.may.in akhdary,the district court stated,section applies only when congress establishes a new cause of action without reference to preexisting law.the userra does not establish a new cause of action instead,it amends the preexisting law of the vrra.id.at citations omitted quoting zubi v.at t,cir.but that district court reasoning is incompatible with the test the supreme court announced in jones.as the court made clear,the important concern is not whether an amendment refers to preexisting law,but the amendment substantive effect on the rights and liabilities of the parties.at.after the court decided jones,several lower courts,including a district court in our circuit and one in the same district as akhdary,have found that userra is subject to the limitations period in see wagner novartis pharm,d.july,collecting cases nino haynes int l,wl,at.
userra provided veterans the chance to seek previously unavailable remedies,an amendment that materially altered the vrra enforcement provision.the rights to liquidated damages and a jury trial were not available to middleton under the vrra,and userra created new potential liability for the city.in his operative complaint,middleton alleged that the city violation of userra was willful,and he sought all just and proper relief.such relief encompasses the new remedies that congress provided for veterans in userra.applying the supreme court reasoning in jones,middleton current claim was made possible by and necessarily depend s on userra,meaning it arose under a cause of action enacted after.see at.
legislative history and agency interpretation of userra 
perhaps recognizing the difficulty of his textual argument,middleton also turns to userra legislative history to persuade us that congress intended that no statute of limitations apply.but the only ambiguity we find concerning userra is in its legislative history,not in the statute actual language.and where a statute language is clear,we look to the legislative history only to determine whether congress expressed a clear intention to the contrary of the literal application of that language.see bowlds motors div.of the motors,cir.we find no contrary intention here.
middleton cites congressional reports to support his argument,which are often of limited use in discerning congressional intent.see conroy aniskoff,d scalia,concurring in the judgment.even so,the reports to which middleton refers us speak solely to congress intention that userra not be subject to state statutes of limitations.see.i,at,at congress expressed no desire for userra claims to be immune from a limitations period.of course,under userra predecessor,the vrra,the express provision that no state statute of limitations should apply effectively meant that no statute of limitations was no federal statute of limitations until.but userra came four years after,and congress was well aware that it had recently enacted a limitations period governing any claim under a subsequent act.we see no clear congressional intent contrary to the statutory language.
middleton also asks us to adopt the department of labor interpretation of userra.the dol is charged with promulgating rules for administering userra,a,and its position has been that the law is not subject to,see userra preamble.in the preamble to its final rule codified at,the dol noted that it has long taken the position that no federal statute of limitations applied to actions under userra but that at least one district court had reached the opposite conclusion.userra preamble.at.after considering comments on the issue,the dol stated that it would maintain its original position that no statute of limitations applied to userra,but it noted that the issue will ultimately be resolved by the courts.id.at.the dol then offered the following advice 
until the issue is resolved,potential userra plaintiffs would be well advised to file userra claims within section period.accordingly,the department has amended section to acknowledge that at least one court has held that applies to actions under userra,and that individuals asserting rights under userra should determine whether the issue of the applicability of the federal statute of limitations has been resolved and,in any event,act promptly to preserve their rights under userra.
we disagree with middleton argument that we should defer to the dol interpretation.first,we defer to an agency reasonable interpretation of a statute only where congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue through the statutory text.ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,d quoting chevron,natural res.def.council,d.that congress did not articulate a statute of limitations in userra perhaps suggests some ambiguity,but there is no ambiguity in the limitations provision of,which applies to any act of congress enacted after december,unless that law otherwise provides.congress did not otherwise provide in userra.second,in explaining its position in the preamble,the dol relied heavily on case law and the inconclusive legislative history we have just discussed.see userra preamble.at.third,although the preamble to states that the dol believes no statute of limitations applies to userra,the rule itself is much less certain userra does not have a statute of limitations,and it expressly precludes the application of any state statute of limitations.the dol is correct that userra does not have a limitations did not include an express statute of limitations within the statute.the dol rule then hedges.it explains that at least one court has applied statute of limitations,that laches may also apply,that any individual with a userra claim should determine whether this issue has been resolved by the courts,and that the individual should act promptly.id.the dol uncertainty on this issue further persuades us to withhold any deference its interpretation might otherwise be due.
accordingly,userra legislative history and the dol interpretation of the law do not convince us that congress intended to immunize userra claims from.
section applies to userra 
we recognize congress desire to protect the employment and reemployment rights of our many veterans.our country population owes a great debt to the men and women who have served to protect us.we also acknowledge that userra is to be liberally construed.davis advocate health ctr.patient care express,cir.but we are charged with interpreting the laws that congress enacts based on the language that it uses.congress enacted userra well after it created the limitations period in,and we presume that congress knew that any new federal statute would be subject to such a limitation unless it otherwise provided by law.thus,if congress wanted a different limitations period to apply to none at needed to say so.and this is precisely what congress did in,when it passed the veterans benefits improvement act,bringing us to our next the vbia applied to middleton claim.
ii.the retroactive application of the vbia 
middleton next argument is that even if applied to his userra claim when he filed it,congress recent enactment of the vbia saves his lawsuit.the district court granted the city motion to dismiss on june,middleton filed his notice of appeal on july and the vbia became effective on october.middleton now claims that congress enacted the vbia to clarify that userra was never subject to any statute of limitations,and,consequently,the new provision should revive his claim.we disagree.
a.the vbia statutory language 
we turn first to the language of the disputed legislation.the vbia struck the provision in userra that prohibited applying state statutes of limitation,formerly,as amended,at i,and replaced it with the following 
if any person seeks to file a complaint or claim with the secretary of labor,the merit systems protection board,or a federal or state court under this chapter alleging a violation of this chapter,there shall be no limit on the period for filing the complaint or claim.
f,stat,codified at b.
as we detailed above,our first stop in interpreting legislation is the language that congress employed,engine mfrs.ass n,at,and it is well established that a court should not apply a newly enacted statutory provision retroactively unless congress has c
