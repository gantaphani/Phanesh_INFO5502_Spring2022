an issue of first impression in california is raised in this dissolution action does the federal preemption doctrine prohibit the inclusion of military allowances for housing and food in a party gross income for purposes of calculating child and spousal support,since under federal law such allowances are not taxable or subject to wage garnishment we conclude the doctrine is inapplicable,as under united states supreme court authority family law support matters are within the province of state law unless congress has positively required by direct enactment that state law be.rose rose,rose.before a state law governing domestic relations will be overridden,it must do major damage to clear and substantial federal interests.ibid.we join courts across the nation in holding such allowances are included in a party gross income for purposes of support when state law encompasses them.we affirm orders denying soloman robert stanton requests for modification of awards of temporary child and spousal support to carol adrianne stanton which are based in part on his military allowances.
background 
the parties married in august,and they have a teenage son.the parties separated in and in march soloman filed for dissolution of the marriage.the dissolution was granted,effective march.
the parties had signed a stipulated marital settlement agreement msa,which purported to settle all financial issues,including support.after a hearing on september,however,the court granted soloman order to show cause osc to set aside the msa for equitable reasons,with the exception of the termination of the parties marital status.the court order states to make sure that some support orders are in effect no later than september,the court schedules a review hearing for september.
after a hearing on september,the court awarded carol per month in temporary child support.after a hearing on september,the court awarded carol in temporary spousal support soloman did not appeal those orders.
soloman is a member of the united states navy.in calculating temporary support,the court included in his gross income nontaxable military allowances,a basic allowance for housing bah and a basic allowance for subsistence bas soloman may pay stub shows he had monthly base pay of,bah of,bas of,and special duty pay of.carol income and expense declaration stated soloman had stopped paying child and spousal support and she had just begun working.she also has a young daughter.
on october,soloman filed an osc for a reduction in child support,and on november,he filed a petition for a modification of spousal support.his august pay stub showed his monthly base pay had increased to,and his bah had increased to.his bas and special duty pay remained and,respectively.carol updated income and expense declaration stated gross monthly income of as a graduate research assistant.
in his memoranda of points and authorities,the only argument soloman raised was that the court erred by including his bah and bas in his gross income.he argued the court violated the federal preemption doctrine since federal law exempts military allowances from the definition of income for federal tax purposes,and they are not subject to wage garnishment for support arrears.the memoranda also claimed his updated income and expense declaration showed changed circumstances,but he developed no argument on the matter.
after a hearing on december,the court denied soloman osc regarding child support.the court explained,i f it looks like income,it is income no matter how it paid to you.and this court has always considered bah and bas to be income.after a hearing on december,the court denied soloman motion for modification of temporary spousal support.the court again set temporary spousal support at per month.
discussion 
ifederal preemption is proper issue on appeal 
preliminarily,we address the department comment at oral argument that we need not reach the federal preemption issue because it is a legal issue,and we may affirm the december orders on the sole ground soloman presented no changed factual circumstance justifying a modification of support.since the september support orders are based in part on his bah and bas,the federal preemption issue arose then,and he did not challenge the orders on appeal and they are final.
under state law,a variety of interim,temporary orders also referred to as pendente lite relief may issue in domestic relations proceedings pending trial and ultimate judgment.hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group ch,scope note.pending final resolution of the case,the court may order one spouse to support the other and either or both parents to pay any amount necessary to support the children.as a general rule,courts will not revise a child support order unless there has been a material change of circumstances.this rule applies to any form of child support order,whether pendente lite or permanent.hogoboom king,supra.the majority view is that the same general rule applies to temporary spousal support,to.
without a changed circumstances rule,dissolution cases would have no finality and unhappy former spouses could bring repeated actions for modification with no burden of showing a justification to change the order.litigants are entitled to attempt,with some degree of certainty,to reorder their finances and life style sic in reliance upon the finality of the decree.citations.absent a change of circumstances,a motion for modification is nothing more than an impermissible collateral attack on a prior final order.in re marriage of biderman th.this is true of temporary support orders,which are directly appealable as an exception to the one final judgment rule.in re marriage of skelley cal d.
there are,however,some recognized exceptions to the general rule that collateral attack will not be allowed where there is fundamental jurisdiction as here for example,a judgment may be collaterally attacked where unusual circumstances were present that prevented an earlier and more appropriate attack.pacific mut.life ins.of cal.mcconnell cal d,in re marriage of jackson th,collateral attack not allowed absent unusual circumstances or compelling policy considerations witkin,cal.procedure ed.jurisdiction.for instance,in bierl mcmahon d,the court allowed a collateral attack on an order establishing a contingency child support fund,when the appellant personally attempted to object to the order and was told by the court to remain silent and let his attorney speak.
soloman asserts that because of the procedure the court adopted after setting aside the msa on september,scheduling a child support hearing the following day and then awarding spousal support on september at what he thought would be a review hearing he was unprepared to address the federal preemption doctrine.he submits the matter was not argued on the merits until december and,at the hearings on his osc and motion for modification.the record does show that when the court set aside the msa on september,it moved quickly to establish new support orders to avoid any gap in support.
at the hearing on soloman osc for modification of child support,the court did not prohibit him from collaterally attacking the september support orders.rather,it allowed him to thoroughly argue the merits of the federal preemption issue from this record,we may infer the court found unusual circumstances justifying a collateral attack.we conclude the court had jurisdiction to consider the issue,and its ruling is properly before us on appeal.

soloman has not met his burden.he cites no direct enactment showing congress intended to disallow a state court inclusion of military allowances such as bah and bas in a party gross income for purposes of family support.he merely string cites an assortment of federal statutes and cursorily concludes the court exceeded its authority.
soloman cites federal statutory definitions of military pay as including basic pay,special pay,retainer pay,incentive pay,retired pay,and equivalent pay,but not allowances.a.he also cites a provision of the internal revenue code that states,gross income shall not include any qualified military benefit,a.the term qualified military benefit means any allowance or benefit that a military member receives.b a.he also cites a federal statute that excludes military allowances payable pursuant to chapter of title,united states code uscs et,as prescribed by the secretaries concerned as necessary for the efficient performance of duty,from income subject to withholding in a garnishment proceeding against the united states government to satisfy support obligations.h b ii h ii,iii.
the nontaxable status of military allowances does not suggest congress had any preemptive intent with regard to either child or spousal support.in in re marriage of alter th alter,the court held recurring monetary gifts could be included in a parent gross income for support purposes even though the federal tax code excludes gifts as taxable income.the court noted section specifically includes some types of income,such as workers compensation payments,that are excluded from taxable income under the internal revenue code.alter,supra,at,subd.a.the court explained that federal tax law and state support law have different purposes.the internal revenue code does not so much define the term income as identify that which,consistent with prevailing federal tax policy,might be taxed.citation.in contrast,california child support statutes are designed to ensure that parents take equal responsibility to support their child in the manner suitable to the child circumstances.citation.section,which lists the principles to be followed by the court in setting the child support award,states that the guideline takes into account the parents actual income,not their taxable income.a parent may have income that is not taxable but that would be available for support for the child.for example,components of a personal injury award paid on account of physical injury might be considered as income for child support even though such funds are expressly excluded from gross income under the internal revenue code.alter,at.
soloman claims alter is inapplicable as it does not pertain to bah and bas.the opinion basic premise,however,is sound regardless of the nontaxable asset at issue.further,courts in other jurisdictions have persuasively rejected the notion the nontaxable character of military allowances precludes them from being included in gross income.in in re marriage of stokes stokes,an oregon statute provided that in setting support the court should consider a ll earnings,income and resources of each parent id.at,citing,subd.a.a guideline defined gross income as including expense reimbursements received in the course of employment if they were significant and reduced personal living expenses.stokes,at.similar to this state alter opinion,the court noted oregon law did not define gross income in terms of taxable income,and some listed sources of income included potentially nontaxable items such as social security and disability payments.the court also noted that a previous oregon opinion held that earned income not subject to federal income tax should nonetheless be included in gross income for support purposes.stokes,at.the stokes court held that bah and bas payments fall within the broad category of income from any source.ibid.the court added,those allowances are paid to husband in his paychecks and are available to him to spend as he desires.there is no reason why they should not be considered income for purposes of calculating husband support obligation.ibid.
in massey evans,massey,the court also reached the same conclusion as the alter court,in the context of military allowances t he purposes underlying the federal tax code and child support statutes are different.the object of the former is to calculate an individual taxable income,while the objective of the latter is to determine the amount that a parent can afford to pay for the support of his or her child.the court added various federal regulations also support the conclusion that bah and bas are part of a member compensation for military service see,cfr t otal family income for purposes of child development services includes incentive and special pay for service or anything else of value,even if not taxable,that was received for providing services,bah and bas cfr allowances for subsistence and housing are included within a member disposable earnings pursuant to usc for purposes of calculating child support allotments.federal law thus recognizes that bah,bas and the associated tax advantages of such allowances provide members of the military with a valuable employment benefit that is not reflected in their base pay.massey,at.
in state,dss ex rel.so d,the court likewise held the federal preemption doctrine is inapplicable to bas and bah payments despite their nontaxable status.the court relied in part on an article in the military law review,which states in general,all of a soldier pay and allowances should be considered as income for the purposes of setting the child support obligation.citation footnotes omitted.many soldiers live in government accommodations and eat in the mess hall for free.this in kind income may justify an upward adjustment in support owed.moreover,basic allowance for quarters baq now bah,basic allowance for subsistence bas and military payments can constitute large portions of a soldier total income.these items,however,are not taxable.if the state guidelines are based on gross pay,the soldier income should be adjusted upward to account for the increased value of nont
