in this title vii unequal pay case,esther taylor appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of her employer,secretary of the army thomas white the army.because taylor failed to identify evidence that would create a genuine question of material fact to rebut the army affirmative defense,we affirm.
taylor was a civilian employee at the army pine bluff,arkansas arsenal the arsenal.from early february through june,she worked on a temporary program known as the munitions items disposition action system or midas.taylor duties under the midas program related to the preparation of detailed technical reports to describe unwanted conventional munitions.the purpose of the midas program was to facilitate the disposal of these munitions.
taylor was not a veteran,but she had worked for the arsenal for many years before joining the midas program.she first worked for the arsenal from through,at which time she quit to raise her family.in she returned to the arsenal as a grade timekeeper in the office of the directorate of manufacturing operations between and she worked as a munitions inspector and progressed in salary and title from grade munitions inspector to grade munitions inspector in,through a formal process,she was downgraded and transferred to the arsenal directorate of product assurance as a grade quality assurance clerk.
due to application of the statutory salary retention policy of,taylor was entitled to retain her higher,grade and salary for a limited period of time following the therefore,immediately prior to joining the midas program under the directorate of product assurance in,she worked as a quality assurance clerk in the directorate of product assurance but received statutorily protected pay at the level.she does not allege that her demotion during the earlier involved discrimination or that her ranking demonstrated historical discrimination by the army.
theodis thornton and willie early were taylor male on the midas program.both were quality assurance specialists before placement with the midas program.thornton was an army veteran and arsenal employee since.early was a marine veteran and arsenal employee since.linda jones was taylor female coworker on the midas program.jones was a engineering technician.
prior to placement with the midas program,taylor,early and thornton were on the arsenal surplus roster.on the surplus roster,they faced uncertain job security.the record is not clear regarding the precise nature of this uncertainty such as the likelihood or timing of possible layoffs or demotions.however,it is undisputed that arsenal management generally attempted to fill vacant positions with surplus roster personnel to avoid layoffs.jones was not on the surplus roster prior to her placement with the midas program.
the midas program originally had the potential to be funded for three years,but was obtained as a temporary program of uncertain duration.ultimately,control over the midas program rested with the army defense ammunition center and school in savannah,illinois.local control over the midas program at the arsenal was originally held by the arsenal directorate of engineering and technology.while taylor,early,and thornton were on the surplus roster,quality assurance supervisor john hill negotiated transfer of the midas program jobs and funding from the arsenal directorate of engineering and technology to the directorate of product assurance.hill was able to obtain local control of the midas program from the directorate of engineering and technology due to poor performance by that directorate and due to a threat from savannah to withdraw the midas program and its funding from the arsenal.by securing the midas program for the directorate of product assurance,hill created positions for taylor,thornton,and early thus removing these three employees from the surplus roster.
taylor,her female coworker jones,and her male coworkers thornton and early commenced work under the midas program in late january and early february.at that time,the civilian personnel office cpo had not yet classified the midas positions and duties under the gs system.taylor,jones,thornton,and early simply assumed new duties,received limited group training,and continued to receive pay at their prior,unequal,at the level,jones at the level,and thornton and early at the level.previously,when the midas program was under the directorate of engineering and technology,one of the midas workers was a male rated at level.the record is unclear regarding the historical grades and duties of other,prior midas workers.
notwithstanding these different classifications and salaries,it is undisputed that during at a least a portion of their time together under the midas program,taylor,jones,thornton,and early performed identical work under identical conditions.when their midas work began taylor and her shared a lack of relevant experience and training.they learned to perform midas work together by trial and error and through joint training.
in the summer of,hill submitted a written description of the midas workers duties to the cpo.in addition,he claims to have recommended classification of these duties at grade.in august of,about six months after taylor and her coworkers joined the midas program,but before taylor statutory salary retention benefits expired,the cpo classified the midas positions at grade.after the classification,thornton and early maintained their grades and salaries.because jones returned to her previous position shortly before the classification,she was unaffected by the cpo action.jones maintained her grade status throughout her entire tenure with the midas program.
after the cpo classification,taylor was promoted from grade to grade.because she had been receiving statutorily protected pay at the level for two years,her three grade promotion did not appear to provide a dramatic salary increase.taylor two year benefit period under would have expired in october of had she not been promoted to the level.
jacquelyne evans,a position classification specialist from the cpo,claims that the cpo relied on hill written description to classify the midas duties at grade.taylor does not dispute that the cpo relied on hill written description.however,she alleges that reliance on the written description was irregular and notes that evans does not recall hill recommending classification at grade.in addition,taylor notes that no cpo personnel conducted a desk audit or personal interview of taylor,early,or thornton to explore the tasks involved with the performance of their midas duties.although taylor attacks the classification process,she presents no evidence to suggest that a desk audit was required,that such interviews were a mandatory part of the position classification process,or that reliance on a supervisor written description was impermissible.accordingly,although taylor has identified a question of fact regarding whether or not hill recommended classification at grade,it is clear that the cpo did not rely on any such recommendation and taylor unsupported critique of the classification process can not support an inference of discrimination.
shortly after the cpo classification,thornton acquired additional,program duties and devoted only about fifty percent of his time to the midas program.in april,he was promoted to.although thornton continued to share some duties that were identical to those of taylor and early,taylor does not allege that her workload was equal to that of thornton after the scope of his duties expanded.early continued to receive a salary under the midas program until october,when he returned to his prior,position.taylor performed the same work as early throughout this entire time but received pay at the level.taylor remained with the midas program through its termination in may.at that time she returned to a position to perform duties,but maintained her grade and salary.
in september,after taylor was promoted to grade,she met with the arsenal eeo officer to complain about the disparity between her salary and the salaries of her male coworkers.the officer made an appointment for taylor to meet with james bacon,the executive assistant and at the arsenal.in october of,bacon met with taylor and told her that he would respond at a later time.on may,after receiving no response for over six months,taylor sent bacon a memo requesting action to correct the wage disparity and requesting a status report.bacon did not respond to taylor may memo.however,in the same general time frame that bacon received taylor months after taylor first complained and over sixteen months after early placement in the midas office acted to formalize and document early status as a worker performing duties.the documentation accompanying early change of status indicated that the change was originally requested in november,was not acted upon until may,became effective may,and was to last for a period not to exceed days.after early status was formalized,he was considered a quality assurance specialist detailed to a position.
pay above the level that thornton,early,and jones received while under the midas program was not mandated by the statutory,provisions of.similarly,the pay received by taylor after she left the midas program was not mandated by statute.accordingly,it is undisputed that the arsenal employed a salary retention policy for the employees involved in this case.the details of this policy are disputed.
ultimately,taylor filed a claim with the equal employment opportunity commission followed by this suit.the district court granted summary judgment finding no evidence to rebut the army assertion of the salary retention policy as a defense to taylor claim of discrimination.
our review of the district court grant of summary judgment is de novo.the district court did not find,and the army does not contend that there is an absence of factual questions in this case.rather,the district court and the army assert that all outstanding questions of fact are immaterial.accordingly,we must examine the record to assess the materiality of the disputed facts.in conducting this examination,we consider taylor evidence to be true and draw justifiable inferences arising from the evidence in her favor.anderson liberty lobby,d.if this evidence is merely colorable,or is not significantly probative,summary judgment may be granted.id.at.internal citations omitted.thus,although taylor does not have to provide direct proof that genuine issues of fact exist for trial,the facts and circumstances that she relies upon must attain the dignity of substantial evidence and not be such as merely to create a suspicion.metge baehler,cir.in essence,the evidence must be such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson,at.
taylor alleges discrimination under title vii,a.because her allegations of discrimination relate solely to unequal pay for equal work,her claim is governed by the standards of the equal pay act,d epa.buettner arch coal sales,cir conducting analysis of a title vii claim under the framework of the epa where the alleged discrimination related solely to unequal pay for equal work see also hutchins international brotherhood of teamsters,cir and mckee dev.agency,cir.under the epa,a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case by show ing that the defendant paid male workers more than she was paid for equal work in jobs that required equal skill,effort,and responsibility and work performed under similar conditions.buettner,at.if a plaintiff makes this showing,the burden shifts to the defendant to prove one of the affirmative defenses set forth under the epa.the last of the statutory affirmative defenses set forth in the epa is a provision that excuses pay discrepancies based on any other factor other than sex d iv 
this analytical framework differs from the mcdonnell douglas burden shifting analysis mcdonnell douglas green,d.under the epa,a defendant can not escape liability merely by articulating a legitimate reason for the employment action.rather,the defendant must prove that the pay differential was based on a factor other than sex.county of washington gunther,d equal pay act litigation,therefore,has been structured to permit employers to defend against charges of discrimination where their pay differentials are based on a bona fide use of other factors other than sex.
the army summary judgment motion relies solely on the epa,factor other than sex affirmative defense.d iv.therefore,for the purpose of this motion,it is undisputed that taylor established a prima facie case under the epa.the army argues specifically that the pay discrepancy resulted from a salary retention policy intended to retain skilled workers and protect workers salaries.the army argues further that,like her two male and one female,taylor was the beneficiary of the informal salary retention policy because she was allowed to retain her grade and salary upon her return to a,position.further,unlike the other midas workers,she received and preserved a promotion under midas.the army claims that the rationale for such a salary retention policy is to retain skilled employees during periods of time when their services are not required by preventing job loss and allowing employees to perform less demanding,lower grade work without suffering a reduction in grade or salary.
taylor does not dispute the existence of a salary retention policy.she argues instead that the army raises the policy as a mere pretext to hide wage discrimination.in support of her argument,she describes the policy not as an informal system but as a system that requires documentation and provides a finite number of formal mechanisms for exchanging workers between departments and positions permanent assignments,formally documented but temporary details limited in duration to days,and undocumented,unofficial borrowing or lending of labor.she asserts that because the army did not properly document its treatment of her in accordance with the well structured system she describes,the army actions were subjective and loose and questions of fact remain regarding whether the army application of its policy was inconsistent and discriminatory.in essence,she argues that sloppiness and informality in the army execution of its salary retention policy necessarily supports an inference of discrimination.
taylor also argues that,as a matter of law,an employer should not be allowed to rely on prior salary or a salary retention policy as a defense under the epa because reliance on such factors permits the perpetuation of unequal wage structures.
the district court initially agreed with taylor and denied summary judgment,specifically finding there to be a genuine question of material fact regarding whether taylor male coworkers were detailed or assigned to the midas program.however,two days after denying summary judgment,the district court issued a second opinion in which it reversed itself.in this second opinion,the district court did not deny the existence of taylor factual questions regarding the mechanisms used for placement of her male coworkers,were the workers detailed,assigned,or loaned to the midas program.rather,the district court determined that,even after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to taylor,the outstanding questions of fact were not material because,even if resolved in favor of taylor,they did not demonstrate a deviation from gender neutrality.the court stated,plaintiff argues that early was not detailed and that defendant is grossly misrepresenting this in his briefs.i find that whether or not early was,in fact,detailed is of little significance.defendant still succeeds with his defense.the district court determined that,although taylor had demonstrated informality at the arsenal in the processing of workers movements between positions and sloppiness in the documentation of such movements,she had not presented any evidence to rebut the army claims of gender neutrality in the application of its salary retention policy.
we first address taylor general arguments that the subjective,informal nature of the army asserted policy necessarily gives rise to an inference of discrimination and that employers can not rely on salary retention policies to explain unequal pay.
this court previously has rejected the general argument that subjectivity in an employment decision necessarily supports an inference of discrimination.see elliott montgomery ward,cir t hat an evaluation process contains some subjective components can not in and of itself prove pretext or discriminatory intent.accordingly,if it is permissible to rely upon a salary retention policy,the unwritten nature of the policy or the presence of subjectivity or informality in the structure or administration of the policy can not,standing alone,support an inference of discrimination.the underlying question of whether it is permissible to rely upon a salary retention policy depends upon the meaning of the factor other than sex affirmative defense in the epa.d iv.
on its face,the epa does not suggest any limitations to the broad factor other than sex affirmative defense.the more specific factors that are systems,merit systems,and systems that measure earnings by quality or quantity of examples of the type of factors envisioned by the legislature.id.the legislative history supports a broad interpretation of the exception,listing examples of exceptions and expressly noting that the provision is necessary due to the impossibility of predicting and listing each and every exception given this facially broad exception,we are reluctant to establish any per se limitations to the factor other than sex exception by carving out specific,factors for exclusion from the exception.
while we recognize that salary retention policies might lead to wage decisions based on factors unrelated to an individual qualifications for a particular job,such policies are not necessarily gender biased.as discussed in footnote,the relevant legislative history recognizes that salary retention policies may serve legitimate,business purposes,such as the retention of skilled workers who may be needed in the future to perform higher level work.the army has raised this rationale and,in fact,thornton,early,and taylor were spared from the surplus roster due to their placement with the midas program.the undisputed evidence demonstrates that thornton,early,taylor,and jones were retained as employees at the arsenal and all four returned to positions graded at or above their prior salary grades following their placements with the midas program.
further,although we recognize that an employer might apply a salary retention policy in a discriminatory fashion or use such a policy as a vehicle to perpetuate historically unequal wages caused by past discrimination,these potential abuses do not provide valid bases to adopt a per se rule that declares all salary retention practices inherently discriminatory.rather,these risks simply highlight the need to carefully examine the record in cases where prior salary or salary retention policies are asserted as defenses to claims of unequal pay.in particular,it is important to ensure that employers do not rely on the prohibited market force theory to justify lower wages for female employees simply because the market might bear such wages.see corning glass works brennan,d holding that,although women may have been willing to work for lower wages than men and market forces therefore dictated that an employer could pay women less than men,reliance on such a market force theory nevertheless became illegal once congress enacted into law the principle of equal pay for equal work.in addition it is important to ensure that reliance on past salary is not simply a means to perpetuate historically lower wages.kouba allstate ins,cir stating that a factor like prior salary can easily be used to capitalize on the unfairly low salaries historically paid to women.
in conducting this examination,our concern is not related to the wisdom or reasonableness of the asserted defense.it is related solely to the issue of whether the asserted defense is based on a factor other than sex.d iv.we do not sit as a department that an entity business decisions.kipp.highway and trans.comm,cir.as such we are reluctant to establish a per se rule that might chill the legitimate use of policies and practices.in this regard,we reach the same conclusion as the seventh circuit which refused to adopt a per se rule that would exclude salary retention or past salary as qualifying factors other than sex.covington southern illinois,cir.
in covington,the seventh circuit determined that a university salary retention policy,differences in education,and differences in experience were all qualifying factors other than sex under d iv.the covington court stated 
we conclude that siu salary retention policy qualifies as a factor other than sex.we do not believe that the epa precludes an employer from implementing a policy aimed at improving employee morale when there is no evidence that that policy is either discriminatorily applied or has a discriminatory effect.although we realize that a plaintiff need not establish discriminatory intent to recover under the epa,we do not believe that the act precludes an employer from carrying out a policy which,although not based on employee performance,has in no way been shown to undermine the goals of the epa.
id.at.similarly,the ninth circuit has held that,the equal pay act does not impose a strict prohibition against the use of prior salary.kouba,at.
in kouba,the ninth circuit found that the per se rejection of reliance on prior salary as a factor other than sex would be inconsistent with congress decision to adopt a broad,affirmative defense.however,the court in kouba ultimately remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the employer consideration of past salary was reasonable.the court stated,a pragmatic standard,which protects against abuse yet accommodates employer discretion,is that the employer must use the factor reasonably in light of the employer stated purpose as well as its other practices.id.at.therefore although the court in kouba refused to adopt a bright line rule against reliance on salary retention or past salary as factors other than sex,it was willing to sit in review of the employer decisions.this reasonableness level of review is greater than that provided in the seventh circuit and greater than that which we believe to be required under title vii and the epa.as noted above,we do not sit as a super personnel department and we do not review the wisdom of an employer chosen means to accomplish its goals.like kouba,we believe a careful review of the record is required.however,we would limit that review to a search for evidence that contradicts an employer claims of.
in contrast to covington and kouba,the eleventh circuit in glenn general motors,cir did state a bright line prohibition against reliance on prior salary except in limited,exigent circumstances.in glenn,the pay discrepancy arose from a facially policy purportedly intended to promote the switch of hourly employees to salaried positions.under the policy,general motors guaranteed hourly employees that they would not suffer a drop in pay if they would switch from hourly to salaried positions.as a result of the policy,some male employees who switched to salaried positions received higher wages than newly hired,female salaried employees and female salaried employees who had not switched from hourly positions.the court in glenn rejected gm policy as an affirmative defense stating that gm was attempting to rely on a market force theory,a theory based on the belief that labor market supply and demand dictates that women may be paid less than men.glenn,at citing corning glass works,at.
the glenn court found further support for its position by adopting a limited reading of the legislative history that we quote above at note.house comm.on equal pay act of,reprinted in cong.admin.news,for instance,it is not uncommon for an employer who must reduce help in a skilled job to transfer employees to other less demanding jobs but to continue to pay them a premium rate in order to have them available when they are again needed for their former jobs.glenn interpreted the reference to the retention of skilled workers as only applying in special exigent circumstances.glenn,at the legislative history thus indicates that the factor other than sex exception applies when the disparit
