background 
we begin with the regulatory scheme that frames this case.under the veterans preference act of,stat.codified at,a preference eligible who has been separated or furloughed without delinquency or misconduct,on request,is entitled to have his name placed on appropriate registers and employment lists for every position for which his qualifications have been established.a.the office of personnel management opm has adopted regulations to implement the requirements of section.the regulations are codified at.
sections require that each agency maintain a reemployment priority list rpl and establish guidelines for the operation of its rpl.under section a,employees entered on an rpl enjoy,at a minimum,priority consideration over certain outside job applicants.the regulations provide that an agency may not make a final commitment to an individual not on the rpl to fill a permanent or temporary competitive service position when a qualified individual is available on the agency rpl,unless the first individual is on the agency rolls.b,c.
section b requires that each agency establish and maintain a reemployment priority list for each commuting area in which it separates eligible competitive service employees by rif,except as provided by paragraph c of this section.the section c exception states 
an agency need not maintain a distinct rpl for employees separated by reduction in force if the agency operates a placement program for its employees and obtains opm concurrence that the program satisfies the basic requirements of this subpart.the intent of this provision is to allow agencies to adopt different placement strategies that are effective for their particular programs yet satisfy legal entitlements to priority consideration in reemployment.
thus,the regulations require that an agency maintain either an rpl or an alternative program that has obtained opm concurrence or,put another way,approval.
although agencies must maintain an rpl under sections a and b or an equivalent program under section c,the regulations do not mandate that employees participate in available agency reemployment programs.section clarifies that placement on an agency rpl is not automatic.in order to be entered on an rpl,an employee must first complete an application within the time frame set forth in section a.section a provides 
to be entered on the rpl,an eligible employee under must complete an application registration may take place as soon as a specific notice of separation under part of this chapter,or a certification of expected separation as provided in of this chapter,has been issued.the employee must submit the application within calendar days after the rif separation date.an employee who fails to submit a timely application is not entitled to be placed on the rpl.
even though an employee is not entitled to automatic entry on the rpl,he or she is entitled to receive information from the agency that may aid the employee in applying for the rpl.pursuant to b,at the time employees receive notices of separation or certifications of expected separation ces s,the agency must give each eligible employee information about the rpl,including appeal rights.
the regulations also establish qualification requirements for placement through the rpl.in order to be appointed to an open position through the rpl an employee must meet all the requirements set forth in section a.section a provides 
subject to applicable requirements of law and this chapter,an individual is considered qualified for a position if he or she 
meets or approved qualification standards and requirements for the position,including any minimum educational requirements,and any selection placement factors established by the agency 
is physically qualified,with reasonable accommodation where appropriate,to perform the duties of the position and 
meets any special qualifying condition that opm has approved for the position.
meets any other applicable requirement for appointment to the competitive service.
as noted above,section b requires priority treatment for qualified individuals on an agency rpl.however,section a gives an agency some discretion to establish selection placement factors.in the august operating manual for qualification standards for general schedule positions operating manual for qualification standards,opm notes that selective placement factors include specialized agency requirements such as specific training or educational requirements for a particular position.for example,an agency may require knowledge of economics for an economist position.the operating manual for qualification standards also notes that an agency may require that an employee have an appropriate license,registration,or certification for a particular position.therefore,selection placement factors appear to be requirements that are tailored for a particular position.further,subsection b of section contains an exception that allows an agency,under certain enumerated conditions,to adopt an alternative qualification standard other than the one set forth in subsection a.section b expressly notes,however,that this exception does not authorize a waiver of the selection order required by.
section establishes two permissible selection order methods for operating an rpl.these methods are set forth in section b,entitled retention standing order,and section c,entitled rating and ranking.if an agency chooses to follow the retention standing order method described in subsection b,the agency is required to place qualified individuals in group and subgroup order in accordance with part of this chapter.id.b emphasis added.if the agency chooses the rating and ranking option set forth in subsection c,then the agency is required to rate qualified individuals according to their job experience and education.id.c emphasis added.thus,both of the selection order options set forth in section c refer to qualified individuals.section d creates an exception that allows an agency to appoint an individual who is either not on the rpl or has a lower standing than others on the rpl to a position when it is necessary to obtain an employee for duties that can not be taken over without undue interruption.
employee appeal rights are established by section,which states 
an individual who believes that his or her reemployment priority rights under this subpart have been violated because of the employment of another person who otherwise could not have been appointed properly may appeal to the merit systems protection board under the provisions of the board regulations.
turning to the facts of this case,sturdy was working as a resource management specialist for the army at fort chaffee,arkansas,when he received a notice,dated april,informing him that he would be subject to an rif effective september.at the time of the rif,the department of defense dod,of which the army is a part,operated both an rpl and a separate priority placement program ppp.it is undisputed that the ppp was not.
after receiving the notice,sturdy took action to increase his chances of finding a new position before the rif took effect.in that regard,he registered for the ppp.he did not apply for the rpl,however.
after being registered for the ppp in may of,sturdy applied for one of three open environmentalist positions at fort chaffee,for which he was rated qualified.the army found that he was not well qualified for the environmentalist positions,however,and hired three external applicants instead.these applicants were not registered on the rpl or on the ppp.sturdy ultimately accepted reassignment through the ppp to a conservation specialist position at fort worth,texas,in august of.because his reassignment took effect prior to the september,rif,sturdy was never separated by the rif.both sturdy former position as resource management specialist and his new position as conservation specialist were at grade and carried the same pay.
sturdy appealed to the board on october,claiming that the army violated his reemployment priority rights when it did not select him for one of the three environmentalist positions at fort chaffee,arkansas.in an initial decision,the administrative judge aj to whom the case was assigned dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because sturdy had not registered for the rpl,although he noted sturdy contention that the army told him that he would be registered on the rpl as of the date of his separation pursuant to the rif.sturdy dep t of the army,no,slip op.at.
sturdy petitioned the board for review of the initial decision.on sturdy petition for review,the board,citing stuck department of the navy,stated a n agency may maintain both an rpl and a ppp,and the board has held that,pursuant to,it has jurisdiction to review an alleged violation of reemployment priority rights under a ppp.sturdy dep t of the army,sturdy i,reh g granted,table sturdy rehearing decision,rev,sturdy dep t of the army,sturdy ii.the board thus agreed with sturdy that his failure to register for the rpl did not necessarily deprive the board of jurisdiction over his appeal.id.however,the board affirmed the aj dismissal of sturdy appeal for lack of jurisdiction on the alternative ground that an employee could only appeal an alleged violation of reemployment priority rights if the employee was separated from his or her position by an rif,which was not the case with sturdy.id.
the board decision in sturdy i was appealed.while the appeal was pending,the government filed a motion requesting a remand to the board,so that the board could address how changes in a affected the board jurisdiction over an employee who,like sturdy,had been notified of an impending rif,but was never actually separated from his or her position.see eligibility due to reduction in force.may,we granted the government request.sturdy rehearing decision,at.
on remand,the board with its full complement of members deferred to the view of opm that separation by an rif was not necessary for jurisdiction over an appeal of rpl rights under.sturdy ii,at.the board then ruled that it had jurisdiction even though sturdy had not registered for the rpl because the army misinformation about the rpl caused sturdy not to register for it id.at.based upon its ruling,the board remanded the case to the aj for adjudication of the merits of sturdy reemployment priority rights claim.
the aj ruled in the initial decision on remand that the army had not violated sturdy reemployment priority rights when it found that sturdy was not well qualified for an environmentalist position.initial decision,slip op.at.sturdy timely petitioned for review of the initial decision by the full board.in an order issued september,the two sitting members of the board,chairman mcphie and member marshall,failed to agree on the disposition of the petition for review.sturdy iii.under b,the initial decision thereby became the final decision of the board.
in the september,order,chairman mcphie expressed his view that the board had jurisdiction because sturdy failure to register for the rpl was due to agency misinformation.sturdy iii,at.despite the fact that the board had jurisdiction over sturdy appeal,chairman mcphie would have affirmed the aj decision on the merits because,in his view,the agency did not err in finding that sturdy was not well qualified.id.at.member marshall,on the other hand,would have dismissed sturdy appeal for lack of jurisdiction.in her view,sturdy appeal failed to meet the jurisdictional requirements of for two reasons i sturdy was never separated or demoted pursuant to an rif and ii sturdy was not registered under either an rpl or an ppp.id.at.
sturdy timely appealed the decision of the board to this court.we have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to a.
discussion 
we will overturn a board decision only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence.c.we review the board findings regarding questions of law,including jurisdiction,without deference to the board.carley dep t of the army,citing diefenderfer merit.prot.
we first address the jurisdictional issues in the case.on appeal,the government does not argue,as it did below,that the board lacked jurisdiction because sturdy was never separated by an rif.rather,the government argues that the board lacked jurisdiction because sturdy failed to register for the rpl or an ppp.additionally,the government argues that the board erred in sturdy ii in concluding that it could exercise jurisdiction over sturdy appeal because his failure to register for the rpl was the result of misinformation from the army.
preliminarily,even though the government does not challenge the board jurisdiction on the ground that sturdy was not separated in the rif,we must address the issue.the parties may not confer jurisdiction by consent and we must be satisfied that the board did have jurisdiction.see dunklebarger merit.prot,a n agency can not by acquiescence confer jurisdiction on the merit systems protection board to hear an appeal that congress has not authorized the board to entertain.
as noted above,the board ruled in sturdy ii that it had jurisdiction,notwithstanding that sturdy had not been separated in the rif.at.it did so after considering the advisory opinion that it had requested from opm on the question.id.in its advisory opinion,opm stated that s ince,opm has notified agencies that rpl appeal rights for employees accrue at the time they have been specifically notified that they are to be separated based on a rif and are registered on the rpl.thus,it was opm position that,even prior to the amendment to section a,an employee had appeal rights prior to being rifed.according to opm,the amendment merely changed the timing of accrual to allow employees to acquire rpl appeal rights after receiving a ces.based upon opm views,the board reasoned that separation by rif is not a jurisdictional requirement for an appeal of reemployment priority rights.sturdy ii,at.the board noted that opm interpretation was neither plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the regulations.id.further,the board was persuaded that public policy favored allowing an employee to appeal reemployment priority rights prior to the employee separation by an rif.id.we see no error in the board ruling on this jurisdictional point.opm position and the board ruling are consistent with the language of a.
the jurisdictional arguments that the government does make are resolved by roberto department of the navy,decided today.in roberto,we hold that the board has jurisdiction under over a reemployment priority rights claim that is asserted by an individual who registered for either an rpl or an ppp.we also hold that the board has jurisdiction under section over a reemployment priority rights claim that is asserted by an individual who did not register for an rpl when his or her employing agency failed to provide the individual with correct information about the rpl as required by b.
turning to this case,sturdy was not registered on the rpl,and the ppp in which he did register is not.however,in sturdy ii,the board held that it had jurisdiction because sturdy failure to register on the rpl was the result of misinformation he received from the army.sturdy ii,at.as noted,the board based its finding that sturdy had been misinformed on i sturdy affidavit stating that the army led him to believe that he would be entered on the rpl as of the date of his separation by the rif and ii the deficiencies in the description of the rpl that the army provided to sturdy with his rif notice.id.in particular,the board noted that the army did not provide any information,verbally or in the information sheet attached to sturdy rif notice,concerning when he would be registered or allowed to register for the rpl.id.we see no reason to disturb the board finding that the army misinformed sturdy.the board decision is supported by substantial evidence in the form of sturdy affidavit and the contents of the rpl information sheet provided to sturdy with his rif notice.thus,the board properly exercised jurisdiction over sturdy appeal under because his failure to register for the rpl was excused due to misinformation he received from the army concerning the rpl,in violation of b.
as far as the merits are concerned,sturdy argued before the board that because he was rated qualified for the environmentalist positions,he would have been selected for one of the positions had the agency accorded him proper selection consideration pursuant to before it considered the applications of the selected outside candidates.sturdy urged that it was improper for the agency to use a well qualified standard as a selection placement factor under.the aj found,however,that the army did not violate sturdy reemployment priority rights by hiring three outside candidates for the environmentalist positions.initial decision,slip op.at.in reaching that conclusion,the aj relied on the declaration of vicki kosechata,personnel management specialist and fort sill directorate of personnel in her declaration,kosechata stated that under both the rpl and the ppp,as applied at fort sill,candidates for a particular position must be more than merely qualified.they must be well qualified,slip op.at.
the aj first determined that the well qualified standard used in the ppp would be a valid standard if used to administer an rpl,slip op.at.the aj concluded that under,which govern the administration of rpls,it is permissible for an agency to utilize a well qualified standard.the aj noted that section a permits an agency to establish its own selection placement factors,slip op.at.the aj reasoned that even if the well qualified requirement was a standard rather than a selection placement factor under section a,the requirement still was valid because section b permits an agency to adopt alternative standards for administering an rpl,slip op.at.the aj found that nothing in the language of section b barred the army fort sill from adopting a heightened qualification standard like the well qualified standard rather than a lowered qualification standard,slip op.at.after determining that the well qualified requirement complied with the rpl regulations,the aj ruled that the army had not erred when it applied the well qualified requirement to sturdy,slip op.at.the aj found that the army had demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that sturdy was not well qualified for the environmentalist positions at fort chaffee,slip op.at.
on appeal,sturdy argues that the well qualified requirement utilized by the ppp and the rpl comprises an impermissible heightened standard under.as he did before the board,he urges that by applying a heightened well qualified standard,the army violated his reemployment priority rights under sections.according to sturdy,the dod heightened well qualified standard effectively eliminates any priority.he asserts that pursuant to b and a,an individual simply must be qualified,rather than well qualified.in addition,sturdy contends that even if the dod well qualified requirement was a permissible alternative standard under section b,the army had to comply with the selection method outlined in.sturdy urges that because section requires that qualified candidates on an rpl be considered for a position in a particular order relative to other candidates,the agency refusal to consider sturdy because he was not well qualified violated section.although sturdy raises the issue of the validity of the well qualified standard,he does not argue on appeal that the aj erred in finding that he was not well qualified for the environmentalist positions.
the government contends that the aj correctly found that the well qualified requirement used by the army at fort sill constituted a permissible agency selection placement factor pursuant to a.according to the government,the well qualified requirement is a selection placement factor because it places a premium on factors such as the applicant training and experience.in the alternative,the army contends that section b authorizes the use of a well qualified requirement as an alternative qualification standard.
the question before us is whether the army violated sturdy reemployment priority rights under by not hiring him for one of the three environmentalist positions at fort chaffee because,although he was qualified for the positions,he was not well qualified for them.more precisely,the question is whether the army violated sturdy reemployment priority rights under the dod rpl.there are two reasons for this.first,although sturdy was enrolled in the dod ppp and was considered for the environmentalist positions under the ppp and not under the rpl,the ppp was not approved by opm.therefore,it is not governed by the regulations at.as a result,sturdy argument that the ppp well qualified requirement does not comply with sections fails because the ppp is not subject to the regulations.in addition,under roberto,the board was without jurisdiction to consider any claims arising under the ppp.second,the board found that sturdy failure to register for the dod rpl was the result of misinformation he received from the army.under roberto,as a result of this finding,the board had jurisdiction under to determine whether sturdy reemployment priority rights under the rpl were violated.
whether sturdy rpl rights were violated comes down to a hypothetical question.the question is this if sturdy had registered for the rpl would he have been selected for one of the three environmentalist positions before answering this question,however,we must decide whether it would have been proper for the army to apply a well qualified standard under the dod rpl.if it would have been proper to apply the well qualified standard,then it is clear that sturdy would not have been selected.that is because it is undisputed that he was qualified for the positions,but not well qualified.if however,it would not have been proper for the army to use the well qualified standard under the dod rpl,the matter boils down to whether sturdy would have been selected for one of the positions under the proper standard.if the answer to that question is yes,then his reemployment priority rights were violated.
we begin with the pertinent provisions of the rpl itself.the rpl is set forth in subchapter of the department of defense civilian personnel manual dod cpm.the paragraphs of the rpl are designated sc.subparagraph states that,among other things,subchapter implements dod policy under part of title of the code of federal regulations.subparagraph provides that,within dod,eligible rpl applicants shall be provided priority consideration for reemployment in accordance with the provision of subchapter.at the same time,subparagraph instructs that rights provided under the rpl pursuant to subchapter and part,including the right of appeal to the board,are separate and distinct from those provided pursuant to the dod ppp.the paragraph adds that t he ppp and the rpl operate independently.
paragraph sets forth eligibility requirements for the rpl.it states that individuals who meet the conditions enumerated in paragraph it notes are specified in and may receive reemployment consideration under the rpl.subparagraph states that an individual is eligible for placement on the rpl if he or she r eceived a performance rating above unacceptable,or equivalent,on the last annual performance rating of record for the rif.finally,subparagraph,which deals with selection order,states that w hen a qualified rpl applicant is present on an activity rpl,an activity may not make new appointment unless the appointee is a q
