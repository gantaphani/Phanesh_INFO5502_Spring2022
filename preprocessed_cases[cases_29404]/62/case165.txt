this appeal,arising from a dispute between a law firm that represented qui tam plaintiffs and the defendant shipbuilders,raises the issue of whether the district court exceeded its discretion in awarding attorneys fees of under the false claims act.the plaintiff,a cincinnati law firm,contends that the amount was unjustifiably low,while the defendants urge this court in a to find the lower court award excessive.two additional issues are before us first,the defendants challenge the plaintiff standing to bring this suit and second,the plaintiff argues that portions of the defendants reply brief for the contravene fed.c.
the plaintiff has standing to appeal the lower court decision,while the plaintiff motion to strike portions of the reply brief is denied for failing to show prejudice.turning to the substantive issues raised by both parties,we hold that,with the exception of the exclusion of fees related to the fee litigation,the district court calculation of attorneys fees falls within the broad discretion afforded under the statutory scheme.consequently,with the exception of its ruling on the fee litigation issue,the district court decision is affirmed.
the law firm of helmer,martins,rice popham,hmrp represented relators tina and william gonter from until march,in an investigation of faulty valves produced by hunt valve company for use in submarines and ships built for the navy by northrop grunman newport news and general dynamics electric boat collectively shipbuilders.in march,the relators filed a false claims act fca action against hunt valve company and the shipbuilders.the department of justice intervened in the hunt valve prerogative under the ultimately announced a settlement with the company in the spring of.this settlement resulted from a collaboration between the department of justice and the private attorneys representing the relators.the department of justice did not,however,choose to intervene in the suit against the shipbuilders,which allowed the relators to prosecute the case as qui tam plaintiffs on the taxpayers behalf.
in january,two attorneys,frederick morgan and jennifer verkamp,and one paralegal,mary jones,left hmpr to join another firm,volkema,thomas,miller,scott merry volkema.because morgan and verkamp had spearheaded the work on the fca claims,the relators chose to conclude hmrp representation in march and continue with volkema.that fall,the by a million settlement with the shipbuilders,the details of which were finalized in march.
on december,hmrp filed a motion for an award of attorneys fees and expenses for the considerable work it performed from until early in preparing and settling the fca claims against both hunt valve and the shipbuilders.the district court denied the initial petition on two grounds first,the request was premature,and second,the fca statute only permits relators to file attorneys fee petitions.shortly thereafter,the through another petition on behalf of hmrp for attorneys fees and expenses.in the petition,hmrp sought in attorneys fees and in reimbursable expenses,for a total of.the shipbuilders allowed that they owed fees and expenses,but argued that the amount should total,representing in attorneys fees and in expenses.after considering the evidence offered by both parties,the district court ultimately awarded hmrp fees of and expenses of,for a total amount of.
in this appeal,the plaintiff,hmrp,argues that the district court abused its discretion in the following three ways by using allegedly unsubstantiated billing rates instead of current,rates by refusing to award attorneys fees for litigation related to the fee petition itself and by refusing to enhance the award by for exceptional results.the defendant shipbuilders filed a,contending that the district court failed to exercise appropriate discretion in calculating the number of hours billed by the plaintiff specifically,they fault the lower court for sufficient in the lodestar valuation that were allegedly duplicative,unrelated to the litigation,or wasteful.
iii.jurisdiction over the appeal 
the district court exercised subject matter jurisdiction over the federal question involved in this,the false claims act.see a.appellate jurisdiction exists under,as the district court issued a final order in this case.the shipbuilders contend,however,that only the relators could bring this appeal and that the case should thus be dismissed because hmrp is an improper party.for the reasons discussed below,the plaintiff does have standing to proceed.
the false claims act,d,provides for and includes both attorneys fees and expenses as part of the award to a successful qui tam plaintiff.the fca reads in relevant part such person qui tam plaintiff shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred,plus reasonable attorneys fees and costs.all such expenses,fees,and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.d.notably,only the plaintiff has the power to demand that the defendant pay the fees of the plaintiff attorney under the fca without such a demand,the defendant is under no obligation to pay.united states ex rel.virani jerry lewis truck parts,cir,cert.denied,d.once the power is exercised,however,the attorneys right vests,and the defendant duty becomes fixed.id.at.because the relators,through a motion filed by volkema,did seek attorneys fees on behalf of hmrp,the defendants duty to pay such fees vested.
the defendants point to several instances where courts have denied requests for attorneys fees to support their argument.but in each of the cases the defendants cite,the court refused attorneys fees because the relators never sought them.see,united states ex rel.thornton science applications int l,d,noting that because the relators did not request attorneys fees,their counsel lacked standing.these cases are thus inapposite to our case,where the relators filed a fee petition on behalf of the plaintiff.moreover,the cases do not address the question before us regarding standing on appeal,but instead discuss the ability to recover an award in district court.
whether hmrp has standing to appeal the district court ruling is an issue of first impression in the sixth circuit.other circuits have addresses this issue,but have reached different results.compare mathur board of trustees of southern illinois university,cir finding standing,and lipscomb wise,cir finding standing,with willis government accountability office,denying standing.in mathur,a case involving the civil rights act,the plaintiff employee won a discrimination suit against a university that included an award of attorneys fees.the not the the district court choice of rates in determining the award.while the seventh circuit noted that the right to fees belonged to the prevailing party and not his counsel,it did not find that this fact precluded counsel from having standing.mathur,at see also devlin scardelletti,d the supreme court has never restricted the right to appeal to named parties to the litigation.instead,the seventh circuit applied the following reasoning in determining that mathur attorneys did have standing to appeal the award 
since an attorneys fee award is considered part of the costs of litigation the award goes straight from the plaintiff to counsel and is not intended to serve as additional compensation for plaintiffs.this means that the question whether the motion for fees is in the name of the party or his attorney is a technicality,because it would exalt form over substance to deny the motion for fees if an attorney,and not the plaintiff,is the named party.
mathur,at quoting lowrance hacker,cir emphasis added.the fifth circuit addressed a similar question in lipscomb wise,cir.there,several attorneys involved in a class action lawsuit appealed a lower court ruling denying them standing to seek attorneys fees.the fifth circuit found that the attorneys did have standing because they had alleged a personal stake in the outcome and would potentially suffer an economic injury in fact.lipscomb,at denying the request for attorneys fees on other grounds.
the federal circuit reached a different result in willis government accountability office,where,again,an not the prevailing party,plaintiff appealed a gao decision denying additional attorneys fees under g.the willis court held that because the plaintiff did not file the appeal,the attorney lacked standing.at.notably,however,the plaintiff in willis specifically refused to request the entire amount of fees sought by the attorney when he filed the initial petition seeking fees.id.at.willis is thus distinguishable from the instant case where the relators fee petition did include the entire amount sought by hmrp.consequently,in our case,but not in willis,the right to larger amount vested in counsel.
the fifth and seventh circuits treatment of the issue is persuasive.as an initial observation,both the relators and volkema had fully resolved their fca claims to contingency fees and attorneys fees,respectively,prior to this appeal consequently,as in mathur,the district court any additional only affect hmrp interests.see also lipscomb,at a s a practical matter,the lawyer is frequently the only person adversely affected when attorney fees are denied.because the district court awarded hmrp fees lower than the amount sought in the petition,the firm has suffered a putative injury in fact.additionally,unlike the situation in willis,the relators in the instant case did implicitly approve the entire amount sought by hmrp when it filed the original fee petition for the full amount.to refuse standing,therefore,would be to tantamount to exalt ing form over substance.mathur,at.an alternate holding would,moreover,potentially jeopardize the availability of sufficiently reasonable fees to attract competent representation and,by extension,the ability to vindicate the goals of the fca.see,sess,cong,the committee intent in amending the qui tam section of the false claims act is to encourage more private enforcement suits.consequently,in concluding that hmrp does have standing to bring this appeal,we reiterate our earlier observation that w hen they are the real parties in interest,attorneys are entitled to their day in court.price pelka,cir quoting lipscomb,at.
iv.calculation of fee award 
standard of review 
the district court award of in attorneys fees and expenses covered work performed by hmrp over a period.in seeking additional fees,the plaintiff argues that the district court should have applied the firm,rates instead of allegedly unsubstantiated historic rates from.additionally,the plaintiff urges this court to find that the district court refusal to include litigation in the award and to apply a enhancement for exceptional success constituted abuses of discretion.conversely,the shipbuilders contend that numerous hours submitted for compensation were either unrelated to the underlying fca claim,duplicative,or wasteful,and that the district court exceeded its discretion by failing to adequately address these issues.
this court reviews a district court award of attorneys fees and expenses for abuse of discretion.geier sundquist,cir citing perotti seiter,cir.an abuse of discretion exists when the district court applies the wrong legal standard,misapplies the correct legal standard,or relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact.first tech.safety,depinet,cir.
reasonable fees 
in an attorneys fee case,the primary concern is that the fee awarded be reasonable.reed rhodes,cir citing blum stenson,d.a reasonable fee is adequately compensatory to attract competent counsel yet which avoids producing a windfall for lawyers.geier,at emphasis added see also coulter tennessee,cir h ourly rates for fee awards should not exceed the market rates necessary to encourage competent lawyers to undertake the representation in question.the starting point for determining a reasonable fee is the lodestar,which is the product of the number of hours billed and a reasonable hourly rate.see hensley eckerhart,d.the district court calculation of the lodestar value,as well as any justifiable upward or downward departures deserves substantial deference,but only when the court provides a clear and concise explanation of its reasons for the fee award.eckerhart,at.hadix johnson,cir.
hmrp objects to the lower court use of billing rates in three ways.first,the firm contends that the district court award applied a twenty percent reduction that was unsupported by the evidence in the case.second,the firm suggests that the district court erred as a matter of law by using rates instead of the current,billing rates.and third,the plaintiff argues that the rates used by the district court were unsubstantiated and thus based on clearly erroneous findings of fact.
to justify any award of attorneys fees,the party seeking compensation bears the burden of documenting its work.reed,at citing webb county bd.of,d.in the instant case,the plaintiff submitted considerable on its billing its claim for a lodestar amount of.the district court reasoned,however,that to award such an amount would be tantamount to a windfall for counsel,as the bulk of the legal work occurred from dist.op.at.at the same time,the court noted that in order to ensure adequate compensation for the plaintiff it would compensate hmrp for waiting several years for payment,by awarding rates for the work done in,and.id.at.the court then applied the rate to the number of hours,supported by hmrp fee petition having provided a clear and concise explanation for its fee award,the lower court did not exceed its discretion in fact,the district court appropriately balanced the twin goals of ensuring adequate compensation for counsel who take on fca cases and preventing a windfall for lawyers.
the decision to apply historic,rates was similarly within the district court discretion.we have occasionally approved the application of current billing rates when doing so was appropriate in reaching a reasonable fee.see,barnes city of cincinnati,cir finding the current market rates reasonable because the litigation had been ongoing for nearly six years arthur langenderfer,johnson,cir noting that current rates were appropriate to counterbalance a delay in payment reversed on other grounds.but barnes does not stand for the proposition that this court even of current rates rather,as the barnes court itself stated,the application of current rates was within the contemplation of the attorneys fees statute.at see also louisville black police officers organization,louisville,cir w e reiterate today that the district courts retain their discretion in such matters constrained only by their duty to achieve the goal enunciated in northcross to make an award of fees which is adequate to attract competent counsel,but which does not produce windfalls to attorneys.citing northcross,at.accordingly,the district court has the discretion to choose either current or historical rates so long as it explains how the decision comports with the ultimate goals of awarding reasonable fees.here,the district court appropriately justified how its award balanced the competing goals at issue in calculating reasonable fees the court believes that while hmrp is entitled to some adjustments for waiting several years for compensation,the use of current rates would produce a windfall.dist.op.at.
and finally,the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining the rates,which it then used in the lodestar calculation.as we described in geier sundquist,t o arrive at a reasonable hourly rate,courts use as a guideline the prevailing market rate,defined as the rate that lawyers of comparable skill and experience can reasonably expect to command within the venue of the court of record.at citing secretary of treasury,cir.the appropriate rate,therefore,is not necessarily the exact value sought by a particular firm,but is rather the market rate in the venue sufficient to encourage competent representation.see lamar adver.charter twp.of van buren.cir even if it would be reasonable to award plaintiff per hour,the record supports the district court conclusion that per hour is sufficient to encourage competent lawyers in the relevant community to undertake legal representation.see also auto alliance customs service,cir awarding a per hour flat rate in the eastern district of mich
