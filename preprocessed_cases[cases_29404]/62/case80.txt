at approximately on june,two sergeants in the united states army found private first class tammy ivon near death in the parking lot adjacent to the enlisted service members barracks at the united states army airfield in giebelstadt,germany.when ivon was found,her legs were protruding from under a pickup truck,and her jeans had been pulled down to her ankles.one of the sergeants noticed a man whom he identified as brosius staring at him from a nearby road.after several seconds,brosius,who had been a close friend of ivon,walked away.a short time later,ivon died.
an autopsy revealed that ivon had been stabbed times,four times in the chest,five times in the abdomen,and once near each eye.ivon car was found parked next to the pickup,and the back seat of the car was stained with blood.the log for a gate on the base showed that ivon car had returned at with two occupants.a witness who had passed ivon car at about stated that the windows were fogged,he heard a grunt or groan coming from inside,and he thought that the occupants were having sex.
numerous witnesses described brosius behavior during the hours after ivon body was found.a witness who saw him at described him as shocked and dazed.at,he told another witness that he had just come from working out in the gym although the gym was closed at the time.he told another witness that a girl who had given him a ride home two hours earlier was dead and that he suspected her boyfriend.brosius then reportedly threatened to kill the boyfriend.a short time later,when another witness asked brosius if he had heard about ivon death,brosius said that he had not.brosius then went to the laundromat and told a witness who later testified for the prosecution that ivon had given him a ride home that night and that he might have been the last person to see her alive.he said that he had heard that she had been stabbed times.he told another witness who testified for the defense that a third person had accompanied ivon and him when they drove back to the base.at,he awakened his roommate,screaming that ivon boyfriend had killed her.
word reached brosius first sergeant that brosius had been with the victim on the night of her murder,and the first sergeant then provided this information to agents from the criminal investigation division cid.brosius was called to the orderly room,and special agents douglas allen and tyrone robinson took brosius into the first sergeant office and spoke with him.brosius stated that on the night of the murder,ivon had driven another soldier and him back to the base from a local club.when special agent allen asked the identity of the third person,brosius replied that he did not wish to say anything about it.according to special agent allen,brosius then requested to have a lawyer,his first sergeant,or some other third party present to witness his statement.according to brosius,he asked to have a lawyer present,but brosius admitted that it was possible that he might have also mentioned his first sergeant.special agent allen told brosius that there were lawyers at the cid headquarters the river building in wuerzburg and that if he wanted to speak to a lawyer or someone else,he should go there.sergeant pickett,brosius section sergeant,drove him to the river building.sergeant pickett and brosius were acquaintances.app.
at the river building,special agent mark nash questioned brosius without administering any warning of rights.special agent nash told brosius that the victim boyfriend was the main suspect and that if brosius was worried about rights or anything being violated,if you start to say anything that we think would be incriminating against you,we would stop you and advise you of your rights.app.special agent nash told brosius that captain harper ewing would be available to witness the interview.captain ewing was the prosecutor assigned to the case.
when captain ewing arrived,brosius recognized him as an attorney who had represented him in an earlier civil matter.captain ewing asked brosius some questions about the prior representation in order to ascertain whether there was a conflict that would prevent him from prosecuting the case.special agent nash and captain ewing both told brosius that captain ewing was a prosecutor and was working with the cops,but brosius did not voice any objection.captain ewing acknowledged,however,that brosius said something to the effect that he wanted an attorney present because he did not trust the police and feared that they would twist his words.app.captain ewing testified that he thought that brosius was simply requesting someone to record his words accurately and was not requesting legal representation,and special agent nash testified that captain ewing was present at the interview for that purpose.brosius did not ask captain ewing any questions or request legal advice,but he testified at trial that he thought that captain ewing was his lawyer because captain ewing had represented him in an earlier matter and was present while he was being questioned.
at the end of the interview,brosius signed a written statement.the chief points stated were that ivon had given brosius a ride back to the base from the club another male soldier,whom he described,had accompanied them ivon had a troubled relationship with her boyfriend and brosius had last seen her at about brosius statement seems to have added little if anything of substance to what he had told other witnesses during the hours immediately after ivon body was discovered.the cid agents also took the clothing that brosius had worn on the night of the murder,but it apparently did not yield any incriminating evidence.after the interview,brosius returned to his unit.
brosius returned for further questioning on june and.at this time,he was warned of his rights under miranda arizona,d,and article of the uniform code of military justice ucmj.after receiving these warnings,brosius waived his rights and eventually confessed to the murder.he said that he had returned to the base with ivon and that no one else was in the car.when they reached the parking lot,he stated,they started to have intercourse,but he realized that this was right because she was like a sister to him.he stated that he stabbed her in the chest and stomach and then,because she was looking at him,in the eyes.he said that he stabbed her about nine times.at the end of the confession,however,he stated i do believe i did it and if i did i want help.i feel like i falsified the whole statement.
the degree to which a federal habeas court may consider claims of errors committed in a military trial has long been the subject of controversy and remains unclear.nearly years after it was decided,the supreme court decision in burns wilson,is still the leading authority.in burns,two soldiers were tried by court martial,found guilty of murder and rape,and sentenced to death.they filed habeas petitions claiming that they had been denied due process of law.some of the claims appear to have presented pure questions of fact,whether the petitioners were beaten and denied food and sleep before they confessed,while other claims presented either mixed questions or questions of law,whether,on the undisputed facts,their confessions were coerced.the district court dismissed the petition,and the court of appeals affirmed.burns lovett.the court of appeals applied the following standard 
h abeas corpus will not lie to review questions raised and determined,or raisable and determinable,in the established military process,unless there has been such gross violation of constitutional rights as to deny the substance of a fair trial and,because of some exceptional circumstance,the petitioner has not been able to obtain adequate protection of that right in the military process.
id.at.applying this standard,the court reviewed each of the petitioner allegations and found that none warranted relief.
the supreme court affirmed by a vote of to but without a majority opinion.one member of the majority,justice minton,took the position that the court could do no more than inquire whether the court martial had jurisdiction.burns,at.minton,concurring in judgment.however,the plurality opinion written by chief justice vinson and joined by three other justices concluded that the court inquiry was somewhat broader.the plurality stated that the petitioners allegations were sufficient to depict fundamental unfairness and that the district court could have reviewed these claims de novo if the military courts had manifestly refused to consider them.id.at.but because the military courts had heard petitioners out on every significant allegation and had given fair consideration to each of the ir claims,the plurality stated,the petitioners had failed to show that this military review was legally inadequate.id.at.the plurality added that although the court of appeals may have erred in reweighing each item of relevant evidence in the trial record,it certainly did not err in holding that there was no need for a further hearing in the district court.id.at.justice jackson,the sixth member of the majority,concurred in the result without opinion.id.
justice douglas,joined by justice black,dissented,arguing that it was proper to determine in the habeas proceeding whether,based on the undisputed facts,that the petitioners had been held incommunicado and repeatedly questioned over a period of five days,the petitioners confessions had been unconstitutionally obtained burns,at.douglas,dissenting.
although the rule that emerges from burns is far from clear in all respects,it appears that a majority the plurality plus justice minton held that in considering a constitutional claim involving a pure question of law or a mixed question of law and fact,a habeas court may not exercise de novo review and may not go beyond considering whether the military courts dealt fully and fairly with the claim.moreover,the plurality treatment of the petitioners coerced confession claim suggests that full and fair consideration was intended to mean no more than hear ing the petitioners out.burns,at.although it appears that the judge advocate general,then the highest reviewing officer,had not addressed the question whether the undisputed facts relating to the confessions established a violation of the governing supreme court precedent concerning unconstitutionally coerced confessions the plurality rejected the coerced confession claim with the simple statement that there was exhaustive inquiry into the background of the the taking of testimony from the persons most concerned with the making of these statements.id.at.
lower courts have had difficulty applying the burns full and fair test.the tenth circuit,which has the most experience with habeas petitions filed by service members due to the location of the disciplinary barracks at leavenworth,kansas,has stated that t he federal courts this court the language in burns has been anything but clear.dodson zelez,cir see also,kauffman sec.of the air force,the test has meant many things to many courts.
our court treatment of burns has also been far from seamless.in united states ex rel.thompson parker,cir,we interpreted burns narrowly.the petitioner argued that his confession had been obtained in violation of the fifth amendment and article of the ucmj,but we rejected that argument with the terse statement that the district court,after determining that the military courts had given due consideration to petitioner contentions,quite correctly refused to review and reevaluate the facts surrounding petitioner allegations.id.at.
by contrast,in levy parker,cir,rev on other grounds,d,we seemingly read burns more expansively.levy,a military doctor,was convicted by a general court martial of wilful disobedience of the lawful command of a superior officer,uttering public statements designed to promote disloyalty and disaffection among the troops,and wrongfully and dishonorably making intemperate,defamatory,provoking,contemptuous,disrespectful,and disloyal statements to other officers.see id.at.he contended that the articles under which he was convicted were too vague to satisfy due process.we suggested that a habeas court may examine de novo those constitutional claims not dependent upon any evidentiary or factual construction.id.at.the actual holding of the case,however,was limited to claims related to the facial unconstitutionality of a statute under which a petitioner was charged.id.any broader reading of levy as requiring de novo review over all questions of law would be inconsistent with burns,in which a majority of the court the plurality plus justice minton applied a deferential standard of review to the claims that,on the undisputed facts,the habeas petitioners constitutional rights were violated.see burns,at.douglas,dissenting arguing that the undisputed facts in the case ma de a prima facie case that the supreme court rule on coerced confessions expressed in watts indiana,was violated.
in the present case,we find it unnecessary to attempt any further explication of burns.whatever burns means,we have no doubt that at least absent a challenge to the constitutionality of the statute under which the defendant was convicted,such as that raised in levy,our inquiry in a military habeas case may not go further than our inquiry in a state habeas case.see burns,at.in military habeas corpus cases,even more than in state habeas corpus cases,it would be in disregard of the statutory scheme if the federal civil courts failed to take account of the prior proceedings emphasis added.thus,we will solely for the sake of we may review determinations made by the military courts in this case as if they were determinations made by state courts.accordingly,we will assume that e applies to findings of historical fact made by the military courts.under this provision,a determination of a factual issue made by a state court is presumed to be correct,and a habeas petitioner has the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.in considering other determinations made by the military courts,we will assume that d applies.under this provision,
a n application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.

brosius argues that his conviction must be reversed because,prior to his two interviews on june,he was not given the warnings prescribed by miranda or article b of the uniform code of military justice,b article b differs from miranda in that it requires warnings whenever a service member is suspected of an offense and is being interrogated.it may thus apply in situations in which a service member is not in custody.see united states baird.we will discuss miranda and article b separately.
in miranda,the supreme court held that warnings must be administered before a person is subjected to custodial interrogation,questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.at.footnote o
