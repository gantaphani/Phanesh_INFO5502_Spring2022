henry thomas high high appeals the district court grant of summary judgment.high,an employee of and a participant in the benefit plan,later managed by metlife,initiated this proceeding in the district court,alleging that when metlife became the plan claims administrator in,it improperly began reducing his monthly plan disability payments by the amount of veterans administration va benefits he was receiving.the district court disagreed,granting summary judgment in favor of after finding that metlife did not abuse its discretion or act arbitrarily or capriciously in modifying high disability benefits payments.because the record suggests that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to and determining that metlife did not abuse its discretion when it offset high monthly disability benefits by his va benefits and high does not meet the requisite elements to support this court finding that the doctrine of or waiver applies,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
this case involves an employee welfare benefit plan governed by erisa.high was hired by in september of.he had been receiving monthly va benefits prior to being hired and he continued to receive these va benefits throughout his employment this fact was fully disclosed to.through his employer,high elected to contribute to the plan in case he were no longer able to work due to a permanent disability.
on july,the plan,merged into the raytheon company long term disability benefits plan raytheon plan raytheon company is the plan administrator,but the plan still governs the terms of high monthly benefits under the raytheon plan.all benefits payable under the plan are funded exclusively by employee contributions.metlife provides claims administrative services to the plans and the plans grant metlife broad authority to construe plan terms.
in,high became unable to work and began receiving disability payments under the plan without offset for his va benefits.these monthly disability payments under the plan continued until when metlife became the new claims administrator.at that time,after an extensive investigation,metlife notified high that his benefits would be offset by his va benefits,determining that even though the policy did not specifically include va benefits as a source for offset,it was suggested by the language of the plan.high then appealed this decision to raytheon company it agreed that the va benefits should be offset.high appealed again,and again his request to reinstate the original amount of his disability benefits was denied.accordingly,high disability payments were reduced from just over per month to per month,beginning in september of.
as a result,high filed suit in texas state court on september,complaining that when metlife became the plan claims administrator in,it improperly began reducing his monthly plan disability payments by the amount of the monthly va benefits he was receiving.he sought past and future benefits.the case was removed to federal court because it involves an erisa plan and is,therefore,governed by federal law.
on march,moved for summary judgment asserting that the plan administrator was granted discretion to make benefit decisions under the plans and that the decision to reduce high payments per his va benefits was not arbitrary or capricious.high responded that the adverse decision was an abuse of discretion because it contradicted the plain language of the plan.agreeing with,the court granted its motion for summary judgment holding that the claims administrator had discretion to make an adverse benefit determination.it entered judgment against high on february.thereafter,high filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment the court denied his motion and high appealed.
discussion 
whether the district court erred in granting summary.standard of review 
the standard of review for a district court grant of summary judgment is de novo.facility ins.employers ins.of wausau,cir citing gowesky singing river hosp,cir.summary judgment is only appropriate if the evidence shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c lq.when,as here,the language of the plan grants discretion to an administrator to interpret the plan and determine eligibility for benefits,a court will reverse an administrator decision only for abuse of discretion.meditrust fin.servs.sterling,cir.in the summary judgment context,to avoid reversal,the erisa administrator decision must be supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.ellis liberty life assurance,cir.substantial evidence is that which a reasonable mind might accept as sufficient to support a conclusion.id.
one of the underlying principles of erisa is to ensure that employee benefits are given as promised and as expected.lockheed spink,d.therefore,erisa has specific provisions regarding decisions that may affect these expectations.for example,an adverse benefit determination is any of the following a denial,reduction,or termination of,or a failure to provide or make payment in whole or part for,a benefit.m.in the case of a claim for disability benefits,the plan administrator shall notify the claimant of the plan adverse benefit determination within a reasonable period of time,but not later than days after receipt of the claim by the plan.f 
on the other hand,even though congress strictly guards erisa plans,where an erisa plan gives an administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe terms,courts may not reverse the administrator benefits determinations absent an abuse of discretion.meditrust,at.the plan provides discretionary authority to the plan administrator,as does the subsequent raytheon plan.accordingly,we may apply a analysis to determine whether the administrator in this case abused its discretion,first determining whether the administrator decision was legally sound and,if it is not,determining whether the decision was an abuse of discretion in any event.duhon texaco,cir this court,however,is not confined to this test we may skip the first step if we can determine the decision was not an abuse of discretion.see maclachlan exxonmobil,cir sweatman commercial union ins,cir concluding that an erisa administrator determination was not an abuse of discretion and affirming judgment on that basis without considering whether the administrator determination was legally correct.accordingly,in assessing whether metlife abused its discretion in applying the offset,our analysis bypasses whether metlife determination was legally correct,as the record reflects that it has not abused its discretion.
high asserts that the six year gap during which he received both va benefits and benefits under the plan was an unreasonable amount of time for to delay adjusting his entitlements.the time lapse that occurred in this case,however,is only one variable in the equation that we consider thus the regulations,referred to by high and cited above,delineating a reasonable time are not instructive.this situation is not one where metlife knew about the improper disability benefits and then,six years later,applied an offset provision this is a situation where once metlife took over as claims administrator,it reviewed the policy provisions and disability payments it would be making,immediately found a discrepancy in high disability payments,conducted a thorough investigation,contacted the former plan administrator for an opinion,considered whether other participants in the plan had their benefits offset under the provision,allowed high to appeal twice its decision to offset va benefits,and then made an ultimate determination to a offset va benefits and b not attempt to collect retroactively the benefits inadvertently paid from.we hold that this scenario constitutes careful deliberation on metlife and part and does not evidence arbitrary or capricious.the record reflects that there is a rational connection between the known facts and the ultimate decision.meditrust,at.thus,metlife determination was reasonable.
