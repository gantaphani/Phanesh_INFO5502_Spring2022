background 
on january,after having served on active duty in the united states navy between and and in civilian employment with the department of transportation and the department of the air force for nearly years,mccrary retired under the civil service retirement system csrs.prior to his retirement,mccrary completed an application for retirement standard form and a military service deposit election form opm form.on both documents,mccrary elected not to make a deposit to claim credit for his military service.mccrary admits that he did not timely make the deposit,but asserts that he did not do so because,when he asked how much the deposit will cost,he was told by a government counselor that it would cost a lot.see initial decision,slip op.at.
upon his retirement in,mccrary began receiving annuity payments each month.on april,mccrary became eligible for social security benefits.with social security benefits in place,it was necessary for the government to recalculate mccrary annuity under applicable statutory provisions,which permit credit of both civilian and military service toward an annuity only if the required military deposit was made before retirement.
thus,on april,opm notified mccrary that his monthly civil service annuity benefit had been recomputed to exclude his military service years and was being reduced by per month because of his election at the time of his retirement not to make the deposit,slip op.at.the required deposit would have been seven percent of his military pay of,or a lump sum of,plus interest.id.seven days later,surprised at the effect of his election on his retirement annuity,mccrary filed an appeal of opm decision with the board.in his appeal,mccrary sought waiver of the deposit deadline to permit late payment of the deposit,with interest,and reinstatement of his full annuity.before the board,mccrary argued that he was grossly misinformed as to the dollar amount of the deposit,and that,had the amount of deposit and reduction been effectively explained to him,he would surely have elected to buy back his military time,slip op.at.mccrary asserted that opm failed to provide proper counseling when,in response to mccrary inquiry regarding how much it would cost to make the required deposit,an opm employee answered something like,a lot,slip op.at emphasis in original.mccrary argued that the deadline should be waived because opm committed administrative error in characterizing a deposit of,plus interest,as a lot when the consequence of his election not to make the deposit was a reduction of per month in his annuity.in support of his argument for waiver of the deadline,mccrary asserted that in riddick office of personnel management,the board waived the military deposit deadline due to administrative error where the agency materially misinformed the appellant as to the amount of the deposit.opm contended that mccrary request to make a deposit should be denied because the standard form and opm form explain the consequences of failing to make a deposit prior to retirement and mccrary indicated,on those documents,his election not to make a deposit.initial decision,slip op.at.
on august,the aj decided that the deadline for making the deposit should not be waived and affirmed opm decision to reduce mccrary annuity benefits by eliminating credit for his military service,slip op.at.the aj acknowledged that,if mccrary could show that he did not make the deposit due to administrative error,he may be permitted to make a deposit within a time limit set by opm,slip op.at.the aj further recognized that certain decisions of the board hold that administrative error occurs when opm or the employing agency affirmatively misleads an annuitant regarding his retirement rights,slip op.at citing zimmerman office of pers,riddick,at pinkston office of pers.the aj noted that,in riddick,the retirement counselor told the employee that the required deposit would probably total thousands of dollars when it would only have been plus interest,but distinguished riddick on the ground that,in that case,a specific representation regarding the dollar consequences of the deposit was made,whereas,in this case,no specific amount was represented.initial decision,slip op.at.the aj did not distinguish zimmerman or pinkston,but instead based her decision on this court decision in collins office of personnel management,which held that,where an annuitant receives full and fair notice of the requirement to make a deposit,the government is not required to inform an annuitant about the dollar consequences of electing not to make the deposit.the aj concluded that,because mccrary was properly advised and understood that he must pay a deposit for this military service and of the consequences for failing to make such a deposit,and because,under collins,the government was not required to inform mccrary of the precise dollar consequences of not making the deposit,the deadline should not be waived,slip op.at.
on may,the board denied mccrary petition for review,making the initial decision the final decision of the board.final decision,slip op.at.mccrary timely filed an appeal with this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

standard of review 
our review of this appeal is limited in scope.we must affirm the decision of the board unless we find it to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence.see c cheeseman office of pers.the petitioner bears the burden of establishing error in the board decision.see cheeseman,at.
statutory and regulatory background 
a civil service annuitant who retires after september,is entitled to receive credit for active duty military service performed after under both the csrs and the social security system,but only if the annuitant deposits with the civil service retirement fund an amount equal to seven percent of the person total military pay.see j.moreover,the amount of the deposit accrues interest until deposited.see,e,j.if,before retirement,the individual does not make the required deposit with interest,opm must recompute the individual retirement annuity when the individual becomes eligible for social security benefits,so as to exclude any military service from the computation of the civil service retirement annuity benefit.
opm has promulgated regulations regarding the deposit requirement.see.those regulations provide that,while an individual generally must make a deposit prior to retirement from a position subject to coverage under the csrs,the time limit requiring that the deposit be made before retirement may be waived if the failure to make the deposit prior to retirement from service was the result of an administrative error.see id.a.if a separated employee,through administrative error,did not make or complete the deposit prior to his retirement,the deadline may be waived and the deposit,with interest,may be paid in a lump sum within a time set by opm.id.the regulations do not define administrative error.
this appeal presents the question whether opm committed administrative error when,in response to mccrary inquiry as to the amount of the deposit,opm answered that the required deposit is a lot when,in fact,the amount of the required deposit was,plus interest.for the reasons below,we find that the retirement counselor statement that the required dep
