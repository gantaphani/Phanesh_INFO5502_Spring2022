appellant,doe,a soldier in both the army reserve national guard of the united states and the california state national guard,challenges the president authority ordering doe to active duty for a period longer than his enlistment.
doe challenges fall into three general arguments.first,doe argues the government did not satisfy the procedures required by in extending his service.second,doe asserts that is unconstitutional.third,doe contends the order extending his enlistment conflicts with other laws regulating members of the reserve military.
the government contends as a threshold issue that we need not address the merits of this challenge because doe has received new orders,rendering his challenges moot.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to.although we conclude that this case is not moot,we disagree with doe substantive arguments and affirm the district court denial of doe petition for writs of habeas corpus and mandamus.
background 
on may,doe,an veteran of the army,enlisted for a term in the california state national guard and the army reserve national guard of the united states.the enlistment agreement,referred to in recruiting material as try one,allowed active duty veterans to enlist for a term before making a further service commitment.the enlistment agreement,signed by doe,stated that subsequently enacted laws and regulations could affect the terms of his contract.the enlistment agreement provided also that i n time of national emergency declared by the president of the united states,i doe may be ordered to active duty and that my doe enlistment may be extended enlistment doc.c.see also statement of understanding of reserve obligations and responsibilities.
following his enlistment and initial training,doe was assigned to the transportation company based in sacramento,california.in february of,doe reenlisted for a second term,extending his contract through may.on july,doe unit received orders to in support of operation iraqi freedom.doe was notified that he would be required to serve on active duty until march,approximately eleven months longer than the term of service specified in his enlistment agreement.pursuant to these orders,doe unit was deployed to fort lewis,washington,for approximately days of training before being sent to iraq.
doe,however,was never sent to iraq.on january,in response to a medical condition,doe received new orders retaining him on active duty under d.on january,doe received his present assignment to the california medical community based health care organization in sacramento,california,where he was to receive health care evaluations and treatment,which may result eventually in his discharge from active duty.
procedural history 
on october,doe filed a petition for writs of habeas corpus and mandamus,and for declaratory and injunctive relief ordering his release from any further obligation of military service under his existing enlistment contract.in addition to these claims,doe argued that the involuntary extension of his enlistment was contrary to constitutional and statutory law.on the same day,doe sought a temporary restraining order,which was denied on october.on november,the district court denied doe motion for a preliminary injunction.following this denial,doe brought an interlocutory appeal to the ninth circuit and moved the court for emergency injunctive relief.on january,we issued an order denying the motion for injunctive relief and affirming the district court denial of doe request for a preliminary injunction.on march,the district court rendered a decision on the merits,denying doe remaining claims.on april,doe timely filed his notice of appeal.

discussion 
fourteen days before oral argument,the government submitted a brief suggesting doe appeal is moot.the government says that doe january,activation orders assigning him to a medical retention center preclude him from being subject to the authority of and that,after the completion of his medical assignment,doe well may be discharged from the service.government,brief.at oral argument,we asked the government whether doe,following his medical assignment,could be returned to active duty subject to status.the government represented that doe would not be returned to active duty under after the medical assignment is completed.nevertheless,doe january,orders refer to a temporary assignment with instructions to return to his permanent station at the end of the assignment.moreover,his current orders specify that he must remain on active duty until january,as reflected in his most recent earnings statement.consequently,we conclude doe continues to have a personal stake in the outcome of this case sufficient to avoid dismissal on the ground of mootness.see lewis cont l bank,d p arties must continue to have a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit.internal citations omitted.
maintains that the president may suspend any provision of law relating to promotion,retirement,or separation applicable to any member of the armed forces who the president determines is essential to the national security of the united states.doe argues that an applicable provision of law was never properly suspended,and thus that the extension of his service was impermissible.
milper message milper message,issued on november,operationalized the stop loss policy.santiago rumsfeld,cir as amended.in paragraph,it states the provisions of regulations governing voluntary retirements,separations,and refrads of officers and enlisted soldiers are suspended thus,the milper message served both as a suspension and an extension.doe extension was properly executed pursuant to the statute.
doe assertion is additionally foreclosed by our decision in santiago,in which we held that the president power under a was properly delegated to the assistant secretary of the army for manpower and reserve affairs,who entered the order suspending the separation laws on november,pursuant to milper message.at.
doe argues also that the president should have first made a determination that his military service was essential to national security.but the statute does not require the president to determine each and every person who is essential,nor does it require that the president elucidate the reasons for his determination.
the president declared a national emergency on september.presidential proclamation,see also,extending national emergency for one more year a conferring authority upon president to declare national emergency santiago,at.in the same proclamation,he invoked his power under to activate members of the army national guard of the united states.id.on july,doe unit was activated.the activation of his unit during the state of national emergency was enough to satisfy the statutory requirements.doe contention fails.
constitutional arguments 
doe argues that a is unconstitutional for three reasons.first,doe contends that section permits arbitrary infringement on his liberty.second,doe implicitly asserts that authority is an impermissible delegation of power by congress.third,doe argues that his extended enlistment violates his fifth amendment due process rights because the government failed to provide meaningful notice of its ability to extend his enlistment.for the reasons set forth below,each argument fails.
arbitrariness 
doe contends that is unconstitutional because it fails to include boundaries on the president authority sufficient to safeguard doe fifth amendment liberty interest.doe argument ignores the language of section as well as the limitations of activation imposed by,and.
the presidential power to extend enlistment contracts is limited to circumstances essential to the national security of the united states.a.moreover,an extension of enlistment can be imposed only on members of a reserve component that are serving on active duty pursuant to an order to active duty under authority of
