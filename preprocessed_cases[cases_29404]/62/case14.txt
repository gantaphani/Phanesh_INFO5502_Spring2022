on april,segundo meléndez,a reserve officers training corps rotc officer,was assaulted during a student protest on the university of puerto rico río piedras campus the campus.due to the university policy,puerto rico police department prpd officers were unable to come to his aid.in april,meléndez sued various university officials pursuant to,alleging,among other things,that they had violated the equal protection and due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment by failing to protect him from injury.he also asserted various claims.after protracted discovery,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on the claims and dismissed the claims because it concluded that the parties were not diverse.
meléndez now contends that the district court abused its discretion twice when ruling on discovery,by refusing to issue sanctions under.for the defendants alleged massive discovery misconduct,and second,by failing to grant meléndez motion to set aside summary judgment based on the same discovery misconduct improperly dismissed meléndez federal civil rights claims on the ground of qualified immunity and committed clear error in determining that there was no diversity jurisdiction.for the reasons stated hereinafter,we affirm all of the district court rulings.
background 
the policy 
historically,relations between rotc members and some students at upr have been marked by conflict and tension.for example,during a protest sparked by the imposition of a sentence on a defendant who refused to submit to induction into the armed forces,students at marched into an rotc building and proceeded to burn and otherwise destroy doors,windows,and glass display cabinets,among other things.during subsequent days,multiple rotc cadets were assaulted and threatened.as a result of this violence,the university suspended army rotc classes for approximately three months.after one protest in,an rotc cadet was killed.in,a bomb was discovered in the rotc facility.
in response to the violence and confrontation on the campus,former chancellor juan fernández issued a statement encapsulating what came to be known as the policy ncp.the policy evolved over time,and was eventually issued in written form in.the translation of the preamble to the written ncp notes,
the university of puerto rico,and particularly the río piedras campus,historically has been the reflection and participant of sic the fundamental duties and conflicts of the puerto rican society.in some cases,events happened that generated tragic results for the university and the country.these events led us as university members to the introspection and search of sic some understanding as to how to avoid violence,the entrance of the police to sic the university and the external improper intervention in the university affairs.
the body of the policy explains that the university community is committed to avoiding confrontation by,among other things,establishing as institutional policy a practice of us ing all available resources to avoid the intervention of the puerto rico police in university affairs.although the ncp was not issued in written form until,the parties agree that the unwritten ncp that was in force in prohibited prpd officers from entering the campus without the permission of a university administrator 
the assault on meléndez 
during the months leading up to meléndez assault,the tensions between students and rotc members were evident.the navy use of vieques for weapons testing sparked many demonstrations on campus.in february,the president of student government wrote a letter demanding that rotc members not be allowed to wear uniforms on campus.in april,two officers ncos who went to the campus to pick up mail were harassed and threatened by rotc opponents.rotc officers and ncos were regularly harassed and threatened when they wore their uniforms on campus.
on april,the day of the assault,defendant george hillyer,who was then the chancellor of,had planned to be away from the campus.he had confirmed with a student group before leaving that no demonstrations were planned for that day.at that morning,several rotc cadets and ncos began to perform physical training exercises in the upr track and field area.a number of protesters began demonstrating on a bridge that leads to this area.in response,the officers in charge,major jorge más and josé martínez,decided to move the exercises to the rotc compound.the protesters,however,also moved.as a result,cadets and officers were prohibited from entering or leaving the compound protesters intercepted and beat up one cadet who attempted to flee through a hole in a fence.the demonstrators also hurled rocks,eggs,and mangoes at the compound.
at some point,josé gonzález arrived on the scene.as he stood inside a gazebo near a parking lot,a group of demonstrators spotted him and proceeded to push and shove him.josé miguel pizarro,who believed that one of his men was in danger,moved toward the gazebo to provide assistance.at that point,meléndez entered the fray to assist pizarro,his commanding officer.gonzález was able to get into his car and drive away,but pizarro and meléndez were left in the middle of a group of demonstrators,who began to kick and hit them.as the two men walked across the parking lot,a distance of about meters,demonstrators continued to punch and kick them.according to meléndez,the protesters dissipated after he threatened to press federal charges.
after the protest,meléndez asked a prpd officer why he had not intervened,and the officer responded that the university had not authorized entry.although neither the campus guard nor the prpd arrested or detained any of the protesters,federal authorities eventually arrested pedro colón almenas.colón almenas was charged with,and found guilty of,assaulting a federal officer.
procedural history 
meléndez filed suit in federal court on april.in october,after two years had passed without any reports to the court on the status of the case,the court ordered meléndez to show cause as to why his case should not be dismissed for lack of prosecution.after meléndez complied,the court decided not to dismiss the case but warned meléndez that he had to keep the court apprised of the status of the case and bring any discovery disputes to the court without delay.on january,the parties submitted a discovery plan,proposing to coordinate discovery in the present case and a parallel state court action.the court rejected this plan,and set the discovery deadline for may.the discovery deadline was later extended until august.
on september,the defendants filed for summary judgment.on november,as part of discovery in the parallel state case,the defendants informed meléndez that approximately pages of documents were available for review.believing that these documents were relevant to his federal suit,meléndez filed a motion requesting that the court enter a default judgment against the defendants,or else impose other severe sanctions under rule.the court declined,without explanation,to take either action.meléndez now argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion.see section,infra.
on august,the court filed its order granting summary judgment to the defendants on their federal claims.see sánchez,slip op.at filed,meléndez i.meléndez appeals this judgment.see section,infra.
the court declined to rule on the claims in its august,order,instead ordering meléndez to provide evidence of his domicile as of april,so that the court could determine whether it had diversity jurisdiction.after meléndez produced the required evidence,the court concluded that he was not a texas domiciliary as of the date he filed his complaint,and thus that there was no diversity of citizenship between him and the defendants.see sánchez,doc,slip op.at,meléndez iii.meléndez appeals this dismissal.see section,infra.
the same day that it ruled on the jurisdiction issue,the court denied meléndez motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment order.see sánchez,doc,slip op.at,meléndez ii.meléndez now claims that the district court erred in refusing to set aside its summary judgment ruling and allow the parties to continue discovery given the alleged discovery abuse.see section,infra.
ii.discussion 
discovery abuse 
meléndez makes two related claims regarding discovery the district court abused its discretion in refusing to grant a rule an entry of default or another exclusionary the defendants failed to produce certain documents in a timely fashion,and the district court abused its discretion in refusing to set aside its summary judgment given the defendants failure to produce those same documents.after a brief discussion of the facts upon which these claims are based,we address,and reject,each of them in turn.
background 
pursuant to a state court order,the defendants informed meléndez on november,that approximately pages of new documents were available for review.this set of documents,produced in response to a state discovery request that was apparently broader than the federal request,see meléndez ii,slip op.at,included a report by the puerto rico civil rights commission on the rotc program at upr the report documents various incidents of harassment of and violence against rotc members.meléndez argues that this document,as well as the remainder of the pages of documents in the set,should have been disclosed both as part of the defendants rule mandatory disclosures and in response to meléndez august,federal discovery request,which asked for a ll documents,objects or things evidencing communications between the rotc and the upr or regarding incident s of harassment at the against cadets,officers and officers from until the present.although he opened only one of the boxes that the defendants had made available to him,meléndez claims that it was clear that the boxes contained evidence of the historic discrimination suffered by the rotc at the campus,that defendants knew long ago about the existence of all these documents,and that they therefore should have been disclosed earlier as part of the federal discovery process.meléndez filed his opposition to the defendants motion for summary judgment on january.
refusal to grant rule sanctions 
on december,meléndez filed a motion requesting an entry of default or severe sanctions based upon the defendants massive discovery misconduct.the court denied this request,without explanation,on january.meléndez now claims that the district court erred in refusing to grant the request.district court determinations regarding the selection and imposition of sanctions are reviewed for abuse of discretion.barreto citibank,cir per curiam.
even assuming that at least some of the pages were responsive to meléndez federal discovery request,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to grant meléndez request for a rule sanction.the plain language of rule b provides that before a court can impose sanctions,the offending party must fail to obey an order to provide or permit discovery.b a see also local union town line sand gravel,cir federal rule empowers a district court to make such orders as are just when a party fails to comply with a discovery order here,meléndez can not point to any order to provide or permit discovery that could form the basis of a rule sanction thus,the district court decision to deny meléndez motion was correct.
refusal to set aside summary judgment 
meléndez next attacks the district court september,order denying the plaintiff request for reconsideration of its previous summary judgment determination,meléndez ii meléndez claims that he was not given an adequate opportunity to discover facts supporting his claim because the defendants did not inform him of the existence of the pages of new documents until november.we review a district court denial of a plaintiff motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.see douglas york county,cir.
the essential problem with this claim is that the law upon which meléndez bases his claim is not applicable to the circumstances of his case.meléndez cites carmona toledo,cir,and resolution trust north bridge associates,cir,for the proposition that this court may reverse summary judgment and order further discovery where discovery was not completed due to a moving party misconduct.it is true that we may do so.these cases,however,involve situations where a party believed it needed to conduct further discovery to marshal facts necessary to oppose summary judgment,that party filed a rule f motion requesting additional time and the court did not grant the party request.see carmona,at despite plaintiffs rule f motion and repeated references to the incompleteness of discovery,the district court did not make findings or hold a hearing as to the diligence and sufficiency of the defendants responses.resolution trust,at the main battleground between the parties is the appellants third rule f motion,which rested on a claim of delayed discovery still outstanding.
meléndez facts do not fit into this framework because the district court did not deny any rule f motion that he filed,or anything that could be construed as sufficient to invoke the protections of rule f.see.mun.wholesale,cir.he did file three motions for extensions of time after he was alerted to the existence of the pages of documents,but the court granted these extensions.meléndez ultimately had more than a month to review the documents before filing his opposition to the motion for summary judgment.the only motion that the district court denied that related to meléndez allegedly inadequate opportunity to conduct discovery was meléndez order requesting default judgment or other severe sanctions.that motion,however,did not request more time,and therefore can not justify a reversal under the case law that meléndez cites.
section violations 
the substantive due process claim 
meléndez argued below that the defendants violated his right to substantive due process by increasing his risk of danger on campus and then failing to protect him against that risk.the defendants replied by arguing,among other things,that they were entitled to qualified immunity from suit under section.the district court,in accordance with saucier katz,overruled in part by pearson callahan,began its qualified immunity analysis by assessing whether,when viewed in the light most favorable to meléndez,the facts alleged show the defendants conduct violated a constitutional right.id.at.it concluded that they did not,and that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity,because neither the defendants actions surrounding the april,demonstration nor their implementation of the ncp constituted conduct that would shock the conscience.meléndez i,slip op.at.
we review the lower court qualified immunity determination de novo.walden city of providence,cir.because this is an appeal from a denial of summary judgment,we review the evidence,to the extent necessary,in the light most favorable to meléndez.see,asociación de periodistas de mueller,cir.we may affirm on any basis apparent in the record.chiang verizon new england,cir.
officials are entitled to qualified immunity unless the facts that a plaintiff has alleged or shown make out a violation of a constitutional right and the right at issue was clearly established at the time of the defendants alleged misconduct.walden,at quoting pearson.at.in light of pearson,we may now address the second prong of the qualified immunity test first.see.at.we follow that course here.
this second prong has two aspects whether,based on the clarity of the law at the time of the alleged civil rights violation,t he contours of the right were sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right,walden,at alteration in original quoting maldonado fontanes,cir quoting anderson creighton,and whether,based on the facts of the particular case,a reasonable defendant would have understood that his conduct violated the plaintiffs constitutional rights.id.quoting maldonado,at.the relevant,dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right was clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.id.at quoting saucier,at.
we conclude that it would not have been clear to a reasonable upr official that the conduct at issue here was unlawful.as a general matter,a state failure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the due process clause.deshaney winnebago cnty.dep t of soc.the deshaney court recognized a limited exception to this rule which applies to circumstances in which the government has a special relationship with the individual because government action has deprived that individual of the liberty needed to protect himself,cir.this exception may apply when the individual is incarcerated or is involuntarily committed to the custody of the state.id.at quoting rivera rhode island,cir.in addition to the special custodial relationships,the deshaney court suggested,but never expressly recognized,the possibility that liability might arise where the state creates or substantially contributes to the creation of a danger.id regardless of whether a plaintiff proceeds under the theory that the defendants are liable because they limited his ability to protect himself the limitation theory,or under the theory that they are liable because they created or substantially contributed to the danger he faced and then failed to protect him from it the danger theory,the defendants actions must also shock the conscience of the court,rivera,at,in order for the plaintiff to prevail.see sauro,cir applying shock the conscience standard to a danger claim gloria,cir applying same standard in discussing a limitation theory claim.
even if meléndez were able to establish that the officials here either a created a danger and then failed to protect him from it or b limited his ability to protect himself or receive protection from outside sources,and engaged in conduct,he would still need to prove that it would have been clear to a reasonable upr official that the relevant behavior here was unlawful.he can not do so.
in order to shock the contemporary conscience,state action must be egregious and outrageous.rivera,at quoting county of sacramento lewis.in situations where actors have an opportunity to reflect and make reasoned and rational decisions,deliberately indifferent behavior may suffice to shock the conscience.id.citing county of sacramento,at.d eliberate indifference,however,that shocks in one environment may not be so patently egregious in another.puerto rico,cir quoting county of sacramento,at.the burden to show state conduct that shocks the conscience is extremely high,requiring stunning evidence of arbitrariness and caprice that extends beyond m ere violations of state law,even violations resulting from bad faith to something more egregious and more extreme,at quoting depoutot raffaelly,cir.
meléndez argues that the university has been deliberately indifferent to the rotc security needs and that this alleged deliberate indifference shocks the conscience.he does not attempt to explain why he believes the relevant law was clearly established.we conclude that it would not have been clear to a reasonable official that the conduct about which meléndez complains was unlawful.
the district court concluded that the continued implementation of the ncp was not because it was an attempt,however imperfect,to balance the competing rights of free speech,safety and use of university property by different student groups on campus.meléndez i,slip op.at.in light of the evidence that the ncp was established to balance these rights and goals,we conclude that it would not have been clear to a reasonable official that continuing to implement the ncp was unlawful.meléndez argues,however,that other acts of alleged deliberate indifference substantially increased the risk of harm to rotc members.these acts,according to meléndez,included failure to punish those who harassed rotc members,take a public stand about the rights of rotc members,and train the campus guard to protect rotc members.even all of these omissions,taken together,are not so egregious as to make it clear to a reasonable official that such conduct would constitute a violation of the due process clause.
furthermore,we have recognized that e ven where the government is aware of specific dangers it must perform a triage among competing demands,at.although some of the omissions that meléndez alleges contributed to the dangerous atmosphere at might have been relatively easy to remedy,not taking a public stand about the rights of rotc members,others may have been more expensive or to address,not training the campus guard to protect rotc members during protests or involved,not calling in prpd officers,given that allowing the officers to enter might have led to increased violence.because a university,like a local government,must choose how to use limited resources,it would not have been clear to a reasonable official that the choices that were made here violated the plaintiff right to substantive due process.
for all these reasons,we affirm the grant of qualified immunity on the due process claim 
the equal protection claim 
meléndez claims that the district court improperly applied equal protection jurisprudence in concluding that there was no evidence that the defendants intentionally discriminated against rotc members.again,we review the lower court qualified immunity determination de novo.walden,at.we conclude that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because there was insufficient evidence to establish that they violated meléndez right to equal protection.
it is true that t he s tate may not selectively deny its protective services to certain disfavored minorities without violating the equal protection clause.deshaney,at see also hayden grayson,cir.in order to prevail on an equal protection claim based upon alleged selective denial of protection,plaintiffs must adduce competent evidence of purposeful discrimination.hayden,at quoting washington davis.a plaintiff must show that the decisionmaker selected or reaffirmed a course of action at least in part because of,not merely in spite of,its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.soto flores,cir quoting pers.adm r feeney,applying standard in context of allegedly discriminatory treatment of complaints regarding domestic violence against women.
there is no evidence that the ncp is discriminatory on its face or has been applied in a discriminatory manner.the policy has never,either in its written or unwritten form,applied specifically to protests.there is no evidence that,in the years since the inception of the ncp,the upr administration has ever asked the prpd for assistance during a protest,either related to rotc or not.where failure to act is the result of a neutral nonintervention policy,it can not form the basis of an equal protection claim.hayden,at.
furthermore,there is not sufficient evidence that the other alleged omissions that might potentially constitute denials of equal campus guard failure to chase culprits and perform civil arrests,the university failure to investigate the assault and identify additional culprits,and the failure to punish the convicted culprit with something more severe than a simple the result of discriminatory animus.indeed,the deposition of samuel molina,one of the members of the campus guard present when meléndez was attacked,suggests that molina failed to execute arrests because his priority during the attack was to get people off of meléndez,and after the attack,he could not reach the culprits.guard director artemio de jesús explained during his deposition that the culprits were not arrested in part because the campus guard officers were focused on preventing an even larger confrontation,protecting meléndez and pizarro from continuing attack,and providing medical assistance to them former associate dean jimmy torres rodríguez also explained that neither he,nor former dean carlos ramos bellido,nor former chancellor hillyer proposed disciplining any of the students involved in the meléndez attack because the victims did want to file any complaint and said they wanted to file complaints at the federal level.
in light of these facts,we conclude that meléndez has failed to demonstrate that the defendants acted with discriminatory intent.accordingly,meléndez right to equal protection was not violated,and the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on the equal protection claim.
the uniformed services employment and reemployment 
rights act userra claim 
meléndez argued below that he could bring a section claim predicated on a violation of the userra,which prohibits employment discrimination against individuals based upon their service in the uniformed services.specifically,he claimed that the defendants failure to provide protection against attacks by rotc opponents constituted a denial of a benefit of employment by an employer based upon his membership in the armed forces.a.the district court noted that it was not clear whether the individual defendants could properly be considered employers as defined by the statute,meléndez i,slip op.at,but,rather than dismissing the plaintiff argument on that ground,dismissed it based upon its conclusion that congress implicitly precluded enforcement of userra violations through,id.at.meléndez now argues that the district court conclusion that the userra was not enforceable through a section claim was in error.we review this challenge to the district court order de novo both because the district court resolved the matter on summary judgment and because this is an issue of law.see bristol west ins.wawanesa mut.ins,cir.
we need not reach the issue of whether congress intended to prohibit plaintiffs from bringing section claims predicated on userra violations because the statutory language of the userra does not appear to protect against the types of violations that meléndez alleges occurred.meléndez provides no support for his proposition that being protected from assault by rotc opponents is a benefit of employment.the userra defines benefit of employment as any advantage,profit,privilege,gain,status,account,or interest other than wages or salary for work performed that accrues by reason of an employment contract or agreement or an employer policy,plan,or practice and then enumerates various benefits.courts have concluded that benefits of employment include not being assigned to a position with drastically different job responsibilities,francis booz,allen hamilton,cir having a more regular working schedule,hill michelin,cir and having the opportunity to take,within a reasonable period of time,an exam required for a promotion or other advantage,see domínguez county,d.here,meléndez does not argue that his right to be protected by the defendants against assaults arose from any employment relationship rather,he maintains that he should have been protected against assault in the same manner that any other person,whether employed by upr or not,would have been protected against assault.because meléndez was not deprived of any benefit of employment within the meaning of the userra,he can not predicate his section claim on a userra violation.
c.the jurisdictional issue 
meléndez argued below that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over his claims even after it dismissed his federal claims because he was domiciled in texas when he filed his complaint,in april,and thus there was diversity of citizenship between him and the defendants.when the district court dismissed meléndez claims in its order,it requested that meléndez provide evidence that he was domiciled in texas at the time he filed his complaint.see meléndez i,slip op.at.after holding an evidentiary hearing on the existence of diversity jurisdiction and considering all the relevant submissions,the district court concluded that it did not have jurisdiction over the claims and dismissed them.
when a defendant challenges the court jurisdiction based on lack of diversity,the party invoking subject matter jurisdiction has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the facts supporting jurisdiction.pavía,cir quoting bank one,montle,cir.a district court determination that an individual has failed to meet his burden of proving that he changed his domicile at the time he filed his federal complaint is a mixed question of law and fact and as such may not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.a finding is clearly erroneous when,although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.id.quoting anderson bessemer city.we conclude that the district court determination that meléndez was domiciled in puerto rico in april was not clearly erroneous.
a person domicile is the place where he has his true,fixed home and principal establishment,and to which,whenever he is absent,he has the intention of returning.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.domicile is determined as of the time the suit is filed.id.there is,ordinarily,a presumption of continuing domicile.id.in order to show change of domicile,a party must establish that he was present in the new domicile and intend ed to remain there.bank one,at.another specific presumption applies to members of the military service personnel are presumed not to acquire a new domicile when they are stationed in a place pursuant to orders they retain the domicile they had at the time of entry into the services.charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure,at ed see also chico power,d,hosp.san pablo,codagnone perrin.a service member may,however,rebut this presumption by demonstrat ing that despite his involuntary presence in a state,he or she has formed the intention to make a home in that state.wright et,supra,at.such proof requires clear and unequivocal evidence.id.at see also chico,d at.at codagnone.at.
the following factors are relevant in determining whether a party intends to make his home in a given state the place where civil and political rights are exercised,taxes paid,real and personal property such as furniture and automobiles located,driver and other licenses obtained,bank accounts maintained,location of club and church membership and places of business or employment,at quoting bank one,at.while no single factor is controlling,some courts have presumed domicile in a state is established where a party is registered to vote.id.this circuit,however,has not recognized such a presumption,though it has said that the place a person is registered to vote is a weighty factor in determining domicile.id.quoting lundquist precision valley aviation,cir.
here,meléndez argues that he became a texas domiciliary at some point between,when he was first assigned to fort bliss in el paso,texas,and,when he returned to puerto rico to serve in the rotc program he marshals the following evidence to support his argument he lived in texas on and off for six years,beginning in and ending in his former wife,whom he married in,was originally from el paso,texas,and his oldest son was born in texas between and,he lived in texas with his then wife and two children,both on the base and in private housing outside the base he opened a bank account in san antonio,texas,in,which has always been his principal bank account he obtained a texas driver license in between and he voted in the and elections while living in texas,and has not voted in an election in puerto rico since and he paid texas state sales taxes 
even assuming that these facts constitute the requisite clear and unequivocal evidence of intent to make a home in texas as of,the district court did not clearly err in concluding that meléndez was not a texas domiciliary as of april,given the countervailing deposition testimony suggesting that he decided,at some point between and,to remain in puerto rico.the following colloquy took place during meléndez april,deposition 
then,as a result of your new job,you were forced to leave puerto rico and go with the rest of the south army to their new offices in texas 
that is correct.
q.so if this incident had not happened,is it fair to say that you would have remained in the rotc 
i would have retired here,and i would have remained in the rotc.
and you would have stayed living in puerto rico 
living in puerto rico,yes.
but,as a result of the incident,you had to find a new job,which eventually took you away from puerto rico 
that is so.
shortly afterward,meléndez reiterated that he would have stayed in puerto rico for a longer period of time if not for the assault 
q.how does it make you feel that your plans of retiring as an rotc instructor never happened because of the incident of april thirty two thousand and one 
a.it affects me a lot.my plans were to stay in puerto rico with my family,my father,my mother,my uncles.now i am working in a place where i am alone.i do have any puerto ricans.there just a handful i am working at a job that i had to because i ca just sit around doing nothing,i have to work everything is just fine,but i still far from my island.
does it affect you emotionally 
oh yes.that is frustrating.one of my goals that i was unable to realize.
the parties disagreed about whether meléndez statement that he intended to retire in puerto rico meant only that he intended to complete his military career in puerto rico,or that he intended to live in puerto rico after the end of his military service.the district court,however,concluded that even if it assumed that meléndez statement that he wished to retire in puerto rico meant only that he intended to end his military career there,his statement that his plans were to stay in puerto rico with his family,his mother,his uncles was an unequivocal expression of the fact that,at some point prior to april,plaintiff had formed the intention to remain in puerto rico.meléndez iii,slip op.at.we agree.even assuming that meléndez became a texas domiciliary at some point before,he did not remain a texas domiciliary through rather,he decided,at some point between and,to remain in puerto rico,where he was then living.at that point,he became a puerto rico domiciliary.see bank one,at presence in state and intent to remain in state necessary to show domicile.the fact that meléndez identified himself as a citizen of bayamón,puerto rico,in a state court complaint filed simultaneously with his federal court complaint,and failed to explain this discrepancy,see meléndez iii,slip op.at,also supports the conclusion that he was a domiciliary of puerto rico in april.finally,meléndez evidence that he authorized his former wife to purchase a home in texas,and that she bought a house there at some point during is not sufficient to establish,in the face of the evidence to the contrary,that between and april,meléndez continued to intend to return to texas,rather than to remain in puerto rico.thus,we conclude that the district court did not clearly err when it concluded that meléndez was a puerto rico domiciliary on april.
iii.conclusion 
for the reasons stated,we affirm all of the challenged district court orders.
defendants claim that the chancellor of was the only person authorized to call the prpd to campus meléndez claims that the president of upr could override the determination of a chancellor on this issue.defendants claim that the chancellor of was the only person authorized to call the prpd to campus meléndez claims that the president of upr could override the determination of a chancellor on this issue.

even though it has not violated any court order.charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure,at ed.the first circuit hasrecognize d that in rule d jurisprudence,there are differences of

flawed as to be tantamount to no response at.int l welch foods,cir citations omitted.we need not resolve this dispute,however,because even under the more expansive view of rule d,the defendants delay was not an especially serious disregard of the obligations imposed by the discovery rules such that it was tantamount to a total failure to produce discovery.wright et,supra,at.in addition,meléndez argues that the district court could have issued an order excluding the defendants evidence under rule c despite the fact that the district court never issued an order to compel the production of the documents.rule c provides as follows if a party fails to provide information as required by rule a or e,the party is not allowed to use that information to supply evidence on a motion,at a hearing,or at a trial,unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.in addition to or instead of this sanction,the court,on motion and after giving an opportunity to be heard c may impose other appropriate sanctions,including any of the orders listed in rule b a i vi.c.it is not clear why meléndez is arguing that the district court should have excluded the documents his concern is that he was not given enough time to examine possibly helpful evidence,not that the defendants were able to use evidence that he had not had an adequate opportunity to examine.even assuming,however,that meléndez is invoking rule c in order to argue that the sanctions listed in rule b should have been available to him despite the lack of a court order because of the provision in rule c c that allows rule b sanctions when a party fails to make the required automatic disclosures under rule a,he still can not prevail.in light of the amendments to rule a,a party need only turn over material that the possessing party might intend to use to support its claims or defenses.gillespie sears,roebuck,cir.meléndez has not provided any evidence that the pages of documents included material that the defendants might intend to use to support their claims or defenses.id.therefore,any claim relying on the assertion that the defendants failed to disclose materials whose automatic disclosure was required by rule a will fail.meléndez cites a leading treatise for the proposition that rule d allows the imposition of sanctions against a party for especially serious disregard of the obligations imposed by the discovery rules even though it has not violated any court order.charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure,at ed.the first circuit hasrecognize d that in rule d

et,supra,at.in addition,meléndez argues that the district court could have issued an order excluding the defendants evidence under rule c despite the fact that the district court never issued an order to compel the production of the documents.rule c provides as follows if a party fails to provide information as required by rule a or e,the party is not allowed to use that information to supply evidence on a motion,at a hearing,or at a trial,unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.in addition to or instead of this sanction,the court,on motion and after giving an opportunity to be heard c may impose other appropriate sanctions,including any of the orders listed in rule b a i vi.c.it is not clear why meléndez is arguing that the district court should have excluded the documents his concern is that he was not given enough time to examine possibly helpful evidence,not that the defendants were able to use evidence that he had not had an adequate opportunity to examine.even assuming,however,that meléndez is invoking rule c in order to argue that the sanctions listed in rule b should have been available to him despite the lack of a court order because of the provision in rule c c that allows rule b sanctions when a party fails to make the required automatic disclosures under rule a,he still can not prevail.in light of the amendments to rule a,a party need only turn over material that the possessing party might intend to use to support its claims or defenses.gillespie sears,roebuck,cir.meléndez has not provided any evidence that the pages of documents included material that the defendants might intend to use to support their claims or defenses.id.therefore,any claim relying on the assertion that the defendants failed to disclose materials whose automatic disclosure was required by rule a will fail.
although meléndez does not point to any such order in his appellate brief,his motion requesting a rule sanction does cite an order,dated september,that he believes fulfills the requirements of rule.in this order,the district court denied the defendants motion for an extension of time to answer or otherwise object to the plaintiff first set of interrogatories and first and second requests for admission.in addition,the district court denied the plaintiff request to deem as admitted his first and second requests for admission.the docket notes that the court grant ed ten additional days for defendants to produce interrogatories and requests for admissions.this order is not sufficient to serve as a basis for relief under rule b because it does not address production of documents and can not be construed as an order compelling such production.although meléndez does not point to any such order in his appellate brief,his motion requesting a rule sanction does cite an order,dated september,that he believes fulfills the requirements of rule.in this order,the district court denied the defendants motion for an extension of time to answer or otherwise object to the plaintiff first set of interrogatories and first and second requests for admission.in addition,the district court denied the plaintiff request to deem as admitted his first and second requests for admission.the docket notes that the court grant ed ten additional days for defendants to produce interrogatories and requests for admissions.this order is not sufficient to serve as a basis for relief under rule b because it does not address production of documents and can not be construed as an order compelling such production.
to the extent that meléndez is simply arguing that meléndez ii was incorrect because the district court failed to conclude that the court january,ruling was in error,we reject that claim.as explained above,we conclude that the january ruling was proper because meléndez can not point to any court order that the defendants disobeyed.to the extent that meléndez is simply arguing that meléndez ii was incorrect because the district court failed to conclude that the court january,ruling was in error,we reject that claim.as explained above,we conclude that the january ruling was proper because meléndez can not point to any court order that the defendants disobeyed.

this circuit has expressed uncertainty about whether these exceptions constitute two separate exceptions or just one.noted that it is not clear from the creation of danger language in deshaney whether a state action which enhances or creates danger to an individual would provide a separate exception to the general rule of no duty to protect,or whether the language is simply in service of the special relationship exception and provides a set of circumstances where the state actions might create a special relationship and thus a duty to protect,at quoting rivera,at.recently,however,this court suggested that the danger theory and what might be termed the limitation theory,that if the state limits an individual ability to protect himself,it may be held liable for harm caused by a third party are two separate exceptions to the general rule that the state failure to protect does not constitute a due process violation.see gloria,cir.this circuit has expressed uncertainty about whether these exceptions constitute two separate exceptions or just one.noted that it is not clear from the creation of danger language in deshaney whether a state action which enhances or creates danger to an individual would provide a separate exception to the general rule of no duty to protect,or whether the language is simply in service of the special relationship exception and provides a set of circumstances where the state actions might create a special relationship and thus a duty to protect,at quoting rivera,at.recently,however,this court suggested that the danger theory and what might be termed the limitation theory,that if the state limits an individual ability to protect himself,it may be held liable for harm caused by a third party are two separate exceptions to the general rule that the state failure to protect does not constitute a due process violation.see gloria,cir.
