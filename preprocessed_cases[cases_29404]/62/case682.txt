david roth was given mandatory retirement from the united states air force at the rank of major,effective july,after twice having been nonselected for promotion to the rank of lieutenant colonel.this followed a mandatory discharge in for failure to be promoted to major and subsequent reinstatement and promotion to that rank after corrective action by the air force board for correction of military records board.following an unsuccessful application to the board after his second separation,roth filed suit in the united states court of federal claims on october.in his suit,he sought reinstatement to the rank of major as of july,back pay,benefits,and the correction of his military record.
on april,the court of federal claims granted judgment in roth favor based on the administrative record.the court first ruled that roth was entitled,through board action,to various corrections of his military record.the corrections were i upgrading the indorsement levels on three of his officer effectiveness reports oers ii removal of the notation corrected copy from his oer for the period ending march,march oer iii forwarding recommendations for approval of an decoration for his service at shaw air force base afb iv awarding an decoration for his service at ramstein afb v insertion of an air force af form in his record explaining the lack of an oer for the eleven months prior to his involuntary separation from the air force in january of and vi insertion of an af form,training report,to reflect air force institute of technology afit sponsorship of his attendance at a graduate school program during the month period that began in february of during which he was involuntarily separated from the air force.after correcting roth record,the court of federal claims voided his calendar year and nonselections for promotion to lieutenant colonel and directed the board to reinstate him to active duty at the rank of major retroactive to july,with back pay and benefits.finally,the court ordered the board to send roth corrected record to special selection boards ssbs to determine whether,if roth had gone before the and selection boards with his record as corrected,he would have been promoted to lieutenant colonel.roth united states,fed.cl.
the government now appeals the decision of the court of federal claims.it argues that the court exceeded its authority when it directed the board to correct roth record.in the alternative,it urges,assuming record corrections were in order,the court erred in the further relief it granted.according to the government,the court simply should have directed that roth corrected record be referred to ssbs for a determination as to whether,if roth had gone before the and lieutenant colonel selection boards with his record as corrected,he would have been promoted.the government contends that the court should not have voided roth two nonselections for promotion and ordered him retroactively reinstated to active duty.
for the reasons set forth below,we see no error in the decision of the court of federal claims insofar as it i directed the upgrading of the indorsement levels on three of roth oers ii ordered the forwarding of recommendations for approval of an decoration for roth service at shaw afb iii ordered that an decoration be awarded for roth service at ramstein afb and iv ordered the insertion of an af form explaining the lack of an oer for the eleven months prior to roth initial separation.we also see no error in the court decision insofar as it ordered that ssbs be convened for the and lieutenant colonel selection boards.we agree with the government,however,that the court of federal claims exceeded its authority in ordering the removal of the corrected copy notation on the march oer and in ordering that a training report be added to roth record reflecting afit sponsorship of a graduate course during his previous involuntary separation.nevertheless,on the latter point,we do think that roth is entitled to a nonprejudicial correction of his record to cover the gap in his service record from january,to june.we also agree with the government that the court of federal claims erred in voiding roth and nonselections for promotion to lieutenant colonel and in reinstating him to active duty at the rank of major with back pay and benefits,retroactive to july.
thus,we affirm the decision of the court of federal claims insofar as it directed record corrections i iv above in the preceding paragraph.however,we modify the court decision insofar as it ordered that a training report be added to roth record reflecting afit sponsorship during his involuntary separation.finally,we reverse the court decision insofar as it ordered the removal of the corrected copy notation on the march oer,voided roth and nonselections for promotion to lieutenant colonel,and ordered him retroactively reinstated to active duty at the rank of major with back pay and benefits.the case is remanded to the court of federal claims with the instruction that the court,in turn,remand the case to the board for further proceedings.in remanding the case to the board,the court is to instruct the board to make the four record corrections noted above and to correct roth record with respect to the gap in service between january,and june.the court also is to instruct the board to convene ssbs for the and lieutenant colonel selection boards to consider roth for promotion to lieutenant colonel in light of the corrections that will have been made in his record.in sum,we,and remand with instructions.
background 
roth was commissioned a second lieutenant in the air force reserve on june.by december,he had attained extended active duty status.soon thereafter,he became regular air force and was promoted to the rank of captain.in june,he assumed duties at shaw afb,south carolina,as intermediate command ninth air force inspector general air intelligence inspector.on each of his oers,including the one ending june,june oer,he received impeccable performance ratings.in addition,each of his oers was indorsed by a brigadier general roth,fed.cl.at.
between june and march,roth was investigated by the air force office of special investigations afosi as a result of allegations of personal wrongdoing.id.based solely upon the fact of these allegations,roth received an unfavorable mark on his march oer,covering the period june,to march.on item of the professional qualities category,which queried whether o ff duty personal problems detracted from an otherwise excellent professional image,he received a meets standard rating.id.in addition,the indorsement on his march oer was from the ninth air force inspector general a colonel,rather than from the ninth air force vice commander a brigadier general,which had been the case previously.
the afosi investigation closed on july,after the issuance of the march oer,and roth was ultimately absolved of all charges of wrongdoing.his two subsequent oers,for the periods covering march,to january,january oer,and january,to june,june oer,nevertheless reflected the same lowered indorsement level of only colonels,one serving as ninth air force inspector general and the other as ninth air force deputy chief of staff for intelligence.in the summer of,roth was given a permanent change of station to homestead afb,but he did not receive any decorations recognizing his three years of service at shaw afb.in july,he was transferred to ramstein afb,germany.
roth was passed over for promotion to the rank of major on september,and again on june.as a result,he was involuntarily separated from the air force with an honorable discharge on january,roth,fed.cl.at.upon his separation,he received neither a decoration nor an oer for his eleven months of service at ramstein afb.
in march,roth applied to the board for relief.in his application,he requested i that item on his march oer be upgraded to well above standard ii that he be reconsidered for promotion by an ssb and iii that if selected by an ssb,he be reinstated to active duty.in the matter of roth,slip op.at.on october,the board recommended upgrading item of the march oer to well above standard and replacing the previous comments on his march oer with the comment behavior and bearing were exemplary.id.at.the board also convened two ssbs,which met on may,to reconsider roth promotion to major for the calendar years and,based on the corrected march oer.roth,fed.cl.at.although the ssb for calendar year did not recommend his promotion,the ssb for calendar year concluded that roth would have been promoted to major by the original selection board on the basis of his corrected march oer.roth,fed.cl.at.
in a formal request to return to active duty on june,roth informed the air force that after his involuntary separation,he had enrolled in an advanced degree program at the claremont graduate school in claremont,california,where he was working toward a in international political economy.id.at.he asked that he be allowed to complete the program,perhaps under sponsorship by afit,so that a nonprejudicial explanation for his absence from active duty could be placed in his record.id.roth took his request to the board,which sought the opinion of the air force military personnel center afmpc.in the matter of roth,slip op.at.the afmpc indicated that afit does not itself sponsor students,and that both the air force academy and air force intelligence roth last duty station declined to sponsor roth for the afit program.id.based on the afmpc further explanation that no graduate education quota in roth degree area had been established by the air force for fiscal year,the board refused to provide roth with afit sponsorship.id.
the board did decide,however,that roth should be reinstated as a result of the ssb decision for calendar year.the board further determined that his record should be corrected for the month period from january,to june,during which he was separated,to show that he was not discharged from all appointments on january but on that date,he was ordered permanent change of station pcs to his home id.on june,roth was returned to active duty at the rank of major,retroactive to january.roth,fed.cl.at.
upon his return to active duty,roth was assigned to the defense intelligence agency in a joint staff assignment at the department of defense.by the time the lieutenant colonel selection board met in october,roth had received only three oers since his return to active duty,see in the matter of roth,slip op.at june,whereas other candidates with competing service generally had received five or six.roth,fed.cl.at.roth was passed over for promotion to lieutenant colonel.after a subsequent passover in,he was given mandatory retirement from active duty effective july,id.at.
on august,roth submitted to the board a request for reconsideration.he asked,inter alia,that his records be corrected to reflect direct promotion to lieutenant colonel as if he had been selected by the october selection board.roth asserted that he was denied fair and equitable consideration for promotion to lieutenant colonel in and because his record was not substantially complete.roth argued that as a result of omissions that could be traced directly to his march oer and his erroneous separation in,his record included the following errors 
unrated months prior to his separation unrated years between his erroneous separation and reinstatement misleading,inaccurate,and improperly reduced indorsement levels on oers closing march,january,and june lack of deserved decorations upon transfer from shaw afb in and ramstein air base in direct reference to restoration to active duty by board action on af form corrected copy reference on march oer and prfs for and lieutenant colonel promotion boards prepared on basis of inaccurate and incomplete personnel record 
roth urged that a directed promotion to the grade of lieutenant colonel would be the most appropriate way to remove the consequences of his flawed oer once and for all.
on the merits of roth claims,the afmpc recommended that the board i order the march and january and june oers reaccomplished with upgraded indorsements ii deny the request to remove the corrected copy notation from the corrected march oer iii deny the request for an decoration from shaw afb iv award an decoration from ramstein afb v place a form in roth record indicating that no rating was available for the last eleven months of active duty prior to his separation in through no fault of the applicant vi deny the request for an afit training report for the months of roth involuntary separation vii deny the request to alter the language on his july af form viii deny any correction to the prfs for the and selection boards ix deny roth direct promotion to lieutenant colonel and x should the board make the recommended corrections,send roth record to an ssb for consideration for promotion to lieutenant colonel.memorandum from the afmpc to the board at.
despite the afmpc admission of certain errors in roth record,on june,the board denied roth request for reconsideration for failure to demonstrate the existence of probable material error or injustice in the matter of roth,slip op.at june.specifically addressing roth request for direct promotion to lieutenant colonel,the board found no evidence that roth record was so inaccurate or misleading that the members of the duly constituted selection board were precluded from rendering a reasonable decision concerning his promotability in comparison to his peers.id.at.with regard to his requested record corrections,the board found insufficient relevant evidence to demonstrate the existence of probable error or injustice warranting corrective action.id.
on october,roth filed suit in the court of federal claims.in his complaint,he asserted i that the board june,decision was arbitrary,capricious,and contrary to law ii that he was entitled to promotion consideration on a fair and equitable basis iii that his and nonselections for promotion to lieutenant colonel were unlawful because they were based on a record that did not reflect his career on a fair and equitable basis iv that he was therefore entitled to active duty pay,allowances,and other benefits at the rank of major from his unlawful mandatory retirement on july,and v that he also was entitled to have deleted from his record the and nonselections for promotion and his mandatory retirement,and to have his record modified to reflect continuous active duty service.roth,fed.cl.at.
in response,the government filed a motion to dismiss or,in the alternative,a motion for judgment on the administrative record.roth responded by filing a for judgment on the administrative record.the court ruled on those on april.
in its decision,the court addressed in turn each of roth requests for relief.id.at.the court determined that the board refusal to upgrade the indorsement levels on roth march and january and june oers,despite the fact that the afmpc admitted that roth record warranted the corrections,was arbitrary and capricious.id.at.according to the court,the board standard that roth evaluators were not precluded from forwarding the contested reports for higher level indorsements was not supported in law.id.emphasis added by the court.in addition,the court was persuaded by explanations from former members of roth chain of command that had it not been for the pending afosi investigation,roth would have received indorsements on the oers.id.the court thus ordered the indorsements on the three oers to be upgraded.
the court also ordered the board to remove the notation corrected copy from roth corrected march oer and to apply discretionary language,pursuant to note of afr,table,that would be innocuous as far as roth prospects for promotion were concerned.id.
the court determined that the board decision with respect to decorations from shaw and ramstein afbs was arbitrary and capricious as well.id.at.again,the court concluded that the board rationale,that there was no evidence that the members of roth chain of command were precluded from recommending him for an end of tour decoration when he departed shaw afb,had no basis in law.id.emphasis added by the court.thus,the court ordered the board to forward the recommendations for the shaw afb decoration for determination whether the award should be issued.id.for the same reason,and also because the afmpc admitted it was warranted,the court ordered the board to award roth an decoration for his service at ramstein afb.id.
the court also ordered the board to issue an af form for the period from march,to january,with language,consistent with the afmpc recommendation,that no report was available for reasons that were not the fault of roth.id.at.
the court determined that the board refusal of afit sponsorship for roth graduate studies constituted a failure to fulfill its duty to take steps to grant thorough and fitting relief.id.at,citing caddington united states.the court thus ordered the board to add to roth record an afit training report for the month period from january,to june,reflecting marks commensurate with his academic performance at the claremont graduate school,the institution which he had attended.id.at.
the court concluded that the board decision not to grant roth request for promotion to lieutenant colonel was arbitrary and capricious,and in clear violation of operative statutory and case law id.at.according to the court,the board applied a legal standard with no basis in law when it decided that roth records were not so inaccurate or misleading that the selection board was precluded from rendering a reasonable decision concerning his promotability in comparison to his peers.id.emphases added by the court.the court recognized,however,that the ultimate decision to promote roth lay solely with the military.id.at.it therefore did not order the board to promote him but rather ordered the board to submit his corrected record to ssbs for the and selection boards.id.at.
finally,the court of federal claims voided roth and nonselections for promotion to lieutenant colonel and ordered that he be reinstated at the rank of major retroactive to july,with back pay and benefits.id.the government appeals the court of federal claims decision.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
the court of federal claims reviews a board decision to determine if it is arbitrary,capricious,contrary to law,or unsupported by substantial evidence.heisig united states.in this case,the court granted summary judgment on the administrative record based on the absence of genuine issues of material fact.fed.cl.c,anderson liberty lobby,d.
we review legal determinations of the court of federal claims,such as a judgment on the administrative record,de novo.heisig,at.we therefore apply the same standard of review we will not disturb the board decision unless we find it to be arbitrary,capricious,contrary to law,or unsupported by substantial evidence.see haselrig united states.as the court of federal claims recognized,the pertinent facts in this case are not in dispute.accordingly,we need only decide whether the court erred as a matter of law in the several rulings that the government challenges on appeal.we begin with the legal framework for the issues raised by the government.
when a military officer is involuntarily separated from active duty,or mandatorily retired,for twice failing to be selected for promotion,he may apply for relief,pursuant to a,to the appropriate board for the correction of military records.the correction board is a civilian board,through which the secretary of a military department may correct any military record when the secretary considers it necessary to correct an error or remove an injustice.a.the secretary is obligated not only to properly determine the nature of any error or injustice,but also to take such corrective action as will appropriately and fully erase such error or compensate such injustice.caddington.at.
in carrying out its function,the correction board must determine whether the applicant has demonstrated the existence of a material error or injustice that can be remedied effectively through correction of the applicant military record and,if so,what corrections are needed to provide full and effective relief.l.indeed,when a correction board fails to correct an injustice clearly presented in the record before it,it is acting in violation of its mandate.yee united states.our predecessor court elaborated upon this obligation of the board t he secretary and his boards have an abiding moral sanction to determine,insofar as possible,the true nature of an alleged injustice and to take steps to grant thorough and fitting relief.caddington.at.
turning to the matter of promotion,the fundamental rule is that documents that are sent to a selection board must be substantially complete,and must fairly portray the officer record.weiss united states.if an officer record contains prejudicial information,or lacks pertinent documents that may have mitigated the adverse impact of the prejudicial information,the record is not complete,and the law requires that another selection board be presented with a substantially complete and fair record.porter united states,citing weiss,at sanders united states.
we explained in porter that section does not limit the kind of military record subject to correction by a correction board hence,a correction board may entertain any kind of application for correction.at.the application may request corrections ranging from changing the terms of a discharge,or the citation of awards received,to amending records that include oers,passover decisions by selection boards or ssbs,and discharge orders.id.
before a correction board,an officer has the burden of presenting sufficient evidence of probable material error or injustice.a.faced with an application for the correction of an officer records,a correction board has multiple options.first,it may deny the application,at which point,in all cases but one,the board acts for the secretary and its decision is final id.p.
the correction board also may grant any application in whole or in part,and if the relief was recommended by the official preparing the advisory opinion,was unanimously agreed to by the panel,and does not involve an appointment or promotion requiring confirmation by the senate,the board decision is final.id.p.if the board decision to grant an application in whole or in part is not final pursuant to section p,it forwards the record of the proceedings to the secretary for a final decision.id.q.
should a correction board decide to grant corrections to an officer record,it may choose to convene an ssb under the provisions of b,which was enacted as part of the defense officer personnel management act dopma section b provides that in the case of an officer who was previously considered for promotion but was not selected,the secretary may convene a special selection board ssb if the secretary determines either that 
a the action of the board which considered the officer was contrary to law or involved material error of fact or material administrative error or 
b the board did not have before it for its consideration material information.
id.b emphasis added.by the language of the statute,if a correction board corrects an officer record,but does not find i that the original selection board decision was contrary to law or involved material error of fact or material administrative error,or ii that the original selection board lacked material information for its consideration,it may alternately choose not to convene an ssb,despite any corrections it ordered in the officer record.see porter,at the air force regulations for ssbs have thus consistently stated that access to an ssb occurs when the secretary,or his or her designee,determines that a material error of fact was involved in the previous passover decisions.id.at under section,a officer has access to an ssb on a showing of material error.
in the alternative,when a correction board determines that the initial selection board decision did contain material error of fact or material administrative error,the proper course is for the board to refer the corrected record to an ssb for a determination whether the officer would have been promoted had the initial selection board had the corrected records before it.id.at richey united states.
the ssb will compare the officer corrected record to a sampling of the records of those officers of the same competitive category who were recommended for promotion,and those officers who were not recommended for promotion,by the board that originally considered the officer.b.if the ssb decides the officer would have been promoted based upon his or her corrected records,the secretary is bound by that decision.porter,at.the consequences of this selection then relate back to the date of the selection board that passed over the officer,for which the ssb is the substitute the officer receives the same position on the active duty list with the requisite pay and benefits that accrue to the rank to which he or she is promoted as a result of the ssb decision.d porter,at.
if,on the other hand,the ssb decides that the officer would not have been promoted,the officer incurs no additional failure of selection for promotion,b,and the officer may then bring to the correction board any complaints he or she may have concerning the process and decision of the ssb.porter,at.by first sending the officer to an ssb to determine whether he or she would have been selected for promotion,rather than exercising its own discretion to select the officer,the correction board is authorized and obligated to review the actions of the ssb on application from the officer id.at.as we explained in porter,the board must be able to act in the event material errors of a procedural,factual,or compositional nature infect the ssb deliberations.id.the ultimate responsibility lies with the board to assure that an ssb produces a reasonable determination of the officer promotion prospects,which is the focus of the board inquiry under section upon an appeal by the officer of the ssb decision.id.at.thus,the correction board is obligated to recommend to the secretary voidance of an ssb decision when it concludes that the process of presenting the corrected records to the ssb did not yield a reasonable determination that the officer would have been denied promotion initially even with an untainted record id.
an officer may obtain review of an adverse decision of a correction board in the court of federal claims,provided that the court has jurisdiction in the case pursuant to the tucker act,a the tucker act authorizes certain actions for monetary relief against the united states to be brought in the court of federal claims.for actions pursuant to contracts with the united states,actions to recover illegal exactions of money by the united states,and actions brought pursuant to statutes,regulations,executive orders,or constitutional provisions,the tucker act waives the sovereign immunity of the united states.a united states mitchell,d united states testan,d.because the tucker act itself does not provide a substantive cause of action,however,a plaintiff must find elsewhere a source upon which to base a suit.mitchell,at.testan,at.collins united states.
in the context of involuntary separation cases,such as this one,the applicable source is the military pay act.see,martinez united states,en banc adkins united states,sanders,at.in order to bring such a case in the court of federal claims,the plaintiff must allege that because the separation was unlawful,he or she is entitled to the pay that would have been received but for the unlawful action.see martinez,at.moreover,although the court of federal claims does not possess general equity jurisdiction,under the tucker act,in actions for monetary relief,t o provide an entire remedy and to complete the relief afforded by the judgment,the court may,as an incident of and collateral to any such judgment,issue orders directing restoration to office or position,placement in appropriate duty or retirement status,and correction of applicable records a.finally,an involuntarily discharged or mandatorily retired officer must bring his or her tucker act action in the court of federal claims within six years of the date of discharge or retirement.see id.
justiciability 
the government challenges neither the court of federal claims exercise of jurisdiction over roth complaint nor the court order to add to his record an af form explaining that the absence of an oer for the period march,to january,was not his fault.the government does,however,challenge the justiciability of the remaining corrections ordered by the court according to the government,those corrections present nonjusticiable issues of military discretion because there are no statutory or regulatory guidelines against which the decisions of the military may be measured.
even if a court possesses jurisdiction to hear a claim,when that claim presents a nonjusticiable controversy,the court may nevertheless be prevented from asserting its jurisdiction.we have explained that a controversy is justiciable only if it is one which the courts can finally and effectively decide,under tests and standards which they can soundly administer within their special field of competence.voge united states,quoting greene mcelroy.in the military arena,because of the admonition against court interference with military matters,see orloff willoughby,justiciability is an especially appropriate inquiry.adkins,at quoting murphy united states.as it is an issue of law,this court decides de novo whether a claim is justiciable.id.
we have held that the merits of a service secretary decision regarding military affairs are beyond the ken of judicial review.id.not all claims arising from military decisions,however,present nonjusticiable controversies this court has consistently recognized that,although the merits of a decision committed wholly to the discretion of the military are not subject to judicial review,a challenge to the particular procedure followed in rendering a military decision may present a justiciable controversy.id.emphasis in original.we spelled out in murphy that a court may in fact decide whether the military followed its own procedures,which by their nature limit the military discretion.at.accordingly,in cases in which procedural violations are alleged,the test or standards against which this court measures the military conduct are inherent they are the applicable statutes and regulations.adkins,at.to engage in such an inquiry does not intrude upon any discretion reserved exclusively for the military rather,the inquiry merely ascertains whether applicable military procedures,statutory or regulatory,were followed.we have therefore determined that questions of procedural compliance are justiciable.
the government argues that if a regulatory or statutory standard does not govern a particular military action,the action is not justiciable.in this case,according to the government,all but one of the corrections ordered by the court of federal claims were based not upon the air force failure to comply with regulation,but upon facially discretionary acts by air force officers and the board.the government thus contends that the court of federal claims exceeded its authority by intruding into the military province.for example,the government asserts that the trial court cited no regulatory guidance governing the level at which roth oers should have been indorsed.the issue was therefore nonjusticiable,and the trial court was without the authority to order the indorsement levels raised on the march and january and june oers.
roth responds that the errors in his record arose from improperly executed military decisions,and that the mere presence of discretion in a military decision does not render that decision nonjusticiable per se.roth explains that,contrary to the government contentions,the court of federal claims was not being asked to make substantive decisions for the military.roth asks us to recognize that the actions of the military in his case were improperly undertaken when measured against the regulations that governed them.
pursuant to afr,paragraph,an officer is entitled to fair and equitable promotion consideration,and roth contends that this court has recognized the justiciability of this standard in its assessment of the propriety of records with which officers compete for promotion.see sargisson united states,explaining that the court of claims reviewed the actions of selection boards for compliance with the requirement of c repealed that the record presented to a selection board portray an officer career in a fair and equitable manner.roth asserts that the events leading to his allegedly unlawful discharge began with the improper downgrading of his march oer.he argues that the failure of the board to correct his records prevented his receiving fair and equitable consideration.his claim,he argues,is therefore justiciable.
with two exceptions,we think that the record corrections ordered by the court of federal claims do not run afoul of the rules of justiciability as they pertain to military decisions.we agree with the government that in order for an officer claim to the correction of his record to be justiciable,there must exist standards by which a court can review the military decisions at issue.see adkins,at.what we think the government fails to recognize,however,is that a normally nonjusticiable decision is not insulated from judicial review if it flows directly from the breach of a statute or regulation.once a breach has been established,the obligation falls to the board,or if necessary to the court,to take steps to grant thorough and fitting relief caddington.at.
for example,the government is correct that there is no explicit regulation governing the level at which an officer oer should be indorsed.however,as we discuss in part below,the lowered indorsement levels on roth march and january and june oers occurred as a direct result of the violation of afr on his march oer.therefore,the decision to lower the indorsement levels on three of roth oers is not insulated from judicial review merely because no regulation explicitly sets forth guidelines for the indorsement levels on officer oers.the fact that the decisions to lower the indorsements flowed directly from the violation of a related regulation provides sufficient basis for the court to undertake judicial review.
downgraded march oer 
paragraph of afr states that certain material is inappropriate and must not be considered in the evaluation process or included in comments in evaluation reports or indorsements to them.among the matters prohibited from consideration in the preparation of an oer are c harges preferred,investigations,reviews by boards of evaluation or inquiry that are not complete as of the closeout date afr,a.roth presented unrebutted evidence to the board that the rating under item of the professional qualities category on his march oer was lowered as a result of the afosi investigation,which was not completed until july,despite the fact that he was ultimately absolved of all allegations against him.
in his initial appeal to the board in,roth presented statements signed by all three of the raters on his march oer that their decision to downgrade item was the result of the afosi investigation,the afosi interviews of roth coworkers,and the existence of allegations and rumors concerning his behavior.colonels william coward,dieter satz,and david sawyer each averred that roth evaluation was written during the heat of this controversy,and they based their evaluation upon the best information they had available at the time.board,
during the proceedings in roth appeal to the board,each of these three raters was also forwarded the afmpc recommendation,which was to deny roth the correction of his march oer.in response,colonel satz stated in a letter to the board that during a phone call from higher headquarters that addressed both the investigation and the march oer,t he option provided to colonel coward and i at that time was to downgrade at least one block in captain roth oer or else in the absence of the above,captain roth would not have been downgraded in block,professional qualities.board colonel sawyer likewise stated,it was precisely because the investigation was ongoing and serious accusations were being made against captain roth that i was directed to downgrade block.i had originally marked the block well above standards,but was directed by colonel satz and colonel coward to reaccomplish the oer because we could not ignore the accusations.board colonel coward confirmed this sequence of events 
the ninth air force commander and i had a discussion about the allegations the ninth air commander and i agreed that the oer on captain roth should be rewritten and block nine should reflect the apparent off duty indiscretions of captain roth.the rating and reviewing officials agreed with this decision,and the oer was rewritten i know that the decisions concerning captain roth were honestly but poorly made and based solely on unsubstantiated allegations.
board it is clear that afr,paragraph a was violated when item of the professional qualities category was downgraded to meets standard on roth march oer.
as noted above,the board did grant roth relief for this violation in.in the matter of roth.the board recommended that item on roth march oer be corrected to reflect a well above standard rating,that certain negative comments be deleted,and that the comment behavior and bearing were exemplary be inserted.id.at.the board further recommended that roth be considered for promotion to major by an ssb for each selection board in which the corrections it had ordered were not a matter of record.id.
the court of federal claims determined that the board failed to afford roth complete relief,however.thus,it upgraded the indorsement levels on three of his oers ordered the removal of the notation corrected copy from his march oer ordered that recommendations for approval of an decoration for his service at shaw afb be forwarded for consideration and ordered that an decoration be awarded for his service at ramstein afb.the court also ordered the insertion of an af form in roth record explaining the lack of an oer for the eleven months prior to his separation from the air force in,and the insertion of an af form,training report,to reflect afit sponsorship of his attendance at a graduate school program during the period that he was involuntarily separated.in addition,the court voided roth and nonselections for promotion to lieutenant colonel.we address these record corrections in turn.
indorsement levels on march and january and june oers 
roth june oer had been indorsed by the vice commander of ninth air force,brigadier general robert mccann.the indorsement on his march oer,however,dropped to that of colonel coward,serving as ninth air force inspector general.not only then was roth march oer substantively downgraded,but also colonel coward admitted that t he false allegations against roth preempted his intentions of requesting the same level of indorsement in that roth had received in.board this reflects a violation of afr,paragraph a,for it demonstrates that the investigation against roth,which was not complete as of the closing date of the march oer,was considered in connection with the level of indorsement on roth march oer.
in turn,the downgrade in the indorsement level in march precipitated subsequent downgrades in the indorsement levels on roth january and june oers.on both,roth was indorsed only by a colonel,rather than brigadier general mccann.lieutenant colonel william atkinson,the additional rater on roth january oer,admitted that 
b ecause of the previously documented substandard performance,as reflected in that oer of june through march,major roth following oer,from mar through jan,for which i was the additional rater,could also not be sent forward for the air force vice commander indorsement this oer for duty with would most certainly have been forwarded for the vice commander indorsement had it not been for the previous incident for which major roth has since been absolved of any wrongdoing,and the substandard oer of june through march,which has now been corrected.
similarly,both the rater and additional rater on major roth june oer,lieutenant colonel robert heller and brigadier general john garrison,respectively,explained that the january and june oers would most certainly have been forwarded for the vice commander indorsement had it not been for the previous incident for which major roth has since been absolved of any wrongdoing,and for the substandard oer of june through march,which has now been corrected.board,in addition,the vice commander himself,brigadier general mccann,confirmed that allegations of misconduct by roth,subsequently found to be without basis,drove the decisions by rating and additional rating officers not to forward roth oers to me for indorsement.board general mccann also stated that he would have indorsed all three oers had they been forwarded to him,and he requested that the board correct any oer shown not to have been forwarded to him because of the allegations against roth to reflect his indorsement.board 
it is therefore clear that the lowered indorsements on roth march and january and june oers resulted directly from the initial violation of afr,paragraph a,the downgrading of item on his march oer,and constituted independent violations of that regulation as well.notably,the afmpc agreed in its advisory opinion to the board and conceded that if it chose,the board could order the oers to be reaccomplished.memorandum from the afmpc to the board at.because of these violations of afr,the court of federal claims determined the decision to lower the indorsement levels on all three oers to be a justiciable military decision.we agree,and we affirm the decision to order that roth march and january and june oers be reaccomplished to reflect the indorsement of commander brigadier general mccann.
corrected copy notation on march oer 
in,the board corrected roth march oer by upgrading section iii,item,to well above standard.in the matter of roth,slip op.at.in accordance with afr,table,note,the oer was also marked with the notation corrected copy.the necessity for this notation arose as a direct result of the improper downgrading of roth march oer in violation of afr,paragraph a.had the march oer been properly prepared when it was first issued,it would not have been necessary to correct it later.we therefore agree with the court of federal claims that this issue too is a justiciable military decision.
roth argued before the board that the appearance of corrected copy on his oer was prejudicial to him in his consideration by subsequent selection boards.we explained in sanders that because regulations prescribe that oers are to be objective and prepared in a certain way,i f a particular officer oer has not been so prepared and that defect could have resulted in his nonselection for promotion,this is legal and factual error and an injustice to the officer as well.at.the court of federal claims concluded,based on the text of note,that the board has discretion respecting the language that may be used upon correcting an oer as evidenced by the caveat unless otherwise directed by the board.roth,fed.cl.at.it therefore ordered the board to apply discretionary language,instead of corrected copy,on roth march oer.
we do not agree with the court of federal claims on this point.the reason is that we are unable to discern any error in the addition of the notation corrected copy on the march oer.not only was the notation placed on the oer pursuant to regulation,but before the board roth offered no support for his assertion that the notation was prejudicial.finally,roth has not even argued the point on appeal.accordingly,we reverse the court decision insofar as it directed removal of the corrected copy notation.
shaw afb decoration 
as noted,from june to the summer of,roth was assigned to shaw afb.upon his transfer to ramstein afb during the summer of,he did not receive an decoration commemorating his three years of service at shaw afb.although the air force failure to award this decoration did not itself violate any air force regulation or statute,before the board roth presented unrebutted evidence that it was the direct result of his improperly downgraded march oer.in their statements to the board,general garrison,lieutenant colonel atkinson,and lieutenant colonel heller,each within roth former chain of command,confirmed that his performance ordinarily would have warranted an medal when he transferred from shaw afb had it not been for the now corrected march oer in light of this evidence that the absence of the decoration flowed directly from the original violation of afr,paragraph a,we agree that the decision not to award roth an decoration for his service at shaw afb presents a justiciable military decision 
the afmpc did not recommend this correction to roth record because,unlike the statements he provided regarding the ramstein afb decoration,discussed in the next section,roth did not provide a similar statement from the approving authority that the shaw afb decoration would have been approved had the recommendations for it gone forward.memorandum from the afmpc to the board,at.the board,in turn,found no evidence that the members of roth chain of command were precluded from recommending him for an end of tour decoration when he departed shaw afb the applicant has not provided reaccomplished reports or a recommendation for the requested award prepared by the appropriate officials consequently,the board did not award roth the decoration.in the matter of roth,slip op.at june.the court of federal claims,however,explained that roth had provided evidence from his former chain of command that he would have been recommended for the award.the court therefore directed the board to order the recommendations for the award to be sent forward.we agree that the recommendations to award roth an decoration for his service at shaw afb should be forwarded to the proper authority for a determination whether the award should be issued.
ramstein afb decoration 
roth also did not receive an decoration upon his separation from ramstein afb.major roth commander at the time of his separation,lieutenant colonel walter harris,stated that had an oer been prepared for roth,it would have reflected honorable and competent success oriented service.board moreover,had roth departure been due to causes other than separation,lieutenant colonel harris would have considered him for an medal commensurate with his evaluation of roth accomplishments board general,the approval authority for the medal at the time,explained to the board that he would have approved a recommendation for the medal had it been submitted by roth commanding officers,and that he supported a correction of roth record to that effect.board these views were shared by colonel richard,director,plans and systems for at the time of roth separation and a member of his immediate supervisory chain.board 
the lack of an medal from ramstein afb flowed directly from the violation committed on roth march oer,which infected his january and june oers.the evidence establishes that the downgraded indorsement levels resulted in his separation,which in turn resulted in his not receiving an decoration for his service at ramstein afb.the court of federal claims properly found this military decision to be justiciable in light of the statements by members of roth former chain of command.
the afmpc concluded,based on these statements from members of roth chain of command,that the board could order the decoration to be awarded.memorandum from the afmpc to the board at.the court directed the board to award roth the medal.we agree,and we affirm the trial court order that roth record be corrected to reflect the award of an decoration upon his departure from ramstein afb.
lack of an oer for the eleven months prior to january,
the absence of an oer for the period from march,to january,prior to roth involuntary discharge,was the direct result of the initial violation of afr,paragraph a,for roth would not have been separated had his march oer not been improperly downgraded.in addition,the failure to provide roth an oer for this period constituted a violation of afr,table,note.that provision mandates that a separated officer receive an oer unless his separation is either voluntary or for misconduct under afr,neither of which applied to roth.in view of afr,this military decision is justiciable.
the afmpc admitted this violation,and offered that the board could order a form to be placed in roth record indicating that no rating was available for the period through no fault of roth.memorandum from the afmpc to the board at.we agree,and we affirm the court of federal claims decision to order the placement of an af form in roth record with language to the effect that a report for this period is not available for administrative reasons which were not the fault of roth.
afit sponsorship 
after his separation on january,roth did not return to active duty until june,resulting in an approximately gap in his record.roth sought to account for this gap with an af form training report indicating that the graduate studies he had been pursuing while he was separated were sponsored by afit.the afmpc recommended against the sponsorship,explaining that the gaps in roth record were accounted for by forms prescribed by,inter alia,air force instruction afi,afr,and afr memorandum from the afmpc to the board at.because air force regulations do prescribe how the air force accounts for gaps in an officer record,we find this decision to account for roth absence to be justiciable.
in,the board declined roth request for afit sponsorship because the air staff indicated there was no education quota in roth degree area during fiscal year.in the matter of roth,slip op.at.the board instead recommended that roth record be corrected to reflect that he was ordered permanent change of station pcs to his home id.at.an af form was placed in roth record stating,no report available for the period mar through jun.member restored to active duty by direction of the secretary of the air force under afr,air force board for the correction of military records.in the board again declined to award roth afit sponsorship for this gap because he was not actually in an afit training program during those months therefore,to insert an afit training report would create an erroneous and misleading record.in the matter of roth,slip op.at june.
roth explains that had he not been discharged as a result of the improperly prepared march oer,he would have received evaluations during these months,and that the air force failure to account for this gap was prejudicial to his record.the court of federal claims thus ordered the board to issue the afit training report as part of its duty to roth to take steps to grant thorough and fitting relief.roth.at citing caddington.at.because the court did not identify any statute or regulation that had been violated,however,we disagree with its decision.we also disagree with the board decision to permit roth record to reflect his home as his place of active duty,however.this too fails to adequately remedy the gap in roth record,which directly resulted from the initial violation of afr,paragraph a.we thus modify the ruling of the court of federal claims on this point by ordering that the af form in roth record regarding his month absence from the service be corrected to properly explain that both the gap and the resultant lack of oers for this period occurred through no fault on his part.we leave the exact wording of the correction to the discretion of the board,with the caveat that the language must be nonprejudicial to roth future prospects for promotion selection.
we think this relief,coupled with the award of an af form that explains in a nonprejudicial manner the lack of an oer for the eleven months from march,to january,will adequately substitute for the current af form in roth record that reads,no report available for the period mar through jun.member restored to active duty we agree with roth that the language on this form,quoted above,erroneously implies that roth was not on active duty for the entire forty months,when in fact,he served on active duty from march,to january,before he was simply failed to receive the oer he had earned for those eleven months.this error will be remedied by the separate af forms we have ordered to be issued one for the eleven months prior to his separation for which he should have received an oer by regulation,and one explaining the month gap in his service in a manner that is not prejudicial to him.
for the reasons set forth above,we affirm all record corrections ordered by the court of federal claims,with the exception of the removal of the notation corrected copy from the march oer and the issuance to roth of an afit training report to account for his month gap in service.we reverse the court decision insofar as it directed the removal of the corrected copy notation from the march oer.we modify the court decision insofar as it directed issuance of an afit training report.instead of an afit training report,we direct that an af form be placed in roth record explaining his month absence from the service in language that is nonprejudicial to his prospects for promotion by future selection boards.
as noted,after ordering corrections to roth record,the court of federal claims directed the board to convene ssbs to determine whether,if roth had gone before the and lieutenant colonel selection boards with his record in its corrected form,he would have been promoted.in the meantime,the court ordered the and nonselections for promotion to lieutenant colonel voided and roth reinstated to active duty at the rank of major,retroactive to july,with back pay and benefits.
the government argues that the court of federal claims erred in the relief it granted roth.it contends that,assuming corrections to roth record were in order,the court simply should have referred his corrected record to ssbs for a determination as to whether,if he had gone before the and lieutenant colonel selection boards with his record as corrected,he would have been promoted.the government urges that the court action voiding the and nonselections and ordering roth reinstated to active duty was improper and contrary to our decisions in porter and richey.
for his part,roth argues that the court of federal claims did not err in voiding his nonselections and in reinstating him to active duty pending ssb action.he asserts that,under the tucker act,the court of federal claims may award equitable relief only incident of and collateral to a money judgment.a.if no money judgment is awarded,roth reasons,no equitable relief is available.according to roth,if the court did not void his and nonselections,reinstate him,and award him back pay,it could not direct any corrections to his record.thus,roth asserts that what the court did complied perfectly with the strictures of tucker act jurisdiction.roth argues that porter and richey are inapposite because they address the authority of correction boards and the ssb process,rather than the parameters of tucker act jurisdiction,which is what he says is at issue.
we see no error in the decision of the court of federal claims to remand roth case to the board with the instruction that the board correct roth record as directed and then convene ssbs for the and lieutenant colonel selection boards pursuant to b.we recognize that,generally,the proper approach after a correction board makes record corrections is for the board to decide for itself whether or not to convene ssbs.see porter,at i n the context,the board may exercise its section authority by following the statutory directive in section b a that is,convening an ssb.thus,if the correction board determines that in view of the corrections that have been made in an officer record,the action of the original selection board which considered the officer was contrary to law or involved material error of fact or material administrative error,the board may convene an ssb.b a see richey,at porter,at 
in this case,however,we agree with the court of federal claims that the appropriate course is to remand the case to the board with the instruction that the board correct roth record and then convene ssbs for the and selection boards.in view of the record corrections that will be made in roth record,we conclude that the actions of the original selection boards that considered roth for promotion involved,at a minimum,material error of fact,and that it would be arbitrary and capricious for the board not to convene ssbs.godwin united states,ruling,in part,that the correction board committed legal error in determining that no error or injustice occurred in the coast guard failure to provide godwin with an oer in violation of coast guard regulations,reversing the dismissal of the complaint,and remanding the case.
