rigoberto aguilar,a native and citizen of honduras and a lawful permanent resident alien of the united states,petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge ij order finding him removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.we have jurisdiction under.we review de novo whether aguilar has been convicted of an aggravated felony within the meaning of federal law.see parrilla gonzales,cir.we hold that aguilar was not convicted of an aggravated felony and accordingly grant the petition for review.
aguilar was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident in.in june,aguilar joined the united states marine corps.while in the marine corps,he used a government computer to access pornographic internet sites.in,he pled guilty to and was convicted by special of violating article of the uniform code of military justice 
article requires that an individual subject to the comply with any lawful general order.see,found at.the lawful general order aguilar violated in connection with his article conviction provides that government computers shall be for official use and authorized purposes only and that such authorized purposes may not include uses involving pornography.see department of defense directive,section a.
in september,the government initiated removal proceedings against aguilar,charging him with being a subject to removal because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in a i.
after holding a hearing on the charges of removability,the ij held that aguilar conviction under article was an aggravated felony as described in a and a.the ij therefore ordered aguilar removed from the united states to honduras as a convicted of an aggravated felony.
aguilar appealed to the bia.the bia applied the modified categorical approach and held that aguilar conviction under article was an aggravated felony 
under the modified categorical approach,the respondent article conviction is an aggravated felony.the government computer identified as having been used by the respondent on specific dates to obtain access to pornographic internet sites was identified as the same computer employed by him to wrongfully and knowingly possess,on the same dates,visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.therefore,we conclude that the dhs has proven by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.
the bia therefore affirmed the ij decision and dismissed aguilar appeal.aguilar is before this court on a petition for review of the bia decision.
a.the categorical approach 
to determine whether aguilar conviction under article is an aggravated felony,we apply the analytical approach outlined in taylor united states,d.see parrilla,at.this approach requires us to make a categorical comparison of the elements of the statute of conviction and the generic definition of the aggravated felony,and decide whether the conduct proscribed by the statute of conviction is broader than,and so does not categorically fall within,this generic definition.gonzales,cir en banc quotations omitted.in making this categorical comparison,we may not consider the specific conduct that resulted in the conviction or the circumstances under which the crime was committed.id.at.we must look only to the elements of the statute of conviction.see id.
a conviction is a categorical aggravated felony if a violation of the statute of conviction would necessarily also be a violation of the generic aggravated felony statute.see id.at.if,on the other hand,a violation of the statute of conviction would not necessarily be a violation of the generic aggravated felony statute,the conviction is not a categorical aggravated felony.see id.at.
here,the generic aggravated felonies with which we compare aguilar conviction are found at subsections a and a of.a violation of either of these subsections requires conduct involving a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.see a making it unlawful to knowingly receive,distribute,or reproduce for distribution any visual depiction if a the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and b such visual depiction is of such conduct a making it unlawful to knowingly possess matter which contain s any visual depiction if i the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and ii such visual depiction is of such conduct.
aguilar article conviction is thus a categorical aggravated felony only if a conviction for violating article necessarily involves a depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.see,at.
to be convicted of violating article,an individual must have engaged in conduct that 
violates or fails to obey any lawful general order or regulation 
having knowledge of any other lawful order issued by a member of the armed forces,which it is his duty to obey,fails to obey the order or 
is derelict in the performance of his duties 
found at.it is undisputed that a conviction for violating article does not necessarily involve a depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.see id.
aguilar was convicted of violating article by violating or failing to obey a lawful general order.the lawful general order that aguilar violated in connection with his article conviction is found at section a of department of defense directive section a prohibits the use of government computers except for official use and authorized purposes,and section a d provides that military agencies may not authorize uses of government computers that would reflect adversely on dod or the dod component such as uses involving pornography chain letters unofficial advertising,soliciting or selling except on authorized bulletin boards established for such use violations of statute or regulation inappropriately handled classified information and other uses that are incompatible with public service.department of defense directive,section a d.
although a violation of section a may involve pornography,a violation does not necessarily involve pornography,nor does it necessarily involve a depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.
because a violation of article through violating section a does not necessarily involve a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,aguilar article conviction is not a categorical aggravated felony see,at.
b.the modified categorical approach 
in the absence of a categorical match,we typically would next apply the modified categorical approach under which we would consider whether certain documents in the record or judicially noticeable facts show that aguilar conviction under article constituted an aggravated felony.see united states de oca,cir a.
the modified categorical approach may only be applied,however,if the elements of the crime of conviction are broader than the generic crime,at.to put it another way,the modified categorical approach applies only if the statute of conviction is divisible into several crimes,some of which involve an aggravated felony and some of which do not.id.
on the other hand,if the crime of conviction is missing an element of the generic crime altogether,we can never find that a jury was actually required to find all the elements of the generic crime,and the modified categorical approach does not apply.id.citation omitted.in other words,if the crime of conviction lacks an element of the generic crime,the crime of conviction can never be narrowed to conform to the generic crime because the jury is not taylor find all the elements of the generic crime.id.this is true even if a petitioner has admitted to the missing elements because such admissions can not be used to modify the crime because they were not necessary for a conviction.id.
here,section a prohibits uses involving pornography.see department of defense directive,section a.neither article nor section a,however,requires that the pornography involve a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.article and section a are thus missing an element of the generic crime altogether a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct the modified categorical approach does not,therefore,apply and can not be used in an attempt to conform aguilar conviction to match the generic crimes.see,at.this is true even if aguilar had admitted that the pornography he accessed in relation to his article and section a conviction involved a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.see id.
we hold that aguilar conviction for violating article of the is not an aggravated felony.aguilar is not,therefore,deportable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.accordingly,we grant the petition for review and remand to the bia with instructions to terminate the proceedings and order the government to release aguilar 
petition for review granted remanded.
no one disputes that rigoberto accessed pornographic websites on a government computer while on duty in the marine corps.no one disputes that from those pornographic websites,downloaded at least six visual depictions of children under the age of eighteen engaged in sexually explicit conduct.and no one disputes that a conviction for possession of child pornography is a statutory basis for removal.see a i,a a iii.yet the majority holds that our current precedent concerning the categorical and modified categorical approach compels us to permit to remain in the united states.
the majority relies on our statement in gonzales,cir en banc,that we can never apply the modified categorical approach w hen the crime of conviction is missing an element of the generic crime altogether.id.at.i dissent from the majority application of this statement to the facts of this case because certainly was convicted of a crime that contained all the necessary elements of a.
more importantly,i write to question our reliance on broad claim that we may never look to the modified categorical approach where the statute is missing an element of the generic crime.with all due respect,i believe that adopting such a strict rule was to the extent that it was considered at all,unnecessary,and in conflict with our prior cases and the decisions of our sister circuits.as outlined below,i would adopt the flexible approach enumerated by the supreme court that simply analyzes whether the factfinder necessarily found the defendant guilty of the requisite elements of the generic crime.
after entering the united states in and joining the united states marine corps four years later,began accessing pornographic websites on his computer workstation at the marine corps air station miramar in san diego.he specifically searched for and downloaded images of girls engaged in sexually explicit activity.he saved some of the images onto disks for his personal use at home he also borrowed a laptop from a friend on which he downloaded child pornography.
was charged before a court martial,in a single charging document,with two counts of violating the uniform code of military justice ucmj.the first count alleged a violation of article of the ucmj,which requires members of the military to obey all lawful orders.specifically,he was charged with violating a standing order that department of defense computers not be used in a manner that would reflect adversely on the accessing pornography.the second count alleged a violation of article of the ucmj conduct unbecoming a marine for accessing and downloading images of minors engaged in sexually explicit activities.the charging document is pellucid on a critical fact used the same computer,identified in the charging document by serial number and the relevant time period,to access the pornographic websites alleged in the article count and to download the child pornography alleged in the article count.
did not deny his salacious activities,and pled guilty to both charges in a single plea colloquy on may.the military judge presiding over the court martial carefully walked through all of the elements of both convictions,obtaining admission to each element.he explained that,to be found guilty of the article count,the prosecution would be required to prove that 
on diverse occasions,from on or about november to on or about july,violated this regulation by wrongfully using a government computer,fujitsu hd,serial number gb,to obtain access to pornographic internet sites.
the military judge then explained that,to be found guilty of the article count,the prosecution would be required to prove 
that on diverse occasions from on or about november to on or about july,on a government computer hard drive,fujitsu hd,serial number gb,wrongfully possessed visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct that knew he possessed these depictions and that the persons depicted in these depictions were minors.
the military judge defined a minor as an individual that has not obtained the age of years and sexually explicit conduct as conduct that is plainly or clearly involving sexual activity the organs of sex or the instincts,drive,or behavior associated with sexual activity.admitted each element of both charges.
during the plea colloquy,entered a stipulation of facts.in connection with the article charge,he stipulated 
on divers e occasions,from on or about november,to on or about july,used the government computer in his workspace to knowingly and wrongfully obtain access to pornographic internet sites.
in connection with the article charge,he stipulated 
between on or about november and on or about july,lcpl aguilarturcios possessed six visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.lcpl aguilarturcios found these images at pornographic internet sites.lcpl aguilarturcios possessed these images on a government computer hard drive,fujitsu hd,located in his workspace 
the ij found that the article conviction was an aggravated felony under the modified categorical analysis but that the article conviction was not and ordered removed from the united states.in response to aguilar turcios appeal,the bia affirmed the ij decision in a written opinion.the question before us is whether the article conviction,under either the categorical or modified categorical analysis,constitutes an aggravated felony as described in.
under,an alien is removable for committing an aggravated felony after entry into the united states.see a a iii.an aggravated felony includes,among other things,offenses described in,see a i listing crimes relating to child pornography,two provisions of which are relevant here.first,it is an aggravated felony to knowingly receive any visual depiction that has been transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means including by computer if a the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and b such visual depiction is of such conduct.id.a.second,it is an aggravated felony to knowingly access with intent to view,matter which contain s any visual depiction while on any land or building under the control of the government of the united states if i the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and ii such visual depiction is of such conduct.id.a.we must decide whether either or both of these provisions can form the basis for removal.
i begin my analysis with the categorical approach established in taylor united states,d.we can not find that committed an aggravated felony as a categorical matter unless,after comparing the elements of the statute of conviction and the definition of the aggravated felony,we conclude that the entire range of conduct prohibited by the statute fits within the statutory definition of an aggravated felony.see id.at.
there is no question that conviction would not constitute a removable offense under this inquiry.pled guilty to violations of two broad provisions of the ucmj one violation of article for violating a lawful general order,see,and one violation of article for conduct unbecoming a marine,see.we analyze the article conviction as the only basis for removal because the government did not appeal the ij decision that the article conviction was not an aggravated felony.
article makes any member of the military who violates or fails to obey any lawful general order or regulation punishable by a court martial.pled guilty to violating a d of department of defense directive,which prohibits put ting federal government communications systems to uses that would reflect adversely on dod or the dod component such as uses involving pornography chain letters unofficial advertising,and other uses that are incompatible with public service.
the broad language of a d clearly encompasses conduct unrelated to possession of child pornography as defined in a or a thus,a violation of section a d is not categorically an aggravated felony.
the taylor court recognized that there would be situations where the sentencing court may look beyond the mere fact of conviction in a narrow range of cases where a jury was actually required to find all the elements of the generic crime.taylor,at.the supreme court has extended that approach to cases,such as this,where the alien has pled guilty to the predicate crime.see shepard united states,d.the substantial and at times confusing body of law that has developed to define this narrow range of cases where a court can look beyond the mere fact of conviction has come to be known as the modified categorical analysis.
the modified categorical analysis applies,inter alia,in situations where a statute is divisible into several crimes,only some of which qualify as removable offenses.when the modified categorical analysis applies,we consult charging documents,signed plea agreements,jury instructions,guilty pleas,transcripts of plea proceedings,and judgment,and comparable judicial record s of this information,shepard,at,to determine if the conduct for which the alien was actually convicted satisfies the definition of an aggravated felony.ashcroft,cir see also shepard,at.ashcroft,cir.thus,in the present case i would examine these documents to determine whether a plea of guilty to the article conviction necessarily admitted the elements of the aggravated felony.shepard,at.
the majority,however,concludes that it can not apply the modified categorical analysis because the crime of conviction lacks an element of the generic crime.op.at.specifically,the majority finds that the article conviction lacks an element required by,namely proof that the pornography accessed by contained a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.op.at.for the general proposition that we can not apply the modified categorical approach if the crime of conviction is missing an element of the generic crime altogether the majority,understandably,relies on our en banc decision in gonzales,cir en banc,which in turn relied on a concurring opinion in li ashcroft,cir.i question the wisdom of our decision in,and i disagree with the majority decision to extend it.
there is good reason to question whether the sparse discussion of the modified categorical analysis in was fully considered.presented the question of whether a conviction under california penal code for accessory after the fact was a crime involving moral turpitude.see at.the case required us to address both the categorical and modified categorical analysis,but the vast bulk of the majority opinion focused on the categorical approach.see id.at.indeed,only three paragraphs of the majority opinion are devoted to the modified categorical analysis,see id.at,and the concurring and two dissenting opinions do not discuss this analysis at all.see id.at reinhardt,concurring id.at tallman,dissenting id.at bea,dissenting.
however,proclaims,when the crime of conviction is missing an element of the generic crime altogether,we can never find that a jury was actually required to find all the elements of the generic crime.at internal quotation marks omitted.offers a single case as kozinski concurring opinion in li,at then only in a citation modified by the parenthetical providing examples.id.that is the beginning and the end of our discussion.
the parenthetical notation providing examples is apparently a reference to two examples used in chief judge kozinski concurrence describing when the crime of conviction is broader than the removable crime first,when particular elements in the crime of conviction are broader than their counterparts in the removable crime,and,second,when the crime of conviction is missing an element of the removable crime altogether.li,at kozinski,concurring.chief judge kozinski says that this first case is acceptable under taylor,but argues that in the latter case,when the crime of conviction is missing an element of the removable crime,we can never find that a jury was actually required to find all the elements of the generic crime.id.internal quotations removed.
chief judge kozinski approach in li is subject to criticism on a variety of fronts it goes well beyond anything that the supreme court required in shepard and taylor it is entirely inconsistent with almost two decades of ninth circuit precedent indeed,read literally,conflicts with at least of our published decisions and goes beyond the approach taken by any of our sister circuits it has created a jurisprudence of,conflicting decisions,and confusion that neither our appellate panels nor district courts appear capable of keeping straight and it is no longer good law after nijhawan holder,d.
with due respect,i do not believe that chief judge kozinski reading in li is required by the supreme court decisions in taylor and shepard.the holdings in those cases do not mandate such a strict rule and the logic behind those cases indicates that such a rule does not even apply in the civil immigration context.
taylor permits looking beyond the statutory elements of the removable crime where a jury was actually required to find all the elements of the removable offense.at.shepard,which was decided after li,makes it clear that in a guilty plea context this showing is satisfied when the judicial record demonstrates that the plea had necessarily rested on the fact identifying the crime as a removable offense.at.the modified categorical analysis is concerned with determining whether the petitioner conviction fits the generically defined crime,not whether the elements fit the defined crime.
to illustrate how the modified categorical analysis should work,consider chief judge kozinski first example in his li concurrence 
s uppose the generic crime requires that defendant have used a gun,while the crime of conviction can be committed with any kind of weapon.the government may then use the indictment and other documents in the record to prove that,because the jury convicted the defendant,it must have done so by finding that he used a instance,if that was the only way that element of the offense was charged in the indictment.
li,at kozinski,concurring.this situation,in which the crime of conviction contains several possible elements,at least one of which satisfies the generic crime,is referred to as a divisible statute.see united states,cir wala mukasey,cir.if the indictment,jury instructions,or plea colloquy clearly establish that the only way the conviction could be sustained was to find that the defendant used a gun,taylor and shepard are satisfied.i agree so far,so good.
but in my view,chief judge kozinski second example in li when the generic crime requires use of a gun while the crime of conviction does require a weapon at all,li,at kozinski,concurring also satisfies taylor and shepard.chief judge presumably,hold that it does not.but,if the government,us ing the indictment and other documents in the record can prove that,because the jury convicted the defendant,it must have done so by finding that he used a gun,then the modified categorical approach should be fully satisfied,whether it was an express element in the statute of conviction or not.
consider an example that has arisen repeatedly in our own jurisprudence.suppose a defendant is charged with burglary,but the crime of conviction does not require one of the elements of the generic burglary crime an unlawful entry.if the indictment,plea colloquy,or in the event of a trial jury instructions all make it clear that the defendant could not have been convicted of burglary unless the trier of fact concluded that the defendant entered unlawfully,the factfinder still necessarily found the requisite elements of the generic crime,and taylor and shepard are satisfied.see,united states williams,cir applying modified categorical analysis where the defendant pled nolo contendre to entering unlawfully even though the statute did not contain unlawful entry as an element.
indeed,the taylor court embraced both examples that chief judge kozinski statutes and those lacking elements of the generic the example that i just provided.the court noted that a few states burglary statutes define burglary more broadly,by eliminating the requirement that the entry be unlawful,or by including places,such as automobiles and vending machines,other than buildings.taylor,at.here,the court acknowledged that some crimes of conviction would lack elements of their generic counterparts.the court held,nonetheless,that an offense constitutes the generic crime if the statutory definition substantially corresponds to the generic crime,or the charging paper and jury instructions actually required the jury to find all the elements of the generic crime.id.
the approach in li concurrence is not so flexible.if a conviction is missing an element of the generic crime,a court can never look beyond the terms of the if the defendant specifically acknowledges that element in his plea.this approach completely removes certain crimes from consideration in the immigration context.for example,in california,idaho,and nevada,burglary does not contain an unlawful entry requirement.cal.penal code idaho code ann.stat.regardless of the contents of the indictment,jury instructions,plea colloquy,or stipulated facts,it is now impossible to remove an alien based on a prior burglary conviction in these states.indeed,has already required this result with regard california burglary statute.see united states de oca,cir even if we were to undertake a modified categorical approach,we could not narrow the california statute by amending it to include the restrictive elements of the guidelines generic,that the entry must have been unlawful or unprivileged.
the result is that makes an alien removable based more on geography than the conviction.although an alien can never be removed for a burglary that takes place in california,idaho,or nevada,aliens convicted of burglary in alaska,arizona,hawaii,oregon,montana,and washington,based on the same indictment,jury instructions,plea colloquy,or stipulated facts,face the possibility of removal because the statutes in these states contain an unlawful entry requirement.alaska stat.stat.ann.to l,or.stat.code.ann.this is precisely the odd result that the supreme court sought to avoid in taylor.at.finding it odd that a person imprudent enough to commit a crime in california would face immigration consequences yet a person who did so in michigan might not.
i therefore disagree with the analysis of the second example in the li concurrence.instead,a better approach would be to follow directly the supreme court guidance in shepard and taylor the appropriate question is whether the trier of fact was actually required to find all elements of the generic offense to support the conviction,see shepard,at.quoting taylor,at,not whether the crime of conviction is broader because it is missing an element of the generic crime altogether.li,at kozinski,concurring.in other words,given the allegations in the charging document,the instructions given to the jury or,in the case of a plea,the admissions in the plea colloquy or plea agreement,must the trier of fact necessarily have found that the petitioner committed all the elements of the removable offense in order to convict if the answer to that question is yes,the modified categorical analysis is satisfied.shepard,at.taylor,at.
a more flexible analysis is all the more appropriate in the present case because the reasons for adopting a strict reading of the taylor categorical and modified categorical analysis in the criminal context are not implicated in civil removal proceedings.i divide these concerns into two categories statutory and constitutional.
first,a statutory concern arises because congress has only made aliens removable for actual convictions of certain crimes,not for having engaged in certain elements.see,a a iii any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.emphasis added see also taylor,at.t he language of e generally supports the inference that congress intended the sentencing court to look only to the fact that the defendant had been convicted of crimes falling within certain categories,and not to the facts underlying the prior convictions.this method of interpreting the statutory language is motivated by a concern for the practical difficulties and potential unfairness of inquiring into the facts of each individual conviction,taylor,at,and to avoid what would basically be a retrial of the conviction,see id.at.
but that concern is not present in this case.there is no need to retry the facts of the conviction here because the plea colloquy,charging document,and stipulations of fact are undisputed in the record before us.indeed,as i have argued above,the supreme court recognition of the possibility that a court may go beyond the mere fact of conviction in a narrow range of cases where a factfinder was actually required to find all the elements of the removable crime,taylor,at,squarely fits this case.
the constitutional concerns that motivated the development of the modified categorical approach in taylor are also not present here.the categorical analysis developed in criminal cases,where concerns raised in apprendi new jersey,d,are front and center.see,shepard,at.discussing potential apprendi problems if a sentencing court were to consider found facts in connection with a sentencing enhancement under the armed career criminal act id.at.thomas,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment arguing that the taylor categorical approach violates the sixth amendment taylor,at.if the sentencing court were to conclude,from its own review of the record,that the defendant actually committed a generic burglary,could the defendant challenge this conclusion as abridging his right to a jury trial.
this is not a criminal case in which might be subject to increased criminal penalties on the basis of facts,because an alien facing removal is not entitled to a jury trial to determine whether he is removable.furthermore,the standard of proof for establishing that an alien is removable is lower than the standard of proof required for a criminal conviction.see c a establishing that the government has the burden to prove an alien is removable by clear and convincing evidence 
this case illustrates precisely why a more flexible approach to the modified categorical analysis should be permitted in this context.there is no doubt that is an alien,that he knowingly possessed images depicting a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,that those images required a minor actually to engage in sexually explicit conduct,that he was convicted under the ucmj for that crime,and that aliens convicted of knowing possession of child pornography are removable.finding otherwise requires a significant indulgence of the legal imagination.see gonzales,d james united states,d one could,of course,imagine a situation in which attempted burglary might not pose a realistic risk of confrontation or injury to anyone but acca does not require metaphysical certainty.if the concern motivating the entire categorical exercise is that courts must be certain of the conduct that an alien committed before imposing the punishment of removal on him,then we need not be worried here that we are removing an alien unjustly.
the rule announced in also conflicts with almost twenty years of ninth circuit jurisprudence in fact,if the majority reading of is correct,we have actually overruled the li majority remarkable outcome given reference to the li concurrence examples without any indication that the majority opinion was incorrect.see,at.in li,we were required to determine whether eight federal offenses,none of which contained the amount of loss as an element,were aggravated felonies under a a iii because they were offenses that involve fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds.id.a m i although we ultimately held that the record of conviction was inadequate to satisfy the modified categorical analysis,we still felt bound to use that approach to reach our conclusion an approach that is clearly wrong under our statement in.see li,at.
at least published decisions from to have applied the modified categorical approach to cases where the crime of conviction lacked an element of the generic crime.see supra.these cases were joined or authored by at least twenty different active judges out of presently serving on the ninth circuit.i see no reason to upset such a large number of opinions decided by such a wide array of distinguished jurists over the course of almost two decades of our circuit history.it is hard for me to believe that we intended to do so based on the examples provided in a single judge concurrence to a panel opinion.
moreover,no other circuit has adopted the strict reading of the modified categorical approach enumerated in.indeed,many cases where our sister circuits have applied the modified categorical analysis are inconsistent with the broad pronouncement in or apply a much more flexible approach in determining when the modified categorical analysis applies the strict application of pronouncement places us in conflict with the law in each of these circuits without ever recognizing that a conflict even exists 
because of the manner in which summarily announced this novel legal principle,we have witnessed a number of false starts and conflicting decisions within the circuit,and i am afraid that we have left the district courts scratching their collective heads.has made our jurisprudence in this area as clear as mud.
at least two opinions have been published,withdrawn,and then because the panel failed to recognize the broad implications of statement.see kawashima gonzales,cir decided one day before,using modified categorical analysis to determine whether convictions under and qualify as aggravated felonies because the loss to the government exceeded,withdrawn and superseded by kawashima mukasey,cir finding that the modified categorical approach does not apply because t he rule,which requires that the statute of conviction must contain every element of the generic offense before we resort to the modified categorical approach,plainly applies in this setting,abrogated by nijhawan holder,d united states de oca,cir applying the modified categorical approach to a conviction under california penal code even though does not include an unlawful entry element as required by the generic burglary crime,withdrawn and replaced by united states de oca,cir finding that the modified categorical approach can not apply because a conviction under is lacking the unlawful entry element.both of these cases sparked separate opinions from members of the panel questioning the rule laid out in.see kawashima,at,and callahan,concurring specially de oca,at gould,dissenting a pplication of to the california burglary statute here is inconsistent with the scope intended by the united states supreme court.
at least three opinions after appear to ignore its requirements altogether.holder,cir applying the modified categorical approach even though the california fraud statute does not require a showing that property was taken without consent,the second element of the generic theft offense described at a g mukasey,cir applying the modified categorical approach even though the crime of conviction,did not contain two elements of an obstruction of justice charge united states,cir applying the modified categorical approach to determine if california health and safety code a constitutes a drug trafficking offense,even though a does not contain the necessary intent element for a drug trafficking offense 
in a subsequent en banc decision we employed the modified categorical approach in direct conflict with while purporting to leave the issue untouched.in united states snellenberger,cir,we applied the modified categorical approach to california burglary statute,california penal code,which is plainly missing at least one element of the generic burglary crime.see id.at,dissenting.nonetheless,the decision purports to express no opinion on the application of to the facts of this case.id.at.
it is not surprising that in light of the manner in which announced its rules and these subsequent decisions,at least one district court has simply decided to ignore altogether in applying the modified categorical approach.united states,wl,refusing to find that overruled earlier precedents directly addressing first degree residential burglary under california penal code because t here is simply no indication that the en banc decision of sought to overrule prior precedent.
i can hardly fault the district courts for failing to apply a rule that we ourselves have failed to explain,defend,or consistently follow.
finally,i address the supreme court recent decision in nijhawan holder,d,which makes our decision in all the more remarkable.
in nijhawan the court added a precursor to our general categorical approach.the court held that we must first decide whether a requirement under the generic crime is an element of the generic crime,as opposed to simply a description of the particular circumstances attendant to a generic crime.id.at.if the former,we must apply the framework from taylor and shepard if the latter,we must ensure that the bia used fundamentally fair procedures.id.at.although the court did not explain the specific contours of fundamentally fair procedures,it noted that the taylor and shepard framework was unnecessary in such an analysis.id.
with regards to nijhawan specific facts,the court held that the loss requirement in a m i is not an element,but simply applies to the specific circumstances surrounding an offender commission of a fraud and deceit crime on a specific occasion.id.at.it went on to hold that the bia proceeding was not fundamentally unfair the government was forced to prove the loss requirement by clear and convincing evidence,and the loss was tied to the specific counts covered by the conviction,namely,the defendant uncontradicted stipulation showing that the conviction involved losses considerably greater than.id.at.
nijhawan does not directly affect the resolution of the present case.it is undisputed,and plain from the statutory language,that the requirements of a,at issue in this case are elements of the generic crime,not simply a description of the particular attendant circumstances under which the crime was committed.both parties agree that taylor and shepard apply,and that we are not simply reviewing for fundamentally fair procedures.id.at.
however,nijhawan does affect in one respect.it overruled the only decision that cited as support for its novel proposition li concurrence.chief judge kozinski would have held in li that the modified categorical approach could not apply to the loss requirement in a m i because the loss requirement was an element of the element that was not present in the crime of conviction.however,nijhawan specifically holds that the loss requirement is not an element and that the framework from taylor and shepard does not apply to this portion of a m i.li concurrence is no longer good law.thus,statement,which overturns two decades of ninth circuit precedent,goes further than any of our sister circuits in limiting our review of prior convictions,and has caused nothing but confusion and disarray within our circuit,is based entirely on a view that has been rejected by the supreme court.
putting my criticisms of aside,and assuming that we are bound by the li concurrence analysis of taylor,i would find that the modified categorical analysis still applies in this case and that was convicted of an aggravated felony.
says that w hen the crime of conviction is missing an element of the generic crime altogether,we can never find that a jury was actually required to find all the elements of the generic crime.at.here,pled guilty to using a government computer to access pornographic websites,while the generic crime requires the use of a government computer to access child pornography a visual depiction involv ing the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.
child pornography is a subset of pornography.if the record reveals that the pornographic websites he accessed in connection with the article charge contained child pornography,i see no reason why we should not be able to consider that information.i therefore vigorously disagree with the majority assertion that article and section a d are thus missing an element of the generic crime altogether a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.op.at.this case is precisely like the first example given in the li concurrence,which is the source of the rule in that the majority purports to apply.put differently,child pornography is to pornography as a gun is to a weapon.
although i believe this is the correct analysis after,this case illustrates the absurdity of a rule that distinguishes between crimes that are broader than the generic crime and crimes that are simply missing an element of the generic crime.the majority and i agree that possessing or accessing child pornography is an element of the crimes described in a.is pornography simply broader than child pornography,or is pornography missing an element of child pornography altogether the majority says it is missing i say that it is simply broader.and,of course,we are both correct.that is because there is no logical distinction between broader and missing are two sides of the same coin.
a few examples from our case law prove the point.in united states bonat,cir,we were faced with an arizona burglary statute that would allow a conviction even if the intent to commit the crime was formed after entering the structure,while the generic burglary crime requires entry into a structure,with intent to commit a crime.taylor,at.emphasis added.this statute is both broader than and missing an element of the generic burglary crime depending on one viewpoint it is broader because the statute encompasses burglary where intent is formed after entering the structure,but it is also completely missing the element of entry with the intent to commit a crime.
similarly,in united states,cir,we recognized that to be convicted of statutory rape in california the victim must be under the age of eighteen,whereas the generic federal statutory rape crime requires a showing that the victim is under the age of sixteen.id.again,this statute could be viewed as broader than the generic crime or missing an element altogether broader in that the crime encompasses victims that are between the ages of and,but also completely missing the element of the generic crime in other words,almost any statute that is broader than the generic crime can be easily as missing an element by defining the overbreadth as the absence of an element.
given the lack of any logical distinction between broader and missing,it appears that after all we can reliably do is compare any given factual situation to the li concurrence,which,we are told,provid es examples,at.applying this approach to the present case,there is simply no more principled distinction between child pornography and pornography than between guns and weapons therefore,the modified categorical approach should apply.i admit that my reading of broader is no more principled than the majority reading of missing.i simply have the fortuitous fact on my side that the example in the li concurrence is virtually indistinguishable from the present case.unfortunately,this is the level of sophistication we are left with after.
having concluded that the modified categorical analysis is appropriate to use in this case,i have no difficulty finding that conviction for violating article necessarily shows that he committed the aggravated felony of knowing possession of child pornography.this is so for one unavoidable reason the only pornography that admitted to accessing on his government computer during the plea colloquy were the six images of child pornography.
the charging document in this case leaves no room for doubt about what activities led to conviction for violating article.the dates of the offenses and the serial number of the computer charged under article are identical to the dates and serial number charged under article,which specifically and exclusively charges knowing possession of child pornography.pled guilty to both charges contemporaneously in a single plea proceeding.when read together,the charging document and the plea colloquy,leave no doubt that pled guilty because he wrongfully and knowingly possess ed visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.
the stipulation of fact,relied on by the court martial during the plea colloquy,provides further confirming evidence.admitted,in connection with the article violation,that he accessed pornographic internet sites on the computer in his workspace.in connection with the article charge,he admitted that he downloaded six images of minors engaging in sexually explicit activity from pornographic internet sites that he accessed on his workspace computer.the conclusion that admission to viewing pornographic internet sites on the same computer,on the same dates,refers to the child pornography is unavoidable.
if there were still any lingering doubt,there is additional record evidence that underscores that knew that the images he downloaded onto his computer depicted minors engaging in sexually explicit activity.the military judge presiding over the plea proceedings carefully walked through all of the elements of what would be,in the civilian world,a conviction under,and admitted all of them.indeed,the only pornographic images that specifically admitted during the plea colloquy to downloading on a government computer,were the six images of child pornography.the article conviction therefore necessarily found that had knowingly possessed child pornography because,at the time the military judge accepted plea,he had only admitted to viewing child pornography.
that explicitly admitted to viewing the child pornography in connection with the article charge,and not the article charge,gives me only brief pause.nothing in taylor or shepard limits our modified categorical review to that portion of the charging document or plea colloquy that pertains to the specific charge at issue.instead,we are permitted to consult these documents to determine if the jury or other factfinder necessarily found that the alien committed a removable crime.the only factual basis on which the military judge could have found guilty of an article violation was his viewing of the six child pornography images admitted to in the plea colloquy,as those images are the only ones mentioned in the record at the time the military judge accepted the plea.
the record presented to the bia and the immigration judge leaves no room for doubt about the conduct to which pled guilty.had he not been in the military at the time of his offense,or had his conduct occurred,he could have been prosecuted under either california penal code,which tracks precisely the elements of,or under itself,which is statutorily defined as an aggravated felony,see a i,and his article conviction necessarily found all of the elements of a violation.
this is not a close case.was convicted of a removable offense.i respectfully dissent.
aguilar also pled guilty to and was convicted by special of violating article of the by using two different computer hard drives,including the hard drive of the computer used in connection with his article conviction,to wrongfully and knowingly possess visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.because the ij held that aguilar conviction under article was not an aggravated felony,and the government did not appeal that determination,we address only whether the article conviction constitutes an aggravated felony.
because it does not change the outcome in this case,we assume,without deciding,that the elements of this lawful general order can be considered in det
