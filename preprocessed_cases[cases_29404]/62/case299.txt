we must decide whether military participation in a civilian criminal investigation violated the posse comitatus act or.because we conclude that the military participation falls under the independent military purpose exception,we affirm the district court order denying hitchcock motion to dismiss the charges against him or to suppress all evidence because of a violation of the posse comitatus act and.we must also decide whether evidence should be suppressed that was gathered under a search warrant obtained and executed on november,but mistakenly dated november,by the magistrate judge.since we conclude that the search was within the scope of the warrant,we affirm the district court order denying hitchcock motion to suppress the evidence seized at his home.finally,we conclude,in light of united states antonakeas,cir and united states buckland,cir en banc,that hitchcock sentence does not violate apprendi new jersey,d.
background 
after the army criminal investigation division cid received information that benjamin lake,a marine stationed in,was selling lysergic acid diethylamide lsd to other military personnel on his base,it began a joint investigation with the naval criminal investigative service ncis.lake sold lsd to an undercover cid agent on october,and again on november.after the sale on november,ncis agents arrested lake.lake agreed to cooperate with ncis agents.he identified the defendant,mark hitchcock,as the source of the lsd.because hitchcock is a civilian,the lead ncis agent on the case,michael moran,asked the drug enforcement administration dea to join the investigation.the dea took control of the investigation,assigning special agent john meade as the case agent.two ncis agents,moran and robert rzepka,remained involved with the investigation.under dea agent meade direction,lake made two monitored calls to hitchcock and discussed payment for lsd lake had previously obtained.the calls were made from the dea field office and were monitored using dea equipment.ncis agent rzepka brought lake to and from the naval brig so that lake could make the calls.
on november,lake met with hitchcock,paying him for the lsd with dea funds.on november,at the direction of the dea,lake made another monitored call to hitchcock and ordered more lsd from him.under dea supervision,lake met with hitchcock later that same day and hitchcock sold lake additional lsd.after lake purchased the lsd,dea agents arrested hitchcock and seized the lsd.the dea sent the seized lsd to the dea western regional laboratory for analysis shortly after hitchcock arrest,dea agent meade advised hitchcock of his miranda rights.hitchcock waived his rights.ncis agents moran and rzepka were present at hitchcock interrogation.dea agent meade conducted the interrogation,although ncis agent moran also participated.
on november,ncis agent moran conducted surveillance of hitchcock home,as did ncis agent rzepka,along with dea agents,the next day.on the day of hitchcock arrest,the dea obtained a search warrant from a magistrate judge.after hitchcock arrest,dea agents executed the warrant,searched hitchcock house,and seized evidence they discovered.ncis agent rzepka assisted in the search,as did two cid agents who were present.dea agent meade report of the investigation states that of the ten drug exhibits recovered,four were seized by cid investigators.the search revealed a significant amount of drugs and drug paraphernalia.the dea sent all of this evidence to the dea western regional laboratory for analysis.
hitchcock was charged in a superseding indictment filed on april,with five counts.count one of the indictment charged hitchcock with possession with intent to distribute and distribution of a mixture containing a detectable amount of lsd,in violation of a and b c.counts two and three charged him with possession with intent to distribute and distribution of one gram or more of a mixture containing a detectable amount of lsd,in violation of a and b b.count four charged him with possession with intent to distribute but not distribution of one gram or more of a mixture containing a detectable amount of lsd,in violation of a and b b.count five charged hitchcock with conspiracy to distribute one gram or more of lsd,in violation of 
on march,hitchcock filed a motion seeking to suppress the evidence obtained during the november,search of hitchcock house.hitchcock argued that the search and seizure was conducted without a valid warrant and that no grounds existed to justify a search without a warrant.the search warrant dea agent meade obtained recites that a search of hitchcock home is permitted on or before the tenth day after the issuance date of the warrant.although dea agent meade obtained the warrant on november,the magistrate judge dated the warrant november.hitchcock argued that because the warrant was dated november,the search of his home on november,was performed without a valid warrant.the district court found that the magistrate judge had inadvertently written the wrong date and had corrected the date on the return copy of the warrant when dea agent meade brought the error to his attention.furthermore,the district court found that the officers had a good faith belief that was objectively reasonable that the warrant was valid.the district court therefore denied hitchcock motion.hitchcock appeals from the district court order denying his motion to suppress.
hitchcock filed another motion on may,seeking dismissal of all charges against him and suppression of all evidence on the grounds that ncis and cid participation in the investigation leading to hitchcock arrest violated the posse comitatus act pca,and both of which generally prohibit military involvement in civilian law enforcement.after hearing oral argument,the district court held that ncis and cid involvement in the dea investigation of hitchcock did not violate the pca or because the military had only rendered indirect assistance to civilian law enforcement and such assistance is not prohibited by the acts.united states hitchcock,d,i.alternatively,the court held that the investigation did not violate the acts because the military participation arose out of legitimate military concerns.id.at.hitchcock appeals from the district court order denying his motion to dismiss or suppress all evidence because of a violation of the pca and.
hitchcock entered a conditional guilty plea to all five counts of the superseding indictment on september,reserving the right to appeal the district court orders denying his motions to dismiss and suppress.he had no plea agreement with the government.while he admitted that the substances identified by the indictment contained a detectable amount of lsd,he did not concede the actual weight or quality of the drugs,leaving that issue to be contested at sentencing.at the sentencing hearing on may,the government had three forensic chemists testify concerning the quality and weight of the lsd at issue in the indictment.hitchcock expert called into question the methods used by the government chemists to identify the lsd.however,hitchcock expert admitted that he did not carefully weigh the substance,nor did he analyze its chemical composition.after argument,the court made findings concerning the weight of the lsd 
the court finds that the government has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the weight of there was lsd as to count one and the weight was grams,as to count two was gram,as to count three was milligrams pure lsd and grams,as to count it was milligrams of pure lsd and grams weight.
based on the total amount of lsd found by the court milligrams,hitchcock base offense level was.see c.the probation office presentence report recommended and the district court awarded a two point downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility,giving hitchcock a total offense level of.with a criminal history category of ii and an offense level of,the sentencing guidelines prescribe a sentence of eight to fourteen months imprisonment.ch,pt.however,b b prescribes a mandatory minimum of five years imprisonment for conviction of possession with intent to distribute and distribution of lsd in the amount of gram or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of lsd.b b v.since counts two through five involved one gram or more of a mixture containing lsd,the mandatory minimum was implicated.the district court sentenced hitchcock to five years imprisonment for each count of the indictment,to be served concurrently hitchcock appeals from the district court sentence,arguing that his sentence to the mandatory minimum under b b violated apprendi new jersey,d,because the issue of drug quantity was not presented to a jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt 
ii.discussion 
posse comitatus act 
whether the navy involvement in hitchcock arrest violated the pca is a mixed question of fact and law which is primarily legal.united states roberts,cir.we therefore review de novo the district court determination of this issue.id.
the pca prohibits army and air force personnel from participating in civilian law enforcement activities unless otherwise permitted by federal law.supra note.although the navy and marine corps are not included by name in the pca,congress passed legislation requiring the secretary of defense to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to prohibit members of all branches of the military from participating in civilian law enforcement activities as well.supra note.pursuant to this congressional directive,the secretary of defense promulgated a department of defense dod directive regulating the cooperation of military personnel with civilian law enforcement officials.dod directive,as amended.the secretaries of the navy and army issued regulations implementing dod directive.secnav instruction b,army regulation july.
these regulations generally prohibit direct military involvement in civilian law enforcement activities but permit indirect assistance such as the transfer of information obtained during the normal course of military operations or other actions that do not subject civilians to the use of military power that is regulatory,prescriptive,or compulsory.dod directive see also id,the regulations permit an exception to the general prohibition on direct involvement where the military participation is undertaken for the primary purpose of furthering a military or foreign affairs function of the united states,regardless of incidental benefits to civilian authorities.id.see united states chon,cir recognizing the independent military purpose exception to the prohibition against military involvement in civilian law enforcement activities.
in this case,the district court held that the participation of ncis and cid agents in the investigation and arrest of hitchcock and the search of hitchcock house and subsequent seizure of evidence did not violate the pca or because the military agencies merely provided indirect assistance to the dea.hitchcock,d at.in reaching this conclusion,the district court relied on our opinion in united states khan,cir.khan set forth three tests for determining whether military involvement in civilian law enforcement constitutes permissible indirect assistance the involvement must not constitute the exercise of regulatory,proscriptive,or compulsory military power,must not amount to direct active involvement in the execution of the laws,and must not pervade the activities of civilian authorities.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted the district court held that ncis and cid involvement constituted indirect assistance under khan because,
although ncis agent moran participated in the interrogation of defendant,his involvement was extremely minimal,and was limited to questions pertaining to distribution of drugs on a military base.in addition,while it is true that ncis agents moran and rzepka participated in the surveillance and that agents moran and rzepka,along with two army cid agents,were present during the search of defendant home,all evidence was recovered by the dea,it was the dea who was in command of both the surveillance and the search,and it was the dea who instructed the other agents about the extent of their participation.
hitchcock,d at.
the district court conclusion that ncis and cid involvement in hitchcock case did not constitute direct assistance under the regulations may have been erroneous.section of the dod directive explicitly prohibits military personnel from participating in a search or seizure and also prohibits u se of military personnel for surveillance or as investigators,or interrogators.dod directive.however,we conclude that participation of military personnel in the dea investigation of hitchcock did not violate the pca,or the regulations implementing,because the military involvement in this case falls within the independent military purpose exception,as the district court held in the alternative.see hitchcock,d at.the regulations implementing explicitly permit direct assistance in civilian law enforcement i nvestigations and other actions related to enforcement of the uniform code of military justice ucmj.dod directive.the ucmj specifically prohibits military personnel from possessing and distributing lsd.it is undisputed that hitchcock sold lsd to lake,a marine,who was,in turn,selling lsd to other military personnel.ncis agent rzepka specifically testified that ncis agents were involved in hitchcock interrogation in order to determine whether hitchcock had sold drugs to other military personnel besides lake.military participation in hitchcock investigation for the purpose of determining the extent to which his lsd was being used and distributed on the military base was justified.the regulations also permit direct assistance in i nvestigations and other actions related to the commander inherent authority to maintain law and order on a military installation or facility.dod directive.hitchcock protestations notwithstanding,the proposition that the sale of lsd to persons who might use the drug on a military base or sell it to others on the base implicates the maintenance of law and order on a military installation is unassailable.
because the participation of ncis and cid agents in the investigation was permissible under the independent military purpose exception,the pca and were not violated.therefore,we affirm the district court order denying hitchcock motion to dismiss the charges against him or to suppress all evidence.
search warrant 
hitchcock seeks to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to a misdated search warrant.hitchcock,the government,and the district court frame the question as whether the agents reliance on the warrant fell within the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.as we have described it,the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule permits law enforcement officers reasonably to rely on search warrants that are later determined to be invalid if the executing officers act in good faith and in reasonable reliance upon a search warrant,evidence which is seized under a facially valid warrant which is later held invalid may be admissible.united states michaelian,cir citing united states leon,d sheppard,d.the good faith exception has no application here,where there is no dispute about the search warrant validity but only about whether the agents executed the warrant before it was effective.rather,the issue is whether the search was conducted within the scope of a warrant,though here the issue is temporal scope whereas in the ordinary case what is at issue are the items for which the search warrant was issued or the places the warrant authorizes to be searched.see,united states furrow,cir considering whether search of four outbuildings was properly within the scope of search warrant,overruled on other grounds by united states johnson,cir en banc united states rude,cir considering whether seized documents were outside the scope of search warrant.
we review de novo whether law enforcement agents exceeded the scope of a search warrant.united states gorman,cir.whether a search exceeds the scope of a search warrant is an issue we determine through an objective assessment of the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the warrant,the contents of the search warrant,and the circumstances of the search.united states rettig,cir in dete
