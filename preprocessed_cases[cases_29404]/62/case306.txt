we must decide whether the district court properly dismissed various claims brought by a retired colonel in the california army national guard which challenged military personnel decisions.
william wenger,now retired,served to the rank of colonel in the california army national guard the guard.he served in the united states army on active duty for over thirty years,and as a member of the guard for approximately nine years.on the evening of march,wenger was a guest speaker at a guard social event known as a hosted at the glendale armory by the officers of the infantry battalion,infantry division.after the dinner concluded,some of the event attendees stayed for certain entertainment two civilian female strip dancers performed 
at some time before the dining in incident,wenger name had been submitted for promotion to the rank of a general officer.wenger promotion awaited federal recognition by the department of the army in washington,when the occurred.shortly after the,the guard initiated a preliminary investigation into the dancing incident.pending the investigation,on april,the adjutant general for the state of california initiated a suspension of favorable personnel actions against wenger known as placing a flag on wenger file,which had the effect of suspending proceedings on wenger promotion.
after initiating its investigation,the guard requested that wenger personnel file be returned from the pentagon to the state of california pending completion of the investigation.as a result of that request,the department of the army inspector general office daig opened an inquiry into the.the guard also informed the army war college,where wenger had taught for three years,of the flag thereafter,the war college informed wenger that he would not be asked to return to teach.
on may,wenger provided written demand to the california adjutant general,requesting that the flag on his record be removed the request was denied.
on june,wenger filed suit in this action,seeking,inter alia,temporary and permanent relief ordering the guard to end the investigation,if it was not already ended to remove the flag from his record and to inform the daig and the army war college the investigation was improvidently initiated as to wenger and,in any event,had ended and the flag was removed.the guard moved to dismiss the suit pursuant to federal rule of procedure b.it also sought a protective order staying discovery until the court ruled on its rule b motion to dismiss.wenger moved for a preliminary injunction.wenger realized that he would be forced into retirement in guard parlance,ropa out at the end of september,unless he was under consideration for promotion he therefore asked the court to enjoin the guard from retiring him during the pendency of his suit.the court granted the protective order,but denied the preliminary injunction.on september,the court granted the guard b motion to dismiss.
the district court entered judgment on september.wenger timely appealed.on september,he sought an injunction barring the guard from retiring him pending his appeal the district court denied the injunction.
when september came,the flag on wenger file continued to prevent him from being considered for promotion.accordingly,wenger was ordered retired from the guard as a colonel as of october.
the district court concluded that wenger claims challenged military personnel decisions,and thus were nonjusticiable under mindes seaman,cir,as adopted by this circuit,see wallace chappell,cir,rev on other grounds sub nom.chappell wallace,d.
under the mindes test as modified by this circuit,a person challenging a military decision generally must satisfy two threshold elements before a court can determine whether review of his claims is appropriate.an internal military decision is unreviewable unless the plaintiff alleges a a violation of a recognized constitutional right,a federal statute,or military regulations and b exhaustion of available intraservice remedies.khalsa weinberger,cir,reaff.if the plaintiff alleges both of these things,a court weighs four factors to determine whether judicial review of his claims is appropriate.these factors include 
the nature and strength of the plaintiff claim 
the potential injury to the plaintiff if review is refused 
the extent of interference with military functions and 
the extent to which military discretion or expertise is involved.
id.the parties agree that mindes controls actions such as this in which a member of the national guard challenges a military decision.see sebra neville,cir holding that the mindes test is the appropriate standard to determine whether claims brought by national guard members are reviewable.they disagree,however,about the result it dictates.
wenger has sufficiently alleged the first of the mindes threshold factors,a violation of a recognized constitutional right,a federal statute,or military regulations khalsa,at.he alleges that the guard violated his constitutional rights to due process for the protection of his good name and reputation.
admittedly,wenger has not alleged the second threshold factor,that he exhaust ed available intraservice remedies.khalsa,at.however,he asserts that this circuit law excuses this omission.in the past,we have concluded that there are four circumstances in which exhaustion is not required if the intraservice remedies do not provide an opportunity for adequate relief if the petitioner will suffer irreparable harm if compelled to seek administrative relief if administrative appeal would be futile or if substantial constitutional questions are raised.see muhammad secretary of army,cir.wenger alleges that his case fits the first and third of these circumstances.he asserts that appeal to the army board for the correction of military records abcmr can not afford him adequate relief and,indeed,would be futile,because he has been forced to retire,and the abcmr can not order either his reinstatement in the guard,or his rehiring by the army war college.see christoffersen washington state air guard,cir recognizing that the naval equivalent of the abcmr has no power to force state to reinstate appellant in state guard see generally setting forth power of correction of records establishing abcmr.the district court agreed.and while the guard contends that the abcmr could reinstate wenger in active federal reserve status,it cites only christoffersen,which holds the opposite.we therefore conclude that wenger failure to exhaust administrative remedies is,indeed,excused.
accordingly,we proceed to the next step of the mindes inquiry the weighing of the four mindes factors.
the district court concluded,after weighing the mindes factors,that a ll four factors of the mindes test weigh against review of wenger claim.wenger disagrees.
wenger first argues that the nature and strength of the his claim,khalsa,at,weigh in favor of review.as noted above,wenger alleges that the guard violated his constitutional rights to due process for the protection of his good name and reputation.wenger cites wisconsin constantineau,d for the proposition that where the state attaches a badge of infamy to the citizen,due process comes into play.he concludes that under this passage,injury to his reputation violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.he bases his argument principally on shakespeare and california state tort law 
whatever the content of california tort law,injury to reputation standing alone does not violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment one interest in reputation standing alone is neither liberty nor property guaranteed against state deprivation without due process of law.paul davis,d see id.at.explaining that t he words liberty and property,as used in the fourteenth amendment,do not in terms reputation as a candidate for special protection over and above other interests that may be protected by state law see also siegert gilley,d stating that the decision in paul turn ed on the lack of any constitutional protection for the interest in reputation standing alone emphasis added peloza capistrano unif.sch,cir in siegert,the court laid to rest the notion that reputation alone is a sufficient
