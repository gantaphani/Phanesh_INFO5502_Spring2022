the officer followed the stolen van for some distance.eventually,the van turned off the freeway at an exit in oceanside.camilleri,still immediately behind the van,followed.at the end of the,the van turned east on a road leading to the main gate at camp pendleton.
when the van stopped at the gate,which is on the base,it was approached by two military policemen.camilleri,still immediately behind the vehicle,called on his loudspeaker for the officers to stop the van.when he did so,the van sped quickly away into the base.camilleri turned on his lights and siren and pursued for about of a mile.because he was unfamiliar with the area,he pulled over and allowed the military police to conduct the pursuit.

after his arrest,appellant told an officer that he was driving southbound on interstate on his way to vista.he denied knowing the van was stolen and stated he did not want to stop because he wanted to call his mother first.
discussion 
appellant argues the conduct that served as the basis for his conviction of felonious evasion of a peace officer occurred on a federal enclave and thus the state of california had no jurisdiction to convict him of that offense.
background 
appellant was charged with the crimes of auto taking and felony evasion of a peace officer.he demurrered to that part of the complaint charging felony evasion,arguing the crime occurred in a place under the exclusive criminal jurisdiction of the federal government and the state of california had no jurisdiction to charge him with the offense.the demurrer was overruled at the preliminary hearing and appellant was bound over for trial on both charges.
appellant section motion 
appellant moved under penal code section for dismissal of the information with regard to the felony evasion charge because the evidence offered at the preliminary hearing was insufficient to prove that the offense occurred within the territorial jurisdiction of the state of california and the officers that appellant attempted to evade were california peace officers.
as to the jurisdictional claim,appellant argued jurisdiction could only be based on section,which requires that when a person intending to commit a crime does any non de minimums act in california to execute that intent and a crime results either in or out of this state,the person is punishable under the laws of california.appellant argued there was no evidence that he formed an intent in this state to commit a felony evasion and no evidence he committed any non de minimums act in california in execution of that intent.
as to the argument the evidence was insufficient to prove the element that he evaded a peace officer,appellant noted that military police officers are not peace officers under section et and that he did nothing to evade the california highway patrol officer.
prosecution opposition 
the prosecution replied that the evidence at the preliminary hearing was sufficient to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of section and that appellant attempted to evade a california peace officer.as to the jurisdictional claim,the prosecution argued that viewed in its totality the evidence was sufficient to show appellant formed an intent in california to evade a peace officer and committed acts in california to that end.
the prosecution noted that when officer camilleri pulled behind the stolen vehicle,appellant exited the freeway.appellant later told officers he was driving south on interstate on his way to vista.the prosecution noted the exit appellant took was not the one for vista.it argued appellant had no legitimate reasons for entering camp pendleton.the prosecution noted that after stopping,appellant ran the gate at camp pendleton,failed to stop when officer camilleri followed him for a short distance with lights and siren and then refused to stop when pursued by military police officers.the prosecution argued the evidence was sufficient to prove appellant knew he was driving a stolen vehicle and intended to evade officers.
the prosecutor argued,contrary to appellant position,that it was unnecessary appellant form the intent in california to feloniously evade a peace officer within the meaning of vehicle code section,subdivision a,attempting to evade an officer by driving with a willful and wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.it was sufficient that appellant merely form the intent in california to evade a peace officer within the meaning of vehicle code section,subdivision a,willfully flee or attempt to elude a pursuing officer.the prosecutor argued the former is merely an aggravated form of the latter.
the prosecution argued appellant non de minimums act in execution of his intent to evade an officer was his act of exiting the freeway and driving onto camp pendleton.
the prosecution conceded that the military officers who pursued appellant on camp pendleton were not california peace officers.it argued,however,appellant crime was a continuing one that started in california and was related to the actions of a california peace officer.
the trial court concluded the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing was sufficient to support a finding appellant formed an intent in california to feloniously evade a peace officer within the meaning of vehicle code section,subdivision a.the court noted when the highway patrol officer told the military police at the gate to stop the van,appellant drove away in a reckless manner.the court concluded appellant had undoubtedly earlier,while in california,formed the intent that if the officer attempted to stop him,he would flee.as to the non de minimums acts committed in california,the court cited appellant leaving the freeway.
as to the issue that the evidence was insufficient to support the finding appellant attempted to evade a california police officer,the court found the attempted evasion began when officer camilleri told the military police at the gate to stop the van.when appellant sped off,camilleri began the pursuit but quickly turned it over to the military police.the crime of evasion is a continuing one and the fact most of the pursuit was conducted by peace officers was irrelevant.
