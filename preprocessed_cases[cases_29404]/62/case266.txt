following the terrorist attacks on september,president george bush authorized the national security agency nsa to conduct a warrantless communications surveillance program.the program intercepted international communications into and out of the united states of persons alleged to have ties to al qaeda and other terrorist networks.though its operating parameters remain murky,and certain details may forever remain so,much of what is known about the terrorist surveillance program tsp was to the public by the president and his administration.
after the new york times first revealed the program existence in late,government officials moved at to quell public concern and doled out a series of detailed disclosures about the program.only one day after the new york times story broke,president bush informed the country in a public radio address that he had authorized the interception of international communications of individuals with known links to al qaeda and related terrorist organizations.two days after president bush announcement,general alberto gonzales disclosed that the program targeted communications where the government had concluded that one party to the communication was a member of,or affiliated with,al qaeda.the department of justice followed these and other official disclosures with a lengthy white paper in which it both confirmed the existence of the surveillance program and also offered legal justification of the intercepts.
the government plethora of voluntary disclosures did not go unnoticed.islamic foundation,a designated terrorist organization,and two of its attorneys collectively,brought suit against president bush and other executive branch agencies and officials.they claimed that they were subject to warrantless electronic surveillance in in violation of the foreign intelligence surveillance act,et.fisa,various provisions of the united states constitution,and international law.the government countered that the suit is foreclosed by the state secrets privilege,an evidentiary privilege that protects national security and military information in appropriate circumstances.
essential to substantiating allegations against the government is a classified top secret document the sealed document that the government inadvertently gave to in during a proceeding to freeze the organization assets.faced with the government motions to dismiss and to bar from access to the sealed document,the district court concluded that the state secrets privilege did not bar the lawsuit altogether.the court held that the sealed document was protected by the state secrets privilege and that its inadvertent disclosure did not alter its privileged nature,but decided that would be permitted to file in camera affidavits attesting to the contents of the document based on the memories of lawyers who had received copies.
in light of extensive government disclosures about the tsp the government is to sustain its claim that the very subject matter of the litigation is a state secret.unlike a truly secret or black box program that remains in the shadows of public knowledge,the government has moved affirmatively to engage in public discourse about the tsp.since president bush initial confirmation of the program existence,there has been a cascade of acknowledgments and information coming from the government,as officials have openly,albeit selectively,described the contours of this program.thus,we agree with the district court that the state secrets privilege does not bar the very subject matter of this action.after in camera review and consideration of the government documentation of its national security claim,we also agree that the sealed document is protected by the state secrets privilege.however,we reverse the court order allowing to reconstruct the essence of the document through memory.such an approach countenances a back door around the privilege and would eviscerate the state secret itself.once properly invoked and judicially blessed,the state secrets privilege is not a proposition.
nonetheless,our resolution of the state secrets issue as applied to the sealed document does not conclude the litigation.also claims that fisa preempts the common law state secrets privilege.we remand for determination of this claim,a question the district court did not reach in its denial of the government motion to dismiss.
background 
on december,the new york times reported that in the years following september,president bush secretly authorized the nsa to conduct electronic surveillance on americans and others without warrants.james risen eric lichtblau,bush lets spy on callers without courts,times,at.the next day,president bush confirmed in a radio address that he had authorized the interception of international communications of people with known links to al qaeda and related terrorist organizations.george bush,president radio address,last visited.the president acknowledged that he reauthorized the program more than times since september,but that the program was suspended in january.id.
general alberto gonzales,and other administration officials,also disclosed in public statements that the nsa,under the tsp,intercepted electronic information where the government had grounds to believe that one party to the communication was a member or agent of a terrorist organization affiliated with al qaeda.see press briefing by attorney general alberto gonzales and general michael hayden,principal deputy director for national intelligence,last visited.attorney general gonzales emphasized that the government had not engaged in blanket surveillance,but instead attempted to home in on individuals who had apparent links to al qaeda.id.the government stated that interception under the program took place only if there were reasonable grounds to believe that one party to the communication was a member or agent of al qaeda or an affiliated terrorist organization.id.the government did not obtain warrants for this surveillance,which took place outside the context of the foreign intelligence surveillance court fisc.in january,attorney general gonzales stated that this type of surveillance is now subject to the judicial jurisdiction of the fisc.letter from alberto gonzales,attorney general,to patrick leahy and arlen specter,senators,available at.gov press ag to pjl re fisa court.pdf.
is a muslim charity which is active in more than countries.its activities include building mosques and maintaining various development and education programs.the united nations security council has identified as an entity belonging to or associated with al qaeda.in february,the office of foreign assets control of the department of treasury temporarily froze assets pending a proceeding to determine whether to declare it a specially designated global terrorist due to the organization alleged ties to al qaeda.ultimately,and one of its directors,soliman,were declared specially designated global terrorists.
in august,during civil designation proceeding,the department of the treasury produced a number of unclassified materials that were given to counsel and two of its directors.inadvertently included in these materials was the sealed document,which was labeled top secret.counsel copied and disseminated the materials,including the sealed document,to directors and,including wendell belew and asim ghafoor.in august or september of,a reporter from the washington post reviewed these documents while researching an article.in late august,the fbi was notified of the sealed document inadvertent disclosure.in october of,the fbi retrieved all copies of the sealed document from counsel,though it did not seek out directors to obtain their copies.the sealed document is located in a department of justice sensitive compartmented information facility.
alleges that after the new york times story broke in december,it realized that the sealed document was proof that it had been subjected to warrantless surveillance in march and april of.though the government has acknowledged the existence of the tsp,it has not disclosed the identities of the specific persons or entities surveilled under the program,and disputes whether inferences are correct.
ii.proceedings in the district court 
in february,filed a complaint in the district of oregon alleging violations of fisa,the first,fourth,and sixth amendments to the united states constitution,the doctrine of separation of powers,and the international covenant on civil and political rights.sought damages and declaratory relief,alleging that the government engaged in electronic surveillance of private telephone,email,and other electronic communications without probable cause,warrants,or other prior authorization.also provided a sealed copy of the sealed document to the district court.
the government moved to dismiss the case,or in the alternative,for summary judgment,on the basis of the state secrets privilege,asserting that the very subject matter of the action was a state secret.in support of its motion,the government submitted public and classified versions of declarations from john negroponte,of national intelligence,and keith alexander,of the nsa.director negroponte asserted that continuation of the litigation would result in the disclosure of information relating both to the nature of the al qaeda threat and the tsp,which could cause grave damage to national security.
the government also moved to bar from any access to the sealed document.john hackett,director of the information management office of the office of the director of national intelligence,asserted in a may,declaration based upon my review of the document filed under seal with the court,it is not possible to describe the document in a meaningful manner without revealing classified information,including classified sources and methods of intelligence.
the district court denied the government motion to dismiss,finding that the existence of the tsp was not a secret,and that no harm to the national security would occur if plaintiffs are able to prove the general point that they were subject to surveillance as revealed in the sealed document,without publicly disclosing any other information contained in the sealed document.islamic foundation,bush,d.
according to the district court,there was no reasonable danger that the national security would be harmed if it is confirmed or denied that plaintiffs were subject to surveillance.id.the district court granted the government motion to bar from access to the sealed document on the basis that it was protected by the state secrets privilege.the court stated that it would,however,permit witnesses to file in camera affidavits attesting from memory to the contents of the document to support assertion of standing and its prima facie case.id.at.
the district court sua sponte certified its order for interlocutory appeal.the case was then transferred to the northern district of california by the litigation panel to chief judge vaughn walker.we granted interlocutory review,and consolidated this appeal with hepting v.at t,
standard of review 
although we have not previously addressed directly the standard of review for a claim of the state secrets privilege,we have intimated that our review is de novo.see kasza browner,cir implying without stating that de novo review governs state secrets determination.de novo review as to the legal application of the privilege and clear error review as to factual findings make sense,as the determination of privilege is essentially a legal matter based on the underlying facts.we accord other privileges,such as the privilege,a similar error as to factual determinations by the district court,but de novo review as to the application of legal principles to those facts.see united states bauer,cir.other circuits are in accord regarding review of the state secrets privilege.see united states,cir molerio fbi.standing is also reviewed de novo.buono norton,cir.
i.the state secrets privilege 
the state secrets privilege is a common law evidentiary privilege that permits the government to bar the disclosure of information if there is a reasonable danger that disclosure will expose military matters which,in the interest of national security,should not be divulged.united states reynolds.the privilege is not to be lightly invoked.id.at.
although reynolds is widely viewed as the first explicit recognition of the privilege by the supreme court,see amanda frost,the state secrets privilege and separation of powers,fordham,the supreme court considered a form of the of certain state secrets totten united states.totten arose out of a contract between president lincoln and a secret agent who was allegedly dispatched to spy on enemy troops.as the court explained in a very short opinion,i t may be stated as a general principle,that public policy forbids the maintenance of any suit in a court of justice,the trial of which would inevitably lead to the disclosure of matters which the law itself regards as confidential,and respecting which it will not allow the confidence to be violated.id.at.the court then barred suit regarding the contract,as t he secrecy which such contracts impose precludes any action for their enforcement,and noted that the existence of a contract of that kind is itself a fact not to be disclosed.id.
as the supreme court noted in a later case involving an alleged agreement for espionage services,lawsuits premised on alleged espionage agreements are altogether forbidden.tenet doe,d.this conclusion has evolved into the principle that where the very subject matter of a lawsuit is a matter of state secret,the action must be dismissed without reaching the question of evidence.reynolds,at.see also kasza,at sterling tenet,cir dismissal is proper if sensitive military secrets will be so central to the subject matter of the litigation that any attempt to proceed will threaten disclosure of the privileged matters.internal citation omitted.
more than years passed before the supreme court directly addressed the state secrets privilege,observing that j udicial experience with the privilege which protects military and state secrets has been limited in this country.english experience has been more extensive,but still relatively slight compared with other evidentiary privileges.reynolds,at.footnotes omitted.in reynolds,the court addressed the privilege at length,analogizing to the policy and legal parameters of other privileges,such as the privilege against.see id.at.
these two and provide the foundation for our analysis.although there is only a single state secrets evidentiary privilege,as a matter of analysis,courts have approached the privilege as both a rule of,akin to a political question,and as a privilege that may bar proof of a prima facie case.see aclu sec.agency,cir the state secrets doctrine has two applications a rule of evidentiary privilege and a rule of.internal citations omitted kasza,at holding that if a plaintiff can not prove the prima facie elements of one claim without resort to privileged information,the court may dismiss.
mirroring these applications of the state secrets privilege,on appeal the government argues that the state secrets privilege mandates the dismissal of claims for three reasons the very subject matter of the litigation is a state secret can not establish standing to bring suit,absent the sealed document and can not establish a prima facie case,and the government can not defend against assertions,without resorting to state secrets 
ii.the subject matter of the litigation is not a state secret 
based on the various public statements made by the president and members of his administration acknowledging the existence of the tsp,and purported knowledge that its members communications had been intercepted,the district court rejected the government contention that the subject matter of the litigation is a state secret.see,d at.the court found that the government had lifted the veil of secrecy on the existence of the tsp and plaintiffs only seek to establish whether interception of their communications was unlawful.id.
we agree with the district court conclusion that the very subject matter of the government alleged warrantless surveillance program under the not protected by the state secrets privilege.two discrete sets of unclassified facts support this determination.first,president bush and others in the administration publicly acknowledged that in the months following the september,terrorist attacks,the president authorized a communications surveillance program that intercepted the communications of persons with suspected links to al qaeda and related terrorist organizations.second,in,was officially declared by the government to be a specially designated global terrorist due to its purported ties to al qaeda.the subject matter of the tsp and the government warrantless surveillance of persons or entities who,like,were suspected by the nsa to have connections to simply not a state secret.at this early stage in the litigation,enough is known about the tsp,and classification as a specially designated global terrorist,that the subject matter of lawsuit can be discussed,as it has been extensively in pleadings,televised arguments in open court in this appeal and in the media and the blogosphere,without disturbing the dark waters of privileged information.
because cases in this area are scarce,no court has put a fine point on how broadly or narrowly subject matter is defined in the context of state secrets.application of this principle must be viewed in the face of the specific facts alleged and the scope of the lawsuit.in this case,the analysis is not difficult because challenges warrantless surveillance authorized under the tsp.significantly,until disclosure of the program in,the program and its details were a highly prized government secret.
the first disclosure may have come from the new york times,but president bush quickly confirmed the existence of the tsp just one day later,on december,in a radio address to the nation.the president announcement that he had authorized the nsa to intercept the international communications of individuals with known links to al qaeda cast the first official glimmer of light on the tsp.since then,government officials have made voluntary disclosure after voluntary disclosure about the tsp,selectively coloring in the contours of the surveillance program and even hanging some of it in broad daylight.
two days after president bush announcement,attorney general gonzales disclosed that the tsp intercepted communications where one party was outside the united states,and the government had a reasonable basis to conclude that one party to the communication is a member of al qaeda,affiliated with al qaeda,or a member of an organization affiliated with al qaeda,or working in support of al qaeda.press briefing by attorney general alberto gonzales and general michael hayden,principal deputy director for national intelligence,last visited.attorney general gonzales confirmed that surveillance occurred without fisa warrants fisa requires that we get a court order,unless authorized by a statute,and we believe that authorization has occurred,and that american citizens could be surveilled only if they communicated with a suspected or known terrorist to the extent that there is a moderate and heavy communication involving an american citizen,it would be a communication where the other end of the call is outside the united states and where we believe either the american citizen or the person outside the united states is somehow affiliated with al qaeda.id.
in an address to the national press club on january,general hayden volunteered further details about the tsp 
t here are no communications more important to the safety of this country than those affiliated with al qaeda with one end in the united states.the president authorization allows us to track this kind of call more comprehensively and more efficiently.the trigger is quicker and a bit softer than it is for a fisa warrant,but the intrusion into privacy is also limited only international calls and only those we have a reasonable basis to believe involve al qaeda or one of its affiliates.
general michael hayden,address to the national press club,last visited.in the same speech,he asserted that the tsp was targeted and focused,and that at least one participant to the conversation was not in the united states,revealing that this is not about intercepting conversations between people in the united states.id.he even volunteered details as to the tsp procedures for inadvertently intercepting a purely domestic call 
and if there were ever an anomaly,and we discovered that there had been an inadvertent intercept of a call,that intercept would be destroyed and not reported.but the incident,what we call inadvertent collection,would be recorded and reported.but that a normal nsa procedure.it been our procedure for the last quarter century.and as always,as we always do when dealing with person information,as i said earlier,identities are expunged when they not essential to understanding the intelligence value of any report.
general hayden statements provided to the american public a wealth of information about the tsp.the public now knows the following additional facts about the program,beyond the general contours outlined by other officials at least one participant for each surveilled call was located outside the united states the surveillance was conducted without fisa warrants inadvertent calls involving purely domestic callers were destroyed and not reported the inadvertent collection was recorded and reported and identities are expunged from nsa records of surveilled calls if deemed to an understanding of the intelligence value of a particular report.these facts alone,disclosed by general hayden in a public address,provide a fairly complete picture of the scope of the tsp.
just a month after the president announcement,on january,the united states department of justice joined the succession of government disclosures in a white paper in which it not only confirmed that president bush had authorized the interception of international communications into and out of the united states,but also justified the intercepts with a legal analysis.department of justice,legal authorities supporting the activities of the national security agency described by the president,http www.usdoj.gov opa whitepaperon nsalegalauth orities.pdf last visited.that the department of justice even thought it necessary to explain to the public in an unclassified form,the legal basis for the nsa activities described by the president,see id.at,suggests that the government both knew that details of the surveillance program were in the public sphere and recognized that the program was already the subject of significant public discussion and interest.
the white paper disclosed other,as yet,information about the tsp,such as the nsa use of signals intelligence to identify and pinpoint the enemy.id.at.the nsa activities are directed at the enemy,and not at domestic activity that might incidentally aid the war effort,id.at,and were designed to enable the government to act quickly and flexibly and with secrecy to find agents of al qaeda and its affiliates.id.at.the tsp,intended to connect the dots between potential terrorists,was carefully reviewed approximately every days by the department of justice,and congressional leaders were briefed more than a dozen times on the agency activities.id.at quoting george bush,president press conference,last visited.
to be sure,there are details about the program that the government has not yet disclosed,but because of the voluntary disclosures made by various officials since december,the nature and purpose of the tsp,the type of persons it targeted,and even some of its procedures are not state secrets.in other words,the government many attempts to assuage citizens fears that they have not been surveilled now doom the government assertion that the very subject matter of this litigation,the existence of a warrantless surveillance program,is barred by the state secrets privilege.
in arguing that the sensitive subject matter of this litigation mandates dismissal,the government points to kasza,in which we affirmed the dismissal of an action on the basis of the state secrets privilege.at.kasza provides scant guidance to us in this case.kasza involved former employees at a classified air force facility who challenged under the resource conservation and recovery act of rcra the government allegedly improper treatment of hazardous materials.the secretary of the air force invoked the state secrets privilege with respect to ten categories of national security information associated with the operating location,including security sensitive environmental data.id.at.
we dismissed the action on the basis that its very subject matter was a state secret,but we were,perhaps purposefully,vague as to the specific reasons.the opinion simply stated that the disclosure of information sought in discovery requests would reasonably endanger national security interests,and that any further proceeding in this matter would jeopardize national security.at.absent some insight into our reasoning,kasza does not inform our determination here,except to confirm that some cases are,indeed,as a consequence of the very subject matter of the action being a state secret.
nor are we persuaded by the recent case of.khaled,a german citizen of lebanese descent,brought claims stemming from injuries allegedly received during his detention under the central intelligence agency cia extraordinary rendition program,at.the government defended the suit on the basis of the state secrets privilege,but argued that the state secrets privilege did not require dismissal of his claims because the cia program had been widely discussed in the press and in public fora,and acknowledged by administration officials.see id.at.maintained that the subject of his suit was only his particular rendition,not the renditions of other victims,and that the litigation posed no harm to national security because sufficient information had entered the public sphere to enable him to pursue his claims without compromising state secrets.see id.at.
the fourth circuit upheld the government assertion of the state secrets privilege and dismissed the action.to establish liability,would be required to produce evidence that exposes how the cia organizes,staffs,and supervises its most sensitive intelligence operations.id.at.for example,to establish of the cia george tenet liability,would be obliged to show in detail how the head of the cia participates in such operations,and how information concerning their progress is relayed to him.id.dismissal was proper because the information that was known to the public about the renditions program did not include facts that are central to litigating action.id.at.
the court in stated that for purposes of the state secrets analysis,the central facts and very subject matter of an action are those facts that are essential to prosecuting the action or defending against it.id.at.according to the fourth circuit,the subject matter of a lawsuit requires its dismissal if the action can not be litigated without threatening the disclosure of state secrets.id.emphasis in original.in other words,that court merged the concept of subject matter with the notion of proof of a prima facie case.indeed,in that case,the facts may have counseled for such an approach.
in contrast,we do not necessarily view the subject matter of a lawsuit as one and the same with the facts necessary to litigate the case.in kasza,we made the distinction between dismissal on the grounds that the subject matter of an action is a state secret,and dismissal on the grounds that a plaintiff can not prove the prima facie elements of the claim absent privileged evidence.see at.the parties,including the government,also made this distinction in their briefs,as did the district court in its decision.see,d at.because the fourth circuit has accorded an expansive meaning to the subject matter of an action,one that we have not adopted,does not support dismissal based on the subject matter of the suit.
to be sure,a bright line does not always separate the subject matter of the lawsuit from the information necessary to establish a prima facie case.in some cases,there may be no dividing line.in other cases,the suit itself may not be barred because of its subject matter and yet ultimately,the state secrets privilege may nonetheless preclude the case from proceeding to the merits.in other circumstances,the decision on the state secrets privilege may need to await preliminary discovery.it is precisely because of this continuum of analysis that the courts,the parties,and the commentators tend to treat the subject matter issue as a separate threshold determination.
case does involve privileged information,but that fact alone does not render the very subject matter of the action a state secret.accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of dismissal on that basis.
iii.the government invocation of the state secrets privilege 
although the very subject matter of this lawsuit does not result in automatic dismissal,we must still address the government invocation of the state secrets privilege as to the sealed document and its assertion that can not establish either standing or a prima facie case without the use of state secrets.our analysis of the state secrets privilege involves three steps.first,we must ascertain that the procedural requirements for invoking the state secrets privilege have been satisfied,at see also reynolds,at.second,we must make an independent determination whether the information is privileged,at.in deciding whether the privilege attaches,we may consider a party need for access to the allegedly privileged information.see reynolds,at.finally,the ultimate question to be resolved is how the matter should proceed in light of the successful privilege claim,at.
with respect to the first step,reynolds requires the government to make a formal claim of privilege,lodged by the head of the department which has control over the matter,after actual personal consideration by that officer.at.footnotes omitted.the parties do not dispute that the procedural requirements for invoking the state secrets privilege have been met.the government formally lodged its claim of privilege through classified and unclassified declarations filed by of national intelligence,john negroponte,as head of the united states intelligence community and lieutenant general keith alexander,director,national security agency.
next,we must determine whether the circumstances before us counsel that the state secrets privilege is applicable,without forcing a disclosure of the very thing that the privilege is designed to protect.id.at.two claims of privilege are at issue,although they are intertwined and we refer generally to both under the rubric of the sealed document whether was subject to surveillance and the sealed document.this case presents a most unusual posture because has seen the sealed document and believes that its members were subject to surveillance.the district court held,however,that because the government has not officially confirmed or denied whether plaintiffs were subject to surveillance,even if plaintiffs know they were,this information remains secret.furthermore,while plaintiffs know the contents of the sealed document,it too remains secret,d at.
the district court also concluded that the government did not waive its privilege by inadvertent disclosure of the sealed document.id.at.because unwittingly knows the contents of the sealed document,its allegations and pleadings are founded on information that it believes is derived from the document without revealing the content of the document.this convoluted sentence and explication underscore the practical difficulty for us in writing about a privileged document,while being cautious not to disclose any national security information.unlike the alleged spies in totten and tenet,who were knowing parties to a secret contract with the government,is privy to knowledge that the government fully intended to maintain as a national security secret.unlike the contract for secret services in totten,which was itself a fact not to be disclosed,the fact of the surveillance program is itself a fact that has been disclosed.at.
despite this wrinkle,we read reynolds as requiring an in camera review of the sealed document in these circumstances.t he showing of necessity which is made will determine how far the court should probe in satisfying itself that the occasion for invoking the privilege is appropri
