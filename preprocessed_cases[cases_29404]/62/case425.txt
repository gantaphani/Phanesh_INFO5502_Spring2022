darrel crawford appeals from a final decision of the merit systems protection board the board dismissing as moot his allegation that the department of the army the agency failed to comply with an order for corrective action.the board determined that the position to which crawford was assigned by the agency in response to the corrective action complied with a of the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act of userra because it was of like status to the position he held prior to his active,uniformed service.we do not find that the board acted arbitrarily or contrary to law in making this determination.we therefore affirm.
background 
crawford began his employment with the agency in.with credit for military service,the inception date of his federal service is.during this time,he has occupied several positions with the agency.in april,at the time crawford was called to perform uniformed service,he was an information technology it specialist,gs,in the agency army corps of engineers new york district information management office crawford old position.crawford uniformed service lasted until about april.
in june,the agency transferred many of its information technology functions to lockheed martin.this transfer was authorized by the office management and budget circular a program.as part of the transfer of functions,the agency abolished crawford old position and transferred those duties to lockheed martin employees,who are not federal employees.
at the same time the agency transferred certain functions to lockheed martin,it also formed a new organization called the army corps of engineers information technology ace it.the mission of ace it is to provide services to all agency offices in the united states.in april,recruitment began for the new positions created within ace it.some agency employees affected by the a program were hired by ace it through a competitive selection process.those employees that were not hired by ace it were transferred,with their consent,to positions in other offices within the corps of engineers new york district.
when crawford completed uniformed service,the agency briefly returned him to an it specialist position.but in june,the agency reassigned him to the position of program support specialist,gs.crawford challenged this reassignment with the board.he specifically alleged that the program support specialist position violated a because it was not of like status to his old position as an it specialist.as such,the agency violated the reemployment protections provided to those in uniformed service under a the administrative judge aj agreed that the program support specialist position was not of like status to crawford old position and granted his request for corrective action.as part of that corrective action,the aj ordered the agency to identify and place crawford in a position of like status to an it specialist.the aj also ordered,pursuant to a,that if the agency determined that no appropriate positions were available or if it was otherwise impossible or unreasonable to reassign crawford to such a position,then the agency should notify the office of personnel management opm to provide crawford with an opportunity to apply for placement assistance.neither party sought review of these orders,which became final on march.
the agency thereafter submitted a notice of compliance with the corrective action,asserting it was not able to find crawford a position of like status to it specialist and,therefore,had requested the opm placement assistance.in response,crawford filed a petition for enforcement with the board challenging the agency alleged compliance with the corrective action.crawford argued that the agency was required to search for all positions of like status or the next best available position,whether occupied or not before concluding there were no appropriate positions available and transferring the matter to the opm for placement assistance.since the agency search for positions was apparently limited to vacant positions,crawford believed that the agency failed to perform an adequate search and,consequently,did not comply with the ordered corrective action.
the aj agreed with crawford and granted his petition for enforcement of the ordered corrective action.the agency search was faulted for being overly restrictive in identifying positions of like status because it focused on only vacant positions.the aj therefore recommended that the agency conduct an search for a position of like status in order to comply with the order for corrective action.
the agency subsequently reassigned crawford from his position as a program support specialist to a position as an it specialist within ace it crawford new position.this new position has the same title and grade as his old position,it specialist.the new position is also located at the same duty station as the old position.
crawford appealed to the board to contest the adequacy of his assignment to the new position.crawford argued that while the title,grade,and location were the same as his old position,the position was nevertheless still not of like status to his old position.he argued that the differences in duties associated with the positions precluded them from being of like status.in particular,crawford asserts that his old position primarily involved duties,such as installing,repairing,evaluating,and configuring computer systems and their associated devices,and it only required him to perform some limited duties.in his new position,however,his primary duties involve software asset management and he does not have any responsibilities.crawford also argued that he was not qualified,as required by userra,to perform the duties associated with his new position.
the board disagreed.the board found it undisputed that crawford old and new positions were similar or identical with regard to pay,tenure,seniority,working conditions,and rank or responsibility.the board weighed those factors against the alleged differences in duties and found that,despite the duties,overall the positions were similar enough to comply with the like status standard of userra.the board also believed that crawford was qualified for the new position since he had already performed the position satisfactorily.additionally,any argument crawford had regarding a lack of qualification would be overcome once he received additional training.based on these findings,the board concluded that the agency was in compliance with the order for corrective action and dismissed crawford appeal.
crawford appeals the board dismissal.we have jurisdiction under a.
standard of review 
the scope of our review of a decision of the board is limited.in general,we can set aside the board decision only if it was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence.c see briggs merit.prot.
in determining whether the board decision is supported by substantial evidence,the question is not what the court would decide in a de novo appraisal,but whether the administrative determination is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.parker postal.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.consolidated edison nlrb.
