victoria snyder appeals the final decision of the merit systems protection board board affirming the decision of the department of the navy navy to furlough her for six days between july and september of as a result of the federal government sequestration of.because we find no reversible error in the board decision,we affirm.
background 
this case is one of many that arise from the sequestration legislation adopted by congress,the budget control act of and the american taxpayer relief act of see,calhoun dep t of the army,fed.cir.fed of fed,local dep t of the army,fed.cir.nffe einboden dep t of the navy,fed.cir.as a result of this legislation,the budget of the department of defense dod was cut by billion approximately halfway through fiscal year.dod took a number of steps to address the dramatic budgetary shortfall for the fiscal year,including reprogramming funds,reducing facility maintenance,and eliminating some military training exercises.
on may,the secretary of defense secdef issued a memorandum directing dod managers to to furlough most dod civilian employees for up to eleven workdays in fiscal year.as explained in the secdef memorandum,sequestration reduced dod operation and maintenance accounts that pay many civilian dod employees,and although dod and implemented various actions to reduce the budgetary shortfall,a shortfall nevertheless remained which would be addressed through furloughs of civilian employees.the memorandum provided that f urloughs will be imposed in every military department as well as almost every agency and in our working capital funds.in an attachment to the memorandum,the secdef provided a list of approved furlough exceptions,which included employees deployed to a combat zone,those whose jobs are necessary to protect safety of life and property,navy shipyard employees,national intelligence program employees,foreign military sales employees,political appointees,fund naf employees,foreign national employees,and various types of employees not paid directly by accounts.
subsequently,on june,a bipartisan group of members of congress sent a letter to the secretary of defense expressing concern about the that civilian workers at entities funded through defense working capital funds wcfs would also be subject to furlough.wcfs are created and controlled by the office of the secdef.a,b,e.they function entirely from the fees charged for the services provided consistent with its statutory authority.einboden,at citing gov t office,gao,a glossary of terms used in the federal budget process.after receiving initial working capital through appropriation,wcf entities are and function from the fees charged for the services they provide to their customers.nffe,at.the primary customers of wcf entities are other dod entities that transfer their own funds to make from wcfs.id.robert hale,under secretary of defense comptroller,on behalf of the secdef,responded to the congressional inquiry regarding wcfs in a july statement to congress,explaining that furloughs of all dod civilians will save about billion in fiscal year,including more than million with reduced personnel costs in working capital fund activities.these working capital fund personnel savings provide us the flexibility to adjust maintenance funding downward to meet needs.thus,in accordance with the secdef directive,of the furloughs generally proceeded across dod,including wcf entities.
snyder was a civilian mechanical engineer at the naval surface warfare center,dahlgren division dahlgren at the time of the sequestration.dahlgren is a navy wcf entity.see einboden,at.on may,snyder as well as numerous other dahlgren employees received a notice of proposed furlough indicating that the navy planned to furlough her for a period of up to eleven workdays days because of the extraordinary and serious budgetary challenges,the most serious of which is the sequester.
at that time,snyder worked on a lockheed martin advanced shipboard weapons control aswc project to modify existing weapons control.the aswc project was governed by a cooperative research and development agreement crada between dahlgren and lockheed martin,signed in september.pursuant to the aswc crada,both parties would provide expertise and engineering support.lockheed martin was solely responsible for funding the project,providing million in,paid to the treasurer of the united states.according to the crada terms,any unused funds remaining at the completion of the project in were to be remitted to lockheed martin following dahlgren submission of a final fiscal report.
on may,lockheed martin sent a letter to the navy requesting that the dahlgren employees supporting the aswc crada including snyder be exempt from furlough.the letter argued that the project was fully funded by lockheed martin independent and research development irad funds and not federal,and therefore,it should be viewed as funding like foreign military sales fms funding one of the express exceptions identified in the secdef memorandum.snyder filed a written reply on june,to the proposed furlough,echoing lockheed martin view that her work for the lockheed aswc crada should be exempted from furlough like the listed secdef exceptions.in a letter dated june,the navy deciding official responded to snyder,denying her request 
snyder petitioned the board for review,asserting that the navy had improperly furloughed her.her case was consolidated with other furloughed dahlgren employees.an administrative judge aj conducted a consolidated hearing on july.
for her part,snyder argued that,because she was working in support of the lockheed aswc crada,her situation was akin to those exceptions identified by the secdef.in support of her argument,snyder requested the aj take official notice of the federal technology transfer act of,codified at et,as well as dod instruction,dod technology transfer program,may,which prescribes procedures for implementing technology transfer programs,including cradas.she argued that these provisions collectively i prohibit the federal government from providing funds to a crada participant and ii obligate the government to maintain separate and distinct accounts to track crada funds.thus,she argued that she was not paid out of funds,like typical wcf employees,and her work should have been exempted from the furlough because her furlough could not have assisted in reducing dod budgetary shortfall.
snyder also argued that the navy improperly provided some,but not all,furloughed employees assigned to work on the aswc crada with an opportunity to earn overtime pay to mitigate the economic impact of the furlough.in support,she offered the testimony of larry fontenot,a fellow aswc crada employee.fontenot testified that he and others working on the project were permitted to work overtime during the furlough time period and that he believed this was a result of a compromise struck by management to make up for the furlough days.this compromise,snyder argued,demonstrates that the navy did not apply the furlough in a fair and even manner.
for its part,the navy explained that all dahlgren employee salaries regardless of funding source are paid directly from the wcf.kathy clark,deputy comptroller for dahlgren,testified that when a wcf employee like snyder performs work on a job requested by a customer,the customer does not directly pay the employee salary rather,the wcf employee salary is paid from the wcf.the navy argued that by not paying snyder salary for six days,it realized a savings in the wcf at the time of the furlough,just as with every other employee paid from the wcf.thus,the navy explained,even if it would be required to pay back lockheed martin certain monies in a later,subsequent fiscal year upon the completion of the project the navy still realized an immediate benefit at that specific point in time in in responding to the sequestration.
on september,the aj issued an initial decision in the consolidated case and found snyder furlough was a reasonable management solution to the shortage of funds caused by sequestration and therefore promoted the efficiency of the service.the aj acknowledged that snyder cited numerous agency regulations con
