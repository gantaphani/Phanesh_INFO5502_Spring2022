in challenging his conviction by a military consisting of less than six persons,kevin sanford invites this court to hold that his rights under the due process clause of the fifth amendment were violated.he relies on the supreme court announcement of a constitutional minimum jury for the trial of civilian,offenses in ballew georgia,d,and suggests it is the government burden to show that his due process rights were not violated.because ballew was grounded in the sixth amendment right to a jury trial,however,sanford is actually seeking a new due process right to a panel of a minimum size.sanford focus on rebutting the government assertions thus fails to engage the appropriate inquiry under weiss united states,d,which is whether the factors militating in favor of the proposed rule are so extraordinarily weighty as to overcome the balance struck by congress,id.at.quoting middendorf henry,d.because sanford failed to engage this standard before the military courts,their resolution of his claim suffered from no fundamental defect and was properly upheld by the district court.
the supreme court conclusion regarding minimum jury size in the civilian system was based on empirical studies.ballew,at.sanford presented no similar empirical evidence regarding the military justice system,which has features to ensure accurate fact finding not found in the civilian justice system.rather,sanford contends that ballew reflects a conclusion about a fundamental right that is required by due process under both the fifth and fourteenth amendments.still he fails to show that the empirical data underlying ballew holding applies with equal force to the military justice system,which is based on congress balancing of interests,some of which are unique to the military.doubtless it is fundamental that there be accurate fact finding under the justice system congress established in the uniform code of military justice,et.ucmj,but sanford fails to show that the design of the military system is so incompatible with that principle as to violate due process.accordingly,we affirm the dismissal of his complaint.
pursuant to article i of the constitution,const.art.i,cl,congress established a military justice system that includes three types of summary,special,and general.see.the summary consists of only one commissioned officer,id,has jurisdiction over enlisted men and women only,can be conducted only with their consent,and can impose only a limited array of minor punishments for minor offenses,see id.at the other end of the spectrum is the general,which comprises a military judge and at least members,or the judge alone if the accused so requests,id,has jurisdiction over all persons in the military for offenses under the ucmj,and can impose all lawful sentences,even death,see id.
the special,at issue in this appeal,falls somewhere in between.consisting of not less than three members,a military judge and not less than three members,or the military judge alone if the accused requests,id,the special has jurisdiction over most offenses under the ucmj and may,under such limitations as the president may prescribe,adjudge any punishment not forbidden by this chapter except death,dishonorable discharge,dismissal,confinement for more than one year,hard labor without confinement for more than three months,forfeiture of pay exceeding pay per month,or forfeiture of pay for more than one year,id.subject to an exception for exigency,adjudgment of a discharge,confinement for more than six months,or forfeiture of pay for more than six months requires that a military judge have presided over the,that a complete record have been made,and that counsel have been detailed to the accused.see id.
the military judge who presides over a special or general rules on all legal questions and instructs the members regarding the law and procedures to be followed.id.the members if the accused has not opted to be tried by the military judge alone decide guilt or innocence,as well as the sentence,if any,to be imposed.id.except in death cases,their verdict need not be unanimous.members of the are selected on the basis of being best qualified for the duty by reason of age,education,training,experience,length of service,and judicial temperament.d.
upon conviction,the defendant may appeal,id,and the service court of appeals is required to review the entire record de novo,id.c,and may substitute its judgment for that of the military judge and that of the court members,united states cole.a further appeal may be had upon petition to the united states court of appeals for the armed forces at that court discretion.a.the court of appeals for the armed forces may only set aside convictions that are incorrect in law.id.c see also cole,at.the court refusal to grant a petition is not subject to review by the united states supreme court.a.
sanford is a former sergeant who served in the united states marine corps.on october,a special comprised of a military judge and four members convicted him of violating a lawful order,dereliction of duty,larceny,and impersonating an officer,all in violation of the ucmj.the conviction was based on his false preparation of recall orders for a marine reservist that,along with other false representations,induced the reservist employer to purchase airfare on his behalf from texas to camp pendleton,california.sanford was sentenced to confinement for six months,forfeiture of pay per month for six months,reduction from pay grade to,and a discharge.
on appeal,the united states corps court of criminal appeals the marine corps court affirmed the finding of guilt with some modifications and reduced the period of his confinement to days.united states sanford,wl,at.rejecting sanford argument that empaneling fewer than six members for his violated his fifth amendment right to due process in contravention of the standard articulated in ballew,the marine corps court stated 
we have considered the appellant eighth assignment of error challenging his convictions for offenses by a panel of only four members,and find it to be without merit.see united states wolff,see also,ucmj.
id.at.the court of appeals for the armed forces denied sanford petition for review.united states sanford.
on october,sanford filed suit in the federal district court challenging the validity of his conviction.as he did on direct appeal,sanford argued that his violated his due process rights under ballew.the district court ruled that the marine corps court had given thorough consideration to sanford argument and that the court judgment did not contravene supreme court standards.sanford united states,d.sanford appeals,and this court reviews de novo the dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim.kowal mci commc ns.
this court has recognized that the standard of review in collateral attacks on proceedings is tangled.united states ex rel.new rumsfeld,new ii.two lines of precedent are relevant the first deals with the full and fair consideration standard that applies for habeas review of,and the second deals with the void standard that applies to collateral attacks on proceedings by persons who are not in custody.the court in new ii,which was faced,as here,with a plaintiff,attempted a synthesis of the two standards,looking primarily to the military courts analyses of the merits of the plaintiff claim.because the first standard full and fair consideration is,if anything,less deferential than the second void,the court observed that a claim that fails the former a fortiori fails the latter.id.at.in that situation,the court did not need to address how much more deference,if any,was due to the military court judgment on review.
in burns wilson.plurality,the supreme court first articulated the full and fair consideration standard,stating in the context of military habeas proceedings that when a military decision has dealt fully and fairly with an allegation raised in that application,it is not open to a federal civilian court to grant the writ simply to the evidence,id.at.in kauffman secretary of the air force,this court interpreted that standard,observing that t he supreme court has never clarified the standard of full and fair consideration,and it has meant many things to many courts,id.at.the court reasoned that the standard should not differ from that currently imposed in habeas corpus review of state convictions,and held that the test of fairness requires that military rulings on constitutional issues conform to supreme court standards,unless it is shown that conditions peculiar to military life require a different rule.id.
the second line of precedent follows schlesinger councilman,d,which held that federal courts have jurisdiction to review the validity of proceedings brought by plaintiffs who can not bring habeas suits,id.at.however,for a court to grant any relief to such plaintiffs,the military court judgment must be void,id.at.see id.at,meaning the error must be fundamental.the supreme court stated that whether a judgment properly may be deemed void may turn on the nature of the alleged defect,and the gravity of the harm from which relief is sought.moreover,both factors must be assessed in light of the deference that should be accorded the judgments of the carefully designed military justice system established by congress.id.at.this court adopted the councilman standard as law for the circuit for collateral attacks on judgments in priest secretary of the navy,and there considered the fundamental nature of the purported constitutional errors,in light of supreme court precedent examining the requirements of the first amendment,id.at.
in new ii,the court traced both these standards,their interplay with the evolution of the relevant standards for habeas review of civilian criminal judgments,and the level of deference to be accorded by the court in each type of proceeding.in the end,however,the court stated it had serious doubt whether the judicial mind is really capable of applying the sort of fine gradations in deference that the varying formulae may indicate.new ii,at.acknowledging councilman statement that errors must be fundamental to void a judgment on collateral review,the court held that in light of councilman point that review is if anything more deferential than habeas review of military judgments,a military court judgment clearly will not suffer such a defect if it satisfies burns fair consideration test,id.at internal citation omitted.ultimately,the court found no fundamental defect in the military court of appeals resolution of the claim.id.at.
however,in applying the full and fair consideration test,the court in new ii did not strictly follow kauffman,which would have required the court to consider new claims de novo and solely on the merits before shifting the burden to the military to show that the needs of military life require a different rule.in new ii the court review was searching,but deferential,much as in priest,at,stating,for example,the court of appeals reasonably found,at,and we can find no fundamental defect in the court of appeals consideration of the issue,id.at,and the military courts use of the political question doctrine deserves deference,id.by contrast,the kauffman view of full and fair consideration,which asks whether the military court decision conforms to supreme court standards,does not appear to contemplate such deference.although in new ii the court did not describe the exact degree of deference accorded to the military courts,its analysis suggests there are two steps in applying the full and fair consideration standard a review of the military court thoroughness in examining the relevant claims,at least where thoroughness is contested and a close look at the merits of the claim,albeit with some degree of deference and certainly more than under kauffman s de novo standard.
the contrast between kauffman and new ii is sharp because new ii does not refer to kauffman,which represented this court most extensive previous interpretation of the burns full and fair consideration standard that new ii purports to apply albeit as a for the councilman void standard.however,sanford appeal does not present the occasion in which the inconsistencies are,and we reserve for another day the question whether,on collateral review in cases,the court need ever reach burns full and fair consideration inquiry that is,resolving the extent to which the burns and councilman standards may differ and the content of those standards.sanford presents two challenges to his conviction he contends,first,that the military courts did not give his due process claim consideration to satisfy the full and fair consideration standard,and second,that his violated the due process clause of the fifth amendment under ballew.although in a case councilman frames the inquiry,we apply new ii approach,considering sanford claims on the least deferential test possible under either burns or it remains true that if they are unpersuasive on the merits,sanford claims would fail a fortiori under the more deferential void inquiry.
for a fifth amendment due process claim in the context,the supreme court has instructed that in light of the fact that j udicial deference is at its apogee when reviewing congressional decisionmaking in this area,weiss,at.internal quotations omitted,the appropriate standard to apply is found in middendorf,where the court inquired whether the factors militating in favor of the proposed rule are so extraordinarily weighty as to overcome the balance struck by congress,id.at.quoting middendorf,at.the question here,therefore,is whether sanford has shown that the factors militating in favor of a are so extraordinarily weighty as to overcome the balance struck by congress when it provided that special could proceed with as few as three members.
the marine corps court addressed sanford due process argument in a footnote to its opinion,citing united states wolff.in wolff,the navy court of military review after noting the sixth amendment inapplicability to,id.at,concluded the ballew factors were inapplicable through the fifth amendment as well,id.at.the court observed that wolff contentions rel ied upon the ballew rationale that the quality of justice varies proportionately with the number of members in the deliberating body.id.however,it concluded that no evidence in the record supported this premise when applied to.furthermore,because of differences between civilian jurors and members,the court was unwilling to adopt empirical data compiled in the civilian community.id.the court noted that members are not selected to represent a of the community and are deliberately selected,not at random,but on the basis of who is best qualified for the position.see also united states corl,united states guilford.
sanford strongest point in contending that the military courts failed to give his due process claim full and fair consideration is that because congress doubled the confinement and forfeiture powers of special from six to twelve months after wolff was decided but before his case,simply citing wolff was insufficient.however,neither wolff,corl,nor guilford relied on the panel punishment power to justify their holdings.corl like wolff instead focused on the empirical data before the supreme court in ballew,and on the judicially recognized fact that the civilian community is different from the military community.see corl,at citing parker levy,d councilman,d see also guilford,at.furthermore,the factual premises underlying the rationale in all three of those cases has not changed.it remains true that there are differences between civilian jurors and members and that members are not selected at random to represent a of the community but rather selected from the military population on the basis of who is best qualified for the position.d.because sanford due process claim was therefore controlled by those prior decisions,it is unclear what benefit could have come from a longer discussion.
taking new ii at its word,at,that summary disposition is appropriate for a weak claim,the marine corps court citation to precedent addressing the relevant considerations and ucmj article sufficed.the marine corps court gave full and fair consideration to sanford due process claim in light of the fact that its resolution was predetermined by binding precedent.
in ballew the supreme court held that
