agustin aguayo,a soldier in the united states army,applied for a discharge as a conscientious objector.the army denied his application,and aguayo filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court.the court denied the petition,and aguayo now appeals.because there is evidence in the record that supports the army decision to deny aguayo application for conscientious objector status,we affirm.
aguayo volunteered to serve in the united states army in november,when he was years old.in his enlistment agreement,aguayo answered no to the following question 
are you now or have you ever been a conscientious objector that is,do you have,or have you ever had,a firm,fixed,and sincere objection to participation in war in any form or to the bearing of arms because of religious belief or training 
aguayo committed to eight years in the army,with four years of active duty,and entered service as a healthcare specialist in january.
in february,shortly before he was deployed to iraq,aguayo applied for a discharge from the army on the basis of conscientious objection.it is the policy of the military to grant conscientious objector co status to any service member 
who is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form 
whose opposition is founded on religious training and beliefs and 
whose position is sincere and deeply held.
a.an applicant who would have qualified for co status before entering the military,however,generally is not eligible for co classification once in the service.id.a.the army has implemented this policy in army regulation ar a class conscientious objector is entitled to separation from the army,while a class objector will continue in military service in a noncombatant status.see a.aguayo applied only for class status.
aguayo explained in his application that m y moral view does not allow me to take the life of another human being,and that his progressive training in arms and other military operations have progressively,and from the very beginning,caused me great anguish and guilt.pursuant to army regulations,aguayo was evaluated by a psychologist and interviewed by a chaplain.the chaplain reported that pfc private first class aguayo seems to be sincere in his beliefs although the timing of his request makes it questionable.it is difficult to assess the depths of his beliefs because they rest solely with in his own thinking and personal values with out the support of background,family or faith group.
captain sean foster was assigned to investigate the application,and in march he held a hearing in tikrit,iraq.aguayo and four witnesses testified.captain foster wrote that after reviewing the evidence and hearing testimony,it seemed clear to me that pfc aguayo is absolutely sincere in his stated beliefs that he is opposed to war in any form,and that aguayo opposition to war grew during basic training and solidified during live fire exercises.captain foster concluded that pfc aguayo stated beliefs that he is internally incapable of participating in any form of war without being in a constant state of personal moral dilemma is absolutely sincere,and recommended that the application be granted.
the application was then forwarded through aguayo chain of command.aguayo company commander recommended approval,and noted that soldier appears to have a legitimate concern with being a soldier and this conflicts negatively with his ability to perform his duties.the next four officers to review the application,however,recommended disapproval.aguayo battalion commander interviewed aguayo and wrote that aguayo pursuit of conscientious objector status is an attempt to remedy his anxiety all soldiers face during an extended deployment in a combat theater of operations.aguayo brigade commander concurred in the battalion commander assessment and wrote that he d id not believe that soldier belief is consistent w conscientious objection.the staff judge advocate responsible for reviewing aguayo application also recommended disapproval.he wrote 
pfc aguayo convictions do not appear to be sincerely held he has not persuasively shown how his duties as a medic are incompatible with his newly discovered beliefs,other than stating he feels he was misled by his recruiter,and he expected to work in a hospital.the timing of his application raises doubts as well pfc aguayo did not identify any specific ways he has altered his behavior to accommodate his beliefs.although practicing a religion is not a requirement for co approval,pfc aguayo has not discussed any equally significant source of his beliefs other than he was raised in a kind and respectful family as stated by his battalion commander,he desires to get out of the deployment and the army,and he is using this process in an attempt to end his service early.
finally,aguayo division commander recommended disapproval.aguayo application then went to the department of the army conscientious objector review board dacorb or board at the department of the army headquarters hqda the dacorb makes the final decision on all co applications requesting discharge.the board denied aguayo application in july.
in august aguayo petitioned the united states district court for the district of columbia,pursuant to,for a writ of habeas corpus ordering the army to discharge him as a conscientious objector.the parties agreed to stay the proceedings in light of aguayo assertion that the army had violated its own regulations by failing to provide him with the opportunity to rebut the negative recommendations from the officers in his chain of command.aguayo then submitted an amended application,and the army agreed to have the dacorb review the entire application de novo.
the amended application included a rebuttal to the officers recommendations and more detailed responses to several questions from aguayo initial application.for example,aguayo explained that his beliefs had changed during his army training 
as the trainings progressed i knew i could not stab anyone with a bayonet for instance.and when i felt the earth tremble beneath me after firing an i felt and i now know there no way i could point it at someone and shoot my convictions are strong and are deeply rooted based on my upbringing,morals,and the experiences i have had in the army.
as to the nature of his beliefs,aguayo explained that he was agnostic and that he had a deep admiration for people such as jesus christ,gandhi,and martin luther king.i treasure their values and desire to follow their lead i believe that if there is a creator he would not want his creations to hurt or damage each other.to the question of what aspects of his life most conspicuously demonstrate the consistency and depth of his beliefs,aguayo wrote that i avoid violent movies and violent entertainment.i try to avoid the more warlike aspects of training.i will always try to act in accordance with my beliefs.
in january the dacorb again denied aguayo application.the denial stated that a fter thorough examination of the case record,the dacorb determined that the applicant did not present clear and convincing evidence,iaw in accordance with ar,that the applicant stated beliefs warrant award of status.
on march,aguayo filed an amended habeas corpus petition in the district court.in april,the army opposed the amended petition and filed the administrative record as well as a memorandum from the dacorb dated march,the supplemental memorandum.this memorandum lists several reasons why the dacorb denied aguayo application 
applicant lacks the religious foundation the underpinning that supports conscientious objector beliefs.
applicant has not provided any significant source of his beliefs conscience or moral views that would warrant conscientious objector status.
appears that applicant held beliefs prior to entry to the army.although these could have crystallized after entry,it still appears that these beliefs were considerable prior to entry with no significant identification of these beliefs at entry to the army.
questionable timing of the application just prior to unit deployment.
the supplemental memorandum also states that t his is not an exhaustive or list of reasons for the denial of this application.
in august aguayo sought an injunction to prevent his deployment to a war zone pending the resolution of his habeas claim.by order and opinion of august,the district court denied aguayo habeas petition and denied the injunction as moot.aguayo harvey,d.aguayo immediately appealed and sought an injunction from this court.we denied the injunction pending the appeal but agreed to expedite the case.aguayo argues that we should reverse because the district court should not have considered the dacorb supplemental memorandum and because there is no basis in fact for the denial of his co application.we disagree with these arguments and affirm 
for purposes of the federal habeas corpus statutes,members of the armed forces are in the custody of the united states government.parisi,at.after exhausting all procedures for administrative relief,service members may challenge their custody by petitioning for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court under.parisi,at.alhassan hagee,cir.
aguayo first argument concerns the dacorb march supplemental memorandum,which lists several reasons for the board denial of aguayo application.aguayo contends that the district court should not have consulted this accordingly that the memorandum should be disregarded on appellate it was created after aguayo filed his amended habeas petition and because the memorandum does not comply with military regulations.we hold that the supplemental memorandum may properly be reviewed in assessing the merits of aguayo habeas petition.
aguayo is correct that judicial review of an administrative decision is generally limited to the existing administrative record.t he focal point for judicial review should be the administrative record already in existence,not some new record made initially in the reviewing court.florida power light lorion,d quoting camp pitts,d.but this principle of administrative law does not preclude consideration of the supplemental memorandum in this habeas corpus proceeding.under the administrative procedure act apa,agencies generally must state the grounds for their decision to deny a written application.see e tourus records,drug enforcement,roelofs sec y of the air force.this requirement facilitates judicial review,because one of the tasks of the reviewing court is to determine whether an agency decision finds adequate support in the administrative record.accordingly,when the statement of reasons is inadequate,in an apa case the usual remedy is a remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.tourus records,at quoting florida power light,at.in this case,the supplemental memorandum provides additional explanation,and we are not inclined to disregard it simply because it was not produced in response to a remand.
moreover,in refusing to ignore the supplemental memorandum we note that we are not reviewing a claim brought under the apa but rather a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.habeas proceedings are governed by their own rules,and habeas corpus rule expressly provides that the judge may direct the parties to expand the record by submitting additional materials relating to the petition.rules governing proceedings,rule a,foll.see also id.rule b the materials that may be required include letters predating the filing of the petition,documents,exhibits,and answers under oath to written interrogatories propounded by the judge.affidavits may also be submitted and considered as part of the record.id.rule b district court may apply any or all of these rules to a habeas corpus petition not covered by scope of rules governing proceedings.in this case,the judge did not direct the army to expand the record but instead accepted the memorandum as an attachment to the army opposition papers this is a distinction without a difference and we will not exclude the memorandum on this basis.aguayo also argues that,habeas rule notwithstanding,courts may not consider new evidence in reviewing a conscientious objector habeas petition.see,armstrong laird,cir.but this argument has no bearing on this case.we agree that the army decision to reject aguayo co application must be supported by evidence in the administrative record as that record existed when it was reviewed by the dacorb,but the supplemental memorandum does not purport to contain such evidence.rather,it lists reasons for the board decision,and under the standard of review we apply to a denial of a service member co application,it is the board decision that must have a factual basis.the standard of review we apply to the army denial of aguayo co application is discussed below in section.the supplemental memorandum might tell us where to look for evidence that aguayo is or is not entitled to be classified as a conscientious objector,but we emphasize that in reviewing the board decision we look to the same evidence reviewed by the board.
aguayo also contends that the supplemental memorandum can not be considered because it did not comply with the military conscientious objector regulations.the reasons for an adverse decision will be made a part of the record and will be provided to the individual.f.the corresponding army regulation provides that i f a determination by hqda that the person request is disapproved sic,the reasons for this decision will be made a part of the record.it will be provided to the person through command channels.ar.aguayo argues that the supplemental memorandum was not made a part of the record,because it was created after aguayo filed his amended petition aguayo also states that he did not receive the memorandum through command channels.the army responds that the memorandum was indeed provided to aguayo commanding officer,and in any event aguayo learned about the supplemental memorandum when the army filed it with the district court.we agree with the army that any errors in the army handling of the memorandum do not merit excluding it from consideration.
because we will not exclude the supplemental memorandum from consideration,we do not reach aguayo argument that the remainder of the record does not present a valid reason for denying his application.as aguayo rightly points out,the dacorb january decision does not give us much to work with.it states simply that a fter thorough examination of the case record,the dacorb determined that the applicant did not present clear and convincing evidence,iaw in accordance with ar,that the applicant stated beliefs warrant award of status.but because we hold that the supplemental memorandum is properly before this court,we need not decide whether this boilerplate denial would be sufficient to guide judicial review of the dacorb decision in light of the regulations clear requirement that the board provide its reasons for denying an application.gruca sec y of the army,holding,in a case involving a challenge to a selective service classification,i t is enough if there is evidence in the record from which we can garner the basis of the board action.nor do we decide what the appropriate remedy would be if it were not sufficient.see,united states ex rel.coates laird,cir holding that,where the marine corps failed to give a reason for its denial of a co application,the proper procedure is to remand the proceedings to the service for reprocessing and for compliance with the requirement of a statement of reasons.
the army decision to deny an application for conscientious objector status will not be disturbed unless there is no factual basis for the decision.united states seeger,d united states ex rel.barr resor.the scope of our review under the basis in fact standard is extremely narrow.we neither substitute our judgment for that of the military nor look for substantial evidence to support its decision.witmer united states.under this standard the army decision can be overturned only if it has no basis in fact.id.at.see also dickinson united states.
basis in fact review in conscientious objector cases traces to the supreme court decision in estep united states.under the conscription laws then in effect,decisions of civilian draft boards regarding the classification of selective service registrants were final and the law did not provide
