this case arises from the tragic february crash of an army special operations aviation regiment helicopter in afghanistan.plaintiffs,who include those injured and the heirs of those killed in the crash,appeal from the district court dismissal of at engine controls atec for lack of personal jurisdiction and from the court summary judgment in favor of the boeing company boeing,honeywell international,honeywell,and goodrich pump and engine control goodrich.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm.
in february,an mh chinook helicopter crashed in the kabul province of afghanistan.the helicopter was transporting military personnel to bagram airbase when it encountered snow,rain,and ice.then,without warning,one of the chinook engines suddenly shut down,and the aircraft crashed.eight servicemen were killed and fourteen were severely injured.
two investigations into the cause of the crash revealed that it occurred after one of the helicopter two engines suddenly flamed out.an initial army investigation suggested that the aircraft engine control system the full authority digital electronic control fadec unexpectedly shut down,causing the engine to fail.according to investigators,the engine digital electronic control unit decu the onboard computer that controls fuel flow to the engine malfunctioned due to some kind of electrical anomaly.
a second investigation,conducted primarily by the manufacturers of the mh,suggested that the crash occurred for a different reason.according to these investigators,the aircraft engine flamed out because it ingested an inordinate amount of water and ice during the inclement weather.this investigation further suggested,however,that the flameout might have been avoided if the mh ignition system had been equipped with a continuous or automatic relight feature,which would have allowed the engine to restart automatically in the event of a water or flameout.
six months after the crash,plaintiffs filed an action against the contractors that designed and manufactured the allegedly defective aircraft.these contractors include boeing,which designed the helicopter airframe honeywell,which designed and built the engines including the ignition system goodrich,which designed the fadec and was responsible for the decu and atec,a british company that designed the hardware and software for the decu.
initially,plaintiffs sought relief in california state court,alleging that defendants were liable on theories of product liability,negligence,wrongful death,and loss of consortium.boeing,however,quickly removed the action to federal court pursuant to the federal officer removal statute,a,which allows federal officers and agents to remove claims to federal court by asserting a federal defense.
in a series of written orders,the district court rejected each of plaintiffs claims.first,in a march,order,the district court ruled that it lacked personal jurisdiction over atec.then,in january,the district court granted summary judgment to boeing,honeywell,and goodrich collectively the contractors.getz boeing,d.according to the district court,plaintiffs claims against the contractors were preempted by the government contractor defense.id.
in resolving plaintiffs appeal,we turn first to the district court dismissal of atec,the british company,for lack of personal jurisdiction.according to plaintiffs,atec is subject to personal jurisdiction in california pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure k.this rule,which is commonly known as the federal statute,permits federal courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant that lacks contacts with any single state if the complaint alleges federal claims and the defendant maintains sufficient contacts with the united states as a whole.rule k,titled federal claim outside state court jurisdiction,provides 
for a claim that arises under federal law,serving a summons or filing a waiver of service establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant if 
a the defendant is not subject to jurisdiction in any state courts of general jurisdiction and 
b exercising jurisdiction is consistent with the united states constitution and laws.
the only question presented here is whether plaintiffs satisfy the first part of rule k.that is,do any of their claims against atec pure claims for product liability,negligence,wrongful death,and loss of consortium arise under federal law 
until now,we have not examined the precise parameters of the element of rule k.we need not,however,navigate through uncharted terrain without a compass.here,the commentary to the rule and the decisions of our sister circuits agree that rule k reach is limited to substantive federal claims.
first,the commentary explains that rule k was enacted to correct a gap in the enforcement of federal law.k,advisory committee note.under the former rules for service of process,federal courts looked to state law,even in federal question cases,whenever a federal statute was silent about the proper mechanism for service.see also omni capital int l rudolf wolff,d recognizing the predecessor rule limitations.as a result,foreign defendants having sufficient contacts with the united states as a whole,but not satisfying the applicable state statute,would be shielded from the enforcement of federal law by the fortuity of the fourteenth amendment favorable limitation on the power of state courts.k,advisory committee note.
rule k eliminates this anomaly.whereas foreign defendants lacking sufficient contacts with any single state could previously avoid responsibility for civil violations of our federal laws,the revised rule allows federal courts to exercise jurisdiction over these defendants,subject only to the limitations of the fifth amendment due process clause.id.in this manner,rule k provides aggrieved plaintiffs with a mechanism for vindicating their federal rights in cases involving defendants that lack contacts,but who possess minimum contacts with the united states as a whole.id.
however,rule k was narrowly tailored so as to avoid conflict with the fourteenth amendment jurisdictional limits in cases alleging only claims 
this narrow extension of the federal reach applies only if a claim is made against the defendant under federal law.it does not establish personal jurisdiction if the only claims are those arising under state law or the law of another country,even though there might be diversity or alienage subject matter jurisdiction as to such claims.
id.emphasis added.thus,in order to preserve the proper constitutional balance,rule k is available only to plaintiffs who allege a federally created cause of action.charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.
those circuits to address rule k have followed the approach set forth in the commentary.the fifth circuit,for instance,has limited the rule to substantive federal law claims.world tanker carriers ya mawlaya,cir.agreeing with world tanker,the first circuit has held that a claim that finds its roots in a federal source satisfies rule k.united states swiss am.bank,cir see also touchcom,bereskin parr,to meet the arising under requirement of rule k,federal law must be a necessary element of one of the plaintiff complaints.
based on the commentary and this authority,we hold that plaintiffs claims for product liability,negligence,wrongful death,and loss of consortium do not arise under federal law for purposes of rule k.none of these purely statelaw claims alleges any violation of a federal right and none seeks the enforcement of federal law.see.k,advisory committee note.unfortunately for plaintiffs,their complaint simply does not assert any substantive federal law claim or a claim that finds its roots in a federal source.see world tanker carriers,at swiss am.bank,at.
despite the basis of their complaint,plaintiffs insist that their claims arise under federal law because the contractors removed this action pursuant to the federal officer removal statute.see a permitting federal officers and agents to remove an otherwise action to federal court by raising a federal defense.according to plaintiffs,their claims became substantively federal when the contractors asserted a federal defense in their removal petition.the problem,at least for plaintiffs,is that the supreme court decision in arizona manypenny,d,forecloses their argument.there,the court explained that the invocation of removal jurisdiction by a federal officer does not revise or alter the underlying law to be applied.id.at.section a confers a purely derivative form of jurisdiction,neither enlarging nor contracting the rights of the parties.id.hence,the contractors decision to assert a federal defense merely provides us with jurisdiction over this action.see mesa california,d section a serves to overcome the complaint rule,which would otherwise preclude removal even if a federal defense were alleged.
here,the underlying law to be applied is california state law.the only federal interest at issue the contractors eligibility for a federal defense has no bearing on plaintiffs ability to vindicate a federal right and it does not constitute an essential element of plaintiffs complaint.see cal.shock trauma air rescue state compensation ins.fund,cir.the existence of a federal defense does not transform purely claims into federally created cause s of action.see wright miller,supra,the reach of rule k is limited to substantive claims.accordingly,rule k does not apply.see manypenny,at.
as for plaintiffs allegations that atec might nonetheless have minimum contacts with california,which they assert independently of their reliance on rule k,we reject plaintiffs contention that the district court should have permitted additional jurisdictional discovery on this issue.w here a plaintiff claim of personal jurisdiction appears to be both attenuated and based on bare allegations in the face of specific denials made by the defendants,the court need not permit even limited discovery.pebble beach caddy,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here,plaintiffs fail to identify any specific facts,transactions,or conduct that would give rise to personal jurisdiction over atec in california.in light of their purely speculative allegations of attenuated jurisdictional contacts,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied plaintiffs request for further discovery.see id.
we turn now to the main issue presented in this appeal whether plaintiffs claims are barred by the government contractor defense.this defense protects government contractors from tort liability that arises as a result of the contractor compli ance with the specifications of a federal government contract.in re hanford nuclear reservation,cir see also rodriguez lockheed martin,cir describing the defense as a shield to tort liability.
the supreme court established the framework of the government contractor defense in boyle united technologies,d.there,the court explained that procurement of military equipment involves uniquely federal interests that sometimes preempt a plaintiff product liability claims against government contractors.id.at.to invoke the defense successfully,the contractor must establish three elements the united states approved reasonably precise specifications the equipment conformed to those specifications and the supplier warned the united states about the dangers in the use of the equipment that were known to the supplier but not to the united states.id.at.in their appeal,plaintiffs raise several challenges to each of these elements.
under boyle first element,a contractor must demonstrate that the government approved reasonably precise specifications.id.as we explained in snell bell helicopter textron,the government approval of a particular specification must be more than a cursory rubber stamp approving the design,cir.rather,approval must result from a continuous exchange and back and forth dialogue between the contractor and the government.butler ingalls shipbuilding,cir.when the government engages in a thorough review of the allegedly defective design and takes an active role in testing and implementing that design,boyle first element is met.id.
plaintiffs argue that the necessary specifications are lacking with respect to the following design features of the mh chinook i the engine ignition system,ii the fadecdecu,and iii the aircraft itself.
according to plaintiffs,the ignition system was defective because it was manufactured without a continuous relight function,which would have allowed the engine to restart automatically in the event of a flameout.upon careful review of the record,we are confident that the united states army approved reasonably precise specifications for this aspect of the mh ignition system,which was manufactured by honeywell.
under the terms of its contract with the army,honeywell was required to construct the mh engine pursuant to military specification av e.this provision,which is titled general specification for engines,aircraft,turboshaft,and turboprop,provides design criteria,performance expectations,and mandatory quality assurance testing for all military aircraft.among other things,the army specification includes diagrams and drawings for engine controls engine configuration requirements and tests for the engine ignition system.specification av e also required honeywell to submit a proposed complete engine specification for governmental approval.
honeywell did just that when it submitted its prime item development specifications to the army.these specifications contain numerous drawings,figures,and schematics for the engine used in the mh chinook.they also provide a detailed description of the allegedly defective ignition system.most importantly,at least for purposes of resolving this appeal,honeywell specifications explicitly state continuous duty ignition capability is not provided.hence,the specifications explicitly identify the design of the particular feature at issue and expressly observe that feature absence.see snell,at.in this sense,honeywell specifications describe,in reasonable detail,the design feature alleged to be defective.see boyle,at.
it is also clear that the army approval of this specification resulted from careful deliberation,not a rubber stamp.see snell,at.the undisputed record provides that the aviation engineering directorate which is charged with evaluating designs,performing quality assurance tests,and approving aviation equipment specifically reviewed honeywell design analyses,reports,and test plans,and attended multiple formal design meetings.members of the directorate also attested that the government was well aware of the availability of an automatic relight system,but chose to forego that technology.this type of continuous exchange and back and forth dialogue is what is necessary to demonstrate that the army exercised its judgment in approving honeywell design for the ignition system.butler,at.
we also reject the notion that the approved specifications constitute mere performance criteria,instead of design specifications.see in re haw.fed.asbestos cases,cir to qualify for the government contractor defense,approved specifications must do more than merely identify a certain level of performance.although some of the specifications identified by the parties are performance based for example,the ignition system performance specification the key specifications at issue pertain to the mh design.in particular,the provision identifying the absence of continuous ignition capability describes a particular aspect of the ignition system design,not a performance characteristic.
the army also approved reasonably precise specifications for the design of the fadec decu,which,again,is the engine control system and computer that allegedly malfunctioned immediately prior to the february crash.according to the undisputed record,goodrich the contractor directly responsible for this component provided army personnel with lengthy and detailed design specifications describing both the fadec the control system as a whole and the decu the fadec onboard computer.among other things,these specifications include complex diagrams and design drawings of the fadec,a description of fault monitoring procedures for the decu,algorithms for troubleshooting,and a system for engine fail detection.
undisputed affidavit evidence also establishes that the army carefully reviewed these specifications,scrutinized their content,and evaluated the reported test results before approving goodrich specifications.army engineers attended regular technical meetings pertaining to the fadecdecu throughout the procurement process.these engineers also issued formal requests for information pertaining to various design aspects of the fadec system and called periodic meetings to discuss and test the fuel control design,software design,and the design of the electronics that is,the decu.at one point,army engineers even rejected the fadec control system specification,insisting that goodrich address certain technical concerns.such critical and substantive review ultimately culminating in approval is the type of careful consideration necessary to demonstrate that the government made a discretionary decision when it approved the fadec decu.see butler,at.
plaintiffs present no contrary evidence.instead,they rely heavily on a single statement contained in goodrich approved specifications for the fadec decu 
specific implementations used to describe the functional requirements throughout this document are for informational understanding only.actual implementations used to meet these requirements will be at the discretion of the designer unless specifically stated otherwise.
according to plaintiffs,the government could not have exercised actual discretion over the design because that discretion was left to goodrich.there are at least two flaws in plaintiffs argument.first,the statement at issue can not reasonably be construed as a broad grant of discretion over the final product.rather,discretion was limited to implementation of the specific design requirements contained within the approved specifications and thus does not defeat the government contractor defense.see,mckay rockwell int l,cir government contractor defense may still apply if the specifications leave some discretion to the supplier in the formulation of the product design oliver oshkosh truck,cir t he fact that oshkosh may have retained some discretion to position the fuel tanks and exhaust system within the envelope permitted by the specifications,standing alone,does not defeat the government contractor defense emphasis added.second,and perhaps more importantly,the evidence discussed earlier establishes that the army carefully scrutinized,tested,and made necessary changes to the fadecdecu.this type of exchange and scrutiny is sufficient to demonstrate that the government exercised judgment in approving this product design.see butler,at.
contrary to plaintiffs view,it makes no difference,for purposes of our analysis,that a similar engine control system had previously been developed for great britain royal air force.although boyle makes the government contractor defense inapplicable when a federal procurement officer orders,by model number,a quantity of stock helicopters that happen to be equipped with a particular design feature,at,this defense does not require the government to create the design or the specifications.as long as the united states makes a significant policy judgment in approving the design,nothing precludes the government from procuring designs and products that were initially developed for other nations.id.at see also carley wheeled coach,cir i t is necessary only that the government approve,rather than create,the specifications.
if we were to hold otherwise,the potential for increased liability could dissuade contractors from providing the united states with sophisticated military equipment that they had initially designed for another nation armed forces.this ultimately would put the united states military at a competitive disadvantage either the government would be unable to obtain necessary equipment or it would be forced to pay higher prices to offset the contractor increased risk of liability.therefore,we are persuaded by the eleventh circuit recent decision in brinson raytheon,cir.there,the court imposed the government contractor defense even though the product design had been patented before it was approved by the united states air force.id.at.the court did so because it was clear that the air force carefully considered and reviewed the design prior to approval and implementation.id.boyle does not require more than this.
while they do not identify any additional defect,plaintiffs argue that the helicopter as a whole was defective.as far as we can tell,this argument is premised on the theory that boeing,which was contracted to configure the aircraft,delivered a final product containing a defective ignition system fadec decu.we reject plaintiffs argument for the reasons expressed above the government approved reasonably precise design specifications for both of these component parts.
we turn now to the second element of the government contractor defense.that element requires a defendant to establish that the product conformed with approved specifications.boyle,at.until now,we have not provided a detailed examination of this requirement.in snell,for instance,we refused to reach the conformity question because the contractor did not establish boyle first element as a matter of law.at.other circuits,however,have extensively examined the conformity element,and their analysis provides persuasive guidance.
following our sister circuits lead,we hold that the operative test for conformity with reasonably precise specifications turns on whether the alleged defect exist ed independently of the design itself.miller diamond shamrock,cir internal alteration omitted internal quotation marks omitted.to say that a product failed to conform to specifications is just another way of saying that it was defectively manufactured.harduvel dynamics,cir.therefore,absent some evidence of a latent manufacturing defect,a military contractor can establish conformity with reasonably precise specifications by showing e xtensive government involvement in the design,review,development and testing of a product and by demonstrating extensive acceptance and use of the product following production.kerstetter pac.scientific,cir.
upon careful review of the record,we conclude that the mh conformed with the approved specifications for both the ignition system and the fadec decu.the government invested years in reviewing,developing,and testing both the mh and its engine.when the finished helicopter was delivered,army officials again carefully examined the engine,inspected the aircraft component parts,conducted test flights,and administered rigorous tests and examinations to ensure conformity.army officials then executed a dd form a material inspection and receiving report for both the ignition system and the fadec decu.through that form,the army officially certified that all articles delivered were inspected and found to conform in all respects to all applicable blueprints,specifications,and standards.because plaintiffs do not present any evidence of a latent manufacturing defect that was undiscovered at the time of acceptance,the government careful scrutiny and subsequent certification of the mh provide sufficient proof of conformity.see miller,at kerstetter,at.
in an effort to overcome summary judgment,plaintiffs place great emphasis on a email addressed to the contractors.in it,an army officer expressed frustration with the contractors over their failure to provide a promised table to army personnel.apparently,this table would have measured the electrical parameters used by the decu to control the engines on the mh.the email states 
for the record,the request for the table was made because a electrical interface control document was apparently never written during the design,development,and testing of the fadec system.action item directly requested that boeing and honeywell provide the aircraft to decu and the engine to decu,respectively,contractually required to be delivered back in.we are still waiting for the sic a copy of the data delivered by either company that met that specific contractual obligation.
this email leaves unclear how the absence of a table has any bearing on whether the decu conformed with reasonably precise design specifications.see boyle,at.significantly,
