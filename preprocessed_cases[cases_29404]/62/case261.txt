factual and procedural history 
the va menlo park campus provides care for elderly,homeless,disabled,and psychologically impaired veterans.the veterans reside in numerous buildings on the campus,including building,which provides skilled nursing care for up to residents.many of the residents have severe physical and mental health care needs.
before his first visit to the campus,lawyer scott rafferty contacted va officials and obtained permission to register veterans to vote.he later visited building but was denied access to patients.he contacted va officials again,advising them of the problem he had encountered on his initial visit to building.the director of the palo alto health care system,which includes the menlo park facility,confirmed in writing that rafferty had been granted permission to register voters at the menlo park campus,provided that his actions not interrupt patient care and that he obtain the permission of the unit head nurse.
when rafferty,along with preminger and another california resident,returned to building with the intent to register voters,rafferty was wearing a john kerry button and introduced the group as being affiliated with the democratic party when approached by a va nurse.the nurse told the group that they had to leave and then called the va police.when a va police officer stopped the group in the parking lot,rafferty produced the letter from the director,authorizing him to register voters on the campus.upon seeing the letter,the police officer confirmed that they had permission to register voters and said that they should not have been denied access to building.but the group did not attempt to return to building that day.rafferty later contacted the director office.on that occasion,rafferty learned that the va had revoked his permission to register voters on the ground that the regulation precluded partisan activities on va property.
plaintiffs then filed this action,challenging on first amendment grounds the va refusal to allow them to register voters on the menlo park campus they brought both facial and challenges to the regulation and sought a preliminary injunction to prohibit the va from enforcing the regulation.
the district court denied plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction and held that it lacked jurisdiction over plaintiffs facial challenge to the regulation because the federal circuit had exclusive jurisdiction over that claim.we affirmed.preminger principi preminger i,cir.thereafter,plaintiffs filed their facial challenge in the federal circuit,and the federal circuit rejected plaintiffs facial challenge on the merits.preminger sec y of veterans affairs.
plaintiffs returned to the northern district of california.the district court held a bench trial on plaintiffs first amendment challenge to the regulation.the court concluded that the va properly characterized plaintiffs voter registration efforts as partisan activities within the meaning of the regulation and that the va application of the regulation was both reasonable and viewpoint neutral.but the district court also concluded that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the regulation and dismissed the case on that ground.plaintiffs timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
discussion 
plaintiffs have standing 
the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing consists of three elements injury in fact,causation,and likelihood that a favorable decision will redress the injury.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing standing.id.at.
an injury in fact is an invasion of a legally protected interest that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.id.at.injury in fact is particularized if it has affected the plaintiff in a personal and individualized way.id.at.the injury may be minimal.see council of ins.agents brokers,cir holding that an identifiable trifle is sufficient to establish standing quoting united states students challenging regulatory agency procedures scrap,d.
in an first amendment challenge,the plaintiff must identify some personal harm resulting from application of the challenged statute or regulation.see,foti city of menlo park,cir an challenge contends that the law is unconstitutional as applied to the litigant particular speech activity,even though the law may be capable of valid application to others.however,the question whether that harm constitutes injury in fact is entirely distinct from the question whether that harm amounts to a violation of the first amendment.the standing analysis focuses on the plaintiff and on whether harm to the plaintiff is sufficient to give him or her the requisite personal interest in a case.see jacobs clark county sch,cir discussing the requisite personal interest required for a plaintiff to have standing see also vasquez county,cir.stating that the purpose of the injury in fact prong is to ensure that there is an advocate with a sufficient personal concern to effectively litigate the matter internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.by contrast,the focus of the first amendment analysis is on the government conduct,specifically,its rationale for imposing the identified harm on the plaintiff.see,perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d identifying the varying restrictions placed on government regulation of expressive activity,depending on the forum.precisely because the test and the proof differ in those two analyses,we often have held that a party had standing to bring an first amendment claim,yet failed to establish that the government conduct violated the first amendment.see,jacobs,at,finding standing,but holding that a school uniform policy did not violate the first amendment 
here,we have no trouble concluding that preminger has direct standing to bring an first amendment challenge to the regulation.when the group asked to register veterans on the menlo park campus,the va turned back preminger personally.the harm to preminger therefore was actual,concrete,and particularized.in addition,the va caused the harm to preminger by barring him from registering voters,and a favorable decision could redress the harm by altering the va registration policy.because we conclude that preminger has direct standing to bring an challenge,we need not and do not consider whether the santa clara county democratic central committee has standing and whether either plaintiff has associational or standing.see leonard clark,cir the general rule applicable to federal court suits with multiple plaintiffs is that once the court determines that one of the plaintiffs has standing,it need not decide the standing of the others.
b.the va application of the regulation did not violate the first amendment.
plaintiffs contend that the va denial of their request to register voters in building violates their first amendment right to free expression the va justified its exclusion of plaintiffs from building under a.the regulation prohibits certain expressive activities on va grounds,including partisan activities.that term encompasses activities involving commentary or actions in support of,or in opposition to,or attempting to influence,any current policy of the government of the united states,or any private group,association,or enterprise.a ii.the va argues that this restriction on activities on va property is reasonable in light of the va mission and that plaintiffs were excluded from building for reasons.
had the district court dismissed this action before trial,we likely would have remanded the case to permit the district court to consider the merits of plaintiffs first amendment claim in the first instance.but the court held a bench trial on the claim before dismissing the action for lack of standing.consequently,there is a fully developed record for us to review.moreover,although the district court dismissed the case for lack of standing,the court also issued findings of fact and conclusions of law that address the merits of plaintiffs first amendment claim.thus,we reach the merits and hold that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the va application of the regulation to them violated the first amendment 
building is a nonpublic forum.
the parties do not dispute that voter registration is speech protected by the first amendment.but the privileges afforded by the first amendment are not absolute.see heffron int l soc y for krishna consciousness,d t he first amendment does not guarantee the right to communicate one views at all times and places or in any manner that may be desired.the extent to which the government may restrict access to a forum depends on the nature of the forum chosen by the speaker.cornelius naacp legal def.educ.fund,d perry educ.ass n,at.
fora are grouped into three categories.public fora are places such as streets and parks that traditionally have been devoted to expressive activity restrictions in public fora are justified only if they serve a compelling state interest that is narrowly tailored to the desired end.perry educ.ass n,at.designated public fora are areas that the government affirmatively has opened to expressive activity exclusion from designated public fora also must serve a compelling state interest and be narrowly tailored to that interest.id.at.nonpublic fora are areas that do not,by tradition or designation,serve as a forum for public communication restrictions in nonpublic fora need only be reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker view.id.at.
in our earlier decision in this case,we held that building is a nonpublic forum,preminger i,at,and that holding remains the law of the case.see ranchers cattlemen action legal fund dep t of,cir stating that decisions at the preliminary injunction phase generally do not constitute the law of the case,but that conclusions of law made in that context are binding.we also note that the federal circuit reached the same conclusion in deciding plaintiffs facial challenge to the regulation,holding that va medical centers,exemplified by the menlo park medical center,constitute nonpublic fora.preminger,at.that being so,the va exclusion of plaintiffs from building did not violate the first amendment if it was reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum,and viewpoint neutral.cornelius,at.
the va application of the regulation was reasonable.
a restriction on expressive conduct in a nonpublic forum must be reasonable in the light of the purpose of the forum and all the surrounding circumstances.id.at.the government must proffer more than a rational basis for the restriction the restriction must reasonably fulfill a legitimate need.sammartano first judicial dist.court,cir.but the restriction need not constitute the least restrictive alternative available.swarner united states,cir.
the district court found that the primary mission of the va menlo park facility is to provide veterans with needed health care.the federal circuit,in deciding plaintiffs facial challenge,agreed.see preminger,at the mission of the va is to provide health care and services for veterans and their families.building is a skilled nursing facility,all of whose residents have significant health care needs,including both severe mental and physical disabilities,that require ongoing medical management.the district court also found that an essential aspect of the va ability to provide quality patient care is the extent to which patients trust their caregivers.preminger does not challenge these findings,and the record fully supports them.
the va offered two reasons for excluding plaintiffs from building a concern that permitting one political party to register voters would require the va to permit all other political parties to do so,which would disrupt and interfere with patient care and a desire to prevent the appearance of partisan affiliation,which would undermine patient trust and therefore would compromise patient care.the district court ruled that the va concern that voter registration drives could compromise its ability to provide health care services to veterans was a reasonable rationale for denying plaintiffs permission to register voters in building.we agree.
in a nonpublic forum,t he first amendment does not forbid a exclusion of speakers who would disrupt a nonpublic forum and hinder its effectiveness for its intended purpose.cornelius,at.the residents of building have significant health care needs and require complex care.the va reasonably concluded that allowing one political party access to the menlo park campus would invite requests from other political parties to do the same and that supervising numerous voter registration campaigns would be difficult and,diverting resources vital to the residents treatment.in light of the facility mission to provide skilled nursing care to its patients,the va decision to exclude plaintiffs was reasonable see cornelius,at.concluding that excluding legal defense and political advocacy groups from a federal employees charity drive was reasonable in light of the drive mission and the government interest in avoiding controversy that could jeopardize the success of the charity drive.
in addition,in a nonpublic forum,the government may restrict expressive activity so as to avoid the perception of favoring one political group over another.id.at.a voiding the appearance of political favoritism is a valid justification for limiting speech in a nonpublic forum.the va reasonably concluded that allowing individuals associated with the democratic party to register voters on its campus would give the appearance of favoring the democratic party over other parties.thus,the va decision to exclude plaintiffs in order to avoid violating the trust of its patients was reasonable.see monterey county,at the postal service reasonably could conclude that its freedom from the appearance of involvement in the political process is critical to its ability to carry out its charge.
the va application of the regulation was viewpoint neutral.
at the time of the events at issue here,the va allowed the league of women voters to register voters on va property.plaintiffs contend that the league engages in partisan activity by seeking to register voters and by taking positions on public policy issues and,therefore,that the va exclusion of plaintiffs must have been motivated by the va desire to suppress the democratic party
