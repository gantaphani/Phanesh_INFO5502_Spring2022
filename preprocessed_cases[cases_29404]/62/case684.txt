background 
factual background 
abell joined the united states marine corps in four years later,he was given an honorable discharge.at the time of his discharge,he received a thirty percent disability rating for disabilities resulting from his service in the marine corps.at the present time,abell is rated as fifty percent disabled.
following his military service,abell attended college and obtained an engineering degree.he subsequently held positions with general electric government electronic systems,martin marietta overseas corporation,and lockheed martin government services.
as a result of his disabilities stemming from his service in the marine corps,abell is a preference eligible veteran entitled to preference eligible points under preference eligible veterans include veterans of service in the armed forces,or relatives thereof,who satisfy the requirements of.by statute,a preference eligible veteran,who receives a passing grade in an examination for entrance into the competitive civil service,is entitled to five or ten additional points above his or her earned rating.because abell is a disabled veteran under c,he is eligible for ten additional points under.
on august,the navy announced three vacancies for the position of general engineer at the aegis combat systems center,wallops island,virginia.the vacancy announcement stated that all united states citizens were eligible to apply,including preference eligible veterans.the announcement also stated that it was both a merit promotion and a public notice announcement.merit promotion procedures govern the placement,promotion,transfer,reassignment,and other movement of competitive service employees.public notice announcements announce vacancies to all sources.preference eligible veterans may apply to fill vacancies under merit promotion procedures when an agency accepts applications from individuals outside its own workforce.see f.the announcement stated that the navy would consider applications generally under competitive procedures and that preference eligibles would be considered under merit promotion procedures.finally,the navy announcement stated that each applicant claiming entitlement to a veterans preference had to submit a letter from the department of veterans affairs va indicating that he or she had received benefits within the last twelve months.
abell responded to the navy announcement by submitting an application for the three announced positions.with his application,abell presented a letter from the va,dated september,indicating that he was in receipt of disability compensation on account of a disability rated at thirty percent or more.the navy delegated examining unit reviewed abell application and determined that he met the basic qualifications specified in the vacancy announcement.the ranking officials then reviewed his application and determined that he was entitled to a score of points,which included a benefit for veterans preference under.abell did not receive a benefit for veterans preference because his va letter did not indicate that benefits had issued within the last twelve months.
as a result of his point score,the navy ranked abell as one of the top three candidates on a certificate of eligibles prepared in response to the announcement.based on the certificate of eligibles,the navy selected several candidates to be interviewed,including abell.after the interviews,the navy tentatively chose paul dendorfer,scott green,and larry small to fill the three vacant positions.neither dendorfer,green,nor small was employed by the navy.however,dendorfer was a preference eligible veteran with a total score equal to abell score of points.at the same time,the navy prepared a request to be submitted to the office of personnel management opm to pass over abell in favor of green,who was not a preference eligible applicant.
a eligible applicant may only be selected over a preference eligible candidate under certain circumstances.congress created a procedure for appointing authorities to use when seeking to pass over a preference eligible candidate in order to fill a vacancy with an individual who is not a preference eligible.see b.the procedure requires the appointing authority to send a request to opm,along with a statement of the reasons for the request to pass over the preference eligible candidate.id.the navy prepared a request to pass over abell in favor of green,stating reasons for the request.however,it never submitted the request to opm for review.instead,it asked management analyst marsha arrington to determine whether the request to pass over would be sustainable based on the justifications given by the navy.
upon reviewing the case file,arrington realized that one of the three identified candidates,small,did not meet the basic qualifications for the position listed in the navy announcement.that was because small did not possess a college degree in engineering,which was one of the required qualifications for applying for the vacant positions.as far as the request to pass over was concerned,arrington offered four alternatives to the navy.first,she stated that the navy could change the scores and ranks of the candidates based on their interviews second,she stated that the navy could select abell third,she stated that the navy could cancel the vacancy and readvertise it and finally,she stated that the navy could apply to opm for passover authority.with respect to the final option,arrington stated that it would not be an easy task since the ranking was done by a navsea subject matter expert and since it is now a prohibited personnel practice to take any action that would violate veterans preference.emphasis in original 
the navy replaced small selection with the selection of an internal candidate,leslie martin,who was a electronic engineer with the navy.effective july,the navy promoted martin to a general engineer position,thereby filling one of the three vacancies under merit promotion authority.ultimately,dendorfer was selected from the delegated examining open competitive certificate to fill the second of the three vacancies.because dendorfer was a preference eligible,the navy could select him over abell without requesting passover authority from opm.rather than making a third selection by passing over abell,the navy cancelled the last vacancy announcement.as a result of this process,abell was not selected.
