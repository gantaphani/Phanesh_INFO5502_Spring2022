background 
beginning in august,lovely was a student at ud and an rotc cadet with an rotc scholarship to ud.in the summer of,lieutenant colonel versalle washington became the professor of military science and chair of the department of military science at ud.as professor of military science,washington was the rotc battalion commander at ud,with responsibility for training cadets so that they may attain commission as army officers.as lovely rotc contract states,the sole purpose of the rotc scholarship program is to produce officers for the united states army.record on appeal roa at contract at.the contract sets forth the financial terms of lovely scholarship,under which the government agreed to pay lovely tuition,educational fees,and textbooks for three years,as well as a subsistence allowance and pay during certain periods.the contract also specifies that lovely education was to be completed in may and that lovely agreed to r emain a student at ud until receiving his degree.roa at contract at.lovely also agreed to m aintain eligibility for enrollment in rotc,enlistment in the usar,and commissioning,as defined by statute,army regulation,and this contract,throughout the period of this contract.id.if lovely failed to complete the educational requirements or other terms of the contract or committed misconduct,he could either be ordered to active duty or instead be required to reimburse the united states for his educational costs paid under the contract.
in december,mark ensalaco,director of the department of international studies at ud,discovered that lovely had plagiarized a research paper for one of ensalaco courses.at that time,ensalaco orally told washington of the plagiarism and offered to prepare for washington a written statement about the plagiarism.it does not appear that washington took ensalaco up on the offer at that time.
in january,a female cadet reported to washington that lovely had sexually assaulted her in september.she declined to press criminal charges,but accepted washington recommendation that she see a counselor at ud counseling center.upon the advice of carol at the counseling center,the female cadet decided to pursue proceedings against lovely through the ud disciplinary board.a ud hearing was scheduled for february.the female cadet asked washington if he would testify for her at the hearing,but he declined.the female cadet,however,already knew of lovely plagiarism and asked washington to obtain a statement about the plagiarism from ensalaco so that she could use it at the hearing to discredit lovely.washington contacted ensalaco and asked him to send washington the previously offered statement.the day before the hearing,ensalaco sent washington an email describing the plagiarism incident,and washington then printed the email and gave a copy to the female cadet.the female cadet presented the statement to the ud disciplinary board at the february hearing.after the hearing,lovely asked washington about the email,and washington confirmed that he had requested the statement from ensalaco and had given the email to the female cadet at her request.lovely also asked ensalaco how the female cadet received the document,and ensalaco stated that he sent the email to washington at washington request.
the board found that lovely engaged in sexual intercourse with the female cadet.roa at lovely aff.at.the ud judicial review committee denied lovely subsequent appeal,and he was suspended on march.
in his complaint,lovely makes several allegations that washington took other actions against lovely in relation to the hearing.lovely alleges that washington told other rotc cadets that lovely had admitted at the hearing that he had sexually assaulted the female cadet.lovely also alleges that washington told other cadets that they should support the female cadet and that washington intimidated one of lovely witnesses so that the witness did not testify at the hearing.
after the ud disciplinary proceedings,washington initiated proceedings to remove lovely from the rotc program.lovely claims that washington improperly inserted himself into these proceedings by,for example,rejecting the suggestion of the ud dean of students that disenrollment could be prevented and insisting on proceeding with disenrollment using ud documents as supporting evidence.lovely eventually was disenrolled from rotc for misconduct,preventing any eligibility to.lovely also had to repay the rotc scholarship money that he had been awarded.
lovely filed a claim for damages with the army,which was denied,primarily on the basis that feres precluded lovely,who was enlisted in the army at the time of the alleged injury,from recovering for an injury incident to service.on june,lovely filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio asserting a claim based on violation of the privacy act.lovely then filed an amended complaint on november,adding his iied claim under the ftca.the amended complaint alleged that lovely suffered economic damages,including loss of his college funding and other earnings,and mental,emotional,and psychological damages,such as loss of reputation,depression,and humiliation.the government filed a motion to dismiss the privacy act claim,and later a motion to dismiss the iied claim under rules b and b of the federal rules of civil procedure,arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction due to the feres doctrine and that lovely complaint failed to state a claim.on march,the district court entered a decision granting the government motion to dismiss both claims.the district court dismissed the iied claim on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction as a result of the feres doctrine because lovely alleged injuries arose out of or were in the course of activity incident to military service.lovely now appeals the district court dismissal of his iied claim.
