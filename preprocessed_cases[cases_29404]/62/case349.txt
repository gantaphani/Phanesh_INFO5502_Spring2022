appellant,a member of the vermont army national guard,sued the department of the army,claiming that the vermont army national guard released his personal information in violation of the privacy act.the parties agree that the privacy act protects state guardsmen while on active federal duty.appellant,however,was not on active federal duty at the time his personal information was released.for the reasons set forth below,we hold that the privacy act protects guardsmen even when they are not on active federal duty.
though organized in part through the states,the national guard functions as an integral part of the first line defenses of the united states.its organization stems from article i,section of the constitution,which gives congress authority t o provide for organizing,arming,and disciplining,the militia,and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the united states,reserving to the states respectively,the appointment of the officers,and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by congress.const.art.i.through the department of defense national guard bureau,the department of the army extends federal recognition to state national guard units that comply with federal criteria it may withdraw recognition if a unit ceases to comply.these state national guard units are known as the army national guard.together,all federally recognized state units comprise one of the reserve components of the army,known as the army national guard of the united states.as the supreme court has explained,t he federal government provides virtually all of the funding,the materiel,and the leadership for the state guard units.perpich dep t of,d.although states are responsible for training the army national guard and rely on their units under gubernatorial command to respond to local emergencies,perpich,at,such training must conform to regulations prescribed by the secretary of the army.the national guard thus plays a dual role,operating under joint federal and state control.
the privacy act,which covers agenc ies including military department s,f,a,safeguards the public from unwarranted collection,maintenance,use and dissemination of personal information contained in agency records.bartel faa.the act protects private information from unnecessary disclosure and enables individuals to correct errors in their files.b,d.at issue here are the act provisions.
appellant,a member of the vermont army national guard,brought a privacy act suit against the department of the army,alleging that a civilian national guard employee and other persons had improperly disclosed appellant highly sensitive personal information,causing him emotional,psychological,and financial harm.although not disputing appellant assertion that the vermont army national guard is federally recognized,the department moved to dismiss,arguing that the vermont army national guard is not an agency subject to the privacy act.the district court,though recognizing that members of state army national guard units are simultaneously members of the army national guard of the united states,nonetheless held that the army national guard is an agency subject to the privacy act only when on active federal duty.because the vermont army national guard was not on active federal duty at the time of the alleged disclosure,the court granted the motion to dismiss.

although the national guard dual status has been described as murky and mystical,bowen united states,this case presents a straightforward question of statutory interpretation does the privacy act definition of agency extend to national guard units only when on active federal duty answering yes,the department emphasizes the level of state control over national guard units when not on active federal duty.we agree with appellant,however,that under the plain language of the relevant statutes,the privacy act definition of agency includes federally recognized national guard units at all times.
the privacy act adopts the freedom of information act foia definition of agency.a see also dong smithsonian.under foia,the term agency includes any military department.f.accordingly,we must determine whether the vermont army national guard is part of a military department.the code clearly answers this question in the affirmative.
section of title defines military department to include all reserve components under the control or supervision of the secretary of the department.a.as the department concedes,appellee br,the army national guard of the united states is one of those reserve components.section,in turn,provides that the army national guard of the united states consists of,in part,federally recognized units and organizations of the army national guard.given that the government nowhere disputes appellant assertion that the vermont army national guard is federally recognized,the privacy act applies.put another way,because it is undisputed that the vermont army national guard enjoys federal recognition,it is part of the army national guard of the united states,which is a reserve component,which is part of the military department of the army,which is included in the privacy act definition of agency.although it takes several steps to reach this conclusion,the result is clear.
at oral argument,department counsel acknowledged the accuracy of each of these steps in the logical chain,conceding that the vermont army national guard is always part of the army national guard of the united states even when not on active federal duty.oral arg.at.the department nonetheless seeks to break the chain by relying primarily on two other provisions and.
section says,the army national guard while in the service of the united states is a component of the army.according to the department,this provision means that the vermont army national guard is part of a military department and thus subject to the privacy act only while in the service of the united states.section,however,says nothing about a state national guard unit status when not in the service of the united states,nor does it remove state guard units from their continuing status as part of the army national guard of the united states.rather,section addresses one of the two ways in which army national guard units may be called into active federal service.first,state guard units may be ordered to active federal duty as reserves of the army through the army national guard of the united states,in which case the army national guard of the united states,always a reserve component of the army,provides the status under which the guard units serve.second,in three specific circumstances,guard units may be called up directly into federal service from their state militia president may call into federal service members and units of the national guard of any state in case of invasion,rebellion,or an inability to execute the laws of the united states with regular forces.see also perpich,at.describing the distinct statutes for activating the national guard of the united states and for calling forth the national guards of the various states.section,which like section refers to the national guard,not the national guard of the united states,addresses the status of guard units called up in these three specific circumstances.in such circumstances,because the guard units do not serve as part of an already existing reserve component the army national guard of the united states,they require some other component status.section fills this gap,providing that the army national guard becomes its own component of the army when called up in this capacity.in other words,section establishes that when the army national guard,as such,is called directly into federal service as opposed to when activated through the army national guard of the united states,it constitutes a separate component of the army rather than serving as an activated reserve of the army.section therefore in no way undermines our view that the vermont army national guard is part of a reserve component and thus of a military department regardless of federal duty status.
section is no more helpful to the department.it provides that w hen not on active duty,members of the army national guard of the united states shall be administered,armed,equipped,and trained in their status as members of the army national guard.as its plain language indicates,section addresses the status of individual servicemen,not the status of state army national guard units within the military department.because the privacy act applies to agencies,not individuals,our concern here is with the organizational status of national guard units,meaning that section has nothing to do with the issue before us.see martinez bureau of prisons,dismissing privacy act and foia claims against individuals because b oth statutes concern the obligations of agencies as distinct from individual employees in those agencies.in any event,nothing in section strips activated guardsmen of their membership in the army national guard of the united states,nor could it.under title,a person who enlists in the army national guard shall be concurrently enlisted as a reserve of the army for service in the army national guard of the united states.b.indeed,by its terms section confirms that activated guardsmen remain members of the army national guard of the united states.
we read sections and as demonstrating that what changes when the vermont army national guard passes in and out of active federal duty is the chain of command,not the guard status as an agency under the privacy act.when called into federal service under section,the army national guard,as a component of the army,operates under the direct command of the secretary of the army.even when not serving in this capacity,however,guard units remain part of the army national guard of the united states,a reserve component that is itself under the control and supervision of the secretary.similarly,although when not federally activated as reserves of the army under section,guardsmen regain state status and report directly to the governor,their guard unit nonetheless retains its status as part of the army national guard of the united states.
in sum,neither section nor section deprives the army national guard of its continuous status as part of the army national guard of the united states.that can occur only if the secretary withdraws the army national guard federal recognition.see also nelson geringer,cir interpreting analogous provisions under title applicable to the air national guard of the united states and holding that e ven when the guard is not federally activated the wyoming air and army national guard units remain reserve components of the united states air force and army respectively,and most if not all functions performed by the state are subject to federal requirements and regulations.as long as the secretary has not withdrawn the vermont army national guard federal recognition,it is part of an agency for purposes of the privacy act whether or not federally activated.
we think it worth noting that the department own regulations and interpretation of the privacy act treat the act as applicable to the national guard without regard to federal duty status.army regulation,issued pursuant to the privacy act,sets forth the army privacy program and applies to the active army,the army national guard,the army reserve,and the army and air force exchange service.dep t of the army,reg,the army privacy program i,available at.mil usapa epubs pdf r.pdf emphasis added see also dep t of the army,reg,the department of the army freedom of information act program i,available at containing identical language applying foia regulations to the national guard.even more revealing,because the privacy act generally requires agencies to obtain written consent for and to keep an accounting of disclosures of information outside the agency,b,c,if the national guard and the army were not part of the same agency,the army would have to obtain consent and provide an accounting virtually every time it shared records with a national guard unit.the department,however,has never interpreted the privacy act as requiring such action.according to an advisory opinion entitled applicability of the privacy act to national guard records issued by the defense department defense privacy board,which oversees implementation of the privacy program,a i,the national guard and the army are part of the same agency for privacy act purposes.because its analysis is particularly compelling,we quote the relevant section of the opinion in full 
reserve components of the army and the air force include the army and air national guards of the united states respectively,which are composed of federally recognized units and organizations of the army or air national guard and members of the army or air national guard who are also reserves of the army or air force.and now and.requires the departments of the army and the air force to maintain personnel records on all members of the federally recognized units and organizations of the army and air national guards and on all members of the army or air national guards who are also reserves of the army and air force.such records are maintained by the army or air force for the purposes of the privacy act.these records are not all located at the national guard bureau.some are in the physical possession of the state adjutant general.however,records need not be physically located in the agency for them to be maintained by the agency.see omb guidelines.records located at the state level are under the direct control of the army and air force in that they are maintained by the state under regulations ngr and afr implementing,and promulgated by authority of the secretaries of the army and the air force under.therefore,the records are army or air force records and subject to the provisions of the privacy act.
that the records are subject to the privacy act does not mean they can not be used by the members of the state national guards.the state officials using and maintaining the records are members of the reserves members of the army or air force national guard of the united states.disclosure to them in performance of their duties is disclosure within the department of defense not requiring a published routine use or an accounting.
defense privacy board,dep t of,advisory opinion,applicability of the privacy act to national guard records emphasis added,available at.based on the same straightforward statutory interpretation we adopt here,then,the department itself has concluded that the members of the national guard and the army are part of the same agency for privacy act purposes.
although finding this statutory analysis alluring,the district court ultimately rejected it given the substantial body of case law that has explained the national guard hybrid status.in re sealed case,slip op.at may.in particular,the district court relied on perpich department of defense,in which the supreme court held that nothing in the militia clauses requires gubernatorial consent to congress calling up the national guard for training outside the united states.at.in reaching that conclusion,the court noted that all guardsmen enlist simultaneously in both the national guard and the national guard of the united states,id.at,and that a member of the guard who is ordered to active duty in the federal service is thereby relieved of his or her status in the state guard for the entire period of federal service,id.at.although perpich thus stands for the proposition that federally activated guardsmen temporarily lose their state national guard status,nothing in the decision holding severs the continuous link between the army national guard of the united states and federally recognized units of the army national guard when not on active federal service.see also matreale dep t of military veterans affairs,cir interpreting perpich as holding only that a guardsman loses state status while on federal duty,not that a guardsman loses federal status when deactivated.moreover,perpich does not involve the privacy act,and as we demonstrated above,the privacy act is clear national guard units,whether activated or not,are part of an agency.nor do the other appellate decisions the district court
