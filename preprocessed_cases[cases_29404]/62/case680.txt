donald wagner wagner appeals from the judgment of the united states court of federal claims,which held that the decision of the army board for correction of military records abcmr was not arbitrary,capricious,contrary to law,or unsupported by substantial evidence.wagner united states.the abcmr explained that,although wagner discharge violated army regulation ar h,any resulting error was harmless.because we are unable to ascertain whether the army violation of its regulation was harmless,we reverse and remand.
background 
wagner was an officer in the united states army reserve.in june of,he was arraigned,tried,and convicted by of making a false official statement and of conduct unbecoming an officer.he was sentenced to a punitive reprimand and forfeiture of per month,but was not discharged.on july,the army notified wagner that the department of the army active duty board daadb intended to consider him for release from active duty on account of the.at the time he was notified,the army reserve personnel center listed january,as the date wagner would achieve eighteen years of active federal service.
the army provides the procedure for involuntarily releasing reserve component officers from active duty in ar.where involuntary release proceedings under ar involve an officer who will have more than eighteen years of active federal service on the date scheduled for release from active duty,the regulation requires of the proceedings by the secretary of the army.see ar,h an officer who will complete or more years of active federal service on his or her scheduled release date will not be processed under this section,unless such action is approved by the secretary of the army.see also.the july notice from the army reserve command to wagner informing him of the pending daadb proceedings indicated that he would be processed under the discharge procedures applying to officers with less than eighteen years of active federal service.at the time the army reserve command sent the notice,it believed wagner would achieve eighteen years of active federal service on january.
on august,wagner filed a request with the army reserves personnel center personnel center to update his records to reflect an additional days of active federal service.his request was granted and,on november,the personnel center notified wagner that he had achieved eighteen years of active federal service as of that day.the personnel center did not,however,notify the individual processing the pending daadb action against wagner.consequently,separation proceedings continued.on december,the daadb recommended that wagner be released from active duty for misconduct or moral or professional dereliction with an under other than honorable conditions characterization of service.the principal deputy assistant secretary of the army approved the daadb recommendation,as required by ar,k,on december.the personnel center notified wagner of the daadb decision on december.
after notifying wagner of the daadb decision,the army learned that wagner had achieved eighteen years of active federal service prior to the daadb decision and that the approval of the secretary of the army had been required under ar,h,prior to processing wagner.in an attempt to rectify the problem,the army belatedly sought approval from the assistant secretary of the army for manpower and reserve affairs to discharge wagner from active duty.on january,the acting assistant secretary retroactively approved wagner release from active duty.wagner was officially released on april.
wagner sought correction of his military records from the abcmr on april.the abcmr is a statutory review board composed of civilians for the purpose of correcting errors in the official records of military personnel.ar.the abcmr may order the correction of the records of military personnel if the applicant proves the existence of an error or injustice by a preponderance of the evidence.ar.
before the abcmr,wagner argued that,because the daadb did not obtain prior approval from the secretary as required by ar h,his release from active duty was contrary to law,arbitrary,and capricious.as relief for the procedural error,wagner requested that the decision of the daadb be set aside and that he be reinstated to active duty with all the back pay and benefits to which reinstatement would entitle him the abcmr denied wagner request,stating that it believed that the secretary of the army would have initially authorized elimination proceedings regardless of the applicant years of service 
following the abcmr decision,wagner filed a motion for judgment on the agency record in the court of federal claims,seeking monetary relief for back pay and allowances under pay and allowances of the uniformed services.the army filed a,also for judgment on the agency record.the court of federal claims accepted the abcmr finding that wagner discharge violated ar by not obtaining prior approval from the secretary.the court further found that,although the abcmr failed to substantiate its conclusion that the secretary would have authorized the proceeding,wagner had failed to carry his burden of showing clearly and convincingly that the abcmr decision was arbitrary,capricious,contrary to law or regulation,or unsupported by substantial evidence.
the court of federal claims premised its decision on three justifications.first,although the abcmr provided no support for its conclusion that the secretary would have approved wagner discharge,the court found that the retroactive endorsement of the proceeding by the acting assistant secretary was strong evidence that the secretary would have approved wagner discharge proceedings if asked beforehand as required by regulation.second,a senior army legal advisor believed that the approval by the acting assistant secretary cured any procedural error resulting from the failure to follow the regulation.finally,the court disagreed with wagner that the abcmr conclusion was based on pure speculation over what the secretary would have done if the regulation had been followed,as the approval by the acting assistant secretary supported the abcmr conclusion.accordingly,the court of federal claims denied wagner motion and granted the army for judgment on the agency record.we have jurisdiction of this appeal pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
the court of federal claims applies the same standard in deciding a motion for judgment on the agency record as it would in deciding a motion for summary judgment.rose united states,fed.cl.therefore,judgment on the agency record is only appropriate when there are no issues of material fact and when one party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see also banknote of am.united states.april.we review such decisions by the court of federal claims without deference,applying the same standard of review that the court of federal claims applied.accordingly,we will not disturb the decision of the corrections board unless it is arbitrary,capricious,contrary to law,or unsupported by substantial evidence.haselrig united states.
we begin with the initial premise that an agency is bound by its own regulations.service dulles,d see also carmichael united states,voge united states,it has long been established that government officials must follow their own regulations,even if they were not compelled to have them at all.in service,the supreme court reversed the secretary of state exercise of his statutorily authorized discretion to dismiss employees with questionable loyalty where the secretary had exercised that authority in violation of regulatory constraints in excess of statutory requirements.at.the decision in service requiring an agency to comply with its regulations,however,does not end our inquiry,as strict compliance with procedural requirements is not required where the error is deemed harmless.see gratehouse united states,exceptions are made to the rule of service dulles where the procedural error is deemed harmless.see also carmichael,at remanding for a determination on whether the navy would have discharged a serviceman even if it had followed proper procedures sargisson united states,finding harmless error in a procedural violation where there was no risk of prejudice to the serviceman due to the violation.
our decisions regarding harmless error and civilian correction boards consist of two lines of cases,clearly summarized by this court opinion in porter united states.the first line of cases involves substantive errors contained in a serviceman military record,and explains that a civilian correction board should review the impact of errors in a military record on a serviceman failure to be promoted for harmless error see sanders united states,engels united states,see also porter,at.sanders was an air force officer whose military records contained inaccurate officer effectiveness reports and,consequently,was twice passed over for promotion and discharged.when the correction board denied sanders request for correction of his records and reinstatement with back pay,sanders sought relief in the court of claims.the court of claims explained that the correction board did not need to order his reinstatement if it determined that the error in his military records was harmless,that substantial evidence show ed that it was unlikely that the officer would have been promoted in any event.sanders,at.
in engels,the court of claims again endorsed harmless error review for erroneous service records.geoffrey engels,like sanders,was an officer in the air force when he was twice passed over for promotion by selection boards.engels,at.the court of claims described a process for review.id.at.first,the officer must show the existence of legal error.id.second,the officer must demonstrate a prima facie showing of a causal nexus between the error and the result reached.id.applying this test itself,the court of claims found that engels had successfully demonstrated that the error in his records was not harmless and ordered his reinstatement.id.at.
the second line of cases involves procedural errors regarding the composition of military selection boards and holds that,in these instances,harmless error review is inapplicable.see doyle united states,evensen united states,see also porter,at.the discharged army reserve officers in doyle asserted not an error with their military records,but a flaw in the composition of the board constituted to evaluate their records for promotion purposes.doyle,at.by statute,promotion boards were required to have a certain number of reserve officers when making promotion decisions regarding other reserve officers.the promotion boards that passed over the reserve officers in doyle contained no reserve officers.when the civilian correction board rejected as harmless the faulty promotion board composition and,consequently,the officers requests to have the passover decisions purged from their records and to be reconsidered for promotion,the officers sought relief in the court of claims.unlike sanders,however,the court of claims rejected the idea that a civilian correction board could review a defect in promotion board composition for harmless error and required reinstatement and reconsideration of the officers records.id.at.
the court of claims in evensen united states also ordered reinstatement of an officer in the united states army due to defective composition of a review board.at.ronald evensen was passed over twice for promotion,once in and again in.he sought and received correction of his records and review by a standby advisory board stab,which declined to recommend him on the corrected record.id.at.the stab,however,consisted of five officers,all of whom had been on the review board that refused to recommend promotion for evensen.id.because,by statute,officers were precluded from serving on consecutive boards reviewing the record of the same candidate for promotion,the court of claims,citing doyle,voided the passover decision and ordered backpay and retirement benefits to evensen.id.at.
our decisions on harmless error review and civilian review boards do not stray significantly from the circumstances present in these two lines of cases,and the situation here does not neatly match the facts of either.wagner urges us to find that this situation falls within the doyle line of cases,and that the procedural error was per se harmful.the government naturally disagrees,and argues that,before we may exclude this error from the purview of harmless error review,we must find that the error is fundamental.in making this assertion,the government cites the court of claims in doyle,which described the error in that case as penetrat ing to the heart of the process congress deemed necessary for fair judgment in selecting officers for promotion.doyle,at see also porter,at instances of fundamental error,at least those affecting the composition of the deciding body,are not susceptible to review under the harmless error test.
the passage from doyle quoted by the government is the conclusion of the court of claims based on the situation before it,which,as explained,does not exactly apply to this case.the reasoning underlying the court conclusion,however,is instructive.the court in doyle articulated two justifications for refusing to apply the harmless error rule avoiding the erosion of essential components of a fair trial and the inability of a reviewing body to assess the magnitude of the error.doyle,at.in evensen,the court of claims reaffirmed the importance of the second justification,explaining that in cases where the effect of the error is incapable of evaluation,harmless error review is inappropriate.at.the court in evensen also explained that fundamental errors are not limited to statutory procedural error,but may also result from violations of regulations and even internal operating procedures.see id.at.
the supreme court has drawn similar distinctions to those reflected in our sanders and doyle case lines.in arizona fulminante,the court explained,
the common thread connecting these harmless error cases is that each involved trial error error which occurred during the presentation of the case to the jury,and which may therefore be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
d.like the erroneous officer effectiveness reports in sanders,the impact of these trial errors could be assessed by an independent reviewing body.in contrast,the court described the cases in which it rejected harmless error review as those involving structural defects in the constitution of the trial mechanism,which defy analysis by standards.id.at.again,like the defective board compositions in doyle,the effect of these errors is not quantifiable and is therefore incapable of review.
beginning with the first justification premised by the court of claims in doyle for not engaging in harmless error review,the essentiality of the secretary preapproval to the overall scheme of the involuntary release procedures of ar is unclear.on one hand,although the secretary approval is required by statute,a,it is required only before the release of a reserve component officer.the statute does not require approval prior to the commencement of daadb proceedings,although the regulations do.as explained,however,that secretarial preapproval is not statutorily required does not address the propriety of harmless error review.voge,at evensen,at.on the other hand,we note that the regulatory scheme is arranged to give the secretary of the army unconditional control over daadb proceedings involving reserve component servicemen with greater than eighteen years of active federal service had the secretary decided against daadb proceedings in wagner case,there is no question the outcome would have been different 
although the first justification for refusing to review the abcmr decision for harmless error is inconclusive,the second is not.the nature of the procedural error involved requires our conclusion that harmless error review is inappropriate in this case,as the magnitude of the effect of the error on the proceeding defies assessment by a reviewing body.the regulations provide the secretary with unbridled discretion over daadb proceedings involving individuals with wagner years of active federal service.
