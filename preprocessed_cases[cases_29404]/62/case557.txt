order on petition for rehearing 
steven preminger has petitioned for rehearing of the court august,decision in preminger secretary of veterans affairs,fed cir.in that decision,we rejected preminger facial challenge to the constitutional validity of a,a department of veterans affairs va regulation that prohibits visitors to va property from engaging in unauthorized demonstrations,which the regulation defines to include partisan activities.in doing so,we concluded that the fora at medical nonpublic in nature,and that the restrictions on partisan activities imposed by section a are both reasonable and viewpoint neutral.in addition,we noted that many of preminger arguments related to his challenge to section a,which remains pending in the united states district court for the northern district of california.preminger principi,wl.filed may.
in his petition for rehearing,preminger argues that the panel erred in several respects.first,he argues that we erred in rejecting as untimely his administrative procedure act apa challenge to the promulgation of section a.turning to his constitutional challenge,he argues that we erred in classifying va medical centers as nonpublic fora,and in rejecting his contention that the regulation is vague,overbroad,and not viewpoint neutral.finally,preminger argues that we erred in concluding that the amount of discretion that section a provides to va officials in determining whether to authorize partisan activities is reasonable.
we deny rehearing with respect to all of these issues except for preminger contention that section a grants excessive discretion to the.on that issue,preminger argues that the regulation does not set forth sufficient standards to guide the va exercise of discretion in determining whether to authorize or refuse to authorize partisan activities.preminger essentially argues that,because the regulation does not set forth adequate standards,va officials possess unbridled discretion to withhold authorization for any reason at all,including viewpoint discrimination.preminger contends that the lack of adequate standards in section a therefore causes the regulation to violate the first amendment on its face.
in our initial opinion,we considered whether the amount of discretion that section a provides to the va is reasonable in light of the function and character of the nonpublic va medical centers.preminger,at.we determined that t he va must be able to maintain a place of healing and rehabilitation for the veterans for which it provides services.id.at.to that end,we concluded that the va must ultimately have the discretion to determine whether any particular demonstration defined to include partisan activities would be disruptive to the va mission.id.at.we stated a s part of the exercise of its discretion,the va must be able to decide when its mission would be compromised to a level that counsels against granting the request to conduct a demonstration.id.at.
we grant preminger petition for rehearing for the limited purpose of explaining in further detail our conclusion that section a does not grant unbridled discretion to the.as the attached opinion makes clear,we think that the regulation sets forth specific,objective standards to guide the va exercise of discretion.we thus see little risk that the va will be able to use the regulation to engage in undetectable viewpoint discrimination.accordingly,we decline to hold section a facially invalid as a regulation granting unbridled discretion to restrict speech.accordingly,
it is ordered that 
the petition for rehearing is granted for the limited purpose of explaining in further detail the panel conclusion that section a does not grant unbridled discretion to the.our prior opinion,dated august,is hereby withdrawn,and the opinion attached to this order is substituted in its place.
in all other respects,the petition for rehearing is denied.
petitioner steven preminger brings a constitutional challenge to the validity of a,a regulation promulgated by the department of veterans affairs va he does so pursuant to,which gives this court authority to review rulemaking by the.
section a governs the conduct of visitors on property under the charge and control of the.among other things,it prohibits visitors to va property from engaging in demonstrations unless authorized by the head of the facility involved.id.a i.the regulation defines unauthorized demonstrations to include partisan activities,those involving commentary or actions in support of,or in opposition to,or attempting to influence,any current policy of the government of the united states,or any private group,association,or enterprise.id.a ii.preminger challenges section a on two grounds.first,he argues that,in promulgating the regulation,the secretary of the va secretary exceeded his statutory authority and failed to engage in required notice and comment rulemaking.second,he argues that the regulation on its face violates the first amendment to the united states constitution.for the reasons set forth below,we reject preminger challenge to the promulgation of section a.in addition,we hold that section a does not on its face violate the first amendment.we therefore deny preminger petition to invalidate the regulation.
background 
preminger is the chairman of the santa clara county,california,democratic central committee sccdcc.he wishes to register to vote veterans who reside at the va menlo park,california,medical center menlo park medical center or medical center.
in april of,preminger,his attorney scott rafferty,and another individual,visited building at the menlo park medical center,intending to register voters.however,when preminger party visited building,a va employee told the party to leave,which it did.
after being turned away from the medical center,preminger,along with the sccdcc,filed suit in the united states district court for the northern district of california,seeking an injunction against enforcement of section a.in the suit,preminger claimed,inter alia,that section a violates the first amendment,both as applied to him and on its face.preminger principi,cir.after filing suit,preminger moved for a preliminary injunction to prohibit enforcement of the regulation.id.the district court denied the motion insofar as it related to preminger challenge,finding that preminger had not met his burden of showing a likelihood of success on the merits.id.as far as the facial challenge was concerned,the district court held that only this court has jurisdiction over such a challenge.id.at.
preminger appealed the denial of his motion for a preliminary injunction to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit.on august,the ninth circuit affirmed the ruling of the district court that preminger had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits with respect to his challenge.id.at.the circuit court also affirmed the district court ruling that it lacked jurisdiction over preminger facial challenge to section a.id.at.on october,preminger section petition was docketed in this court.his challenge to section a remains pending in the district court.
discussion 
pursuant to,we have jurisdiction to directly review the validity of both the rulemaking process and the challenged rules of the disabled am.veterans gober.in pertinent part,section states 
an action of the secretary to which section a or of title or both refers other than an action relating to the adoption or revision of the schedule of ratings for disabilities adopted under section of this title is subject to judicial review.such review shall be in accordance with chapter of title and may be sought only in the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
therefore,our review is in accordance with chapter of the administrative procedure act apa,which directs us to hold unlawful and set aside any agency action that is contrary to constitutional right,power,privilege,or immunity.b.in his petition pursuant to section,preminger asserts that,in promulgating section a,the secretary exceeded his authority and failed to comply with the requirements of notice and comment rulemaking.in addition,he argues that the regulation is unconstitutional on its face because it violates the first amendment.we address the former contentions first.
preminger contends that when section a was promulgated,the secretary exceeded his statutory authority.section a was promulgated pursuant to,which gives the secretary authority to prescribe regulations to provide for the maintenance of law and order and the protection of persons and property on department property.preminger argues that section a covers the content of private speech,and therefore is not within the scope of the statutory authority to maintain law and order or to protect persons and property.preminger further argues that congress does not have the authority to grant the secretary the authority to violate the first amendment,which he asserts section a does.the government responds that the regulation is within the secretary authority.
we reject preminger argument.we agree,of course,that congress can not authorize,nor can the va promulgate,a regulation that violates the constitution,and we address,in part iii,infra,whether section a does violate the first amendment.assuming for present purposes that the regulation is constitutional,we agree with the government that its promulgation was within the secretary statutory authority.
as early as february of,the secretary promulgated predecessors to a,conduct and ceremonies,veterans administration cemeteries,and in september of,the secretary promulgated another version of the regulation,which provided in relevant part 
for the purpose of the prohibition expressed in this paragraph unauthorized demonstrations or services shall be defined as,but not limited to,partisan activities which may be described as commentary or actions in support of,or in opposition to,or attempting to influence,any current policy of the government of the united states,or any private group,association,or enterprise.
in,section gave the secretary the power to make all needful rules and regulations for the governing of the property under his charge and control.national cemeteries act of,stat,codified as amended at.as seen,the present version of section gives the secretary authority to prescribe regulations to provide for the maintenance of law and order and the protection of persons and property on department property.we think both versions of section make it clear that congress wanted the va to have the ability to ensure that the activities of visitors to va property not be disruptive of the va mission to provide services to veterans.see,va palo alto health care system.palo alto.med.gov mission.asp mission statement honor america veterans by providing exceptional health care that improves their health and.last visited june.assuming its constitutionality,section a,which prohibits unauthorized demonstrations,is plainly within section grant of authority.
preminger next argues that section a is invalid because it has never been subjected to a notice and comment rulemaking process.see farrell dep t of interior,if an agency policy statement is intended to impose obligations or to limit the rights of members of the public,it is subject to the administrative procedure act,and,with certain exceptions,must be published in the federal register as a regulation.if it is not,it is invalid.citation omitted.the va failure to subject section a to notice and comment,preminger contends,is a continuing violation of the apa.
the government responds that preminger apa challenge is untimely.according to the government,an apa claim such as preminger is subject to the statute of limitations of a.section a provides that every civil action against the united states shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues.the government contends this includes causes of action under the apa.further,the government asserts,a cause of action seeking judicial review under the apa accrues at the time of final agency action.the government therefore reasons that because the secretary promulgated section a in september of,see.at,and amended it in july of,see,july,the statute of limitations lapsed at the latest in july,over fifteen years before the petition was filed in this case.
we agree with the government that preminger procedural challenge to the process of a is.our sister circuits have held that actions for judicial review under the apa are subject to the statute of limitations in a.see,nagahi ins,cir in the absence of a specific statutory limitations period,a civil action against the united states under the apa is subject to the six year limitations period found in a.instituto de educacion universal dep t of energy,cir the notice of appeal was docketed on march,well within the period allowed for seeking judicial review of the secretary final orders.jersey heights neighborhood ass glendening,cir a complaint under the apa for review of an agency action is a civil action within the meaning of section a.quoting sierra club slater,cir slater,at same sierra club penfold,cir as a general statute of limitation,section a should apply to actions brought under the apa which challenge a regulation on the basis of procedural irregularity.
like the apa,section does not contain its own statute of limitations.we hold that the statute of limitations in section applies to actions under section.we think this makes sense because,as seen,section calls for review of va rulemaking under the standards of the apa.at the same time,we reject preminger argument that the original failure to engage in notice and comment rulemaking with respect to the regulation represents a continuing violation of the apa.the government is correct that a cause of action seeking judicial review under the apa accrues at the time of final agency action.see slater,at under the apa,a right of action accrues at the time of final agency action.citing.in addition,t o determine when an agency action is final,the supreme court has looked to,among other things,whether its impact is sufficiently direct and immediate and has a direct effect on business.franklin massachusetts,d quoting abbott labs.gardner,d omission in original see also lujan wildlife,d explaining that a rule or regulation is a final agency action.in this case,any apa cause of action accrued at the latest in july of,when section a was amended.there is no question that,as of that time,the regulation was in full force and effect and was operative.moreover,were we to accept preminger continuing violation theory,there effectively would be no statute of limitations because the injury would always be ongoing.see wind river mining united states,cir explaining that if every agency action allowed a challenge to a procedural violation in the adoption of the regulation,the statute of limitations would be nullified.
preminger filed his challenge to the promulgation of section a on october,well over more than six years after the va last rulemaking in july of.his apa rulemaking challenge therefore is barred by the statute of limitations.
the main issue on appeal is preminger facial challenge to a.section a provides as follows 
demonstrations.i all visitors are expected to observe proper standards of decorum and decency while on va property.toward this end,any service,ceremony,or demonstration,except as authorized by the head of the facility or designee,is prohibited.jogging,bicycling,sledding and other forms of physical recreation on cemetery grounds is prohibited.
ii for the purpose of the prohibition expressed in this paragraph,unauthorized demonstrations or services shall be defined as,but not limited to,picketing,or similar conduct on va property any oration or similar conduct to assembled groups of people,unless the oration is part of an authorized service the display of any placards,banners,or foreign flags on va property unless approved by the head of the facility or designee disorderly conduct such as fighting,threatening,violent,or tumultuous behavior,unreasonable noise or coarse utterance,gesture or display or the use of abusive language to any person present and partisan activities,those involving commentary or actions in support of,or in opposition to,or attempting to influence,any current policy of the government of the united states,or any private group,association,or enterprise.
a emphases added.
preminger contends that the part of the regulation that deals with partisan activities underlined above is facially invalid because it contravenes the first amendment the first amendment states that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.const.amend.i.according to preminger,because the regulation allows the va to impose restrictions without procedural safeguards,it vests unbridled discretion in the va,is unreasonable,and thus unconstitutional.see city of lakewood plain dealer publ g,d w e have previously identified two major first amendment risks associated with unbridled licensing schemes by speakers in order to avoid being denied a license to speak and the difficulty of effectively detecting,reviewing,and correcting censorship as applied without standards by which to measure the licensor action.
the government argues first that preminger challenge to section a is barred by the doctrine of stare decisis,in view of our decision in griffin secretary of veterans affairs.it is the government position that this litigation involves a facial challenge to the same subsection of that survived a facial challenge in griffin.in making this argument,the government notes that section a has not been revised or amended since griffin.alternatively,the government argues that section a is constitutional on its face.we consider first the government stare decisis argument.
stare decisis plays an important role in preserving the rule of law and in ensuring that its evolution is not subverted by arbitrariness.wilson united states.stare decisis in essence makes each judgment a statement of the law,or precedent,binding in future cases before the same court or another court owing obedience to its decision it deals only with law,as the facts of each successive case must be determined by the evidence adduced at trial.mendenhall cedarapids,quoting james moore,moore federal practice,ed.a prior precedential decision on a point of law by a panel of this court is binding precedent and can not be overruled or avoided unless or until the court sits en banc.sacco dep t of justice,citing newell kenney.
in griffin,patrick griffin,iii,and gregory clemmer together,griffin brought a section challenge to the facial validity of a.griffin desired to have the confederate flag flown daily at a cemetery in which approximately confederate soldiers who died at a union prison camp are buried.griffin,at.griffin requested that the confederate flag be flown in addition to the united states flag,as it previously had from to.id.at.citing section a,the va refused to allow griffin to display the flag.griffin then filed suit in the united states district court for the district of maryland,challenging section a as unconstitutional as applied to his request.id.at.his challenge was ultimately rejected by the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit.id.at.griffin also filed suit pursuant to section in this court,challenging the facial validity of section a.id.at.he attacked the constitutionality of section a through three theories first,he claimed the regulation vests unbridled discretion in va officials.second,he argued the regulation lacks procedural safeguards as a licensing scheme.third,he contended the regulation is void for vagueness.id.at.
in addressing griffin attack on section a,we focused our inquiry on the flag display clause and the portion of the regulation.id.at.in so doing,we stated that griffin had not provided any indication that the va ha d ever penalized a speaker for unauthorized orations or partisan activity on va property.id.at.in addition,we noted that griffin made no allegation that section a poses a risk of censorship at any va property other than national cemeteries.id.at.nor,we noted,did he allege that the regulation would chill speech in any venue other than national cemeteries.id.at.thus,griffin did not attack,and we did not consider,the partisan activities clause of section a,which is what is at issue in this case.
on the merits,we rejected griffin facial challenge.id.at.we first determined that va cemeteries are nonpublic fora and noted that we have no reasons to conclude that other va property ought to be classified as a traditional or designated public forum.id.at.we then considered griffin unbridled discretion challenge in the context of a nonpublic forum and held that the discretion vested in va officials by section a is reasonable.id.at.turning to griffin claim that,as a licensing scheme,the regulation lacks procedural safeguards,we held that the contention did not provide an independent basis for striking down a regulation,and we reasoned that the procedural safeguards requirement had little relevance to the present case because it was mostly subsumed in the unbridled discretion inquiry.id.at.moreover,we noted that exclusions of speakers from nonpublic fora have been upheld despite a complete absence of established procedures for making such decisions.id.citing.educ.television comm forbes,d greer spock,d.finally,addressing griffin void for vagueness claim,we stated,we can not strike down section a unless the regulation vagueness poses a real and substantial threat to protected expression,and we noted that griffin had done no more than speculate that third parties,or even he himself,might be subject to criminal penalties for uttering the wrong words on va property.id.at.
as noted above,preminger challenge does not ask us to decide the same question of law we decided in griffin.griffin only considered the flag display clause and cemeteries.furthermore,if we were to conclude that the partisan activities clause of section a violates the first amendment,as preminger urges us to do,our decision would not conflict with griffin because we could sever the partisan activities clause from the remainder of the regulation.the supreme court has stated that an invalid portion of a statute may be severed from the remainder of the statute and the remainder of the statute upheld as valid.unless it is evident that the legislature would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power,independently of that which is not,the invalid part may be dropped if what is left is fully operative as a law.buckley valeo,d per curiam quoting champlin refining.comm of.a similar approach applies in the case of a regulation.see cartier,d invalidating only the part of a regulation that conflicted with statutory language massachusetts sec y of health human,cir explaining that courts have generally inquired similarly for severability of statutes and regulations see also united states booker,d thomas,dissenting in part i also assume that our doctrine on severability and facial challenges applies equally to regulations and to statutes.citing reno flores,d.
in short,in this case we consider the partisan activities clause of section a.it is to that issue that we now turn.
a challenge to the constitutionality of a regulation presents an issue of law,see terry principi,and we review the constitutionality of a regulation without deference to the agency.griffin,at.as noted,preminger is mounting a facial challenge to the partisan activities clause of section a.a facial challenge to a statute or regulation is independent of the individual bringing the complaint and the circumstances surrounding his or her challenge.griffin,at.indeed,a facial challenge may be brought without a record or any facts at all.flores,d we have before us no findings of fact,indeed no record,concerning the ins interpretation of the regulation or the history of its enforcement.we have only the regulation itself and the statement of basis and purpose that accompanied its promulgation.in contrast,an challenge is specific to the facts of the particular individual involved in the suit.united states raines,d holding a statute constitutional on its face when,although the statute might be unconstitutional as applied to private actors,the court determined that it was constitutional as applied to public officials,and the parties challenging the law were public officials.
while prior restraints are presumed invalid,facial challenges to speech restrictions are generally disfavored,and a petitioner faces a heavy burden in advancing his or her claim.see endowment for the arts finley,d.to prevail on his claim,preminger must demonstrate that application of the partisan activities clause of section a poses a real and substantial threat of the alleged censorship risks.see city of lakewood,at.armed with these precepts,we turn to the substance of preminger facial challenge to section a.
government restrictions on speech on public property are traditionally analyzed by classifying the regulated property as one of three kinds of fora described by the supreme court public fora,designated public fora,and nonpublic fora.griffin,at.public fora have been devoted to assembly and debate by long tradition or government fiat,examples being public streets and parks.see grayned city of rockford,d wherever the title of streets and parks may rest,they have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and,time out of mind,have been used for purposes of assembly,communicating thoughts between citizens,and discussing public quests.quoting kunz new york.citation omitted.in a public forum,exclusion of a speaker by the government must be narrowly drawn and necessary to serve a compelling government interest,meaning that the restriction is subject to strict scrutiny.griffin,at.a designated public forum,on the other hand,is an area dedicated by the government for a certain class of speakers.id.exclusion of a speaker who is within the certain class must pass strict scrutiny exclusion of a speaker outside the class must be reasonable and viewpoint neutral.see id.in a nonpublic forum,the government may restrict speech as long as the restriction is reasonable and viewpoint neutral.see id.
we begin the forum analysis with,the statute pursuant to which the secretary promulgated the regulation at issue.as already seen,it states that t he secretary shall prescribe regulations to provide for the maintenance of law and order and the protection of persons and property on department property.a.the statute defines department property to mean land and buildings that are under the jurisdiction of the department and are not under the control of the administrator of general services.id.a.consistent with the statutory charge,section states,in relevant part,that its rules and regulations apply at all property under the charge and control of the va and not under the charge and control of the general services administration.a.the parties agree that va medical centers,such as the menlo park medical center,constitute property under the charge and control of the beyond that,however,they have not been able to enlighten us as to what other facilities are under the charge and control of the va so as to be covered by the regulation.nor have they been able to point us to authority that would help us answer the question.under these circumstances,we will proceed in the following manner for purposes of adjudicating preminger facial challenge to the partisan activities clause of section a,we will start from the premise that the relevant fora are va medical centers,and we will consider the menlo park medical center to be typical of such facilities.see griffin,at focusing on nonpublic fora national cemeteries and assuming the remainder of va property was nonpublic when griffin only argued regarding cemeteries.
preminger states that the menlo park medical center and va medical centers in general consist of buildings and outdoor,communal areas.he asserts that although some of the buildings are not generally open to the public,most are open.focusing on the menlo park medical center,he tells us that the facility includes the largest open space in the city of menlo park,a regional bus stop,and various through streets and sidewalks.we are further informed that the menlo park medical center covers acres,includes a teaching hospital,three nursing homes,and a domiciliary for homeless veterans.veterans are housed in numerous buildings on the menlo park medical center grounds,including building,which preminger sought to visit to register voters.on this basis,preminger argues that va medical centers are traditional public fora.he further argues that even if the grounds are not traditional public fora,the va has intentionally opened the grounds for public discourse.
the government does not dispute preminger description of the menlo park medical center.it does contend,however,that the medical center is nonpublic property.the government relies on united states kokinda,d plurality opinion,and greer spock to argue that va campus streets and sidewalks are nonpublic fora because of their location in conjunction with other nonpublic fora and their purpose.the government further argues that va property has not been expressly dedicated for expressive conduct.widmar vincent,d finding designated fora when university opened facilities to student groups to foster the free exchange of ideas.the va mission,according to the government,is to provide medical and other social services to residents and visitors,which is far different from a university seeking to provide a robust educational experience,which was the case in widmar.see id.the government concludes that the va mission does not comport with opening up its property as public or dedicated public fora.
we agree with the government that va medical centers,exemplified by the menlo park medical center,constitute nonpublic fora.in kokinda,at,the supreme court addressed the question of whether a postal service regulation prohibiting soliciting alms and contributions on postal premises violated the first amendment.the case came to the court after two volunteers for the national democratic policy committee,who set up a table on the sidewalk near the entrance to the bowie,maryland,post office to solicit contributions and distribute political literature,were arrested and convicted of misdemeanors for violating the regulation.the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit reversed the convictions.the circuit court held that the postal sidewalk was a traditional public forum.having done so,it determined that the government had no significant interest in banning solicitation and that the regulation was not narrowly tailored to accomplish the asserted governmental interest.id.at.after granting the government petition for certiorari,the supreme court reversed the decision of the court of appeals.id.at.the court rejected the respondents argument that although the sidewalk was on postal service property,because it was not distinguishable from the municipal sidewalk across the parking lot from the post office entrance,it was a traditional public forum.id.at.the court held that the sidewalk was not a public forum,noting that the sidewalk was constructed solely to assist postal patrons in negotiating the space between the post office parking lot and the front door of the post office,not to facilitate the daily commerce and life of the neighborhood or city.analyzing the regulation under the standards applicable to nonpublic fora,the court held that the regulation was reasonable.id.at.
in its kokinda forum analysis,the court relied upon greer spock.see kokinda,at.in greer,the court held that even though a military base permitted free civilian access to certain unrestricted areas,the base was a nonpublic forum.the court determined that the presence of sidewalks and streets within the base did not require a finding that the base was a public forum.greer,at.see also jones prisoners labor union,d finding prison facilities not public fora despite being open to some groups consistent with the prison rehabilitative mission.
kokinda,greer,and jones are consistent with two important principles first,t he government ownership of property does not automatically open that property to the public,kokinda,at.citing postal serv.council of greenburgh civic ass ns,d and second,t he mere physical characteristics of property can not dictate forum analysis,id.rather,the forum analysis requires consideration not only of whether government property has been opened to the public,see united states grace,d,but also of the nature and purpose of the property at issue.see int l soc y for krishna consciousness lee,d where the government is acting as a proprietor,managing its internal operations,rather than acting as a lawmaker with the power to regulate or license,its action will not be subjected to the heightened review to which its actions as a lawmaker may be subject.grace,at.the government,no less than a private owner of property,has the power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated.quoting adderley florida,d.
we conclude that va medical centers,of which the menlo park medical center is an example,are,for first amendment purposes,nonpublic fora.in our view,the fact that the public has been given access to the menlo park medical center and that the medical center has a regional bus stop,through streets and sidewalks,and the largest open space in the city of menlo park,is outweighed by the nature and purpose of the medical center.at the medical center,the government is acting in a proprietary capacity to further the mission of the va in general and the medical center in particular.the mission of the va is to provide health care and services for veterans and their families.see veterans compensation,education,and employment amendments of,a,stat,it is the policy of the united states that the veterans administration now the department of veterans affairs shall maintain a comprehensive,nationwide system for the direct provision of quality services to eligible veterans united states department of veterans affairs,mission,vision,core values goals,mission statement to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan.last visited june.at the same time,the mission of the menlo park medical center is to honor america veterans by providing exceptional health care that improves their health and.va palo alto health care system,mission statement.gov mission.asp last visited june.consistent with these missions,the menlo park medical center operates nearly beds,including three nursing homes and a homeless domiciliary,all to serve more than enrolled veterans.va palo alto health care system,about us,http www.paloalto.med.gov about.asp last visited june.the menlo park medical center offers health care services in a broad range of areas,including services to homeless veterans,post traumatic stress disorder programs,and recreation therapy.va palo alto health care system,menlo park.gov directory guide facility.asp id last visited june.in sum,although the menlo park medical center has public areas,the va has not made the medical center available as a forum for first amendment activity.see,kokinda,at.the postal service has not expressly dedicated its sidewalks to any expressive activity.indeed,postal property is expressly dedicated to only one means of communication the posting of public notices on designated bulletin boards.rather,the menlo park medical center serves the purpose of providing medical services to veterans.although the va has allowed public access to some portion of the medical center grounds,the va has not thereby disavowed its purpose of providing medical care for veterans for that portion of the grounds and dedicated that portion of the grounds to the public.greer,at.t he fort dix authorities had not abandoned any claim of special interest in regulating the distribution of unauthorized leaflets or the delivery of campaign speeches for political candidates within the confines of the military reservation.we hold that the menlo park medical center is a nonpublic forum.
in a nonpublic forum,the government may restrict access by content or speaker identity,so long as the restrictions are reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker view.griffin,at citing cornelius naacp legal def.educ.fund,d.thus,restraints on speech in a nonpublic forum will be upheld unless they are unreasonable or they embody impermissible discrimination.id.as part of the reasonableness inquiry,we consider whether the discretion vested in public officials is necessary to preserve the function and character of the forum.id.at.
we hold that the restriction on partisan activities by visitors found in a is reasonable and viewpoint neutral.the va must be able to maintain a place of healing and rehabilitation for the veterans for which it provides services.demonstrations and other disruptions could interfere with the va ability to provide those services and could impede the va ability to carry out its mission of caring for veterans.in light of these considerations,we can not say that it is unreasonable for the va to regulate the activities taking place on its grounds and to exercise its discretion in determining when a demonstration defined to include partisan activities would be disruptive.see griffin,at griffin has not convinced us that preserving the national cemetery for the government own expressive purposes can be accomplished without vesting a significant degree of discretion in va facility heads.
we think the va must have,as part of its discretion,the ability to determine the disruption that would be caused by an authorized partisan activity,as well as by any additional partisan activity that would have to be authorized in order to prevent the agency from engaging in viewpoint discrimination.in other words,as part of its discretion,the va must be able to decide when its mission would be compromised to an extent that counsels against granting the request to conduct a demonstration.we do not agree with preminger that section a provides the va with standardless,unbridled discretion.
the regulation requires a ll visitors to observe proper standards of decorum and decency while on va property.a i.toward that end,any demonstration,except as authorized by the head of the facility or designee,is prohibited.id.the regulation defines unauthorized demonstrations as,among other things,disorderly conduct such as fighting,threatening,violent,or tumultuous behavior,unreasonable noise or coarse utterance,gesture or display or the use of abusive language to any person present.a ii.the intent of the regulation is to give the head of a facility such as the menlo park medical center the authority to decide whether a particular demonstration would impede the ability of the facility to achieve its mission of providing health care and services for veterans and their families.the regulation on its face defines those demonstrations that may be prohibited and thus provides clear standards to guide the facility head in the exercise of his or her discretion.indeed,section a ii is in harmony with the more general regulatory ban on disturbances on va property found in a.section a defines disturbances to include,inter alia,c onduct which creates loud or unusual noise which unreasonably obstructs the usual use of entrances,foyers,lobbies,corridors,offices,elevators,stairways,or parking lots which otherwise impedes or disrupts the performance of official duties by government employees which prevents one from obtaining medical or other services provided on the property in a timely manner or which involves the use of loud,abusive,or otherwise improper language.
in view of the existing specific,objective regulatory standards,the discretion given to a va facility head to authorize or refuse to authorize a particular demonstration under section a is not unbridled.in deciding whether to authorize a proposed demonstration,a va facility head is to be guided by the specific standards set forth in a ii.see shuttlesworth city of birmingham,d stating that a regulation prohibiting a public demonstration without first obtaining a permit from city officials was invalid as originally written because the prior restraint of a license without specified standards to guide the licensing authority is unconstitutional emphasis added see also city of lakewood,at.at to allow illusory constraints to constitute the standards necessary to bound a licensor discretion renders the guarantee against censorship little more than a ideal.citing shuttlesworth,at.at.
because adequate standards to guide th
