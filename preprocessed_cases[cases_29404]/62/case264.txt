jack gerritsen was convicted after representing himself in a federal criminal trial.he argues on appeal that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to counsel because,at the time of the waiver,he was not aware of the maximum penalties he faced and was not informed of the dangers and disadvantages of.we hold that gerritsen waived his right to counsel knowingly and intelligently,and we affirm his conviction.
gerritsen is an enthusiast with a history of transmitting illegal radio broadcasts.in,gerritsen was convicted in a california court for interfering with police radio communications.he spent a year in state prison for this offense.following his release,gerritsen applied for an license from the federal communications commission fcc.the fcc initially granted the license,but later revoked it upon learning of gerritsen prior state conviction.in addition to revoking his license,the fcc sent gerritsen a warning letter advising him to discontinue his radio transmissions and informing him of severe criminal penalties if he failed to do so.
but gerritsen continued to transmit.he proceeded to commit a variety of offenses,including broadcasting over a police frequency,interfering with a coast guard search and rescue operation,transmitting over a line the red cross was using to evacuate a town downstream of a cracked dam,and interfering with a homeland security disaster preparedness exercise being conducted over a military radio system.
on may,gerritsen was charged in a indictment with one count of malicious interference with a military radio system under providing a maximum sentence of ten years two counts of malicious interference with a licensed or authorized radio communication under and three counts of transmitting without a license under.both and are made punishable by,which provides a maximum sentence of one year if the defendant has not previously been convicted under the communications act of,stat,and two years if he has been.
on july,gerritsen attended a status conference and learned that the district court could not accommodate his desire for an early trial date.when the district judge indicated that the trial would likely be rescheduled from that week to early november,gerritsen counsel told the court,i believe gerritsen decision is that if that the only date that available then he would ask for a shorter date and ask to represent himself.the district judge responded he always has the right to represent himself.it like asking somebody to do their own brain surgery but you have a right to do it.i always advise against it.it absolutely your right,if you wish to relieve counsel and represent yourself you may do so.after gerritsen conferred with his counsel he again expressed his desire to represent himself.the district judge responded 
you understand that you have a right to have an attorney and the court has provided one for you and would continue to provide one for you.
if you wish to waive and give up that right and you feel comfortable representing yourself that fine.you have got that right.
i got to advise you and i sure you understand what i about to say,it very dangerous and normally very foolish to represent yourself because there a lot of legal issues that come up.the court can not help you at all.i treat you just like another attorney.i would have to be impartial on that.
there may be a lot of things that you may or may not realize or a lot of pitfalls that you might be getting into trouble on.and it might affect the decision on this case,which could be adverse to you,you understand 
gerritsen replied,i do,your honor.
the district judge then asked the prosecutor to state what the maximum penalty would be.the government correctly listed each charge against gerritsen but incorrectly stated that the total maximum penalty was years of imprisonment.after this recitation,the district judge addressed gerritsen so i want to make sure before you make that final decision you understand the maximum possible punishment,in other words,you risking or playing with years of your life.when the district judge asked gerritsen if he understood that,gerritsen responded,i understand,your honor.
the district judge again warned gerritsen against representing himself i would have to treat you like any other attorney.i ca help you.i ca ask questions for you or participate in the case at all.you would be on your own.the district judge then repeated if you really want to do that with the understanding you are looking at years possible maximum punishment on this and you comfortable doing that,it your right.
in response to the court admonitions,gerritsen responded,your honor,i do have some experience.i would like to proceed pro se.gerritsen had,in fact,represented himself in at least nine state criminal cases,including six jury trials that resulted in convictions.
following yet another reaffirmation of gerritsen desire to proceed pro se,the court asked the prosecutor to state the elements of the charges and the nature of the charges that are pending so that gerritsen is put on notice.in response,the prosecutor recited the elements the government had to prove for each of the three statutes charged in the indictment.the district judge asked whether gerritsen understood the elements and charges 
the court okay.do you understand those elements and charges in this case 
the defendant yes.
the court if you have questions ask them now.
the defendant i understand your honor.i read the indictment.
the court you satisfied you understand what the charges are and what the elements of the charges are.
the defendant yes,i do.
the district judge followed by asking gerritsen if he wanted more time to speak with his attorney.even then,gerritsen indicated that he want ed to proceed.once again,the district judge asked,you wish to waive and give up your right to have an attorney gerritsen replied,yes,your honor.the district judge concluded by appointing gerritsen former counsel as standby counsel who later withdrew,citing ethical objections.in doing so,the judge told gerritsen that his former counsel could not act as advisory counsel.a final time,the district judge asked if gerritsen wished to represent himself,and once again gerritsen expressly replied that he did.the district judge then allowed gerritsen to proceed pro se.
on october,three and a half months later and six weeks before trial,the government filed a first superseding indictment,adding an allegation of willfulness to each of the three counts of violating.gerritsen appeared before a magistrate judge for his arraignment.at the beginning of the proceeding,the magistrate judge asked,gerritsen,do you still intend to represent yourself gerritsen replied,yes,your honor.gerritsen then entered a plea of not guilty.following the plea,the government asked the court for permission to go over the nature of the charges and the maximum penalty.after describing the elements of each charge,the government correctly explained the maximum statutory penalty that gerritsen could face 
with respect to the possible penalties,your honor,the statutory maximum sentence that the court can impose for violation of is ten years imprisonment,a period of supervised release,and a fine of and a mandatory special assessment of.the statutory maximum sentence that the court can impose under on each of the remaining counts of the indictment is one year in prison or two years if the defendant has previously been convicted of an offense under section,a period of supervised release,a fine and a special assessment.therefore,the total maximum sentence that the court can impose is years imprisonment,a period of supervised release,a fine and a special assessment.
this was the first time gerritsen had been told the correct statutory maximum years,not.the prosecutor noted and the magistrate judge confirmed that the court has already asked the defendant if he still intends to represent himself.gerritsen made no further comment regarding his waiver of the right to counsel,and he continued to act as his own representative for the remainder of the hearing.gerritsen represented himself at trial and was convicted.he was represented by counsel at sentencing.his guidelines range was months the district court sentenced him to months in prison,followed by three years of supervised release.
on appeal,gerritsen does not challenge his sentence.instead,he argues that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to counsel.specifically,gerritsen argues that his waiver of the right to counsel was not knowing and intelligent because,at the time he elected to proceed pro se,he had not been adequately informed of either the possible penalties he faced or the dangers and disadvantages of.see united states balough,cir.because his waiver was inadequate,gerritsen argues,he was convicted in violation of the sixth amendment,and we must reverse his conviction and remand for a new trial.see united states forrester,cir,as amended.we review the validity of a waiver of the right to counsel de novo.id.at.t he burden of establishing the legality of the waiver is on the government.id.
the sixth amendment states that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to have the assistance of counsel for his defence.const.amend.vi.the supreme court has interpreted the sixth amendment as guaranteeing that a person brought to trial in any state or federal court must be afforded the right to the assistance of counsel before he can be validly convicted and punished by imprisonment.faretta california,d.but the sixth amendment also guarantees a criminal defendant the constitutional right to proceed without counsel when he voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so.id.specifically,the constitution does not allow the government t o thrust counsel upon the accused,against his considered wish,id.at,in contravention of the nearly universal conviction,on the part of our people as well as our courts,that forcing a lawyer upon an unwilling defendant is contrary to his basic right to defend himself if he truly wants to do so,id.at.
a defendant therefore has two correlative and mutually exclusive sixth amendment rights the right to have counsel,on one hand,and the right to refuse counsel and represent himself,on the other.see united states harris,cir t here is a narrow path to be carefully treaded between the faretta right to refuse the assistance of counsel,and the assurance that the defendant refusal of such services is made with full awareness of the risks of doing so.
because a defendant who exercises the right to foregoes the benefits of exercising the right to counsel,the accused must knowingly and intelligently forego those relinquished benefits.faretta,at.when a defendant elects to waive the right to be represented by trial counsel,w arnings of the pitfalls of proceeding to trial without counsel must be rigorously conveyed.iowa tovar,d internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.although a defendant need not himself have the skill and experience of a lawyer in order competently and intelligently to choose,he should be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of,so that the record will establish that he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.faretta,at.internal quotation marks omitted.the defendant must be aware of the nature of the charges and the possible penalties.harris,at accord balough,at.he must also understand his constitutional right to have a lawyer perform certain core functions,and the possible consequences of mishandling these core functions and the lawyer superior ability to handle them.united states mohawk,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
the supreme court has expressly declined to prescribe any formula or script to be read to a defendant who states that he elects to proceed without counsel.tovar,at.see also united states erskine,cir w e have never required district courts to recite a particular script when making their inquiry.rather,t he information a defendant must possess in order to make an intelligent election will depend on a range of factors,including the defendant education or sophistication,the complex or easily grasped nature of the charge,and the stage of the proceeding.tovar,at.even if the defendant lacked a full and complete appreciation of all of the consequences flowing from his waiver,it does not defeat the state showing that the information it provided to him satisfied the constitutional minimum.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the information a defendant must have to waive counsel intelligently will depend,in each case,upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
accordingly,although it is only the rare case in which an adequate waiver will be found on the record in the absence of a specific inquiry by the trial judge,the failure of the district court to engage in a colloquy with the defendant can not itself be reversible error.balough,at quoting united states aponte,cir alteration omitted.we have explained that a defendant waiver must be evaluated in light of the record as a whole 
a waiver of counsel can not be knowing and intelligent unless the accused appreciates the possible consequences of mishandling the core functions of the trial lawyer and the lawyer superior ability to perform them.our task is to determine from the record whether the accused understood these risks when he elected to represent himself.we prefer trial courts to simplify our review by explaining the risks of to the accused.however,because the test concerns what the accused understood rather than what the court said or understood,explanations are not required.
united states kimmel,cir see also balough,at citing cases.when the district court has not made a waiver inquiry,we must consult the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case,including the background,experience and conduct of the accused to determine whether the waiver was knowing and intelligent.kimmel,at internal quotation marks omitted accord balough,at.our precedents thus apply the supreme court instruction that our fundamental task is to determine whether a defendant who invokes his right under faretta knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.faretta,at.internal quotation marks omitted.our focus should be on what the defendant understood,rather than on what the court said or understood.united states,cir.
once the defendant has validly waived the right to counsel,although he may conduct his own defense ultimately to his own detriment,his choice must be honored out of that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.faretta,at.quoting illinois allen,d brennan,concurring.the supreme court has stated that,even if the right of is a right that when exercised usually increases the likelihood of a trial outcome unfavorable to the defendant,mckaskle wiggins,d,it merits the same vigilant protection as other constitutional rights.when the administration of the criminal law is hedged about as it is by the constitutional safeguards for the protection of an accused,to deny him in the exercise of his free choice the right to dispense with some of these safeguards is to imprison a man in his privileges and call it the constitution.faretta,at.quoting adams united states ex rel.mccann.alterations omitted.
because the right to protects the dignity and autonomy of the accused,wiggins,at,we can not ignore or diminish the importance of this right merely because the defendant efforts at trial were unsuccessful.nor may we,after the fact,whether the defendant would have been better served by counsel.the supreme court has noted that the right of allows the presentation of what may,at least occasionally,be the accused best possible defense.id.most recently,in declining to overrule faretta,the court cited recent empirical research finding that pro se state felony defendants appear to have achieved higher felony acquittal rates than their represented counterparts.indiana edwards,d internal quotation marks omitted.in considering whether gerritsen has effectively waived his right to counsel,we must avoid the tendency of hindsight to diminish the importance of gerritsen corresponding right to.
