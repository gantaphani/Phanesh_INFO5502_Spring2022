in this action alleging gender and disability discrimination as well as retaliatory termination,jaimi bowers bowers appeals the district court order dismissing her complaint.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
during the relevant time period,bowers worked at the youngstown air reserve station as a logistics support specialist in the logistics readiness squadron,maintenance support group.as an air reserve technician art,she was a federal civilian employee of the air force,but she held the military rank of staff sergeant and was required,as a condition of her employment,to maintain membership in the air force reserve.bowers alleges that she suffers from several emotional and medical disorders,including anxiety,depression,gastroesophageal reflux disease,and gastritis.she alleges that major dawn sturdevant,her supervisor,and major ronald coburn interfered with the grant of a security clearance and went beyond the normal requirements in requiring her to substantiate her medical disabilities.at.she asserts that defendant secretary michael wynne,acting through major sturdevant and major coburn,acted maliciously by disregarding bowers medical documentation,and by using a pretext regarding the processing of a security clearance,to discharge bowers.id.at.bowers filed a fraud,waste,and abuse complaint alleging that major sturdevant was forging signatures on performance recommendations and engaging in abuse of power and conduct unbecoming an officer,particularly fraternization with enlisted.id.at.bowers was terminated from her position on august.she contends that she was wrongfully charged with being absent without leave and discharged on the basis of her gender,her disabilities,and in retaliation for filing the fraud,waste,and abuse complaint.following a proceeding in november of,and a final agency decision in june of,bowers filed her complaint in united states district court for the northern district of ohio,naming as defendant michael wynne,the secretary of the air force the secretary.bowers complaint contains three counts discrimination in violation of the rehabilitation act of,unlawful retaliatory discrimination,and gender discrimination in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of.on february,the secretary moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,arguing that bowers claims were barred by the doctrine of feres united states.on march,the district court granted the secretary motion.bowers now appeals the dismissal of her complaint.
ii.law and analysis 
standard of review 
because the secretary attached evidence in support of its motion to dismiss,the parties and the court construed the secretary motion as an attack on the factual basis for subject matter jurisdiction.when a rule b motion attacks the factual basis for jurisdiction,the district court must weigh the evidence and the plaintiff has the burden of proving that the court has jurisdiction over the subject matter.golden gorno,cir.the court reviews the district court application of the law to the facts de novo and its factual determinations for clear error.id.the court reviews de novo a district court determination of the applicability of the feres doctrine.lovely united states,cir.
feres doctrine 
in feres united states,the supreme court held that military personnel could not pursue claims against the government under the federal tort claims act for injuries that arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.id.at.because the relationship of military personnel to the government has been governed exclusively by federal law,the court did not think that congress,in drafting this act,created a new cause of action dependent on local law for injuries or death due to negligence.id.
thereafter,the supreme court applied the analysis in feres to discrimination claims brought by naval personnel against their superiors pursuant to the bivens doctrine.chappell wallace,d.the court explained that i n the last analysis,feres seems best explained by the peculiar and special relationship of the soldier to his superiors,and the effects on the maintenance of such suits on discipline.id.quoting united states muniz,d.the court determined that the unique disciplinary structure of the military establishment and congress activity in the field constituted special factors making it inappropriate to allow a remedy.id.at.
the supreme court reiterated its concern to avoid intrusion into military discipline and military decisionmaking in united states shearer,d.in that case,the court held that the mother of an army private could not pursue a ftca claim based on the murder of her son by another member of the military.id.at.her son was off duty and away from his base when he was killed.id.at.the plaintiff alleged that the government was negligent in its supervision and control over the killer.id.at.the court rejected the appellate court heavy reliance on the site of the murder and the duty status of the army private when the murder occurred because the situs of the murder is not nearly as important as whether the suit requires the civilian court to military decisions and whether the suit might impair essential military discipline.id.at internal citations omitted.
in united states johnson,d,the supreme court invoked the military discipline rationale underlying the feres doctrine in a case involving negligence on the part of civilian employees of the government.id.at.the plaintiff husband,a member of the coast guard,was killed when his helicopter crashed during a rescue mission.id.at.the plaintiff alleged that the crash resulted from the negligent actions of civilian radar controllers.id.the court held that the plaintiff could not pursue her ftca claim,in part,because 
m ilitary discipline involves not only obedience to orders,but more generally duty and loyalty to one service and to one country.suits brought by service members against the government for injuries could undermine the commitment essential to effective service and thus have the potential to disrupt military discipline in the broadest sense of the word.
id.at.the court noted that c ivilian employees of the government also may play an integral role in military activities,and reasoned that,e ven if military negligence is not specifically alleged in a tort action,a suit based upon activity necessarily implicates the military judgments and decisions that are inextricably intertwined with the conduct of the military mission.id.at emphasis added.because the plaintiff husband was engaged in an activity incident to his service and was acting pursuant to the standard operating procedures of the coast guard,the court determined that the potential that the suit could implicate military discipline is substantial.id.at.
in united states stanley,d,the supreme court affirmed the broad incident to service test from feres.the plaintiff was a member of the military claiming injury as a result of his participation in a military program designed to test the effects of lsd.id.at.the plaintiff argued that his case did not involve the sort of issues that were at issue in chappell because he was not acting under orders from superior officers,and because at least some of the defendants were not his superior officers.id.at.the court declined to limit feres to claims by officers against their superiors because even an inquiry into whether a suit questions military discipline and decisionmaking would itself require judicial inquiry into,and hence intrusion upon,military matters.id.at.
this court extended the analysis in feres and chappell to discrimination claims brought by military personnel pursuant to title vii and the rehabilitation act in coffman michigan,cir.see id.at consistent with the reasoning in chappell,courts of appeals have consistently refused to extend statutory remedies available to civilians to uniformed members of the armed forces absent a clear direction from congress to do so.by its terms,a applies to all personnel actions affecting employees of the military departments.id.however,t he equal employment opportunity commission and the circuits that have considered this statute have interpreted it to apply only to suits by civilian employees of the military departments,and not members of the armed forces.fisher peters,cir see brown united states,cir citing cases d.
sixth circuit precedent 
this court has never considered claims brought under title vii or the rehabilitation act by an art.in leistiko stone,cir,the plaintiff alleged that he had been discharged from his position as a national guard technician in violation of the rehabilitation act.id.at.like an art,a national guard technician occupies a hybrid position.national guard technicians are federal civilian employees that must,as a condition of their employment,be members of the national guard.b a b.this court affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant because e very court having occasion closely to consider the capacity of national guard technicians has determined that capacity to be irreducibly military in nature.leistiko,at quoting leistiko sec y of the army,see wright park,cir s ince national guard technicians positions are encompassed within a military organization and require the performance of work directly related to national defense,such positions are themselves military in nature.stauber cline,cir noting that plaintiff and defendant,both national guard technicians,were always under the command of military officers,were subject to military discipline,and were performing work integral to routine military activities nesmith fulton,cir formally,a civilian technician is a federal civil employee outside the competitive civil service.in substance,however,the position is one in a military organization.this court has reiterated the holding from leistiko on several occasions.see,brown roche,app x,cir unpublished fisher peters,cir.
in fisher peters,the court considered a title vii claim by a national guard technician who alleged that her supervisors had downgraded her performance appraisal and denied her requests for promotion.at.in her technician position,the plaintiff was responsible for paying invoices provided to the base and for processing travel vouchers.id.at.she was also required to wear a military uniform,observe military courtesies,and participate in unit training activities one weekend per month.id.the court affirmed a grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant because the national guard technician position is irreducibly military in nature 
in the case at hand,plaintiff attempts to distinguish leistiko by emphasizing that leistiko dismissal from his civilian employment was precipitated by a military decision.while that distinction may be accurate,plaintiff ignores the unambiguous statements made in leistiko that the positions of national guard technicians are irreducibly military in nature.in affirming the grant of summary judgment,this court did not discuss the facts of the underlying employment action taken which precipitated the suit.rather,we simply confirmed that national guard technician positions are irreducibly military in nature and that the rehabilitation act does not apply to hybrid positions that are irreducibly military in nature.
in the case before the court,the district court determined that fisher was controlling because the court could not discern any distinction between an art and a national guard technician.on appeal,bowers contends that arts and national guard technicians are governed by different statutes and that,unlike national guard technicians,arts are not statutorily required to wear a uniform while performing their civilian functions.see b requiring national guard technicians to wear the uniform appropriate for the member grade and component of the armed forces while performing duties as a military technician dual status 
courts in some other circuits take a different approach to analyzing title vii or rehabilitation act claims by dual status technicians.see fisher,at.those courts consider the nature of the technician claim or the challenged conduct.id.for example,in the ninth circuit,dual status technicians are barred from bringing claims where the challenged conduct is integrally related to the military unique structure.mier owens,cir.in the fifth circuit,only claims arising purely from the employee civilian status may be brought.brown united states,cir.if the claim is difficult to characterize,the court will consider whether the conduct at issue is integrally related to the military unique structure.id.at.the second and third circuits have adopted the approach used in the fifth circuit.overton state div.of military naval affairs,cir luckett bure,cir willis roche,app x,cir unpublished.
in fisher,this court determined in the alternative that,even if the plaintiff position was not military in nature,her claims were in the military sphere because she challenged a performance appraisal during a period in which her supervisors were military officers who supervised her in both her military and civilian roles,and because the positions to which she was denied promotion had military components with military qualifications.fisher peters,cir.
in the instant case,the district court determined,in the alternative,that bowers claims were military in nature because it was not disputed that bowers claims involved the conduct of individuals that supervised her in both her civilian and military capacities the district court also noted that bowers alleged that she was terminated in retaliation for filing a fraud,waste,and abuse complaint,which involved military matters because it included allegations that major sturdevant engaged in conduct unbecoming an officer and improperly engaged in fraternization.at.
following the court approach in fisher,at issue is whether an art constitutes a civilian employee or a member of the armed forces.see fisher,at.arts are defined as 
civilian employees who are also members of the air force reserve unit in which they are employed.in addition to their civilian assignments,they are assigned to equivalent positions in the reserve organization with a reserve military rank or grade.arts must maintain active membership in their reserve unit of assignment and satisfactory participation in order to keep their art position.
at,air force instruction,air reserve technician art program july,attachment,at.the art and national guard technician positions are both subject to a,which provides 
for purposes of this section and any other provision of law,a military technician dual status is a federal civilian employee who 
a is employed under section of title or section b of title 
b is required as a condition of that employment to maintain membership in the selected reserve and 
c is assigned to a civilian position as a technician in the organizing,administering,instructing,or training of the selected reserve or in the maintenance and repair of supplies or equipment issued to the selected reserve or the armed forces.
id.the position of national guard technician has a different history than the art position.congress enacted the national guard technicians act of,as amended,to regulate national guard technicians,whereas the art position is subject to the general employment authority of the military departments in.one of the authorities cited by the district court in leistiko for the proposition that a national guard technician position is irreducibly military in nature examined the intent of congress in defining that position,as set forth in the national guard technicians act.see wright park,cir.that analysis is summarized as follows 
appellant,who remains a colonel in the air national guard,argues strenuously that,for purposes of this case,his civilian status may be disentangled from his military status,and that he should be free to sue for discrimination implicating the former.but this balkanization of technicians work is belied by congress description of the functions that ang technicians serve,by the unmistakable intendment of the technician act the statute that congress enacted in to regulate such personnel,and by the resulting ties that bind technicians civilian and military roles.
t he technician act evidences congress intention that technicians,while retaining their positions as civil employees outside the competitive civil service,will serve simultaneously as employees of the appropriate military department,subject to its regulation.
it is axiomatic that the national guard is military in character we think it follows that technicians are martial in character.indeed,under the technician act composite regime,technicians are considerably more than nominal members of the military establishment because national guard technicians serve as the guard support staf and are,in fact,those whose job it is to maintain and assure the guard strength and organization,they are indispensable to this nation defense.see,a assigning to technicians such distinctively military tasks as the administration and training of the national guard and the maintenance and repair of supplies issued to the national guard or the armed forces 
s ince national guard technicians positions are encompassed within a military organization and require the performance of work directly related to national defense,such positions are themselves military in nature.
id.at emphasis added.the reasoning in wright readily applies to the art position.like national guard technicians,arts are encompassed within a military organization and require the performance of work directly related to national defense.
the functions performed by arts and national guard technicians,as described in the applicable statutes,are substantially the same.the distinctively military tasks noted by wright in the national guard technicians act,a,are duplicated in a c,where they are applicable to both national guard technicians and arts.see id.indicating that dual status technicians,including arts employed under and national guard technicians employed under b,may be assigned to organizing,administering,instructing,or training of the selected reserve or in the maintenance and repair of supplies or equipment issued to the selected reserve or the armed forces.the national guard technicians act also provides that national guard technicians may be called to perform the following additional duties 
a support of operations or missions undertaken by the technician unit at the request of the president or the secretary of defense.
b support of federal training operations or federal training missions assigned in whole or in part to the technician unit.
c instructing or training in the united states or the commonwealth of puerto rico or possessions of the united states of 
i members of the armed forces 
ii members of foreign military forces under the same authorities and restrictions applicable to members providing such instruction or training 
iii department of defense contractor personnel or 
iv department of defense civilian employees.
a.similarly,a provides that dual status technicians employed under may be assigned the following additional duties 
a supporting operations or missions assigned in whole or in part to the technician unit.
b supporting operations or missions performed or to be performed by 
i a unit composed of elements from more than one component of the technician armed force or 
ii a joint forces unit that includes 
i one or more units of the technician component or 
ii a member of the technician component whose reserve component assignment is in a position in an element of the joint forces unit.
c instructing or training in the united states or the commonwealth of puerto rico or possessions of the united states of 
i members of the armed forces 
ii members of foreign military forces under the same authorities and restrictions applicable to members providing such instruction or training 
iii department of defense contractor personnel or 
iv department of defense civilian employees.
furthermore,arts fulfill a uniquely military function,even in their civilian capacity,to ensure the combat readiness of the reserve units in which they are employed 
the art workforce provides stable,continuous management,administration,and training of the ready reserve and oversees the transition from peacetime to a wartime or national emergency situation to ensure mobilization readiness is maintained.arts train reservists,provide continuity within the reserve unit of assignment,and support the unit gaining major command.
at,air force instruction july.see d requiring arts and other dual status technicians to maintain membership in the unit in which they are employed or that they are employed to support.the history of the art position provides additional context 
in a letter dated june,the civil service commission csc authorized the air force to proceed with its air reserve technician plan hereinafter art.the primary goal of the plan was to increase the combat readiness of air force reserve units,as well as their effectiveness in the event of mobilization.prior to art,the air reserve flying centers utilized for training air reserve wings were maintained and operated by air force units which were composed of approximately half military and half civilian personnel and were organizationally separate from the reserve wings.art,by replacing military support personnel with civil servants and requiring civilian support personnel to be active reserve members,in effect integrated the support organizations into the air reserve wings.in their civilian capacity,art incumbents were to provide the basic maintenance and supply functions previously provided by the support organization in their military capacity,art employees were to provide training for the remainder of the wing personnel,who reported only on weekends and during summer active duty tours.since this hard core of highly skilled reservists would be available for immediate mobilization,the air force anticipated that combat readiness would be enhanced.
am.fed of gov t employees hoffman.hoffman explains the importance of dual status technicians to ensuring the combat readiness of their unit 
technicians are an integral part of the army reserve and they possess certain skills essential to the unit if it should be called to active duty.since the transition from a reserve status to active duty is critical,dual status personnel,who have been working for the unit and are familiar with unit administrative requirements are employed when the unit is mobilized to enable the critical functions to be performed effectively.when a substitute must replace a technician who does not accompany his unit,the function performed will suffer in some degree.
id.at.in other words,an art is not merely a civilian employee that occupies a separate military position in the reserve forces.instead,the art civilian duties and military role are intricately entwined.the civilian aspect of the art position exists to serve the art military role and the military capacity of the art unit.it follows,then,that an adverse personnel decision regarding an art,even if that decision is related solely to the art nominally civilian role,necessarily implicates the art military role and function.wright park,cir observing that because the national guard technician several roles are inextricably intertwined,it follows that the adverse employment action necessarily implicates his military as well as his civilian status.
bowers contends that the district court should have considered that,unlike national guard technicians,arts are not required to wear uniforms while performing their civilian duties,arts are subject to civil service laws and regulations applicable to the competitive civil service,and arts receive separate military and civilian pay.see hoffman,at,noting that the csc has provided for separation of art employees civilian and military functions to the extent practicable.
bowers argues that the uniform requirement is an important distinction because the eeoc regulations implementing title vii specifically exclude u niformed members of the military departments.d emphasis added.however,the court interprets the eeoc regulations to refer to the nature of the position rather than an individual state of dress.there is no dispute that arts are uniformed members of the military departments in their capacity as members of the res
