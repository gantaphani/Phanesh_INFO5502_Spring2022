i.the events leading to litigation,and the proceedings in the district court 
a.the events leading to litigation 
appellant eugene wigginton served in the marines from to and was then honorably discharged.in wigginton was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the united states army reserve and,concomitantly,in the rhode island army national guard riang.he received regular promotions,and by year in which the event triggering this litigation took,by then years old,had almost twenty years of aggregate service in the marines and riang and had attained the rank of major.in january of wigginton was advised that in may of that year his status would be considered by a selective retention board,pursuant to national guard regulation ngr.the stated purpose of ngr was to e nsur e that only the most capable officers are retained beyond years of qualifying service for assignment to the comparatively few higher level command and staff positions.of the ten riang officers whose status was considered at the may session of the selective retention board,whom wigginton was recommended for.pursuant to the board recommendation,brigadier general reginald centracchio,adjutant general of rhode island,then notified wigginton that he was to be separated from riang as of july,separation followed on that date.
in september of wigginton filed a suit against centracchio and the state of rhode island in the superior court for providence county.the first of the two counts charged that termination of wigginton riang commission constituted deprivation without due process of law of a constitutionally protected property right to continue as a commissioned officer until age substantive right assertedly embodied in of rhode island general laws.that statutory provision,part of the rhode island military code enacted by the rhode island legislature in,is as follows 
all commissioned officers of the staff corps and departments,hereafter appointed,shall have had previous military experience,except chaplains,officers of the judge advocate general corps,and medical corps officers.they shall hold their positions until they shall have reached the age of sixty years,unless retired prior to that time by reason of resignation or disability,or for cause to be determined by an efficiency board or a legally convened for that purpose.vacancies among these officers shall be filled by appointment from the commissioned officer of the national guard or from such other civilians as may be specifically qualified for duty therein.
the second count,sounding in procedural due process,contained two elements.one element was a claim that the criteria prescribed by ngr as governing the decision had not been followed in wigginton case.the other element was a claim that the absence of any explanation of the grounds for the decision constituted a fatal due process flaw.
b.the proceedings in the district court 
centracchio removed the case to the district court and then filed a motion to dismiss.the magistrate judge to whom the case had been referred recommended to the district judge that the motion to dismiss be granted on the ground that claims arising in the military service were.the district court,disagreeing with the magistrate judge,denied the motion to dismiss.the district judge ruled that damage actions arising from military service were not justiciable,but that an equitable as wigginton,seeking reinstatement in commissioned be entertained by an article iii court.the district court then authorized the parties to engage in discovery addressed to the meaning of laws,the rhode island statute relied on by wigginton in the first count of his complaint,with a view to determining whether wigginton had been a commissioned officer of the staff corps and departments within the meaning of the statute.at the close of discovery,centracchio and wigginton both filed motions for summary judgment.
the district court granted centracchio motion for summary judgment.with respect to wigginton first count,the district court found that neither wigginton nor centracchio had presented evidence that gave the statutory phrase staff corps and departments any cognizable meaning.the district court then ruled that,since wigginton as plaintiff had the burden of establishing the legal groundwork for his substantive due process claim,his inability to demonstrate that he was an officer of the staff corps and departments meant that the claim presented in the first count of the complaint must fail.the district court then went on to address wigginton procedural due process claims presented in the second found them without merit.
wigginton appealed to this court from the order of the district court granting summary judgment and dismissing his complaint.
ii.this court prior opinion 
in addressing wigginton appeal we first considered centracchio contention that wigginton claims were.we held that the district court had correctly determined that,since wigginton was not seeking damages but rather the equitable relief of reinstatement as a commissioned riang officer,his claims were justiciable.
we then turned to the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of centracchio.first we considered the dismissal of wigginton second count alleging a lack of procedural due process.wigginton had not pursued on appeal his contention that the selective retention board had not adhered to the decisional criteria prescribed by ngr accordingly,we confined our attention to wigginton claim that he had a due process right to an explanation of the reasons for the denial of retention.we agreed with the district court rejection of that claim.
next we considered the district court grant of summary judgment dismissing the first count of wigginton complaint.as noted above,the district court reasoned that,since the testimony and arguments presented by the parties shed no useful light on the meaning of the crucial and opaque statutory phrase staff corps and departments,and since wigginton as plaintiff had the burden of establishing all of the elements of his claim,wigginton failure to come forward with a persuasive showing that he came within the protective embrace of the statutory phrase meant that his claim must fail.
but h ere,we said,we part company with the district court.wigginton,at.and we undertook to explain why 
on for summary judgment,a plaintiff loses if he can not produce evidence tending to establish a fact that,under the governing law,the plaintiff is required to prove in order to make out his cause of action.but that was not the situation at the point that the district court granted summary judgment against appellant and in favor of appellees.when the district court granted summary judgment,no determination had been arrived at as to what the governing law was.that is to say,neither the meaning of the phrase staff corps and departments as used in
