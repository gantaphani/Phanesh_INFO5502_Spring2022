kelly butterbaugh,roseanne faltin,john marderness,and robert bono petitioners appeal the decision of the merit systems protection board board,which held that petitioners employer,the department of justice department or agency,acted permissibly in charging petitioners military leave allowance for days on which they were not scheduled to work,but they spent training with the military reserves.butterbaugh dep t of justice.the board concluded that the days of paid reserve training leave granted by a refers to calendar days of military training,not to workdays.we conclude,based on the text of the statute,that federal employees need take military leave only for those days on which they are required to work,and that section a thereby grants up to workdays of military leave.we therefore reverse the decision of the board and remand for further proceedings.
petitioners are employees of the department of justice,bureau of prisons,at the federal correctional institution in loretto,pennsylvania.petitioners are also members of the military reserves.like other reservists,petitioners are required to attend military training sessions each year.by statute,a,federal employees are granted up to days of paid leave to attend reserve or national guard training.
prior to,the department,as other federal agencies had done for decades,had included days on which employees were not scheduled to work,weekends and holidays when calculating how much military leave employees took.for example,an employee with a workweek attending reserve training from one friday through the next would be charged for eight days of military leave,even though the employee was absent for only six workdays.thus,the agency measured the grant of military leave by the number of calendar days employees spent in reserve training,rather than by the number of workdays on which they were absent from work.
at least in part due to this accounting practice,petitioners complain that they were forced to supplement their statutory military leave with other leave time to meet their reserve training obligations.petitioners assert that they took annual leave or leave without pay in order to serve the full period of their reserve training 
in,congress amended section to add subsection a,which states the minimum charge for leave under this subsection is one hour,and additional charges are in multiples thereof.a.although neither the amendment nor any legislative history accompanying the amendment addressed or altered the grant of days of leave in section a,the office of personnel management opm determined that,in light of the new subsection,section a could no longer be interpreted to charge against federal employees military leave 
based on new section a,it is clear that congress recognizes an civilian workday as the basis for accruing day of military leave and that there is no intent to charge an employee military leave for the hours that he or she would not otherwise work members of the reserves national guard will no longer be charged military leave for days typically weekends and holidays that occur within the period of military service.
memorandum for human resources directors,office of personnel management.the department,like other federal agencies,changed its military leave policy to conform to opm new interpretation.thus,petitioners grievances relate to past and not current agency policies.
petitioners filed complaints with the board,alleging that the agency practice of charging their military leave for,and thereby forcing them to use other leave to complete reserve training,violated the uniformed services employment and reemployment act of userra,by denying them a benefit of employment based on their military service.in an initial decision,the board administrative judge ruled that the board lacked jurisdiction over petitioners claim,because the agency had actually granted them their military leave and therefore their appeal did not allege the denial of a benefit of employment under userra and if the board had jurisdiction,the agency had a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its leave policy,because the agency was merely following opm guidance in charging against military leave.faltin dep t of justice,nos,merit.prot.bd.
petitioners sought review of the administrative judge initial decision by the full board.contrary to the administrative judge,the full board determined that it had jurisdiction over the appeal,because petitioners had made a nonfrivolous allegation under userra that they had been denied a benefit of employment due to their reserve service.butterbaugh,at.however,the board ruled that the department practice of charging against military leave did not deprive petitioners of a benefit of employment because,as a matter of statutory interpretation,the board held that the grant of days of leave in a meant calendar days of leave,not workdays.hence,agencies were properly charging petitioners for all days they spent in military training,whether or not those days were workdays.the board reached this conclusion beginning with the observation that the ordinary and accustomed meaning of day is a calendar day,indicating that section a grants calendar days of leave.further,for purposes of subchapter i of title,chapter,congress specifically defined day to be a workday,a,but did not do so for subchapter ii.this suggested to the board that congress did not intend for day to mean workday in subchapter ii,where section a is found.moreover,congress specifically used workdays in the sections of the statute granting extended active duty leave for reservists sections b and d of section,showing that congress knew how to specify workdays when it chose to.
finally,the board extensively reviewed the history of the leave statutes 
before,civilian federal employees were generally charged annual and sick leave for intervening that occurred during a period of leave.the rationale for that policy was apparently twofold first,that days generally refers to calendar days,including weekends and holidays and,second,that congress intended that employees,who were then paid for every day,including weekends and holidays,receive one month vacation with the time expressed in days because of the varying lengths of the calendar months.
an act provided,for the first time,that annual leave shall be charged exclusive of.that statute did not apply to sick leave and sick leave continued to be charged for intervening.
the first statute specifically granting civilian federal employees military leave of up to days a year for training was enacted in.act of may,ch,stat.that statute did not state whether intervening during a period of military leave were to be charged as leave,and in the absence of such language,military leave was administered consistent with the policy of charging annual leave and the policy for charging sick leave.
in,congress completed a significant overhaul of the federal leave system and defined days for purposes of annual and sick leave as being exclusive of.act of,title ii,stat.as discussed above,however,that definition was only applied to what would become codified as subchapter i of title.thus,for military leave purposes,days retained its ordinary meaning that the term had for all types of leave prior to the statutory change.
the civil service commission incorporated the practice for charging military leave into the federal personnel manual and the record contains a copy of the relevant provision from.when the civil service commission was abolished and the office of personnel management was created pursuant to the civil service reform act of,stat,the office of personnel management retained the provision,which the bureau of prisons incorporated into its leave policy.
despite making various changes to the military leave system in the last years,congress did not address the way military leave was charged until.see,stat.authorizing military reserve technicians up to workdays a year to participate in noncombat operations outside of the united states,stat.increasing the duties for which reservists are entitled to take military leave from federal employment,stat.making military leave available on a fiscal rather than calendar year basis and allowing the limited carrying over of military leave to future years,stat.authorizing days paid leave when a reservist or national guardsman is activated to enforce the law.
butterbaugh,at footnotes,citations,and paragraph numbers omitted.the board inferred from this history that congress approved of the way federal agencies had been administering section a.according to the board,because congress is presumed to know of administrative interpretations of a statute when it a statute without change,lorillard pons,d,congress would have acted to correct any administrative misinterpretation of section a when it revisited the military leave system in,and.given that congress took no such action until,when it supposedly changed the interpretation of section a by adding section a,the board concluded that the practice of charging against federal employees military leave had met with congress approval.
petitioners appeal the decision of the board.we exercise jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to a.
our review of the board decisions is circumscribed by statute.we must set aside findings or conclusions of the board that we find to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence.c.for purposes of this appeal,neither side contests the board determination that petitioners have alleged denial of a benefit of employment due to their performance of military duties,thereby alleging a userra violation by an executive agency actionable to the board under b.see yates merit.prot.moreover,we agree with the board that,in contrast to cases such as sheehan department of the navy,the question in this case is not whether petitioners military status was a substantial or motivating factor in the agency action,for agencies only grant military leave to employees who are also military reservists.
the issue,as the board perceived,is the correct interpretation of a petitioners can not claim they were denied a benefit of employment if the department granted them the full measure of leave due to them under section a accordingly,the only issue we must decide is whether the board correctly interpreted a.the board interpretation of a statute is a determination of law that we review de novo on appeal.marano dep t of justice.
the leave statute in question reads as follows,with the language in dispute emphasized 
subject to paragraph of this subsection pertaining to employees,an employee as defined by section of this title or an individual employed by the government of the district of columbia,permanent or temporary indefinite,is entitled to leave without loss in pay,time,or performance or efficiency rating for active duty,training as defined in section of title,funeral honors duty as described in section of title and section of title,or engaging in field or coast defense training under sections of title as a reserve of the armed forces or member of the national guard.leave under this subsection accrues for an employee or individual at the rate of days per fiscal year and,to the extent that it is not used in a fiscal year,accumulates for use in the succeeding fiscal year until it totals days at the beginning of a fiscal year.
a emphasis added.
the unadorned language of a statute is,as always,our starting point for statutory interpretation.turtle island restoration network evans,cert.denied,d.the government,as did the board,views this case as largely controlled by the language days per fiscal year in section a.amassing a wealth of authority maintaining that the plain and ordinary meaning of day is hours,or one calendar day,the government argues that leave accruing at days per year must therefore accrue at calendar days per year,not workdays.
we agree that the ordinary meaning of day is a calendar day,and that the leave granted by section a accumulates at the rate of calendar days per fiscal year.but to leap from this premise to the conclusion that are properly chargeable against military leave begs the question at the heart of this case whether an employee must be answerable to the government at all for time that he or she is not required to work.if one does not need leave from the government to attend reservist training on one own time,then leave time measured in calendar days is no different than leave time measured in workdays.as a general matter,employees are not accountable to their employers for time they are not required to work.we see no reason why federal employees need military leave for days on which they are not scheduled to work.
to put it another way,the days that section a refers to are leave days,not training days or reserve duty days.the statute purports to measure how many days of paid leave employees are entitled to,not how many days of reserve training they may attend.the result might be different if the statute provided that federal employees were entitled to attend days of reserve training per fiscal year,in which case the amount of leave would clearly be measured by the period of reserve training.indeed,this interpretation may have been correct for the original version of section a enacted in,which provided that a federal employee is entitled to leave without loss of pay for each day,not in excess of days in a calendar year,in which he is on active duty or is engaged in field or coast defense training a emphases added leave days were thus granted according to the actual period during which an employee was on duty,subject to a maximum.
but in,in the course of revising section a to grant leave by the fiscal year rather than by the calendar year,congress rephrased the statute into its present form,providing that leave accrues for an employee or individual at the rate of days per fiscal year,stat.emphasis added.in so doing,congress changed the computation of leave days from a variable measurement pegged to the actual length of military training,to a constant measurement of days.while leave computed by the actual period of reserve training necessarily includes in the calculation,leave measured by an absolute number of days does not.we therefore conclude that,at least since,the statutory text of a has granted federal employees leave with pay for days on which they would ordinarily be performing their duties for the federal government,rather than leave with pay for a training period of days including days on which they were not required to work.
in light of the foregoing discussion,it is largely irrelevant whether the term days in section a means workdays or calendar days.but even assuming that the choice between workday and calendar day is dispositive in this case,we are not persuaded that the days of section a must be calendar days.the government contends that congress knew how to distinguish between days and workdays,as in a,which explicitly defines days as workdays for purposes of subchapter i of title.because congress made no such provision for subchapter ii,in which section a resides,the government argues that congress by implication retained the ordinary meaning of day for purposes of subchapter ii.likewise,the government argues that congress specifically used the term workdays in the active duty leave provisions of section b and d,which demonstrates that congress uses the specific term workday when it intends for leave to be measured in workdays.
ordinarily,the government argument for consistency in statutory interpretation might carry considerable weight.however,petitioners direct our attention to another leave statute residing in subchapter ii of title,section,which grants federal employees three days of paid leave to attend the funeral of an immediate relative who died in combat while serving in the armed forces.section simply grants three days of leave,which,according to the government argument,is universally understood to mean calendar days rather than workdays.moreover,congress enacted the funeral leave statute at the same time it enacted the active duty leave provision of section b,and we see in those statutes the same distinction between days of funeral leave and workdays of active duty leave.b,reprinted in.one would therefore conclude that section grants three calendar days of funeral leave,not three workdays.yet immediately upon section passage,opm predecessor the civil service commission,acting by formal rulemaking and pursuant to explicit statutory authority,promulgated a regulation interpreting section to grant workdays of paid funeral leave.that regulation has remained unchanged to this day.see.
if opm,acting with the full majesty of formal rulemaking,has declared day in section to mean workday,then it is not apparent why day in section a should not.while consistency is not necessarily the paramount imperative of statutory interpretation,we,like other courts,are enough to expect that administrative agencies ordinarily will construe the same term in closely related statutes consistently.see,dep t of revenue of or.acf,d beliveau dep t of labor,cir.the government,despite invitations from this court,can not offer any rationale why day should mean workday for purposes of but not for a.absent such a rationale,it would seem arbitrary and capricious for the government to count when computing military leave,but not when computing other kinds of leave.
but the government treatment of was not even consistent within the military leave statute itself.under the interpretation of section a,employees were charged military leave for in the middle of a training period,but not for at the beginning or end of the training period.see to the sec y of the army,comp.for example,an employee with a work schedule who attended reserve training from one saturday to the next was charged for five days of military leave,because his bookended the training period and therefore did not count against her military leave.in contrast,a similarly situated employee with a thursday to monday schedule having tuesdays and wednesdays off was charged the full eight days of leave for a saturday to saturday training session,because his fell entirely within the training period and were counted against his leave.as was the case for the discrepancy between funeral leave and military leave,the government is unable to articulate any rationale why some counted as days under the former interpretation of section a,but some did not.these inconsistencies do not compel petitioners view of the statute.however,they largely negate the force of the government argument based on the distinction between day and workday.we therefore adhere to our conclusion that the text of section a does not support the charging of against military leave 
while we conclude that petitioners have the better reading of the statutory text,we concede that section a may be susceptible to more than one interpretation.because the will of congress may not have been expressed unequivocally,we therefore consider whether congress delegated to the department authority to interpret section a,entitling the department interpretation to a claim for judicial deference under chevron natural resources defense council,d.the government in particular contends that the department may assume the mantle of opm interpretive authority given that the department has merely followed opm policy guidance,and that opm interpretation of the statute is entitled to chevron deference on account of opm general authority to administer the federal personnel system.however,we conclude that the department policy is not entitled to chevron deference,either on its own or by deference inherited through opm.
putting aside the question of whether the department may lay claim to any deference that would be accorded to opm,see jones dep t of,there remains the problem that opm lacks explicit authority to administer section a.although the absence of express authority is not dispositive,a very good indicator of delegation meriting chevron treatment may be found in express congressional authorization to engage in formal rulemaking.united states mead,d.section is notable for the absence of explicit opm rulemaking authority.while congress specifically gave opm authority over all other subchapters of chapter,see subchapter i,annual and sick leave,subchapter iii,voluntary leave transfers,subchapter iv,leave bank program,subchapter v,family and medical leave,no such provision gives opm authority over subchapter ii,in which section appears.within subchapter ii,congress granted rulemaking authority to opm to administer sections jury and witness leave,funeral leave,and bone marrow or organ donor leave,but not section.admittedly,this pattern might reflect nothing more than the historical accretion of the leave statutes,for several other provisions of subchapter ii also lack a grant of authority to opm.nonetheless,the notable absence of explicit rulemaking authority must be weighed when determining whether the agency is entitled to chevron deference.
more significantly,neither the department nor opm has under any other statutory authority promulgated a formal rule setting forth its implementation of section.in response to an inquiry from petitioners union,the department indicated that its policy of charging reservists military leave for was embodied in the department time and attendance reporting handbook,and the opm military leave website.the record shows that the department position was earlier set forth by doj order b,dated july,while opm interpretation,as described by the board,derived from the federal personnel manual promulgated by the former civil service commission,and from published and unpublished comptroller general opinions issued in response to particular agency inquiries.
these sources are perhaps quintessential examples of policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines which lack the force of law and are not entitled to chevron deference.christensen harris county,d.like the absence of specific congressional authorization,the absence of rulemaking does not conclusively foreclose chevron deference,see barnhart walton,d mead,at,but this court has made clear that agency personnel policies embodied in informal sources such as handbooks and directives,including those originating in the federal personnel manual,do not ordinarily merit chevron deference.james von zemenszky,denial of rehearing james von zemenszky.
while the government does not actually attempt to distinguish von zemenszky from the present case,we interpret the government emphasis on the historical interpretation of the leave statutes as an argument that chevron deference is warranted here due to the and consistent interpretation of section a and its predecessors.as noted by the board,federal employees historically were charged leave for intervening falling within a period of leave,and the government directs us to comptroller general opinions stretching back to,all opining that reservists must be charged military leave for occurring within the period of their absence.matter of military leave,comp.to the attorney,wl,to the postmaster,comp.
the government does not suggest exactly why a administrative construction should be accorded more deference than those of more recent vintage.there is considerable logic to the position that,once chevron ceded to administrative agencies the power to select a permissible statutory construction in pursuit of policy goals,it became irrelevant whether the agency had adhered to that interpretation in the past,and for how long.see barnhart,at.scalia,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.nonetheless,the supreme court continues to accord extra deference to interpretations in the chevron inquiry,see barnhart,at,just as it has suggested that shifting interpretations are entitled to less,see good samaritan hosp.shalala,d.perhaps interpretations are thought more likely to be the result of reasoned agency deliberation rather than political expediency,though if the political branches are entrusted to implement policy there seems little reason to distinguish between the former and the latter.
here,however,the stability of the government interpretation does not overcome the lack of explicit congressional delegation or the absence of formal regulations.first,as we explain above,the operative element of the statutory text changed in,when congress revised the measure of the grant from days of training to days of leave.while subsequent pronouncements from opm and the comptroller general continued to rely on their older manuals and opinions for the interpretation that should be charged against military leave,congress revision of the statutory text undermined the foundation of those older opinions.
second,the interpretation of section a was never exposed to the light of formal rulemaking,but remained embedded in policy statements,handbooks,directives and the like.the agency interpretation here contrasts with those in cases such as barnhart,in which the court concluded that chevron deference was necessary because the agency interpretation was set forth in a formal regulation promulgated pursuant to statutory authority.barnhart,at.the stability of the agency interpretation at stake in barnhart may have answered criticisms that the agency position was in response to litigation,id.at,but it was not otherwise significant in the chevron analysis.we explained in von zemenszky that,absent special circumstances,factors such as the length of time over which the agency has considered the question do not confer chevron deference on personnel policies embodied in informal directives and handbooks.at.we find no special circumstances here that would overcome the ordinary reluctance to accord chevron deference to informal agency interpretations.
an informal agency interpretation may nonetheless claim a lesser degree of deference proportional to its power to persuade,depending on such factors as its thoroughness,logic,expertness,and fit with prior interpretations.mead,at.quoting skidmore swift.here,as we explain above,the government has been unable to propose any rationale or circumstance,other than the ossification of the statutory interpretation itself,that would support a claim for skidmore deference.we conclude that any deference owed to opm or the department under skidmore does not suffice to outweigh the contrary conclusions we draw from the statutory text.
aside from principles of administrative deference,the government advances an independent reason why age may grace a statutory interpretation with additional persuasive force namely,that congress may be presumed to know of administrative or judicial constructions,and to adopt that interpretation when it a statute without change.see,lorillard,at.but congressional inaction is perhaps the weakest of all tools for ascertaining legislative intent,and courts are loath to presume congressional endorsement unless the issue plainly has been the subject of congressional attention.see solid waste agency of cook county army corps of eng rs,d.extensive hearings,repeated efforts at legislative correction,and public controversy may be indicia of congress attention to the subject.lanehart horner.
while there is some evidence of congressional awareness here,we do not find it sufficient to establish congressional approval of the department interpretation of the statute.as noted by the board,when congress enacted,granting funeral leave and extended active duty reserve leave b,the senate report accompanying the legislation voiced concerns that federal employees were not being granted enough leave for reserve training.the post office and civil service committee directed the civil service commission to prepare a report on the matter,reprinted in.the commission report,discussing summer encampment training periods,stated that military leave is charged for intervening scheduled nonworkdays but not for scheduled nonworkdays at the beginning or end of a period of active duty.improve administration of leave system for federal employees hearings on before the house comm.on post office and civil,cong.report of the civil service commission the commission report further noted that federal employees most frequent complaints about the military leave system were military leave charges should be made for workdays,not calendar days,and military leave should be granted on a fiscal year,not a calendar year basis.id.at.the commission counseled congress against acting on either of these complaints.id.at.and congress took no action to alter the military leave system until,when its revisions of section a changed the measurement of leave days and established the fiscal year as the basis for military leave.congress made further minor amendments to section in,and,but left section a untouched until,when it added the minimum charge provision that induced opm to revise its interpretation of the statute.
none of this history rises to the level that would indicate congressional understanding of or acquiescence to the administrative interpretation of section a.while the civil service commission report disclosed,at least to the post office and civil service committees of congress,that federal employees were being charged military leave for falling within a period of military training,there is nothing in any of the legislative history demonstrating that congress,individually or collectively,knew of or was concerned with this aspect of the leave system.nor were there any legislative attempts to change the computation of leave days,the failure of which might indicate congress satisfaction with the status quo.moreover,to the extent that congress amendment rendered the historical interpretations of section a untenable,it can not be said that congress the statute without change.while there is no direct indication that congress amendment was intended to compel the exclusion of from military leave,that amendment upset the textual basis of the historical interpretation of the leave statute.we therefore can not conclude that congress has acquiesced to or endorsed the former administrative interpretation of section a current text.
conclusion 
for the reasons set forth above,we conclude that a can not be interpreted to require federal employees to expend military leave days for reserve training days on which they were not required to work.accordingly,the full board should have granted the petition for review on the ground that the decision of the administrative judge was based on an erroneous interpretation of the statute.we therefore reverse the decision of the board and remand the case for further proceedings.
reversed and remanded.
i respectfully dissent.in my view,the merit systems protection board was correct to conclude that,in light of the historical background of the military leave statute,the four petitioners were not denied military leave to which they were entitled.
this case turns on the meaning of the allowance of days per year for military leave in the version of that was in effect before the statute was amended in.the court states that the question in this case is whether an employee must be answerable to the government at all for time that he or she is not required to work,and then answers that question by stating as a general matter,employees are not accountable to their employers for time they are not required to work.we see no reason why federal employees need military leave for days on which they are not scheduled to work.but that is not a fair characterization of the question presented in this case.the version of the military leave statute that was applied to the petitioners in this case did not require them to be accountable to the government for days on which they were not required to work.the statute simply provided a set period of time during which congress wanted to ensure employees would receive paid leave from their civilian jobs for purposes of engaging in military training.the question in this case is how to calculate that period.based on an imposing amount of evidence,the merit systems protection board concluded that congress intended the period to be calculated by counting from the beginning of the military leave period to the end,without skipping intervening.reaching the proper result in this case requires us to decide what congress intended with respect to a question of counting mechanics it does not require us to conclude that congress viewed federal employees on military leave as accountable to the government for days that they did not work.moreover,the fact that the court finds the board interpretation of the statute to be contrary to general leave practices in employment,including federal civilian employment,ignores the fact that,at the time the military leave statute was enacted,the general practice to which the court alludes was the exception,not the rule.
before,federal civilian employees were charged annual and sick leave for all calendar days,including,that occurred during the leave period.see act of,ch,stat,authorizing a leave of absence which shall not exceed thirty days in any one year act of,ch,stat,authorizing heads of departments to grant days annual leave and days sick leave annually to employees act of,ch,stat,authorizing thirty days annual leave with pay in any one year,which period may be extended because of illness by an additional period not exceeding thirty days in any one case or in any one calendar year act of july,ch,stat,clarifying that a period of days annual leave may be granted to an employee who has had no more than days leave with pay on account of sickness during the same year op.att y,ruling that the correct interpretation of the law is to charge sundays and holidays against the absentee when they intervene during the period of absence op.att y,leaves of absence include sundays legal holidays,comp.the opinion of the comptroller of the treasury,which contains the most detailed analysis among the contemporaneous constructions of the early statutes,was based in large part on the general legal principle that w here the time limited by statute for a particular purpose is such as must necessarily include one or more sundays,they are to be included in the enumeration,unless they are expressly excluded or the intention of the legislature to exclude them is manifest.comp.at see also computation of leaves of absence to employees of repair shops,comp.
in,congress explicitly changed that rule with respect to annual leave for federal civil servants.see act of,ch,stat.as the board notes,however,the statute did not apply to sick leave,and the agencies therefore continued to charge employees with sick leave for intervening during a period of leave.that practice was not changed until.moreover,statutes that did not specify that leave periods included only workdays continued to be construed to include in computing leave periods.see to the attorney,comp.comp.at comp.at op.att y at.
the first statute granting military leave for civilian employees of the federal government was enacted in.act of may,ch,stat.that statute granted up to days of military leave each year for members of the officers reserve corps on all days during which they shall be ordered to duty with troops or at field exercises,or for instruction.although the statute did not state whether intervening during a period of military leave were to be charged as leave,the statute was consistently applied in accordance with the system for calculating annual leave and the policy for calculating sick leave.see to the attorney,comp.no.to the sec y of the army,comp.calculating military leave in that way,moreover,was consistent with the training requirements for federal employees who were members of reserve and national guard units.those training requirements,which had just been adopted in the previous year,featured one extended training period per year for which the employee would have to take leave from his civilian job.see act of june,ch,stat,members of the regular army reserve subject to field training for up to days per year id,stat.at members of officers reserve corps subject to duty or instructional service of up to days per year id,stat.at members of enlisted reserve corps subject to be ordered to instructional or training periods of up to days per year id,stat.at members of national guard subject to drills plus an instructional period of at least days in training each year.
the same requiring training periods of days per year and granting a corresponding period of days of military unchanged in any essential respect for many years.see act of,stat,members of the fleet naval reserve required to perform training not to exceed days annually id,stat.members of fleet naval reserve entitled to leave of absence from their federal employment for periods not to exceed days in any one calendar year naval reserve act of,stat,armed forces reserve act of,c,stat.the comptroller general,although requested to reconsider that office interpretation of the military leave statute on several occasions,continued to construe the statute as requiring that within a period of military leave be counted against the military leave allotment.see to the sec y of the army,comp,finding it significant that a recent amendment to the military leave statute contains no express or implied language that the theretofore method of charging military leave upon a calendar basis,which was well known to the congress,was in anywise to be changed to the sec y of the army,comp.at to the sec y of agriculture,comp,to the postmaster,comp.
in,the various training statutes were consolidated into a single section as part of the recodification of titles and of the united states code.see act of.no,stat.the training requirements were codified at b and a.the period of allowable military leave was found at,a,stat,and was codified at a.the latter statute,which is now a,read in as follows 
each reserve of the armed forces or member of the national guard who is an officer or employee of the united states or the district of columbia,permanent or temporary indefinite,without regard to classification or terminology peculiar to the civil service system,is entitled to leave of absence from his duties,without loss of pay,time,or efficiency rating for each day,but not more than days in any calendar year,in which he is on active duty or is engaged in field or coast defense training under sections of title,united states code.
the period of military leave authorized in that statute,as in its predecessors,was construed as being calendar days,not workdays.in a opinion dealing with the fleet reserve,the comptroller general explained 
not only is it apparent from the plain language of the statute that the period of leave relates to,and must be governed by,the period of training duty,but the legislative history also supports this view we think it is evident that the intention of congress was to grant,authority for the performance by naval reservists of training duty for periods of not to exceed days and,to provide,so far as government employees are concerned,that their pay,time,or efficiency rating should not be adversely affected by reason of their performing such duty.thus,both the plain language and legislative history of the statute,viewed in the light of the preceding statutes with which it is entirely consistent and on which it was undoubtedly patterned,make it clear that the phrase from his duties may not be construed as an express exclusion of sundays and holidays from the computation of leave for periods of military training ordered thereunder.
to the attorney,comp.no.
in,as part of an overhaul of the federal leave system,congress provided that both annual and sick leave for federal employees would be charged without counting.see,stat.the new statute specifically provided that the days of leave provided for in the statute shall mean days upon which an employee would otherwise work and receive pay,and shall be exclusive of holidays and all nonworkdays established by federal statute or by executive or administrative order.id.a,stat.at.the statute applied only to annual and sick leave and did not apply to other forms of leave,such as military leave.
from this background,it is evident that,as of,the rules applicable to military leave were clear the period of military leave was routinely charged on the basis of calendar days,so that intervening were counted against the period.at the beginning or end of the period,however,were not counted.therefore,if an employee whose normal work week was monday through friday began his or her military training service on a monday and returned to work two mondays later,the employee would be charged for the intervening weekend days,but not the weekend days at the beginning or end of the military leave period.
that was the state of the law as of,and i do not understand the court to disagree.if that is correct,then the board decision in this case must be upheld unless we can say that,at some point between and the leave year at issue in this case,a change was made that required the military leave statute to be construed differently.as detailed below,no such change occurred.
in,the military leave statute was recodified as a,stat.in,congress made two relevant changes in the leave statutes.first,it amended section to grant military leave of up to workdays to reservists or members of the national guard who are activated for law enforcement purposes.second,it enacted section,which granted up to three days paid leave for employees to attend the funeral of an immediate relative in the armed forces who died as a result of injuries incurred in a combat area,stat.
significantly,the legislation distinguished between the workdays of leave that reservists would be granted,which the house committee report and proponents of the legislation pointed out would amount to approximately calendar days,and the days of military leave ordinarily provided for training,which the chairman of the civil service commission pointed out meant calendar days.see,at.the house committee report thus reflects a clear understanding that the days of military leave provided by section a was,and would continue to be,calculated on the basis of calendar days,not workdays.
in the course of congress consideration of the legislation,a question arose as to whether the amount of military leave provided under section a was adequate.to address that issue,the senate committee on post office and civil service directed the civil service commission to report back to the committee as to whether there was a need to provide more paid leave to federal employees for military training.see,at,reprinted in.in its response,the commission submitted a detailed report,in which the commission made clear that military leave was charged on a calendar day basis and concluded that there was no need to change that practice.see civil service comm n,bureau of policies standards,military leave for reservists national,reprinted in improve administration of leave system for federal employees hearings before the subcomm.on employee benefits of the house comm.on post office civil service,cong.the report stated 
the suggestion that military leave be charged on a workday rather than a calendar day basis is,in effect,a request for additional military leave.it has been shown,in previous sections of this report,that days of military leave is sufficient to meet the normal requirements of the reserves or national guard.any increase in the amount of military leave with pay would result in increased cost to the government 
the calendar days of military leave allowable adequately met the needs of the vast majority of reservists and national guardsmen in.
id.at.no statutory change was made as a result of the commission report.
the court does not suggest that the amendment altered the prior regime.in fact,it acknowledges that the board interpretation may have been correct for the original version of section a enacted in.however,the court concludes that an important change in the statute was made in,when the language of the military leave statute was altered.
the version of section a provided that a federal civilian employee is entitled to leave without loss of pay,time,or performance or efficiency rating for each day,not in excess of days in a calendar year,in which he is one active duty or is engaged in field or coast defense training with the reserves or the national guard.the amendment changed that formulation.it omitted the language for each day,not in excess of days a calendar year,in which he is on active duty or is engaged in field or coast defense training.in place of that language,the amendment inserted the words for active duty or engaging in field or coast training,and added a new sentence stating,leave under this subsection accrues for an employee or individual at the rate of days per fiscal year and,to the extent that it is not used in a fiscal year,accumulates for use in the succeeding fiscal years until it totals days at the beginning of a fiscal year,stat.
the court finds that through that amendment congress changed the computation of leave days from a variable measurement pegged to the actual length of military training,to a constant measurement of days,and thereby changed the method of calculating military leave from counting calendar days to counting workdays.according to the court,while leave computed by the actual period of reserve training necessarily includes in the calculation,leave measured by an absolute number of days does not.
i disagree that the amendment made that fundamental change in the meaning of the statute.nothing about the language used in the formulation,under which leave accrues at the rate of days per fiscal year requires that the days be interpreted to as workdays rather than calendar days.the most that can be said for the new language is that it is possible to read the formulation as excluding,while it is more difficult to read the language in that fashion.but that proposition falls far short of establishing that the statute must be given the interpretation that the court assigns to it.
the legislative history of the act is highly instructive on this point.the house report on the legislation explicitly states that the legislation was intended to make only three changes in existing law,at,reprinted in.it was intended to make military leave available on a fiscal year basis rather than a calendar year basis to allow federal employees to carry over some or all of their military leave to the succeeding fiscal year and to grant employees a proportional share of the military leave provided to employees.id.the principal problem addressed was the hardship that occurred when employees had to attend two training sessions in the same calendar year and could not carry over military leave to accommodate the scheduled sessions.there is no indication in the brief report of any intention to change the method of computing the days of allowable military leave from calendar days to workdays.
the hearing that was held on the bill that became the amendment to section makes clear that the focus of the legislation was on allowing military leave to be carried over,and that no change was intended to the method of calculating military leave.see retirement appeals,military leave,quadrennial pay comm n,hearing before the subcomm.on compensation employee benefits of the comm.on post office civil service,house of representatives,cong.moreover,the witnesses who appeared before the subcommittee made clear that they regarded as not at issue in the proposed the days of military leave were to be used for the training period required for members of the reserves and the national guard.see id.at.as in the house report,there was no suggestion at the hearing that any change in the method of calculation was intended.it thus seems clear that the change in the language of section a was made solely to provide additional flexibility for employees whose units might schedule two training sessions in a single calendar year and who might have to carry over military leave from one year to another.the contrary construction is by no means required by the language of the act,and in light of the complete absence of any indication of an intention to change the longstanding method of calculating military leave,the act can not fairly be interpreted as effecting that change.
in the aftermath of the amendment to section,the comptroller general on several occasions revisited the issue of how to calculate military leave,and consistently ruled that the calendar day system that was in place before was still in effect after the revision.see in re military duty spans two or more fiscal years,comp,in re haas,comp.in re mcmillian,comp.in re afge local,comp,in re campbell,comp.
section a was amended in minor respects after,but none of those amendments has any arguable effect on this case.accordingly,if as i
