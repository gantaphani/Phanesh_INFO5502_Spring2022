appellants,current and former navy chaplains of protestant faiths and their endorsing agency,brought suit alleging the navy has unconstitutionally established and maintained a religious quota system for the promotion,assignment,and retention of navy chaplains that disadvantages chaplains of protestant faiths.in the midst of discovery,appellants moved for preliminary and structural injunctions and for partial summary judgment.the district court denied the motion in its entirety,finding,in particular,that appellants had failed to demonstrate the irreparable injury necessary to warrant preliminary injunctive relief.we affirm the district court as to its denial of a structural injunction,and we have no jurisdiction to review its denial of partial summary judgment however,because we conclude appellants have satisfied the requisite showing of irreparable harm for an establishment clause violation,we vacate the district court judgment denying preliminary injunctive relief and remand for the district court to proceed with the remainder of the preliminary injunction determination.
the united states navy maintains a chaplain corps to meet the spiritual needs of those who serve in the navy and their families.adair england,d,citation and internal quotation mark omitted.chaplains serve as naval officers and,like other military officers,both regular and reserve,receive periodic reviews by promotion selection boards that determine which officers should be recommended for promotion.id.at.any officer a promotion selection board considers but does not recommend for promotion is deemed to have failed of selection fos to the higher grade.the military may convene a special selection board for officers who were erroneously not considered by a promotion selection board,or who were considered but did not receive lawful or proper consideration.id,secnav instruction b,special promotion selection boards for commissioned and warrant officers in the navy and marine corps b dep t of the navy.
federal law mandates separation from military service based on criteria relating to age,grade,and failures of selection.in general,naval reserve officers who have not been recommended for promotion to the grade of rear admiral lower half must be separated from the military on the last day of the month they reach years of age.the secretary of the navy is afforded some flexibility to deviate from this rule,however.provided a reserve officer in the chaplain corps has not twice failed to be promoted to the next higher grade,the secretary may retain the chaplain until age.id.a.ordinarily,a second fos makes separation mandatory,id,but even officers who would otherwise be precluded from further service for having twice failed of selection may,subject to the needs of the service,be considered for continuation under regulations prescribed by the secretary of defense,id.a secnav instruction b,continuation on active duty of regular commissioned officers and reserve officers on the reserve active status list rasl in the navy and marine corps dep t of the navy,dod directive,continuation of regular commissioned officers on active duty and reserve commissioned officers on the reserve active status list dep t of defense,chaplains retained under this continuation exception may also serve until age.secnav instruction b dod directive.

the navy divides its chaplains into four categories according to common faith group characteristics catholic,liturgical protestant,protestant,and special worship.liturgical protestant refers to protestant denominations that trace their origins to the reformation,retain an established liturgy in their worship services,and practice infant baptism it includes lutheran,episcopal,methodist,presbyterian,and congregational faiths.adair,d at.nonliturgical protestant refers to protestant denominations that do not have a formal liturgy or order in their worship services,that baptize only those who have reached the age of reason,and whose clergy generally do not wear religious vestments during services it includes baptist,evangelical,pentecostal,and charismatic faiths.see also in re england,

the instant appeal stems from the district court denial of appellants latest motion,filed in the midst of discovery.appellants interrogatory requested a list of chaplains on active duty over age and their denominations.from the navy response,appellants identified fifteen catholic reserve chaplains over age,fourteen of whom are lieutenants or lieutenant commanders who have twice failed of selection and yet remain on active duty.mem.of in supp.of pls.mot.for a prelim.and structural inj.and partial summ.june,pls.mem.appellants br.appellants also identified seven of these fos catholic chaplains as age or greater.pls.mem.at.
armed with this evidence,appellants moved for preliminary and structural injunctions and partial summary judgment.appellants contended the age ceiling established by prohibits the navy from allowing the identified reserve lieutenant and lieutenant commander chaplains over age to remain on active duty.id.even if the chaplains remained in service past age under,appellants argued,the navy violated that provision absolute age limit of by retaining seven chaplains of or over that age.id.appellants also maintained that none of the chaplains over age possessed sufficient time in service to qualify for retirement and the resulting pension,and that the navy gave those chaplains over age a personnel classification,meaning retired reservist recalled to active duty,even though none of them possessed the requisite time in service to qualify for retirement and for the navy legally to recall them.id.at 
the navy actions,in appellants words,evidence a well established practice of allowing catholic naval reserve chaplains,and only catholic chaplains,to remain on active duty beyond mandatory separation age limits,constituting religious favoritism in violation of the establishment clause.id.at.appellants also accused the navy of fraud in covering up this illegal retention by wrongfully employing the classification with respect to catholic chaplains over age.id.at.the navy scheme,according to appellants,appears on its face to have no other purpose but to allow these chaplains to illegally qualify for retirement.id.appellants sought relief that would,among other things,require the navy to separate immediately those chaplains it has allowed to continue on active duty beyond age.id.at.
the district court denied the motion in its entirety.the district court first rejected preliminary injunctive relief because appellants failed to demonstrate any irreparable injury.mem.op.at.in so doing,it repudiated appellants argument that violation of the law,including the first amendment and,specifically,the establishment clause,per se constitutes irreparable harm.id.at.the district court then denied partial summary judgment because adequate time for discovery had not passed.id.at.appellants timely appealed.

the purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held.of camenisch,d.it is an extraordinary remedy that should be granted only when the party seeking the relief,by a clear showing,carries the burden of persuasion.cobell norton.to warrant preliminary injunctive relief,the moving party must show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits,that it would suffer irreparable injury if the injunction were not granted,that an injunction would not substantially injure other interested parties,and that the public interest would be furthered by the injunction,mova pharm,quoting cityfed fin.office of thrift supervision,internal quotation marks omitted.a district court must balance the strengths of the requesting party arguments in each of the four required areas.cityfed,at.if the showing in one area is particularly strong,an injunction may issue even if the showings in other areas are rather weak.id.despite this flexibility,though,a movant must demonstrate at least some injury for a preliminary injunction to issue,id.quoting population inst.mcpherson,internal quotation marks omitted,for the basis of injunctive relief in the federal courts has always been irreparable harm,sampson murray,d quoting beacon theatres,westover,d brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.a movant failure to show any irreparable harm is therefore grounds for refusing to issue a preliminary injunction,even if the other three factors entering the calculus merit such relief.see,sea containers stena ab.

this court has set a high standard for irreparable injury.first,the injury must be both certain and great it must be actual and not theoretical.gas ferc,per curiam.the moving party must show t he injury complained of is of such imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief to prevent irreparable harm.id.citations,brackets,and internal quotation marks omitted.second,the injury must be beyond remediation.as we have stated 
the key word in this consideration is irreparable.mere injuries,however substantial,in terms of money,time and energy necessarily expended in the absence of a stay are not enough.the possibility that adequate compensatory or other corrective relief will be available at a later date,in the ordinary course of litigation weighs heavily against a claim of irreparable harm.

appellants fail to articulate a tangible injury that is either certain and great or irreparable.appellants argue the navy allegedly unlawful practice of retaining catholic chaplains past applicable age limits precludes protestant chaplains from advancing to higher grades,since congress and the navy cap the number of officers per grade.see a,a decl.of captain lyman smith noting that congress provides an annual authorization of officers by grade,which the navy further breaks down by community,for example,chaplain corps.such an injury is far too speculative to warrant preliminary injunctive relief.at most,the navy purported practice reduces appellants opportunities for promotion,which are themselves dependent upon the number of chaplain corps vacancies congress and the navy authorize each year.appellants perhaps inadvertently reveal the hypothetical nature of their tangible injury when they refer to the ultimate relief which would eventually follow resolution of these cases,possible promotions.appellants reply br.emphasis added.this statement underscores the absence in this proceeding of any discrete injury that is of such imminence that equitable relief is urgently necessary.
in addition,appellants asserted tangible injury is redressable.the navy is authorized to convene special selection boards to review a previous,secnav instruction within the reserves,the navy may convene such a board if an officer or former officer failed to receive a promotion selection board recommendation because,among other reasons,the initial board acted contrary to law or its action involved a material error of fact.b a secnav instruction b a.if the special selection board recommends the promotion of a current officer,that officer shall,as soon as practicable,be appointed to the next higher grade and shall,upon such promotion,have the same date of rank,the same effective date for the pay and allowances of that officer grade,and the same position on the active duty list or the reserve active status list that officer would have had if the original promotion selection board had correctly recommended the officer for promotion.e secnav instruction.b.former officers who prevail before the special selection board are entitled to revision of their military record to correct an error or remove an injustice resulting from not being selected for promotion by the initial board.e.monetary remedies are available to such officers if,as a result of correcting a record,an amount is found to be due.id.see also,marsh johnson,d,describing correction of record and back payment award to retired officer after special selection board reversal of previous failure to recommend for promotion.these measures ensure that,should the courts eventually conclude the navy has an unlawful practice of retaining catholic chaplains past applicable age limits to the detriment of protestant chaplains,adequate compensatory or other corrective relief is available to appellants,belying their claims of irreparable tangible harm at this point.
having failed to assert a tangible injury that constitutes irreparable harm,appellants are left to argue that the navy alleged violation of the establishment clause per se constitutes irreparable harm.the district court rejected this proposition,but we disagree.
appellants argument that they would suffer irreparable harm without a preliminary injunction rests on a statement by a plurality in elrod burns,d plurality opinion,that t he loss of first amendment freedoms,for even minimal periods of time,unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.id.at.because appellants claim appellees practice of retaining overage catholic chaplains constitutes an impermissible denominational preference in violation of the establishment clause,they urge us to apply the language of the elrod plurality on its face and conclude that appellants have demonstrated irreparable,the harm that flows from the forbidden message of marginalization appellees actions send to appellants.appellants br.they note several of our sister circuits have employed elrod to find irreparable harm where moving parties alleged a violation of the establishment other words,the precise context in which we find ourselves.see aclu of mccreary county,cir,aff on other grounds,d ingebretsen jackson pub.sch,cir parents ass of quinones,cir.
appellees,in contrast,maintain elrod is inapposite because that case involved political speech and expression,a context far removed from the establishment clause allegations appellants advance.they also assert the rationale underlying the elrod plurality statement was a concern that without preliminary injunctive relief,the first amendment rights to speech and expression would be chilled during the pendency of litigation,a harm that could not be redressed after final judgment.appellees maintain appellants have not identified any constitutionally protected behavior that may be chilled in the absence of a preliminary injunction accordingly,they claim,the concerns motivating the elrod plurality are not present here and appellants mere allegations,without more,do not support a finding of irreparable injury.
at first blush,appellees appear to have the better of this debate.elrod involved political speech and freedom of expression.there,republican patronage employees of a county sheriff department brought suit against,among others,a newly elected county sheriff who was a democrat.elrod,at.plurality opinion.at the time,it was common for an incoming sheriff of a different political party to replace employees with members of his own party when the existing employees lacked or failed to obtain requisite support from,or failed to affiliate with,the new sheriff political party.id.at.the elrod plaintiffs alleged they had been discharged,or threatened with discharge,solely for these reasons and claimed a violation of,inter alia,the first amendment.id.at.upon review,a plurality consisting of justices brennan,white,and marshall,with justice brennan writing,held,after lengthy discussion,that patronage dismissals are unconstitutional under the first amendment and that plaintiffs had therefore stated a claim.id.at.the plurality then briefly turned to whether a preliminary injunction was warranted,a determination that hinged upon whether plaintiffs had made out an irreparable injury concluding they had,the plurality stated 
it is clear that first amendment interests were either threatened or in fact being impaired at the time relief was sought.the loss of first amendment freedoms,for even minimal periods of time,unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.see new york times united states,d.since such injury was both threatened and occurring at the time of plaintiffs motion and since plaintiffs sufficiently demonstrated a probability of success on the merits,the court of appeals might properly have held that the district court abused its discretion in denying preliminary injunctive relief.
id.at.in a footnote to this passage,the plurality noted,the timeliness of political speech is particularly important.id.at.
the facts of elrod,which involved dismissals from government jobs for failure to ascribe to or gain the approval of a political party the plurality citation to new york times,a landmark free expression case and the footnote stressing the timeliness of political speech make evident that the pertinent elrod language on which appellants rely is directed toward circumstances concerning freedom of expression.indeed,in almost all of the many subsequent cases in which our sister circuits have invoked the elrod plurality statement,the operative first amendment liberties allegedly violated were variants of expressive liberties,such as the rights to speak,associate,petition,or exercise one religion.see,pac.frontier pleasant grove city,cir tucker city of fairfield,cir joelner village of washington park,cir newsom albemarle county sch,cir brown cal.dep t of,cir tenafly eruv ass borough of tenafly,cir iowa right to life,williams,cir bery city of new york,cir.women med.clinic mcmillan,cir romero feliciano torres gaztambide,cir cate oldham,cir.the number of cases applying elrod to alleged establishment clause violations is comparatively meager,see mccreary,at baker adams valley sch,cir per curiam ingebretsen,at quinones,at,and,furthermore,each of these decisions cites elrod only in passing,devoid of any analysis of its particular context.the single court that focused on elrod facts recognized the statement at issue here was made in the context of free speech and rejected applying it axiomatically to establishment clause claims.aclu of city of charles,cir.therefore,there is superficial merit to appellees argument that elrod ought to play no role in the proceeding before us,which turns entirely on establishment claims.
in addition,appellees accurately note that this court has construed elrod to require movants to do more than merely allege a violation of freedom of expression in order to satisfy the irreparable injury prong of the preliminary injunction.rather,moving parties must also establish they are or will be engaging in constitutionally protected behavior to demonstrate that the allegedly impermissible government action would chill allowable individual conduct.thus,for example,in national treasury employees union united states,we refused to find irreparable harm where federal employees sought a preliminary injunction after alleging that ethics laws prohibiting them from making appearances,delivering speeches,and writing articles for compensation violated their first amendment rights.id.we noted that while the loss of first amendment freedoms,for even minimal periods of time,may constitute irreparable injury,id.at quoting elrod,at.plurality opinion brackets and internal quotation marks omitted,movants must show that their first amendment interests are either threatened or in fact being impaired at the time relief is sought,id.at quoting wagner taylor,quoting elrod,at.plurality opinion brackets omitted.we concluded that because the record did not suggest the plaintiffs would cease speaking or writing before the district court resolved their claims,irreparable harm would not follow and preliminary relief could not issue.id.at.several other courts have adopted this approach,which emphasizes that where it is not clear that a particular statute,policy,or practice will have any actual adverse effect on protected first amendment liberties,the moving party must demonstrate some likelihood of a chilling effect on their rights.as the second circuit has stated 
where a plaintiff alleges injury from a rule or regulation that directly limits speech,the irreparable nature of the harm may be presumed in contrast,in instances where a plaintiff alleges injury from a rule or regulation that may only potentially affect speech,the plaintiff must establish a causal link between the injunction sought and the alleged injury,that is,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the injunction will prevent the feared deprivation of free speech rights.
bronx household of faith bd.of,cir see also hohe casey,cir t he assertion of first amendment rights does not automatically require a finding of irreparable injury rather the plaintiffs must show a chilling effect on free expression.quoting dombrowski pfister,d am.postal workers union postal,cir laird tatum,d.accordingly,appellees are correct when they assert that in this court,as in several others,there is no per se rule that a violation of freedom of expression automatically constitutes irreparable harm.appellees br.
but the crucial distinction appellees fail to recognize,and which ultimately undermines their position,is that freedom of expression is not the operative first amendment right at issue in this case.it is not the freedom to speak,to associate,to petition,to exercise one religion,or any other liberty that protects an individual freedom to engage in a particular activity.rather,the pertinent liberty here is protection against government imposition of a state religion or religious preference.this protection,unlike other first amendment rights that are variants o
