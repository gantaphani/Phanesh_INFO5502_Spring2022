plaintiffs,fifteen employees of the san antonio fire department,who are members of either the united states military reserves or the national guard uniformed services,brought this civil action under the uniform services employment and reemployment rights act of userra against the city of san antonio,texas for declaratory,injunctive,and equitable relief compensation for lost wages and benefits and additional liquidated damages.the plaintiffs contend that the city violated userra by denying them employment benefits because of their absences from work while performing their military duties in the uniformed services.more specifically,the employees assert that the city collective bargaining agreement cba and policies regarding military leave of absence deprive them of straight and overtime pay,opportunities to earn extra vacation leave and vacation scheduling flexibility,and opportunities to secure unscheduled overtime work and job upgrades.plaintiffs assert that under userra a the city,in implementing these employment practices,unlawfully discriminates against them by deeming them absent from work whenever they are on leave fulfilling their military reserve duties,as opposed to viewing them as constructively present at work.the city contends that,because b provides that persons absent from civilian employment by reason of military service are entitled only to such rights and benefits as the employer provides to employees when they are on leaves of absence,plaintiffs can not recover since they were treated equally as to such rights with all employees absent on leave.
plaintiffs are employed by the city fire department in its fire suppression division and emergency medical services division firefighters.the cba between the city and the employees union governs the working conditions of all city firefighters.plaintiffs,as members of the uniformed services reservists,typically must take leave of absence for military training a minimum of one weekend per month and one annual two week session.reservists may volunteer or be ordered to take military leave to perform extra duties.in order to be promoted,reservists must meet the same educational requirements as a active member of the uniformed services,such as officer training courses.
the parties agreed to bifurcate the liability and damages issues and filed for partial summary judgment on the question of whether the city violated userra and is therefore liable to the plaintiffs.they also filed on whether the plaintiffs claims were barred or curtailed by a statute of limitations,laches or estoppel.the record consists principally of a joint stipulation of facts,the cba,and a number of depositions.
the district court granted the employees motion as to liability on substantially all claims and denied the city.the district court then referred the regarding the statute of limitations,laches and estoppel to a magistrate judge.the magistrate judge granted plaintiffs motion on these issues,holding that the employees were entitled to recover retrospective damages for the period preceding the filing of their complaint.the district court determined that the summary judgments on the issues of liability and limitations on retrospective recovery involve a controlling question of law to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion,and certified the judgments for interlocutory appeal under b the city appealed.
standards of review 
the threshold question of law is one of statutory construction,namely which provision of userra,a or b,governs the adjudication of the employees claims.the employees contend that the district court correctly applied only a,which prohibits private employers from denying employment benefits to employees on the basis or their membership,service or obligations related to the united states military forces.the city contends that the district court erred in basing its decision on a because this case is appropriately governed only by b,which regulates the civilian employment rights of persons who are required to be absent from jobs for service in the military forces.we review the decision of the district court on this issue of law de novo.see casas american airlines,cir.
once we have interpreted the statute and decided upon its proper application,we address the parties de novo,applying the same standards prescribed for use by the district court.see walker thompson,cir.
in order to decide how userra should be interpreted and applied in this case we will set forth an overview of the statute to give perspective to our reading of its parts.because the statute is subject to different interpretations we will examine its legislative history,predecessor statutes,pertinent court decisions,and administrative interpretations.
userra overview 
the purposes of userra,enacted in,are to encourage noncareer service in the uniformed services by eliminating or minimizing the disadvantages to civilian employment which can result from such service to provide for the prompt reemployment of persons returning to civilian jobs from military service and to minimize the disruption of their lives as well as to those of their employers,fellow employees and communities and to prohibit discrimination against persons because of their service in the uniformed services.
userra is the most recent in a series of laws protecting veterans employment and reemployment rights dating from the selective training and service act of userra immediate precursor,the veterans reemployment rights act vrra,was enacted as of the vietnam era veterans readjustment assistance act of congress emphasized userra continuity with the vrra and its intention to clarify and strengthen that law.federal laws protecting veterans employment and reemployment rights for the past fifty years had been successful.t he large body of case law that had developed under those statutes remained in full force and effect,to the extent it is consistent with userra.
userra provision prohibits an employer from denying initial employment,reemployment,retention in employment,promotion,or any benefit of employment to a person on the basis of membership,application for membership,performance of service,application for service,or obligation of service.a.also,an employer must not retaliate against a person by taking adverse employment action against that person because he or she has taken an action to enforce a protection afforded under userra.id.at b.
any person whose absence from a position of employment is necessitated by reason of service in the uniformed services is entitled to the reemployment rights and benefits of userra.id.at a.the returning uniform services member reservist seeking reemployment must make a timely return to or application for reinstatement in the reservist employment position.id.at a.the employee reporting back to the employer following a period of less than days must report not later than the beginning of the first full shift on the first full day following the completion of service.id.at e a i if the service period is between and days,the individual must report within days of completion of service.id.at c.if the service was more than days,the individual must request reemployment no more than days after completion.id.at e d.
an employer must promptly reemploy a person returning from a period of service if the person meets the act eligibility criteria.id.at f.prompt employment means as soon as practicable under the circumstances of the case.for example,prompt reinstatement after weekend national guard duty generally means the next regularly scheduled working day.however,prompt reinstatement after several years of active duty may require more time,because the employer may have to reassign or give notice to another employee who occupied the position.
in construing a precursor to userra,the supreme court in fishgold sullivan drydock and repair,invented the escalator principle in stating that a returning service member does not step back on the seniority escalator at the point he stepped off.he steps back on at the precise point he would have occupied had he kept his position continuously during the war.id.at.although fishgold was mainly a seniority case,the escalator principle applies to the employment position,and rate of pay,as well as the seniority rights to which the returning service member is entitled 
thus,userra requires that the service member be reemployed in the escalator job position comparable to the position he would have held had he remained continuously in his civilian employment.after service of days or less,the person is entitled to reinstatement in the position of employment in which she or he would have been but for the interruption of employment by uniformed service.id.at a a if the service period was longer than days,the service member is entitled to reemployment in the escalator position,but the employer may also reinstate the member in any position of like seniority status and pay for which he is qualified.a a.if the service member is unable to qualify for either the escalator position or a comparable position,despite reasonable employer efforts,he is entitled to reemployment in a position that is the nearest approximation to the escalator position.id.at a a,b 
a person who is reemployed under userra is entitled to the seniority and other rights and benefits determined by seniority that the person had on the date of the beginning of service plus the additional seniority and rights and benefits that he or she would have attained if the person had remained continuously employed id.at a.this section states the basic escalator principle as it applies to seniority and rights and benefits an employer is not required to have a seniority system.userra requires only that employers who do have a seniority system restore the returning service member to the proper place on the seniority ladder an employee rate of pay after an absence from work due to uniformed service is also determined by application of the escalator principle 
userra does not grant escalator protection to service members rights and benefits but provides only that the employer treat employees absent because of military service equally with employees having similar seniority,status,and pay who are on comparable leaves of absence under a contract,agreement,policy,practice,or plan in effect at anytime during that uniformed service b.
legislative history and jurisprudence 
the nation first peacetime draft law,the selective training and service act of was designed to provide reemployment for veterans returning to civilian life in positions of like seniority,status,and pay,stat.in,congress extended reemployment rights to reservists who had been called up from civilian jobs for active or training duty,ch,s,stat.the armed forces reserve act of extended reemployment rights to national guardsmen,stat.the reserve forces act of,ch,f,stat,provided that employees returning from active duty for more than three months in the ready reserve were entitled to the same employment rights as inductees,with limited exceptions.monroe standard oil,d.
in,these reemployment rights and benefits were extended to national guardsmen,stat.see vrra c,monroe,at.a new section,vrra d,was also enacted in to protect employees who had military training obligations lasting less than three months.this section provide d that employees must be granted a leave of absence for training and,upon their return,be restored to their positions with such seniority,status,pay,and vacation as they would have had if they had not been absent for training.monroe.
vrra d did not,however,protect reservists from discrimination by their employers in the form of discharges,demotions,or other adverse conduct between leaves of absence for training.in the years following its enactment discriminatory employment practices intensified.congress responded with legislation codified as vrra b which,in pertinent part,provided that a ny person who is employed by a private employer shall not be denied retention in employment or any promotion or other incident or advantage of employment because of any obligation as a member of a reserve component of the armed forces.
senate report explained the purpose of b as follows 
employment practices that discriminate against employees with reserve obligations have become an increasing problem in recent years.some of these employees have been denied promotions because they must attend weekly drills or summer training and others have been discharged because of these obligations the bill is intended to protect members of the reserve components of the armed forces from such practices under it reservists will be entitled to the same treatment afforded their coworkers not having such military obligations,reprinted in cong.admin.news.
the house report similarly indicated that these were the purposes and effects of the legislation,cong d.see monroe,at.
as the sixth circuit noticed in monroe standard oil,cir,however,vrra b was subject to two different interpretations 
first,it can be read to mean that any time an employee forced absence for reserve duty requires him to forgo a benefit that would have accrued to him only if he had been present for work,he has been denied an incident or advantage of employment because of his military obligation.
or,it can be read to merely require that reservists be treated equally or neutrally with their fellow employees without military obligations,and t o meet this requirement,collective bargaining agreements and employment rules must be facially neutral and must be applied uniformly and equally to all employees.id.
the fifth circuit and other courts adopted the first interpretation of vrra b by holding that,if the right in question is granted to all employees but is denied to a reservist solely because of his absence to attend to military obligations,the reservist is denied an incident or advantage of employment because of an obligation as a member of a reserve component 
in west safeway stores,the fifth circuit construed b to require that employers,in applying collective bargaining agreements,treat reservists as if they were constructively present during their reserve duty in similar contexts.at.the employee,a meat cutter,had contended that,since the collective bargaining agreement guaranteed a hour work week and because the only reason that he was not receiving a hour work week was due to his national guard obligations,he was being denied an advantage of employment.the court agreed and held that the employer must provide him with his guaranteed hour work week despite the fact that the collective bargaining agreement specifically provided that an employee absence for weekend reserve or national guard duty was excluded or negated from the guarantee 
the sixth circuit in a virtually identical situation,involving a hour work week guarantee,however,disagreed with west,holding that b merely required that reservists be treated no differently than other employees who are absent for reasons.monroe.the employee collective bargaining agreement right to work a hour week,as in west,was contingent on the employee being present for work or arranging to switch shifts,as permitted by the agreement.thus,the court held,because the employee was treated the same as his coworkers regarding absences and exchanging shifts,that right did not vest when the employee failed to do either,and the employer was required to do no more than grant him a leave of absence without pay to comply with his military reserve obligation.further,the court found nothing in the legislative history or the statute to support judicial invalidation of nondiscriminatory conditions precedent to employee benefits and adhere d to its belief that conditional benefits are protected by b only to the extent that the conditions have been actually satisfied.id.at.
the supreme court granted certiorari in monroe,affirmed the sixth circuit decision,and substantially agreed with its reasoning,d.the supreme court concluded that the legislative history indicates that b was enacted for the significant but limited purpose of protecting the against discrimination like discharge and demotion,by reason of reserve status.id.at.further,the court found nothing in b or its legislative history to indicate that congress even considered imposing an obligation on employers to provide a special preference,but rather that the history suggests that congress did not intend employers to provide special benefits to not generally made available to other employees.id.at.because the supreme court interpretation of b is contrary to the fifth circuit decision in west,and the high court noted the apparent conflict on this issue between west and the sixth circuit decision we conclude that west constructive presence interpretation was disapproved by monroe.
after the supreme court decision in monroe,the third circuit,in waltermyer aluminum of america,cir,addressed whether a national guardsman was entitled to pay for a holiday that occurred during his leave of absence for a military training period.the collective bargaining agreement limited eligibility for holiday pay to individuals who worked during that week,but exempted from that requirement persons in a number of categories who were absent for reasons beyond their control.id.at.the agreement provided that employees would receive pay for designated holidays if,during the payroll week in which the holiday occurs,the employee is at work on a scheduled vacation on a layoff under specified conditions performing jury service a witness in a court of law qualified for bereavement pay or absent because of personal illness and certain sick leave conditions apply.id.at.reading vrra b in light of the supreme court decision in monroe,the court of appeals concluded that t he thrust of that provision,according to the supreme court,was to prevent discrimination against reservists but not to grant them preferential treatment.id.at.the court noted the similarities between the characteristics of absence from work required by the military obligation at issue and the absences of the exempted categories,the absences were not generally of extended duration and they were for reasons beyond the control of the absent employee.id.at.therefore,the court concluded,relieving national guard members on military leave from the work requirement merely establishes equality for national guardsmen and reservists,not preferential treatment.id.at.thus,the court concluded,the plaintiff guardsman had established his right to holiday pay under b.significantly,however,the court indicated that a scheduled vacation,which also was exempted from the work requirement,was not comparable to military leave.the court observed we realize a planned vacation is different from the other exceptions on the list.vacation is earned time away from work,and this exception merely recognizes that an employee should not be prejudiced,in the form of lost holiday pay,for taking an earned vacation.id.at.
the senate report on the bill that became b stated that it would codify court decisions that have interpreted current law as providing a leave of absence for military service that entitles service members to participate in benefits that are accorded other employees.see waltermyer,winders people express airlines,affirmed,cir.october.the report explained that 
a n individual who serves in the uniformed services will be considered to be on furlough or leave of absence while in the service and will be entitled to the same rights and benefits not determined by seniority that are generally provided to the employer other employees with similar seniority,status,and pay who are on furlough or leave of absence,under a practice,policy,agreement,or plan in force at the beginning of the period of uniformed service or which becomes effective during the period of service.id.
the house report declared that the bill had the same purpose and effect.the bill was described as providing for r ights,benefits,and obligations of persons absent from employment for service in a uniformed service.i april.the house report elaborated 
the committee intends to affirm the decision in waltermyer aluminum of america,cir that,to the extent the employer policy or practice varies among various types of leaves of absence,the most favorable treatment accorded any particular leave would also be accorded the military leave,regardless of whether the leave is paid or unpaid.thus,for example,an employer can not require servicemembers to reschedule their work week because of a conflict with reserve or national guard duty,unless all other employees who miss work are required to reschedule their work.rumsey new york state of corr.services,wl.however,servicemembers are not entitled to receive benefits beyond what they would have received had they remained continuously employed.
id.see also cong.rec.s,wl,a resource guide to the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act userra,of labor veterans employment and training service,march 
although the legislative history of the bill that became b does not mention monroe,congress necessarily intended for that section to codify monroe interpretation of b with respect to the effects upon the rights of uniformed service members by their absences from civilian employment by reason of their military obligations.the reports of both the senate and the house expressed an intention to codify waltermyer in this respect.see i april.thus,they necessarily indicated an intent to codify monroe equal,but not preferential interpretation of vrra b which was adopted and followed by waltermyer.although waltermyer applied the monroe interpretation to enforce the employee right to equal treatment,rather than the employer right not to grant preferential treatment,waltermyer could not be codified without including the monroe interpretation that it adopted.
conversely,userra legislative history does not indicate that congress intended to rely on a general discrimination ban to assure that on military leave receive benefits equal to those that other employees receive while taking comparable leave.while new b legislative history clearly reflects the intent to specifically guarantee reservists equality of benefits,the history of a shows an intent to continue and strengthen the provision but not the specific goal of guaranteeing parity of benefits.
further,the brief legislative history of the bill that became a reflects no intention to prohibit neutral labor contracts from treating employees on military leave equally with those on leave with respect to the loss of benefits due to absence from work.the house report,in most relevant part,states that 
current law protects reserve and national guard personnel from termination from their civilian employment or other forms of discrimination based on their military obligations.section a would reenact the current prohibition against discrimination which includes discrimination against applicants for employment,see beattie v.the trump shuttle,current employees who are active or inactive members of reserve or national guard units,current employees who seek to join reserve or national guard units see boyle burke,cir,or employees who have a military obligation in the future such as a person who enlists in the delayed entry program which does not require leaving the job for several months.see trulson trane,cir.
i april.the senate report likewise does not indicate that congress intended to prohibit such neutral labor contract provisions.the report,in most pertinent part,provides 
new section a would specify the relationship to service that would bring individuals within the vrr law and also specifies the actions of employers that would constitute violations of that law.specifically,as to individuals,the section would provide that individuals who are members of,perform,have performed,apply to perform,or have an obligation to perform service in the uniformed services would be covered by the law.the section would provide that such individuals may not be denied initial employment,reemployment,retention,promotion,or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of the relationship to service.
the legislative history of a and b does not mention west.on the other hand,that legislative history expresses an intent to codify in b the line of cases with respect to rights and benefits to which persons absent from civilian employment by reason of service in the uniformed services are entitled.west is inconsistent with and was expressly disapproved by monroe and waltermyer therefore,we must conclude that userra codification of monroe and waltermyer legislatively overruled west.
section b governs this case 
section b of userra provides that an employee who is absent from employment for military service is deemed to be on leave of absence and entitled to such rights and benefits not determined by seniority generally provided by the employer to employees having similar seniority,status,and pay who are on furlough or leave of absence under a contract,agreement,policy,practice or plan reading b together with a and other ussera provisions,the legislative history,preceding statutes,and pertinent jurisprudence,we conclude that congress intended by b to clarify and codify the interpretation of vrra b by the supreme court in monroe and the third circuit in waltermyer,requiring employers,with respect to rights and benefits not determined by seniority,to treat employees taking military leave,equally,but not preferentially,in relation to peer employees taking comparable leaves generally provided under the employer contract,policy,practice or plan.although,the equal,but not preferential requirement arose out of the courts interpretation of vrra b prohibition against denial of employment rights because of military obligations,which has been enhanced and continued by userra a,congress decided to adopt new b to provide more specifically and affirmatively for the accrual of rights and benefits by employees while on military duty,rather than continue to rely on the general prohibition against denials of benefits for that purpose.congress sought by b to guarantee a measure of equality of treatment with respect to military and leaves and to strike an appropriate balance between benefits to persons and costs to employers.userra does not authorize the courts to add to or detract from that guarantee or to restrike that balance.
for these reasons,we conclude that the district court erred in deciding that a,rather than b,must be applied in this case.because the district court gave several reasons for its interpretation,we will set them forth before commenting on each.
the district court decided that s ection is inapplicable to this case,because it only applies to a person who is reemployed under this chapter or who is absent on furlough or leave of absence.the district court stated that is specifically tailored to apply to a reservist or veteran returning to employment from active duty rather than reservists who have been away for relatively short periods for drilling and training.furthermore,the court stated,the provisions now,formerly,b were specifically added to protect the rights of reservists which had been found to be inadequately protected under the provision cited by the city,formerly vrra d.concluding that this case should be analyzed and decided under userra a provision,the district court identified west,decided under vrra b,as our circuit precedent that must be applied in deciding claims under the userra for benefits by employees returning from service in the uniformed services the district court read west to hold that vrra b requires that employers,in applying collective bargaining agreements which grant a benefit of employment based on presence rather than on hours actually worked,should treat reservists as if they were constructively present during their reserve duty.
we believe that the district court was mistaken in each of its reasons for deciding that a must be applied in this case and,consequently,also mistaken in using the west constructive presence theory to decide the firefighters claims.we will discus the erroneous points of the district court decision in the order set forth in its opinion.
first,b is fully applicable to reservists short absences from civilian employment for weekend drills or annual training.in userra,the term service in the uniformed services means the performance of duty on a voluntary or involuntary basis in a uniformed service under competent authority.it includes active duty,active duty for training,initial active duty for training,inactive duty training,national guard duty,medical examinations to determine fitness for duty,and performance of funeral honors duty.id.the term uniformed services means the armed forces,the army national guard and the air national guard when engaged in active duty for training,inactive duty training,or national guard duty.thus,both of these terms apply to members of the uniformed services who participate in inactive duty training for weekend drills and annual training.consequently,b,which applies to a person who is absent from a position of employment by reason of service in the uniformed services is fully applicable to reservists during their weekend and military duty sessions 
second,reemployment is not formally defined in,but,providing for userra reemployment rights and positions,plainly apply to any person whose absence from a position of employment is necessitated by reason of service in the uniformed services.as noted in the previous paragraph,the terms service in the uniformed services and uniformed services apply to inactive duty training,which refers to reservists and their two week and weekend training periods.further,userra makes specific provisions for the reemployment of a person whose period of service in the uniformed services was less than days.e a a.thus,a reservist who returns to his or her job after weekend drill is reemployed just as much as one who is reinstated after a period of service of two years 
third,the district court mistakenly thought that vrra d was the precursor of userra b.however,userra b had no true predecessor and deals with a different subject rights of persons absent for military service from vrra d reemployment rights.vraa b was somewhat similar to userra b but not a true precursor.see.vraa b was added to protect against discrimination such as punitive discharges,demotions,et not protected against by vraa d.see legislative history of userra,supra.thus,vrra b was not added to cure a deficiency in a prior provision similar to userra b.
finally,as we have noted,west and its constructively present theory of interpretation was disapproved by the supreme court in monroe and legislatively overruled in the codification of monroe and waltermyer by userra b.
applying b to the summary judgment record in this case,we conclude that the district court judgment must be reversed and summary judgment granted for the city on the following claims lost pay lost overtime opportunities and missed upgrading opportunities.from our review of the record we have determined that there is no type of leave available to any employee under which an employee can accrue or receive the foregoing kinds of benefits.hence,insofar as the record shows,there is no type of leave under which these benefits may accrue that is comparable to any military leave.
we further conclude that the district court summary judgment with respect to bonus day leave perfect attendance leave and the hour cap on lost overtime must be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings on these claims.there are genuinely disputable issues as to the material facts of whether involuntary leaves,not generally for extended durations,for jury duty,bereavement,and line of duty injury leave provided that the employee returns to work in the following shift,under which employees may accrue or receive bonus day leave and perfect attendance leave benefits,are comparable to each plaintiff military leaves taken for service in the uniformed services.for the same reason,there is a disputable issue as to whether sick leave,under which employees receive the benefit of the hour cap for the first shift of sick leave they use,is comparable to military leave.thus,we reverse and remand on this claim also.
we also conclude that the summary judgment in favor of anthony rogers must be reversed because the record does not contain adequate evidence to support the judgment.the city must be granted summary judgment on this claim.
we must determine the period of time,during which damages accrued so as to be recoverable under userra.the district court referred t
