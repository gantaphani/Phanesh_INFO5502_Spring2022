for nearly ninety years it has been clearly established that aliens who seek exemption from compulsory military on alienage will be forever barred from becoming united states citizens.here,we are asked to decide whether this bar to citizenship applies to an alien who voluntarily enlisted in the united states navy,sought discharge short of completing his enlistment term on the basis of,and was honorably discharged.we hold that the bar does not apply.
on february,while ground combat operations during operation desert storm were underway in kuwait and iraq,paulo gallarde gallarde,a philippine national,immigrated to the united states as a lawful permanent resident alien.eight months later,gallarde voluntarily enlisted in the united states navy,thereby incurring a active duty service obligation.after serving seven months in the united states navy reserve,gallarde entered active duty on may.
in march,gallarde injured his back while on duty.as a result of that injury,gallarde claims to have endured pain on a daily basis and to have begun experiencing numbness in his left leg.when gallarde spoke with a corpsman about the possibility of being medically discharged,he was advised that such a request would be denied.gallarde,however,was advised that he could seek a discharge on the ground that he was an alien.
on march,gallarde requested an early separation from the united states navy.although gallarde did not specify a basis for his request,gallarde command treated his request as a request for early separation on the basis of.on march,gallarde commanding officer exercised the discretion given him by applicable regulations and denied gallarde request because the navy was experiencing a shortage of sailors in gallarde occupational specialty.
on may,gallarde again requested early separation,indicating that he was requesting to be separated fromm sic the united states navy on the basis of being an alien on june,gallarde was informed by his command that any alien who applies for discharge from service in the armed forces of the united states on the grounds that the member is an alien,and is discharged from such service on such grounds,shall be permanently ineligible to become a citizen of the united states,except if member is exercising treaty rights and served in the armed forces of the country in which the member is a citizen on october,approximately six months short of completing his voluntary military service obligation,gallarde was honorably discharged from the united states navy on the basis of alienage.
in january,gallarde filed an application for naturalization,which the then immigration and naturalization service ins denied.the ins ruled he was barred from becoming a citizen under section of the immigration and nationality act of.see the immigration and nationality act,stat,codified at.
gallarde then filed this action to review the denial of his application for naturalization.gallarde argued that does not bar him from becoming a citizen because he was not liable for service within the meaning of.specifically,gallarde argued bars only aliens who request and receive exemption,relief,or discharge from liability for the draft,not those who request early release from voluntary military service from becoming a citizen.
the district court denied gallarde petition,holding that barred him from becoming a citizen.the district court reached this conclusion without first determining whether training or service in the armed forces,as used in,and military training or military service,as used in,include voluntary military training or service.rather,relying on the definition of liability in the edition of black law dictionary,the district court determined that liability,as used in b,includes contractual liability.thus,the district court held that barred gallarde from becoming a united states citizen because gallarde was separated on the basis of alienage from voluntary military service for which he had contracted pursuant to an enlistment contract.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court interpretation and construction of a federal statute.see united states,cir.
discussion 
gallarde raises the same argument on appeal that he raised below,that citizenship bar applies only to aliens exempted or discharged from liability for the draft.
we are mindful that t he deprivation of the privilege of acquiring citizenship,which an alien in permanent residence normally enjoys,is a substantial penalty.in re rego,cir see also united states lacher,cir expressly relying on in re rego.the loss of that opportunity,no less than the loss of citizenship itself,may result in loss of both property and life,or of all that makes life worth living.united states minker.quoting ng fung ho white.thus,a statute which attaches such a penalty to certain conduct should be construed strictly to avoid an imposition which goes beyond the manifest intent of congress.in re rego,at citing minker.
section is such a statute 
a permanent ineligibility 
notwithstanding the provisions of section b but subject to subsection c of this section,any alien who applies or has applied for exemption or discharge from training or service in the armed forces or in the national security training corps of the united states on the ground that he is an alien,and is or was relieved or discharged from such training or service on such ground,shall be permanently ineligible to become a citizen of the united states.
b conclusiveness of records 
the records of the selective service system or of the department of defense shall be conclusive as to whether an alien was relieved or discharged from such liability for training or service because he was an alien.
c service in armed forces of foreign country 
an alien shall not be ineligible for citizenship under this section or otherwise because of an exemption from training or service in the armed forces of the united states pursuant to the exercise of rights under a treaty,if before the time of the exercise of such rights the alien served in the armed forces of a foreign country of which the alien was a national.
emphasis added.
the immigration and nationality act of does not define training or service in the armed forces or such liability for training and service and,therefore,does not,by its explicit terms,either establish or foreclose the interpretation advanced by gallarde.
the immigration act of vested sole authority to naturalize persons as citizens of the united states in the united states attorney general courts retained authority to administer the oath of citizenship.compare a,with a.thus,the power to naturalize plainly was shifted by the act from the courts to the immigration and naturalization service ins.gorbach reno,cir.the ins,exercising its newly acquired authority,promulgated.therein,it adopted existing court recognized exceptions to bar to citizenship,including 
at the time that he or she requested an exemption from military service,the applicant had no liability for such service even in the absence of an exemption 
the applicant is applying for naturalization pursuant to section of the act.
b,see also.part,persons ineligible to citizenship exemption from military service,is a new part derived entirely from existing interpretations of.emphasis added exemption from military service,in the first exception,means either a permanent exemption from induction or the release or discharge from military training or military service.like the immigration and nationality act of,part does not define such service,as used in b,or military training or military service,as used in.accordingly,neither nor resolves the question we face,whether training or service in the armed forces,as used in a,and military training or military service,as used in,include voluntary training or service in the armed forces or,as gallarde contends,include only compulsory training or service in the armed forces.
determining the meaning of training or service in the armed forces 
because this case involves an administrative agency construction of a statute that it administers,our analysis is governed by chevron natural resources defense council,d.fda brown williamson tobacco,d.the supreme court has articulated chevron analysis as requiring a contextual analysis of the statute at issue 
in determining whether congress has specifically addressed the question at issue,a reviewing court should not confine itself to examining a particular statutory provision in isolation.the certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.
id.at.internal citations and quotation marks omitted see also gorbach,at holding that a statute must be read in context with a view to its place in the statutory scheme,not in isolation.
in addition to reading a statute with a view to its place in the overall statutory scheme,a statute must also be read in historical context.see se.cmty.coll.davis,d although an agency interpretation of the statute under which it operates is entitled to some deference,this deference is constrained by our obligation to honor the clear meaning of a statute,as revealed by its language,purpose,and history.emphasis added quoting teamsters daniel,d.standing alone the phrase training or service in the armed forces in a is broad enough to include voluntary training or service in the armed forces.our task,however,is not to determine the meaning of the phrase training or service in the armed forces in isolation.rather,we must determine the meaning of training and service in the armed forces in context because t he certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.brown williamson tobacco,at.
at the outset we note the phrase training or service in the armed forces,in a is not modified by all,compulsory,or voluntary.thus,training or service in the armed forces in a can fairly be interpreted to include all training and service in the armed forces only compulsory training and service in the armed forces or only voluntary training and service in the armed forces.see,robinson shell oil,d finding the term employee in an section of title vii could be read to include only former employees,only current employees,or both minker,at.in short,witnesses is patently ambiguous it can fairly be applied to anyone who gives testimony in a proceeding,although the proceeding immediately or potentially involves him as a party,or it may be restricted to the person who gives testimony in another case.
ambiguity for chevron purposes,however,is a creature not of definitional possibilities but of statutory context.see brown gardner,d.here,as we will see,when is read in statutory and historical context,training or service in the armed forces unambiguously includes only compulsory training or service in the armed forces.thus,citizenship bar does not apply to aliens,like gallarde,discharged on the basis of alienage from voluntary training and service in the armed forces.
ii.statutory context of 
congress,through,and of the immigration and naturalization act of,continued a set of laws that provides immigration benefits and penalties tied to military service and the avoidance thereof on the basis of alienage.see infra,discussing historical structure.under,a single day of honorable military service during a designated period of hostilities qualifies an alien for accelerated naturalization see the immigration and nationality act,stat,codified at.however,under no person who is or has been separated from such service on account of alienage shall be regarded as having served honorably or having been separated under honorable conditions for the purposes of this section.id.emphasis added.thus,congress imposed a limited penalty short of a citizenship bar on aliens separated from military service on the basis of alienage,ineligibility for accelerated naturalization under.
an alien separated from military service on the basis of alienage,however,may still qualify for accelerated naturalization under.thereunder,an alien qualifies for accelerated naturalization by serving honorably for a period or periods aggregating one year.see immigration and nationality act codified at significantly,aliens discharged on the basis of alienage are not excluded from accelerated naturalization under.barnhart sigmon coal,d w hen congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,a period of otherwise honorable military service not considered honorable for purposes of accelerated naturalization under,may be regarded as honorable for the purposes of accelerated naturalization under 
here,were we to hold,as the government proposes,that training or service in the armed forces,as used in,includes voluntary military service,we would render limited penalty superfluous and the absence of such a penalty in insignificant if a citizenship bar applies to separation on the basis of alienage from voluntary military service,it would be irrelevant whether that service qualified an alien for relaxed naturalization requirements.this we can not do because i t is our duty to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute,united states menasche.internal quotation marks omitted,and i t is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought,upon the whole,to be so construed that,if it can be prevented,no clause,sentence,or word shall be superfluous,void,or insignificant.trw andrews,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted 
congress use in of the phrase enlistment or induction is also instructive because it demonstrates that where congress intended to impose a disability upon aliens discharged from voluntary training or serving in the armed forces on the basis of alienage it did so expressly by including both enlistment,a term denoting voluntary military service,see infra section iii,and induction,a term denoting involuntary military service,id.see.accordingly,reading in statutory context,we conclude citizenship bar applies only to aliens exempted or discharged from compulsory training or service in the armed forces.
iii.historical context of 
our conclusion that,when read in statutory context,does not apply to aliens discharged on the basis of from voluntary training or service in the armed forces finds reinforcement in the historical context in which was enacted.specifically,our interpretation is reinforced by the facts that citizenship bar historically applied only to aliens exempted or discharged from the draft when used in the context of liability,the contemporaneous statutory meaning of training or service in the armed forces was the draft congress narrowed the scope of predecessor to allow for the coexistence of a citizenship bar and accelerated naturalization on the basis of honorable military service.
section historically resided in the selective service act,it applied only to aliens exempted or discharged from liability for the draft 
we can not ignore the fact that the citizenship bar now contained in was historically part of the selective service statutes and barred from citizenship only aliens exempted or discharged from liability for the draft on the basis of alienage.see davis,at.gorbach,at.
in congress authorized the president,at his discretion,to institute a military draft.see an act to authorize the president to increase temporarily the military establishment of the united states,stat.draft act.in congress amended the draft act to impose liability for the draft on treaty aliens allow treaty aliens to avoid liability for the draft by withdrawing their intent to become citizens of the united states and bar any alien avoiding the draft in this manner from ever becoming a united states citizen.likewise,the selective service act of,the selective service act of,and the universal military training and service act of permitted an alien to avoid liability for the draft if prior to his induction he has made application to be relieved from such liability.see act to amend the selective training and service act of,stat.selective service act of,stat,the universal military training and service act of,stat.like the draft act,exercise of the right to exemption from liability for the draft under these statutes barred the alien from ever becoming a citizen.
the immigration and nationality act of brought together in one statute the previously atomized subjects of immigration,nationality,and naturalization.minker,at.in the process,however,congress separated the historically combined right of an alien to avoid the draft from the penalty for exercising that right an alien right to exemption remained in of the universal military training act.see immigration and nationality act,b,stat,stat.
notwithstanding the fact that an alien right to avoid liability for the draft and the penalty for doing so are no longer located in the same statute,we discern nothing in the text of,the immigration and nationality act of,or of the universal military training act suggesting congress intended to expand the scope of citizenship bar beyond its historical scope 
b.the contemporaneous meaning of training or service in the armed forces 
a fundamental canon of statutory construction is that,unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.perrin united states,d stating that the usage of the term at the time of its enactment is determinative.our review of the draft act,the selective service act of,the selective service act of,and the universal military training and service act of leads us to the conclusion that the contemporary meaning of training or service in the armed forces,as used in a,included only compulsory training or service in the armed forces pursuant to the draft.
as an initial matter,liability appears only in b,the subsection of addressing means of proof.see b.liability in b,however,is modified by such and,therefore,refers to training or service in the armed forces in a,the subsection of containing the citizenship bar at issue in this case.see a see also blacks law dictionary ed defining such as t hat or those having just been mentioned.accordingly,a liability requirement has properly been read into a.see b excepting aliens not liable for military training or military service from citizenship bar in re wendt.at excepting from citizenship bar alien who was not liable for the draft when he applied for a draft exemption following mcgrath kristensen.such application,in section a of the selective service act of,refers to an application to be relieved from such liability.as there was no liability for service,his act in applying for relief from a nonexistent duty could not create the bar against naturalization.
the draft act distinguished between voluntary and involuntary military service,using liability to military service,liable,exempt,and exemption when referring to involuntary military service pursuant to the draft and enlistment or voluntary enlistment when referring to voluntary military service.see stat.at.
likewise,the selective service act of distinguished between voluntary and involuntary military service,using the language liable for training and service and liability to serve when referring to involuntary military service.see selective service act of,stat.
the selective service act of and the universal military training and service act of also used similar language,distinguishing between voluntary and involuntary military service by using inducted and liability for training and service when referring to the draft and enlist when referring to voluntary service and barred only aliens who avoided the draft on the basis of their alienage from becoming united states citizen.see selective service act of,stat,see also the universal military training and service act of,stat.amending the selective service act of.
finally,used liable and liable to perform military duty to describe men subject to the draft 
national forces persons liable to perform military duty.
all male citizens of the united states,and persons of foreign birth who have declared their intention to become citizens of the united states under and in pursuance of the laws thereof,between the ages of eighteen and years,are declared to constitute the national forces,and,with such exceptions and under such conditions as may be prescribed by law,shall be liable to perform military duty in the service of the united states.
italics added,ch,stat.such conditions,thereunder,were proscribed by the universal military service and training act of,which defined liability for the draft.see app.a.
accordingly,when tied to the concept of liability,the contemporaneous statutory meaning of training or service in the armed forces included only compulsory training and service pursuant to the draft.
congress narrowing of the draft act citizenship bar 
under the draft act,aliens were not required to exercise their right to exemption from the draft prior to induction.see stat.at.accordingly,the draft act citizenship bar applied to aliens exempted or discharged from liability for the draft at any time.id.
on september,congress replaced the draft act with the selective service act of.see stat.as initially enacted,the selective service act of did not grant aliens a right to exemption from liability for the draft or contain a citizenship bar.id.
on october,congress enacted the nationality act of,providing therein for accelerated naturalization on the basis of a period of honorable military service.see the nationality act of,stat.nothing in the nationality act of deprives an alien discharged under honorable conditions on the basis of alienage from pursuing accelerated naturalization thereunder.
on december,congress amended the selective service act of to permit an alien to avoid the draft by applying for an exemption prior to induction and to impose a citizenship bar upon any alien making such an application.see stat.at.by limiting the selective service act of citizenship bar to aliens who apply for exemption prior to induction,congress preserved accelerated naturalization under the nationality act of for aliens who entered the armed forces,later to be separated from military service under honorable conditions on the basis of alienage 
three months after the attack on pearl harbor,congress amended the nationality act of to provide for accelerated naturalization on the basis of even one day of honorable wartime military service.see war powers act of,stat.congress,however,expressly denied this form of accelerated naturalization to any alien discharged on the basis of his alienage by stating therein that the provisions of this title,the war powers act of,shall not apply to any person who is discharged therefrom on account of alienage.stat.at emphasis added.significantly,because this disqualification was limited to the loss of eligibility under provisions of this title,an alien discharged on the basis of alienage could still seek accelerated naturalization under the nationality act of on the basis of a period of honorable military service or,if a legal permanent resident,on the basis of of continuous residence.in short,congress created a system rewarding honorable military service with accelerated naturalization depending on the length of such service,the peace or war time nature of such service,and whether such service was terminated on the basis of alienage.
we discern nothing in the immigration and nationality act of suggesting congress intended to disturb this system.indeed,we conclude that in enacting,and of the immigration and nationality act of,congress intended to continue that system.
iv.no risk of an exodus of aliens from the armed forces 
the government contended at oral argument that adopting the interpretation of advanced by gallarde would have grave consequences.specifically,the government contended that interpreting citizenship bar not to apply to aliens exempted or discharged from voluntary military service would permit aliens unilaterally to terminate their enlistment contracts without consequence.not so.aliens do not possess a right to a discharge,based on alienage,from voluntary military service rather,certain aliens may apply for a discretionary administrative discharge on the basis of alienage.
