taylor ayes,william cutshall,frank ribar,edward smith,james martin,and william terrio collectively appellants filed a class action complaint against the department of veterans affairs va on behalf of themselves and a putative class of veterans.the complaint alleged that the va violated west supp,the provision of the bankruptcy code,by refusing to fully restore veteran guaranty entitlements to appellants solely because of their previous discharges in bankruptcy.the district court granted the va motion to dismiss,made pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,because it concluded that a does not apply to the veteran guaranty entitlement,which is set out at et.west supp.
we affirm.section a prohibits a governmental unit from denying a license,permit,charter,franchise,or other similar grant solely because an individual has filed for or received a discharge in bankruptcy.a.because appellants concede that the veteran guaranty entitlement is not a license,permit,charter,or franchise and we hold that it is not an other similar grant,we conclude that a does not apply to the veteran guaranty entitlement.
because the facts of this appeal are undisputed,we are left only to decide the legal question of a applicability to the veteran guaranty entitlement.pursuant to the servicemen readjustment act of,codified at et,the va provides housing assistance to certain veterans meeting requirements by guarantying home loans made to them by private lenders.the va automatically guarantee s loans for certain veterans when the loans will be used for,among other things,the purchase or construction of a home.a.pursuant to,the va computes the guaranty amount as a percentage of the unpaid loan balance,with the percentage varying depending on the size of the original loan a a.if the veteran later defaults on the loan,the va pays the private lender the amount it guaranteed on behalf of the veteran.a.in such cases,the va becomes subrogated to the rights of the private lender for the amount paid by the va on the guaranty.id.while the regulations relating to the veteran guaranty program state that any amount paid by the va in satisfaction of a guaranty made on behalf of a veteran shall constitute a debt owing to the united states by such veteran,e,the va acknowledges that it does not take any action to collect this debt.
there is no limit to the number of times a veteran may receive the guaranty entitlement,but the amount of guaranty available to the veteran is always limited by any previously used guaranty amount that has not been restored to the va or does not otherwise qualify for exclusion.b.specifically,b provides the following 
in computing the aggregate amount of guaranty or insurance housing loan entitlement available to a veteran under this chapter,the secretary may exclude the amount of guaranty or insurance housing loan entitlement used for any guaranteed,insured,or direct loan under the following circumstances 
a the property which secured the loan has been disposed of by the veteran or has been destroyed by fire or other natural hazard and 
b the loan has been repaid in full,or the secretary has been released from liability as to the loan,or if the secretary has suffered a loss on such loan,the loss has been paid in full.
in other words,the amount of guaranty available to a veteran upon a successive application for the benefit is reduced by the amount of loss that the va suffered on any previous guaranty made on behalf of the veteran until that loss is repaid absent an exercise of the va discretion to waive the repayment requirements,if a veteran wishes to receive the full guaranty amount after the va previously suffered a loss on a guaranty made on his or her behalf,the veteran has no choice but to repay the loss in full.
appellants are six veterans who allege that they sought home loans from various private lenders after having received discharges in bankruptcy under either chapter or chapter of the bankruptcy code and were denied these loans because the va refused to extend full guaranties on their behalf.the va refused to extend full guaranty amounts to appellants because it had suffered losses on previous loan guaranties made on their behalf that had not been repaid.appellants contend that as a result of the va decision not to fully reinstate loan guaranties to them following their discharges in bankruptcy,they were severely limited in their ability to obtain private home loans.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to west.
we review de novo the district court grant of the va motion to dismiss made pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.bominflot,v.the henrich s,cir.a rule b motion should only be granted if,after accepting all allegations in the plaintiff complaint as true and drawing all reasonable factual inferences from those facts in the plaintiff favor,it appears certain that the plaintiff can not prove any set of facts in support of his claim entitling him to relief.edwards city of goldsboro,cir.
section a of the bankruptcy code provides in pertinent part that a governmental unit may not deny,revoke,suspend,or refuse to renew a license,permit,charter,franchise,or other similar grant to or discriminate with respect to such a grant against a person that is or has been a debtor under this title or a bankrupt or debtor under the bankruptcy act a.the statute codified the result of perez campbell,d,in which the supreme court applied the supremacy clause to strike down an arizona financial responsibility law that conditioned reinstatement of a debtor driver license on repayment of an judgment that had been discharged in bankruptcy.id.at.the court held that the arizona law violated the policy underlying the bankruptcy code,sometimes called the fresh start policy,that debtors be given a new opportunity in life unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of debt because it gave creditors a powerful weapon with which to force bankrupts to pay their debts despite their discharge.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
to establish a violation of a,appellants must show that the va is a governmental unit,the veteran guaranty entitlement is an item covered by the statute,and the va discriminated against appellants solely because of their discharges in bankruptcy.a.the va concedes that it is a governmental unit under the statute,but argues that appellants can not show that the veteran guaranty entitlement is an item covered by a or that the va discriminated against appellants solely because of their prior discharges in bankruptcy.
conceding that the veteran guaranty entitlement is not a license,permit,charter,or franchise,appellants argue that the veteran guaranty entitlement comes within protections because it is an other similar grant.the veteran guaranty entitlement is undoubtedly a grant as that term is used in the statute a veteran satisfying the requirements is entitled to the loan guaranty benefit.see black law dictionary ed defining grant as an agreement that creates a right of any description other than the one held by the grantor.the question is whether it is a similar grant to those specific items listed in a.
