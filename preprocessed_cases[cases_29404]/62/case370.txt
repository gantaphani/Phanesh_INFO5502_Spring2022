appellant martin gillan,iv was discharged from the united states naval reserve because he was twice passed over for promotion while classified as an active reservist.gillan has challenged his discharge on the ground that the navy should not even have considered him for a promotion and only did so because it had improperly failed to transfer him to an inactive status.he brought his claim first to the navy board for correction of naval records bcnr,where he lost.he next sought review of the navy decision in federal district court,which granted summary judgment against him.we affirm the district court judgment because we find that,the statute that governs how the navy classifies and evaluates reservists,does not provide a specific time frame in which the navy must transfer qualified reservists to inactive status.
a naval reservist pay,benefits,and eligibility for promotion turn on both his status as either an active or inactive reservist and the category of service in which he is classified.reservists in an active status can be paid,are eligible to train,earn retirement points,and be considered for promotion.bureau of naval personnel instruction a.inactive reservists can not be paid,participate in training,earn retirement points,or be considered for promotion.id.there are three categories of service for reservists ready reserve,standby reserve,and retired reserve.id.the ready reserve is further divided into the selected reserve and the individual ready reserve,both of which are active status.id.there are two subcategories of standby reservists standby reserve active and standby reserve inactive.id.as the names indicate,the former is an active status category,the latter an inactive status.retired reservists must have met the requirements for a military pension and may not earn more retirement points or be promoted.id.whether gillan should have been considered for promotion turns on whether he was properly classified in an active status in the ready reserve or in an inactive status in the standby reserve inactive.
congress has directed the navy to prescribe equitable procedures for the periodic determination of whether reservists meet the standards and qualifications for their status.see also directing the military to provide a system of continuous screening of units and members of the ready reserve.department of defense and navy regulations require that the navy conduct an annual screening to make this determination.see c screen,at least annually,all ready reservists under their jurisdiction to ensure their immediate availability for active duty and to ensure compliance with.bureau of naval personnel instruction a requiring that a ll members of the ready reserve who are not on active duty will be screened at least annually.if a reserve commissioned officer fails to meet the requirements of active status,the navy shall transfer him to the retired reserve if qualified transfer him to inactive status if qualified or discharge him from his reserve appointment.notably,although congress requires the transfer of delinquent active reservists,the statute says nothing about when that must happen.
gillan was commissioned as a coast guard officer in and served on active duty as an aviator until he was honorably discharged in at the rank of lieutenant.he served in the coast guard individual ready reserve from may until october.gillan then transferred to the naval reserve in late as a member of the ready reserve and was promoted to lieutenant commander in.in december,gillan was activated for service in operation desert storm.after hostilities ceased and effective may,he transferred to the individual ready reserve in an active status.at the time of this transfer,the navy told gillan that,
if you desire a category of lesser participation in the naval reserve,you may wish to request a transfer to the standby reserve,inactive.in that category,you will not be allowed to participate except in time of war and would not be eligible for promotion until one year after your return to the ready reserve.
letter from commanding officer,naval air reserve san diego,to martin gillan june.gillan never responded to this invitation.he failed to seek a transfer to the standby reserve inactive.in fact,gillan had no communication with and did not participate in the naval reserves in any capacity for the next six years because of pressing family reasons and his civilian employment as a junior airline pilot.appellant br.at.
as a member of the individual ready reserve,gillan was required,through participation and training,to earn points each anniversary year to remain in an active status.bureau of naval personnel instruction a.his complete failure to fulfill any of his reserve duties from the time of his transfer to the individual ready reserve on march,made him subject to review by an entity called the mobilization disposition board mdb.the mdb determines whether a reservist will be transferred pursuant to guidelines created by congress in.in gillan case,the mdb ultimately had two options in the face of his total failure to participate in any of his reserve duties transfer him from active status as a member of the individual ready reserve to inactive status in the standby reserve inactive or,in the alternative,discharge him from the naval reserve altogether.b.gillan case was not considered by the january mdb because the files for that mdb were collected in july,before the navy had any record of his noncompliance.letter from chairman,board for correction of naval records,to secretary of navy,bcnr decision.gillan was also not considered by the august mdb.the bcnr noted in its final decision that the navy normally notified reservists whose records would be screened by the mdb and those who did not respond to their notification letter were placed on a list to go to the next scheduled board.id.at.this notification letter is intended to provide delinquent active reservists a chance to respond to a possible change in reserve status that affects their pay and retirement benefits.the bcnr thus believed that because gillan admitted that he had zero contact with the navy in,his failure to respond to the navy presumed notification pushed the review of his record past the mdb to the next mdb in august.that mdb did consider gillan record of and transferred him to an inactive status in the standby reserve inactive.id.
while gillan was still in an active status as a member of the ready reserve from may until the august mdb decision,he was eligible for promotion.bureau of naval personnel instruction a.naval reserve line commander selection boards reviewed gillan file in april and april but failed to promote him to commander,a not surprising decision given his with the reserves.in,two years after his transfer to an inactive status,gillan tried to renew his activity in the naval reserve by participating in training drills.after gillan participated in drills for five months,the navy notified him in march that he could no longer participate in reserve activities because a lieutenant commander who twice fails selection for commander must be discharged after twenty years of commissioned service.see id.b.another mdb considered gillan record in march,and he was honorably discharged from the naval reserve on august.
in addition to challenging his discharge,gillan has also requested that the navy revise upward one grade on his fitness report,an annual performance review.he relies on a letter written by his former commanding officer.gillan commanding officer originally gave gillan a grade of b for desirability for command.eight years later,he asked that this grade be changed to an his stated justification for this change was,information received after report was written justifies a higher grade specifically volunteered for desert storm.outstanding command of his maintenance division.letter from captain jorgensen,usnr,to naval personnel command.on a number of occasions,gillan sought to have the navy make this change to his fitness report and to vacate its decisions not to promote him,which would allow his continued service.he first petitioned the navy in.the bcnr considered and then rejected this request on
