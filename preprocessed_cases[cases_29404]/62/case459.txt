wilfredo romero was employed as an auditor at the department of defense dod.in december,romero was removed from his position for failing to maintain his secret level security clearance.he appealed the removal action to the merit systems protection board mspb.the mspb affirmed the action.this court vacated the mspb decision and remanded for the mspb to determine whether romero could show harmful error resulting from the dod failure to follow its own procedures.see romero dep t of defense,romero p.on remand,the mspb again affirmed the removal.because we agree that the dod complied with its internal procedures in revoking romero security clearance,we affirm.
background 
at issue is whether the dod properly revoked romero secret security clearance when it denied him a different kind of clearance,namely access to sensitive compartmented information sci.
the relevant events began in,when romero supervisor asked the defense intelligence agency central adjudication facility dia caf to grant romero clearance to obtain access to sci.romero had been working as an auditor in the agency office of inspector general since.this position required him to maintain a secret level security clearance,which he obtained in from the washington headquarters service central adjudication facility whs caf.after receiving his secret security clearance but before requesting clearance for access to sci,romero married a honduran national.at the time romero sought access to sci,his wife was an employee of the honduran embassy.
the eligibility standards for sci access and secret clearances are not identical,although there are common guidelines and procedures that do apply to both types of clearances.see exec.order dod.r,app.director of central intelligence agency directive dcid.under these common adjudicative guidelines,an investigating agency must consider thirteen factors in determining whether granting a security clearance is consistent with interests of national security.each of these factors applies regardless of whether an employee seeks a secret clearance or sci access.of particular relevance here is the foreign influence factor.specifically,the foreign influence disqualifying factor states that a security risk may exist when an individual immediate family and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection,influence or obligation are not citizens of the united states or may be subject to duress.dod r,app.conditions that may be disqualifying include having an immediate family member who is a citizen of a foreign country or having relatives who are connected with any foreign government.id.the common guidelines also specify that foreign security concerns can be mitigated under certain circumstances.id.
beyond these considerations,sci access requires satisfying additional minimum personnel security standards that are not required for secret and other clearances.see dcid.for example,dcid specifies that in order to be approved for access to sci,an individual must be a citizen and t he individual immediate family must also be citizens.thus,any individual whose spouse is a citizen of a foreign country is barred under dcid from obtaining clearance for access to sci,although he may still be eligible for a secret clearance if the foreign influence concern is adequately mitigated.if the foreign influence concern can not be adequately mitigated,the individual may be denied both access to sci and secret clearance based on his spouse citizenship.
the general organizational framework used by the dod to make security clearance determinations is as follows.the dod has authorized central adjudication facilities caf in various components,including the dia and the whs,to issue security clearances.when a component caf denies or revokes a clearance,the determination may be appealed to that component security appeals board sab.both the dia and the whs are authorized to grant,deny,or revoke civilian personnel security clearances including secret clearances.in addition,the dia also has the authority to grant,deny,or revoke access to sci.the whs caf generally handles secret security clearances,while the dia caf handles access to sci.under dod regulations,a component may reciprocally accept a security clearance determination made by another component.see dod r.
the first step in the process of obtaining access to sci involves asking the appropriate caf to adjudicate the clearance.although the whs caf was the component that issued romero original secret clearance,the dia caf is responsible for making determinations regarding eligibility to access sci.accordingly,romero employer requested that the dia caf grant him sci access.after conducting an investigation,the diacaf informed romero that a preliminary decision had been made to deny him clearance for access to sci.romero i,at.the preliminary decision also indicated that romero secret security clearance would be suspended pending resolution of the matter.pointing to the honduran citizenship of romero wife and stepson,the preliminary decision explained that available information tends to show a security risk may exist due to foreign influence.the preliminary decision further noted that the foreign influence concerns were also inconsistent with sci eligibility standards,which require that immediate family members must be citizens.
if an employee is not satisfied with the preliminary decision,the second step is to challenge the preliminary determination in writing.romero responded to the dia caf preliminary decision.after considering the information supplied by romero,the dia caf chief issued a final decision denying access to sci and revoking romero secret clearance due to security issues deemed to be inconsistent with national security interests.the final decision indicated that the potential security risks included the fact that your spouse is not a citizen,and is an accredited diplomat of the government of honduras.the final decision concluded that romero had failed to mitigate foreign influence security concerns based on his wife status as an agent of a foreign power.
as the third step in the process,the dia gaf final decision may be appealed to the dia security appeals board dia sab.romero appealed the dia gaf final determination by requesting a hearing before an administrative judge at the defense office of hearing and appeals doha.the doha administrative judge recommended that the dia sab sustain the dia gaf revocation of romero secret clearance.the doha administrative judge acknowledged that the agency did not have jurisdiction to consider whether an exception should apply to dcid preclusion of individuals with foreign immediate family members from eligibility for access to sci.the doha administrative judge therefore addressed only the issue of romero secret security clearance.with respect to this latter issue,the doha administrative judge applied the common adjudicative guidelines and considered foreign influence based on romero relationship with his wife and stepson.after evaluating mitigating conditions,the doha administrative judge found that romero relationship with his stepson did not pose an unacceptable security risk.in contrast,the doha administrative judge found that romero wife employment at the honduran embassy weighed against applying any mitigating conditions in romero favor.accordingly,the doha administrative judge recommended that the dia gaf decision to revoke romero secret clearance be affirmed due to romero relationship with his wife.
the final step in the process is the dia sab review of the doha administrative judge recommendation.in a decision,the dia sab affirmed the determination that romero did not meet the eligibility requirements for access to sci.the first paragraph of the decision concluded that romero did not meet the minimum personnel security standards for sci.the second paragraph of the decision discussed the doha administrative judge treatment of foreign influence security concerns,which as noted above,were addressed by the doha administrative judge in the context of the secret clearance rather than sci access.the dia sab agreed that mitigating factors did not apply to romero relationship with his wife because she was by definition an agent of a foreign power.the dia sab decision did not explicitly mention any other security clearances besides access to sci.
as discussed above,dod regulations permit a component to reciprocally accept another component security clearance determination without conducting further investigation.accordingly,the whs caf the component that originally issued romero secret clearance reciprocally accepted the dia sab final decision denying romero eligibility for access to sci.in addition,the whs caf stated that romero eligibility for access to classified information and to occupy a sensitive position has been revoked based on the diasab decision.thus,the whs caf accepted the denial of access to sci and revoked romero secret clearance based on the dia sab final decision.
because romero position required him to maintain a secret level security clearance,he was removed from his position shortly after his secret security clearance was revoked.
he appealed his removal to the mspb,arguing that his secret clearance had not been properly revoked.he alleged that the dod had denied his right to due process because it did not provide him an opportunity to challenge the whs caf reciprocal revocation.romero i,at.he also argued that the revocation of his secret clearance was invalid because the dia sab had denied only his eligibility for access to sci.id.he further argued that the revocation of his secret clearance was retaliatory.id.at.
the mspb administrative judge affirmed the agency action.id.at.the administrative judge rejected romero due process argument because he had the opportunity to challenge the dia caf final decision and because the agency regulations do not require an opportunity for review of a reciprocal acceptance of a security clearance revocation.id.the administrative judge also held that romero secret security clearance had been revoked,that his position required access to classified information,and that the agency removal of romero fully complied with the procedural requirements of.id.explaining that the mspb could not review the merits underlying a security clearance revocation,the administrative judge rejected romero remaining challenges because they required review of the merits of the decision to revoke his security clearance.id.the full board denied romero petition for review of the administrative judge initial decision.id.
romero appealed to this court.citing hesse department of state,we acknowledged that the mspb may not examine the underlying merits of the security clearance determination.romero i,at.accordingly,we held that the mspb was correct to reject romero argument that the revocation of his security clearance was retaliatory because this argument implicated the merits of the security clearance decision.id.at.we also held that the mspb did not err in concluding that the dod removal of romero complied with the requirements of because romero was provided notice of his proposed removal,the agency provided notice of the reasons for the removal and the underlying revocation of his security clearance,and romero had an opportunity to respond to the removal.id.at.noting,however,that the mspb had not addressed romero challenges to the procedures used to revoke his secret security clearance,we remanded the issue to the mspb to be addressed in the first instance.id.at vacating the mspb decision and remanding for the mspb to determine whether romero can show that the department failed to follow its procedures and that any failure to do so resulted in harmful error.
on remand to the mspb,romero focused on two main procedural objections the dia sab lacked the authority to revoke the secret clearance because it was the whs caf that had issued the secret clearance in the first place and the dia sab had not actually revoked the secret clearance,leaving no revocation for the whscaf to reciprocally accept.after a hearing,the mspb administrative judge again affirmed the dod action.first,he concluded that the dia sab had the authority to revoke romero secret security clearance even though it was not the component that initially issued the clearance.he also concluded that the diasab final decision had in fact revoked romero secret security clearance.the administrative judge reasoned that,although the dia sab did not expressly reference the secret clearance in the decision letter,its discussion of the doha administrative judge opinion which focused almost exclusively on the secret clearance was evidence of agreement with revoking the secret clearance.the administrative judge further found that the whs caf was not required to independently adjudicate romero eligibility for a secret security clearance following the dia decision.finally,the administrative judge concluded that,even assuming the dod had committed a procedural error,any such error was not harmful.he determined that romero secret clearance would have been revoked in light of the security risk associated with romero wife honduran citizenship and status as an agent of a foreign power.he further concluded that romero had received all of the process due under and nearly all of the protections set forth in,which provides for removals without appeal to the mspb in the interest of national security.
the administrative judge decision became the decision of the mspb on april.this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction to review the mspb final decision under a.

when we review a decision of the mspb,we do so under a deferential standard as prescribed by statute.the mspb decision must be affirmed unless it is found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation or unsupported by substantial evidence.bennett merit.prot,citing c.like the mspb,our review of removal actions that involve the revocation or denial of a security clearance is limited to reviewing the procedures used rather than the substance of the revocation decision.romero i,at discussing hesse and department of the navy egan,d.
recognizing the limited nature of our review of adverse employment actions involving security clearance determinations,this court opinion in romero i remanded to the mspb for the limited purpose of determining whether the revocation of romero secret clearance complied with dod own internal procedures.romero i,at.on appeal,romero contends that the mspb committed legal error by misapplying the statutes and regulations defining procedures for security clearance determinations and engaging in erroneous speculation regarding the scope of the diasab final decision.specifically,he argues that the diasab did not explicitly revoke his secret clearance.it follows,according to romero,that the whs caf could not revoke the secret security clearance by reciprocal acceptance because there was no final determination to accept.romero further argues that,even if the dia sab had in fact revoked his secret clearance,the dia lacked the authority to do so because the whs rather than the dia was the component that issued the secret clearance in the first place.romero maintains that dod regulations permit only the component that initially granted the security clearance to revoke it 
the government responds that romero did not meet his burden of showing that the dod failed to follow its procedures and that the mspb determination to that effect was supported by substantial evidence.with respect to romero claim that the dia lacked the authority to adjudicate his secret clearance,the government counters that dod regulations plainly permit dod components like the whs to designate other components to revoke security clearances and do not prohibit designees from revoking clearances originally issued by the designating component.pointing to several departmental memoranda interpreting dod r,the government further argues that denial of sci access automatically acts as a revocation of collateral clearances such as secret clearances.finally,the government notes that common adjudicative guidelines apply to both sci access and secret clearances.the government submits that the dia was required
