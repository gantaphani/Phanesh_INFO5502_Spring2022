the sole issue in this case is whether the feres doctrine,which prohibits suit against the government for injuries that are incident to military service,bars appellants civil suit against the united states for the tragic death of their son,lieutenant mcconnell,in a waterskiing accident.we determine that under our precedent the facts that mcconnell use of the boat was a benefit of his status as a service member and that the alleged negligence was subject to military orders and regulations compel us to affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the government.
this case arises out of a fatal boating accident at lake pleasant,arizona on may.at the time of the accident,lieutenants joseph james mcconnell,steven frodsham,mark donohue,and matthew crowell were student pilots in the united states air force usaf,assigned to luke air force base luke afb,arizona.on may,the day before the accident,crowell rented a boat from the luke afb recreation center,located at luke afb.crowell rented the boat because his colleagues were busy in a meeting.nevertheless,the record indicates that lts.mcconnell,frodsham,and donohue were subsequently briefed on the installation rules and regulations governing the use of the boat,and were required to follow them.
on the morning of may,lts.mcconnell,frodsham,and donohue transported the boat to lake pleasant using mcconnell truck.crowell planned to join the group later.at around,frodsham was driving the boat,donohue was in the boat observing,and mcconnell was waterskiing behind the boat.mcconnell then fell while waterskiing,and frodsham steered the boat back around to bring the ski rope to mcconnell,who was floating in the water by use of a life jacket.at that point,frodsham attempted to slow the boat down but was unable to do so.instead,the boat surged out of control and struck mcconnell in the head,causing a fatal brain injury.the police investigation disclosed that the boat throttle cable had broken feet,inches from the motor.the broken cable kept the throttle stuck at the same position set by the operator immediately before the break and permitted the operator to slow the boat only by turning off the ignition.
the boat was rented pursuant to an agreement with the luke afb recreation center,which is operated by the luke afb recreation program.through the recreation center,boat rentals are available to active duty members and their family members although civilian guests may use recreational equipment if accompanied and supervised by military personnel.the recreation center is part of the broader usaf services programs supporting the air force mission the services squadron,mission support group,and fighter wing commanders administer the usaf services program at luke afb.among the programs offered are morale,welfare,and recreation mwr programs,including the luke afb outdoor recreation program.
the appellants,mcconnell parents,filed a complaint against the united states for wrongful death and loss of consortium under the federal tort claims act.their complaint is solely against the united states,and no other individuals.they allege that the usaf failed to properly maintain,service,and repair the boat,and failed to warn its users and the public that the boat was defective and unreasonably dangerous.
the district court granted the government motion for summary judgment,holding that the feres doctrine deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction.mcconnell parents filed a timely notice of appeal.
we review a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the feres doctrine de novo.wilkins united states,cir.factual findings are reviewed de novo,with all disputed facts resolved in favor of the party.costo united states,cir,cert.denied,d citing dreier united states,cir.
the federal tort claims act ftca is a waiver of the federal government sovereign immunity.see b.under the ftca,the united states is liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.however,in feres united states,the supreme court held that the united states is not liable for injuries that arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service because the united states did not intend to waive its immunity to such claims.id.at.this broad exception has been labeled the feres doctrine.costo,at.
subsequent supreme court decisions have identified three policy rationales underlying the feres doctrine the distinctly federal nature of the relationship between the government and the members of its armed forces,a generous compensation scheme for soldiers the veterans benefits act serves as an ample alternative to tort recovery,and permitting military personnel to sue the armed forces would endanger discipline.id.at citing united states johnson,d.
the third policy the integrity of military the most robust explanation for the feres doctrine and most critical to this case the supreme court has commented 
the peculiar and special relationship of the soldier to his superiors,the effects of the maintenance of such suits on discipline,and the extreme results that might obtain if suits under the torts claims act were allowed for negligent orders given or negligent acts committed in the course of military duty,led the feres court to read that act as excluding claims of that character.
united states brown.see also costo,at t he danger to discipline has been identified as the best explanation for feres.zaputil cowgill,cir the feres doctrine is applicable whenever a legal action would require a civilian court to examine decisions regarding management,discipline,supervision,and control of members of the armed forces of the united states.internal quotation marks omitted.
in determining whether a service member injury is incident to service and therefore,barred under the feres doctrine,we have employed a approach,addressing four factors 
the place where the negligent act occurred,the duty status of the plaintiff when the negligent act occurred,the benefits accruing to the plaintiff because of the plaintiff status as a service member,and the nature of the plaintiff activities at the time the negligent act occurred.
costo,at citing dreier,at.moreover,we have stated that none of these factors are dispositive.id.rather than seizing on any particular combination of factors,we have focused on the totality of the circumstances.id.furthermore,although the various cases applying the feres doctrine may defy reconciliation,we are bound by,and seek to align our resolution of this particular case to,our precedents 
our application of the four factors to the particular facts in this case compels our determination that under our precedent,particularly costo and bon united states,cir,the feres doctrine bars appellants suit against the government 
although appellants stress that the accident occurred on a public lake,the district court properly focused on the situs of the negligence,not the location of the accident.costo,at the appropriate consideration is the situs of the negligence,not the location of the accident.see also johnson united states,cir t he place on the base where the negligent act was found by the trial court to have occurred must be distinguished from the place where the accident occurred.monaco united states,cir holding that a father claim for cancer that was diagnosed after he left the service,and his daughter claim arising out of her birth defect,were barred by the feres doctrine because the alleged father exposure to when he was on active duty.here,the appellants allege that the usaf failed to service and repair the boat and do not dispute that the boat was serviced and repaired,if at all,at luke afb.thus,unlike costo,where much of the alleged negligence occurred on base,here all the alleged negligence occurred on base.however,the location of the negligence is not dispositive,and we must also consider the other factors.see johnson,at.
the parties agree that mcconnell was on leave but on active duty at the time of the accident.the plaintiffs in bon and costo were on liberty at the time of the accidents,but also on active duty.costo,at.similar to the plaintiffs in bon and costo,the record indic
