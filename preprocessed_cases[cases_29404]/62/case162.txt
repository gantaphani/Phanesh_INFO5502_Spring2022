this lawsuit arises from plaintiff linden bowman early retirement from the united states air force and his failed attempt to participate in a program that would allow him to have community service work count toward his years of service needed to obtain a full military retirement.the secretary of defense failed to process his request for military service credit for his work as a youth minister on grounds that the regulations specifically prohibit credit for employment with religious organizations engaged in religious activities,unless such activities are unrelated to religious instruction,worship services,or any form of proselytization.bowman claims the regulation violates the express language of the enabling legislation and is unconstitutional on its face and as applied to him in violation of his fifth amendment equal protection rights.the district court dismissed his complaint for failure to state a claim.bowman now appeals that dismissal because we find the regulation is consistent with the enabling statute and does not violate bowman equal protection rights,we affirm.
background 
bowman served in the united states air force from september,until january,when he took an early retirement as part of a reduction in force.bowman received a final rank of technical sergeant.because bowman was just a few years shy of the required for a full retirement,he was eligible to participate in a program program allowing him to perform community service that would be counted toward his years of military service for retirement.the program was provided by the national defense authorization act for fiscal year which directed the secretary of defense to implement a program to encourage members and former members of the armed forces to enter into public and community service jobs after discharge or release from active duty.see,a,stat,codified at statute.section is entitled encouragement of postseparation public and community service.the statute defines public service organizations as organizations providing school services and education administration,law enforcement,public health care,social services and a ny other public or community service.g.
the secretary of defense promulgated regulations for the community service program.the program authorized service members who retired from active duty with at least but fewer than years of service to accrue additional retirement credit for work in a qualified public or community service organization.c.the regulations permit qualified former military personnel to accrue additional service credit for retirement through employment with public or community service organization s that provide the services listed in sections d through d.b.section d paints with a very broad brush the types of public and community service organizations for which retirement credit is allowed 
d public and community service organization.government or private organizations that provide or coordinate the provision of the following services 
elementary,secondary,or post secondary school teaching or administration.
support of teachers or school administrators.
law enforcement.
public health care.
social services.
public safety.
emergency relief.
public housing.
conservation.
environment.
job training.
other public and community service not listed previously,but consistent with or related to services described in paragraphs d through of this section.
d.the regulations bar credit toward retirement for employment with organizations engaged in religious activities,unless such activities are unrelated to religious instructions,worship services,or any form of proselytization.a.the regulations also exclude businesses organized for profit,labor unions,and partisan political organizations.id.
at the time of his retirement,bowman had years and three months of service in the air force.after retiring from the air force,bowman began employment with the people church of c ma church in geneva,ohio,first as a lay intern,and later as a youth minister.he does not dispute that his duties included religious instructions,worship services,or proselytization.the complaint does not elaborate on what his duties were either as a lay intern or as a youth minister.bowman was employed with the church continuously from his retirement until february.bowman contends that this employment should be counted toward his years of service so that he is entitled to a full retirement.according to his complaint,if he were granted the retirement credit for his work as a youth minister,he would be entitled to receive percent of his base military pay upon reaching the age of,as opposed to receiving only percent of his base military pay.the complaint does not quantify the money difference.
bowman alleges that he filed for military service credit under the program late in the year,again in november,and again in october,this time with the assistance of counsel,by submitting a validation of public or community service employment form to the defense manpower data center.neither plaintiff nor his counsel has ever received a response.plaintiff alleges that his request for creditable service has not been granted or even processed because the form shows that his employment was with a religious organization.bowman alleges that the exclusion of employment with organizations engaged in religious activities from qualification for creditable early retirement under the program conflicts with the broadly drafted enabling legislation,and is unconstitutional on its face and as applied to him in violation of his fifth amendment equal protection rights.

an agency must interpret its implementing legislation in a reasonable manner and may not promulgate regulations in a manner that are arbitrary or capricious in substance,or manifestly contrary to the statute.clark reg l med.ctr.united states dep t of health human services,cir.where congress empowers an agency to enact rules and regulations necessary to carry out an act,those regulations are to be upheld so long as they are reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation.jackson richards med,cir quoting mourning family publ ns,d.
b.the regulation comports with the statute and congressional intent 
bowman argues that the regulatory exclusion in a is not authorized by the enabling legislation,and is contrary to the purpose and intent of congress in establishing the program.the government,on the other hand,argues that the regulatory exclusion is authorized by,is supported by the legislative history,and is entitled to substantial deference under chevron,res.def.council,d.for the reasons discussed below,the district court properly held that the regulatory exclusion contained in a is consistent with the authorization provision of.
in deciding whether the regulatory exclusion conflicts with the statutory enactment,g,the proper starting point is the enabling legislation itself.a provides 
encouragement of postseparation public and community service 
a in general.the secretary of defense shall implement a program to encourage members and former members of the armed forces to enter into public and community service jobs after discharge or release from active duty.
id.this enabling legislation gives the secretary broad power to implement the program.congress defined community service organizations as set forth below 
g this section,the term public service and community service organization includes the following organizations 
any organization that provides the following services 
a elementary,secondary,or postsecondary school teaching or administration.
b support of such teaching or school administration.
c law enforcement.
d public health care.
e social services.
f any other public or community service.
any nonprofit organization that coordinates the provision of services described in paragraph.
the statute is silent on the issue of whether or not work for a religious organization is exempt.the secretary challenged regulation,a,allows early retirees to participate in the program when they work for nonprofit organizations engaged in religious activities if the activities are unrelated to religious instructions,worship services,or any form of proselytization.
bowman contends that congress would have spoken on the issue if it had intended to exclude certain work in religious activities as it has done so explicitly in other legislation.for example,bowman cites to three statutes that the district court relied upon in its analysis that the regulatory exclusion was needed to avoid a violation of the establishment clause of the first amendment.bowman united states,d.in each of those acts,congress specifically prohibited government funds from being used for sectarian purposes.see i no funds provided through a grant or contract to a religious organization to provide services under any substance abuse program under this subchapter or subchapter of this chapter shall be expended for sectarian worship,instruction,or proselytization a participants shall not be employed under this chapter to carry out the construction,operation,or maintenance of any part of any facility that is used or to be used for sectarian instruction or as a place for religious worship and c no funds provided directly to a religious organization to provide assistance under any program described in subsection a of this section shall be expended for sectarian worship,instruction,or proselytization.bowman argues that because congress has explicitly forbidden using public funds to support a religious organization for sectarian worship,instruction,or proselytization in other instances,the fact that it did not do so under must be construed to mean that congress did not intend for any restriction to apply.bowman makes too much of congressional silence.
congress endowed the secretary with broad discretion to adopt eligibility criteria for participation.the government contends that drawing an inference from congressional silence is inappropriate because the secretary regulations reasonably construe statutory terms left undefined by congress in a manner supported by the legislative history.the government argues that an inference may not be drawn from congressional silence where the inference is contrary to all other textual and contextual evidence of congressional intent.burns united states,d.the government contends that since the enabling statute specifically allows the secretary to define the activities which qualify for a retirement credit,the secretary is entitled to substantial deference for those regulations.in chevron,the court held that where congress has explicitly given an agency the power to elucidate a specific provision of a statute by regulation,the regulation must be upheld unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.at.
the first question for the court in deciding whether or not the secretary interpretation of as set forth in a is permissible is whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue by employing precise,unambiguous statutory language.alliance for cmty.media,cir quoting chevron,at.where congress has spoken in unambiguous terms,the inquiry ends and the court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.jewish,sec y of health human serv,cir.congress definition of public and community service organization is vague and leaves a gap for the secretary to fill.this is especially true given the myriad of organizations,public and private,offering various services of value to the community.
since g is ambiguous,the second prong of the chevron analysis comes into play,and the court must determine if the secretary interpretation of the statute is reasonable.alliance for cmty.media,at.the court is guided by the specific language of the provision at issue and its legislative history.id.the second chevron prong requires the court to decide if the regulation represents a permissible construction of the statute,and substantial deference is given to the agency interpretation.estate of gerson comm r of internal revenue,cir,cert.denied,d quoting chevron,at.harris olszewski,cir.
the government argues that the exemption is compelled by congressional intent to benefit only a very narrow class of community service organizations,namely,those involved in education,law enforcement,and health care.the district court based its decision on this distinction.the government relies on the senate report which specifically provides that the purpose of the legislation is to authorize active duty personnel who are approved for early retirement to accrue additional military retirement credit if they take critical jobs,such as in education,law enforcement,and health care.senate committee on armed services,national defense authorization act for fiscal year,at,cong.the government contends that the emphasis on critical job vacancies in education,law enforcement,and health care,is in harmony with the secretary exclusion of work for a religious organization if it involves religious instructions,worship services,or any form of proselytization.
bowman,however,asserts that the exclusion is at odds with the expansive language of g which includes credit for organizations involved in social services and any other public or community service.nothing in the legislative history suggests that congress intended to encourage retirees to accept positions which would involve religious instructions,worship or proselytization.similarly,nothing in the text of the statute itself suggests that congress intended to benefit this kind of activity.under these circumstances,deference is owed to the secretary of defense who,through his regulations,has excluded from g definition of service all activities involving religious instructions,worship or proselytization.accordingly,the district court properly held that the regulatory exclusion contained in a does not violate g 
c.the regulation does not violate bowman right to equal protection 
the district court also dismissed bowman complaint on the grounds that a did not violate his equal protection claim both on its face and as applied to him.since bowman did not set forth any facts challenging the application of the statute to him,the district court properly found that his and facial claims were one and the same and analyzed them as such.the district court correctly recognized that equal protection applies to the federal government through the due process clause of the fifth amendment.bolling sharpe.the equal protection clause protects against arbitrary classifications,and requires that similarly situated persons be treated equally.jackson jamrog,cir quotations omitted.
strict scrutiny 
bowman argues that his challenge of the constitutionality of the exclusion is subject to strict scrutiny because the exclusion is a classification based on religion and burdens his free exercise of religion.to survive strict scrutiny analysis,the regulation must be narrowly tailored to advance a compelling governmental interest.an equal protection claim is subject to rational basis review unless it involves infringement of a fundamental right or application to a suspect class.city of cleburne cleburne living,d.unless the program violates bowman fundamental right to exercise his religion,it must be upheld as long as it bears a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest.jamrog,at.strict scrutiny applies where the classification affecting eligibility for benefits is based on religion or burdens the exercise of religion.see mcdaniel paty,d.the first amendment provides congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,or prohibiting the free
