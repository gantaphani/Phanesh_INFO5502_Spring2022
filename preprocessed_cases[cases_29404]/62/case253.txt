marie toomer and jaya marie little appellants,the mother and daughter of roderick little little,appeal the district court order granting summary judgment to the united states.appellants brought suit under the federal tort claims act ftca,claiming that negligence by the united states caused little death.little was standing in the parking lot of the del taco restaurant located across the street from the street naval base naval base in san diego,california,when he was shot and killed by myron thomas thomas.prior to the shooting,little and thomas had been fighting at club metro,a bar and dance club located on the naval base and operated by the united states.we hold that the united states is not liable for little death.under california law,the united states duty to protect little from foreseeable criminal conduct extended only to the naval base,not to the del taco restaurant,which was outside the united states ownership and control.we affirm.
background and procedural history 
club metro is a bar and dance club located inside the naval base.it is operated by the government.because fights at club metro are common,customers are required to pass through metal detectors before entering,and club metro posts security guards at the entrance and inside the building.
roderick little and myron thomas were at club metro the night of november.each was with a group of friends.the two parties got into a fight on the dance floor.security personnel intervened and put an end to the physical violence,although the thomas group continued to make threatening gestures at little and his friends.when little group left the club,they were confronted by the thomas party,and another fight broke out in the parking lot.club metro security guards again intervened and instructed both groups to leave the naval base.they complied,although thomas had to be physically restrained and brought back to his car by his friends.
the naval base posted two military security officers,darrell gordon and juan salazar,at the exit from the base.the officers were assigned to direct traffic,which was typically very heavy around the time club metro closed at.a dark car with shiny rims and military decals drove past the officers,and they heard someone inside the car say,i going to do a.both officers understood this to be a threat of murder section of the california penal code covers murder.code.the person in the car was later identified as thomas.neither of the officers could see him at the time,and they were not able to take down the car license plate number.officer gordon intended to report the threat to dispatch,which would have then notified the local police,but he was tied up directing traffic.later gordon did go over to the guard booth to use the phone to report the threat.just as he picked up the receiver,he heard shots ring out.
meanwhile,thomas went to the apartment of sergeant kayzoski sanders,his supervisor and friend.thomas was living with sanders temporarily.thomas took sanders automatic rifle.sanders knew that thomas had the automatic rifle and that thomas was dangerous.he called thomas to try and persuade him to return to the apartment.instead,around am,thomas drove with a friend to the del taco restaurant located across the street from the naval base,where club metro patrons tended to hang out after the club had closed.little was standing in the parking lot of the restaurant.while his friend was at the wheel,thomas shot in the direction of little and his friends.little was killed,and several others were injured.
subsequently,thomas was convicted of murder.
marie toomer,little mother,and jaya marie toomer,little daughter,brought suit against the united states for wrongful death,claiming that little death was the result of negligence by the united states.after discovery was complete,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the united states,holding that california law did not impose on the united states an affirmative duty to protect little from violent acts that occurred off the naval base.plaintiffs now appeal.
discussion 
under the ftca,the united states can be held liable for roderick little death if a private individual under like circumstances could be held liable for his death under california tort law.appellants argue that the united states should be treated like a private night club operator for ftca purposes.see united states olson.based on that assumption,appellants advance two theories of liability.first,the united states owed little an affirmative duty to protect little from criminal conduct.second,the united states voluntarily provided security services at club metro and had a duty to exercise reasonable care in performing those services.appellants argue that the united states failed in both duties.
we agree with the district court that california law does not impose on the united states an affirmative duty to protect little from criminal activity occurring outside the naval base.even if the united states had such a duty,it was not obligated to protect little from thomas criminal conduct because the shooting was not reasonably foreseeable.furthermore,because the united states did not increase the risk of harm to little by providing security services at club metro,it can not be held liable on a negligent undertaking theory.we therefore affirm the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of the united states.
affirmative duty to protect little from thomas criminal activity 
the first element of any negligence claim is the existence of a duty.see vasquez residential,d.generally there is no obligation to protect others from the harmful conduct of third parties.however,california law imposes an affirmative duty on business proprietors to protect their customers from foreseeable criminal conduct,an obligation that is derived from the special relationship between a business proprietor and his customers.see morris de la torre,cal.
appellants argue that the united states,as the owner and operator of club metro,owed roderick little three specific affirmative duties.first,the united states had a duty to undertake reasonable and minimally burdensome measures,such as calling,to protect little from imminent or ongoing criminal activity.see id.at.second,the united states had a duty to take more burdensome measures,such as hiring security guards,to protect little from highly foreseeable crime.ann pac.plaza shopping,cal.third,because the united states was thomas landlord,it could be held liable for failing to address the presence of a dangerous tenant or other person on or about the property.hawkins wilton,d.
all three of these duties are specific instances of a landowner general duty of maintenance,which is owed to tenants and patrons.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the duty of maintenance is limited to the landowner property.see castaneda olsher,cal a landlord generally owes a tenant the duty to take reasonable measures to secure areas under the landlord control against foreseeable criminal acts of third parties.emphasis added morris,at duty to take reasonable and minimally burdensome measures to protect customers from ongoing criminal activity extends to areas within the proprietor control emphasis added hawkins,d at a landlord may also be liable for failing to address the presence of a dangerous tenant or other person on or about the property.emphasis added.while the united states did owe the above three duties to little when he was at club metro,those obligations ended when little drove off the naval base.the united states did not have a duty to protect little while he was at the del taco restaurant.where there is no duty,there can be no negligence.
appellants argue that the united states need only have violated its duty to protect little while little was on the navy base the injury resulting from that violation,little death,need not have also occurred on the navy base.appellants are incorrect.there is no california supreme court decision squarely on point,but intermediate appellate courts have held that,if a proprietor is to be held liable in tort for the criminal activity of third parties,that criminal activity must have occurred on the proprietor property.see mata mata,d,a landowner or possessor generally has no duty to take measures to prevent foreseeable violence occurring off the premises.medina hillshore partners,d,here the trial court ruled that landowner breached no duty of care because the wrongful death involved an shooting.we agree.martinez pac.bell,pac bell did not own,possess,or control,and invited no one onto,the parking lot.it,thus,owed no duty of care to protect appellant at that location.balard bassman event,a ny duty owed by respondent to appellant regarding criminal activity was confined to the premises of stanley restaurant.southland superior court,steinmetz stockton city chamber of commerce,
even if the united states affirmative duty to protect extended beyond the naval base,the united states still could not be held liable for little death because his death was not the result of foreseeable criminal activity.see morris,at ann,at f oreseeability is a crucial factor in determining the existence of duty.for example,in morris,the california supreme court held that the foreseeability requirement was satisfied because the attack against the plaintiff actually occurr ed in plain view of the defendant business owner.at.and in delgado trax bar grill,the court held that the defendant bar owner should have foreseen that plaintiff was going to get into a fight with another restaurant customer,at,because plaintiff wife told a security guard at the bar that there was going to be a fight between her husband and the third customer,the guard asked plaintiff to leave the bar in order to separate him from the other customer,and the guard saw the customer follow plaintiff into the parking lot,id.at.
the only indication the united states had that thomas was going to kill little was when two security guards at the exit from the navy base heard someone in a passing car say,i going to do a.although the guards understood this statement as a death threat,they did not see who made the threat,know who was the target of the threat,or see the license plate number of the car.nor did they know whether the threat was real or,instead,empty bravado.even if the officers had known that the threat was sincere and had known who the intended target was,they could not have known that thomas was going to go back to sanders apartment,pick up a gun,return more than half an hour later to the del taco restaurant several blocks away from the exit at which they were stationed,and shoot little in cold blood.see,wiener southcoast childcare,cal morris,at ann,at.the crime was not foreseeable and,therefore,the united states did not have a duty to protect little from that crime.
ii.negligent provision of security services 
appellants also argue that the united states,having chosen to provide security services at club metro,failed in its duty to exercise due care in providing those services.see delgado,at.under the negligent undertaking doctrine,a volunteer may be held liable for trying to protect others only if,in so doing,he increases the risk of harm to third parties.see paz state,cal.to measure increased risk,we must compare the risk of harm to little that existed on the night of the shooting with the risk that would have existed had the united states provided no security services at club metro,not with the risk that would have existed had the united states provided reasonably competent security services.see paz,at.because little would not have been safer had there been no security guards at club metro,appellants negligent undertaking claim fails.
iii.landlord theory of liability 
finally,appellants argue that their final claim against the united states,that the united states had a duty as thomas landlord to protect third parties from thomas once it became aware that thomas was dangerous,survived summary judgment because the district court did not specifically address this claim in its summary judgment order.even if this claim had been clearly pled in the complaint it would fail on the merits if the united states had an affirmative duty to protect little from tenants it knew to be dangerous,that duty extended only to the naval base,not to the del taco restaurant where little was killed.
i respectfully dissent.
consideration of the rowland factors,including foreseeability,demonstrates that the united states owed navy seaman roderick little a duty 
in this case we must decide whether the united states owed navy seaman roderick little a duty to take reasonable steps to protect him from marine lance corporal myron thomas deadly criminal attack.the majority concludes that the united states did not owe seaman little a duty because lance corporal thomas attack was not foreseeable.i respectfully disagree.
plaintiffs,seaman little mother and minor daughter,brought suit against the united states under california negligence law pursuant to the federal tort claims act.see providing that,subject to certain exceptions,the united states may be sued in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances trenouth united states,cir explaining that where a plaintiff brings suit under the federal tort claims act,courts apply the law of the state in which the alleged tort occurred.
under california negligence law,business proprietors such as owners of bars,restaurants,and shopping centers may have a duty to take reasonable steps to protect their tenants,patrons,or invitees against foreseeable criminal acts of third parties.morris de la torre,cal delgado trax bar grill,cal.fried chicken of cal.superior court,cal ann pacific plaza shopping,cal.
as the california supreme court has explained,a proprietor duty is determined by considering the factors set forth in rowland christian,cal,in light of the circumstances of the case.see morris,at delgado,at.fried chicken,at ann,at.the rowland factors are 
the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered,the moral blame attached to the defendant conduct,the policy of preventing future harm,the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach,and the availability,cost,and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.
morris,at ann,at.foreseeability is the most important of these factors.delgado,at.
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,as we must on an appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment,and examining the totality of the circumstances in this case,lance corporal thomas fatal attack against seaman little was foreseeable.see wiener southcoast childcare,cal explaining that on appeal from summary judgment,the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the appellant ann,at explaining that foreseeability is determined by totality of the circumstances.
club metro is a bar and dance club located on the street naval base in san diego.on november,lance corporal thomas and his friends attended club metro on the club weekly hip hop night.seaman little and his friends attended club metro that same night.
club metro security personnel,which consisted of active duty navy shore patrol and civilians,knew that there was a history of violence at club metro.in the three years preceding seaman little death,at least fifty fights had occurred at club metro weekly hip hop night,approximately thirty of which resulted in arrests.
at about on the night in question,lance corporal thomas and his friends got into a fight on the dance floor with seaman little and his friends.security personnel intervened,but lance corporal thomas,seaman little,and their friends continued to exchange hostile words and gestures.
as they were leaving club metro at about,lance corporal thomas challenged seaman little to a fight in the club metro parking lot.club metro security personnel,believing that the altercation would become violent if they did not intervene,physically separated the two groups.even after they were physically separated,however,lance corporal thomas,seaman little,and their friends continued to argu
