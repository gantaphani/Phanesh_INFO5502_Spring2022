godwin was a coast guard lieutenant serving on extended active duty as a reserve program administrator rpa.rpa officers were a category of reserve component officers who served on active duty pursuant to,which was repealed in.in december of,the coast guard convened a board to select officers for promotion to lieutenant commander,among other ranks,for,and rpa captains for active duty continuation.the selection board considering godwin for selection for promotion consisted of seven officers,of which only two were rpa officers.the selection board had before it a number of godwin previous semiannual oers,but no oer for the semiannual period of june,to november.the selection board ultimately did not recommend godwin for promotion.because godwin had not been selected for promotion to lieutenant commander in the previous year,thus having been passed up two consecutive years for promotion,he was mandatorily separated from the coast guard on february.godwin received an oer covering the time period from june,to february,detachment oer.
on june and july,godwin submitted an application for correction to the department of transportation board for correction of military records corrections board,seeking the removal of godwin failure of selection for promotion on the ground that an oer for the review period between june,and november,was unavailable when the selection board convened in december.godwin also sought removal of the february oer from his record.the corrections board denied relief on june,finding no error or injustice on the coast guard part regarding godwin failure of selection by the selection board.the corrections board interpreted the coast guard regulations as allowing semiannual evaluations to be delayed as long as the officer received an oer within days of the normally scheduled semiannual oer.thus,the corrections board found permissible the coast guard decision to process an oer for godwin in february rather than for the semiannual review period ending november.the corrections board subsequently denied reconsideration of its decision.
on august,godwin submitted another application for correction with the corrections board to void his second,and also asked to be returned to active duty and be awarded back pay and allowances.godwin claimed that the selection board was unfairly constituted because it should have had at least three rpa members per coast guard regulations.on july,the corrections board denied godwin request,finding that the coast guard had reasonably concluded that only two rpa officers were available to serve on the selection board.the corrections board denied godwin request for reconsideration on january.

article of the coast guard personnel manual states 
composition of boards.a board convened to consider rpa for promotion to the next higher grade shall consist of five or more officers who are serving in or above the highest grade to which the board may recommend officers for promotion.three of the members shall be rpa.if a sufficient number of rpa are not available to satisfy this requirement,commandant may reduce the number of rpa members to not less than one.in the event no reserve officer is serving on active duty who is senior to all officers to be considered for promotion,a reserve officer serving on inactive duty or in a retired status who is senior to all officers to be considered by the board shall be called to active duty and placed on the board.
article first emphasis in original second emphasis added.thus,under article,if at least three rpa officers are not available,the coast guard is obligated to place at least one rpa officer on the selection board
