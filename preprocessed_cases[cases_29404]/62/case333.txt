this appeal presents the question whether a military service member must exhaust all intraservice administrative remedies before applying for a writ of habeas corpus seeking discharge from the military under the terms of his or her enlistment contract.the district court granted relief and ordered the service member discharged from the military after construing the contract in his favor.because winck has not exhausted his intraservice military remedies,we reverse and remand with instructions to dismiss the petitioner application without prejudice.
background 
the petitioner,david winck,enlisted in the navy under the exceptional student provisions of the nuclear propulsion officer candidate nupoc program,executing the nupoc service agreement enlistment contract on june.he was then ordered to active duty while he completed his final year of college.in december,while still in college,winck signed an addendum page for service agreements.in the addendum,he acknowledged that officer candidate school ocs was a physically and mentally challenging program,and agreed that i f entering the program from civilian life,i n the event he request ed disenrollment prior to acceptance of a commission,he would be discharged from the naval service,but,i f entering the program from an enlisted status he would be obligated to serve the terms of the previous enlistment contract,ex.a at.in this case,those terms required him to serve two years on active duty in an enlisted status if disenrolled from the nupoc program for any reason other than physical,ex.a at.
in may,winck received orders to report to ocs.after reporting,he signed an administrative remarks form with essentially the same language as the addendum regarding disenrollment,with the exception that entering the program from enlisted status expressly included special programs such as nupoc.the following month,winck voluntarily disenrolled from ocs and requested discharge from the navy under the terms of his enlistment contract.the navy advised him,however,that he must serve out the enlisted term required by the original service agreement,and subsequently assigned him to the hue city,a guided missile cruiser to be deployed in january for extended operations in the persian gulf.winck then filed this habeas petition,arguing that the term program in the addendum referred to nupoc and not ocs,and that since he entered nupoc from civilian life,he was entitled to discharge.because the navy did not raise exhaustion as an issue,the district court assumed,without so finding,that winck had exhausted all available intramilitary remedies,and granted the petition on its merits after construing the contract in winck favor.
ii.discussion 
waiver of the exhaustion doctrine 
on appeal,the navy raises exhaustion for the first time,arguing that winck had first sought relief neither from the board for correction of naval records bcnr,created pursuant to with broad remedial authority to correct any error or remove any injustice identified by a service member upon approval by the secretary of the navy,appellant br.at,or from his superior officer pursuant to article of the uniform code of military justice.winck urges us,however,to deem the issue waived because the navy failed to raise it below both in its response to the habeas petition and in its motion to reconsider.the navy responds that exhaustion in the special military context is in the nature of a jurisdictional requirement,and,therefore,may be raised at any time.appellant br.at.as a threshold issue,we determine whether exhaustion in this context is jurisdictional and,therefore,incumbent upon us to consider.
it is true,as the navy points out,that our opinion in hodges callaway,cir,raised exhaustion sua sponte,referring to it as a jurisdictional problem.however,w hat we really determine is a judicial policy akin to comity,mindes seaman,cir,that is,a judicial abstention doctrine.meister.adjutant general dep t,cir,cert.denied,d.as such,we view the requirement of exhaustion as based on principles of comity and not as an imperative limitation of the scope of federal habeas corpus power.in re kelly,cir per curiam.
in fact,we have consistently distinguished our jurisdiction from these prudential considerations.for example,while we have squarely held that courts have jurisdiction over applications for habeas corpus brought by persons in confinement by the military,united states ex rel.berry commanding general,cir,b efore entertaining such an application,we have required,on principles of comity,the exhaustion of the procedures of the military justice system.id.similarly,judicial concern over inappropriate intrusion into military matters has led us to decline review of those matters,though we generally have jurisdiction.rucker secretary of the army,cir citation omitted see also woodard marsh,cir.unit a a federal district court should not review every such decision,even if it has subject matter jurisdiction.
the supreme court has espoused a similar distinction.because civilian courts have jurisdiction to review the judgment of a in a habeas corpus proceeding,the court initial concern is not whether the district court has any power at all to consider those habeas applications,but rather the manner in which the court should proceed to exercise its power.burns wilson.again in schlesinger councilman,d,having already established that jurisdiction existed for the district court to permanently enjoin impending proceedings against an army captain,id.at.at,the court concluded that a question of equitable jurisdiction remained,a question concerned,not with whether a claim falls within the limited jurisdiction conferred on the federal courts,but with whether consistently with the principles governing equitable relief the court may exercise its remedial powers.id.at.at.
we have also expressly concluded that exhaustion is not a jurisdictional bar to habeas relief when seeking release from state custody pursuant to.esslinger davis,cir our consideration whether judicial review is appropriate in the military context is animated by the same principles of comity arising in the setting.see discussion infra note.for this reason,we apply an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing a district court refusal,for lack of exhaustion,to take jurisdiction of a habeas petition brought by a member of the armed forces convicted by special.see doyle koelbl,cir per curiam 
having found the military exhaustion requirement prudential,and not jurisdictional,winck now urges us to reject the navy allegation that he failed to exhaust intraservice military remedies because it was raised for the first time on appeal.we decline to do so,emphasizing the importance of the doctrines of abstention and exhaustion,as well as their application to the military context.in schlesinger,for example,the court sua sponte sought supplemental briefing on exhaustion of remedies,and the propriety of a federal district court enjoining a pending proceeding.at.at.similarly,in the context of a habeas petition for release from state custody,the court held that,while an appellate court is not required to dismiss for nonexhaustion notwithstanding the state failure to raise it,neither is it obligated to regard the state omission as an absolute waiver of the claim.granberry greer,d.recognizing that there are some cases in which it is appropriate for an appellate court to address the merits of a habeas corpus petition notwithstanding the lack of complete exhaustion,id.at.at,the court nevertheless counseled its lower counterparts to determine whether the interests of comity will be better served by addressing the merits forthwith or by requiring a series of additional proceedings before reviewing the merits of the petitioner claim.id.at.at see also esslinger,at c ircumstances may counsel that a district court raise sua sponte a procedural bar to relief that the state has waived,such as the exhaustion requirement in.
accordingly,our decision whether to mandate exhaustion when raised first on appeal is within our discretion.here,winck has at least a colorable federal claim,one that is not,however,plainly warranted,two factors that both counsel against a decision on the merits.granberry,at.at.thus,we will use our discretion to determine whether exhaustion of intraservice military administrative remedies is required before a federal court may review a habeas petition brought by a member of the military seeking discharge under the terms of his or her enlistment contract.
b.the exhaustion doctrine as applied to military habeas petitions 
as previously noted,t hat the federal civil courts have jurisdiction of applications for habeas corpus brought by persons in confinement by the military authorities is undoubted.berry,at gusik schilder.this jurisdiction extends to those involuntarily held while claiming entitlement to discharge under military regulations.see in re kelly,at.we have also recognized our jurisdiction over a habeas petition seeking cancellation or rescission of the petitioner enlistment contract,applying traditional notions of contract law.peavy warner,cir see also ferrell secretary of,cir.
in gusik,the court concluded that i f an available procedure has not been employed to rectify an alleged error in a military judgment which the federal court is asked to correct,any interference by the federal court may be wholly needless.at.at.it thereby established the general rule that habeas corpus petitions from military prisoners should not be entertained by federal civilian courts until all available remedies within the military court system have been invoked in vain.noyd bond,d see also berry,at.in woodrick hungerford,the fifth circuit applied the exhaustion requirement to the type of habeas claim raised here,and held that where a serviceman seeks to effect a rescission of his enlistment contract by means of the habeas writ in federal court,he must show that he has exhausted all available intraservice remedies.we agree,and now adopt this holding as our own,including within its ambit all habeas petitions seeking discharge from the military under the terms of the petitioner enlistment contract,or through allegations that such a contract has been illegally formed or breached.
in doing so,we employ the usual considerations used in determining application of the exhaustion doctrine to specific cases,an application which the supreme court has observed requires an understanding of its purposes and of the particular administrative scheme involved.mckart united states,d.
accordingly,in determining whether the exhaustion rule should be rigidly applied,the court has,on a basis,employed a balancing analysis which considers both the interests of the agency in applying its expertise,correcting its own errors,making a proper record,enjoying appropriate independence of decision and maintaining an administrative process free from deliberate flouting,and the interests of private parties in finding adequate redress for their grievances.
montgomery rumsfeld,cir explaining mckart.
with this framework in mind,we find that the balancing analysis in this case weighs in favor of exhaustion.while some of the practical considerations supporting the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies unique agency competence and expertise,and development of an adequate factual record on not be implicated here,schlesinger,at.at,our respect for coordinate judicial systems and their autonomy,has led us,time and again,to require exhaustion in military cases.see,linfors united states,cir per curiam von hoffburg alexander,cir hodges,at mindes,at berry,at.
the exhaustion doctrine,as we have already explained,originated from broader principles of comity and judicial concern for military independence.granberry,at.at c omity is the basis for the exhaustion doctrine it is a principle controlling all habeas corpus petitions to the federal courts citation omitted.determining whether federal habeas corpus relief was available to review specific assignments to duty,the court in orloff willoughby,explained the principles behind this abiding reluctance to interfere with military affairs 
we know that from top to bottom of the army the complaint is often made,and sometimes with justification,that there is discrimination,favoritism or other objectionable handling of men.but judges are not given the task of running the army.the responsibility for setting up channels through which such grievances can be considered and fairly settled rests upon the congress and upon the president of the united states and his subordinates.the military constitutes a specialized community governed by a separate discipline from that of the civilian.orderly government requires that the judiciary be as scrupulous not to interfere with legitimate army matters as the army must be scrupulous not to intervene in judicial matters.
id.at.at see also white callaway,cir.
in mindes,we distilled,from orloff and other federal court precedent,the primary conclusion that a court should not review internal military affairs in the absence of a an allegation of the deprivation of a constitutional right,or an allegation that the military has acted in violation of applicable statutes or its own regulations,and b exhaustion of available intraservice corrective measures.at in explaining mindes,we said that t he strict application of the exhaustion doctrine serves to maintain the balance between military authority and the power of federal courts,von hoffburg,at,by reducing inappropriate intrusion into military matters.rucker,at quoting nesmith fulton,cir.thus,i n the military context,the exhaustion requirement promotes the efficient operation of the military judicial and administrative systems,allowing the military an opportunity to fully exercise its own expertise and discretion prior to any civilian court review.von hoffburg,at.
although the court in woodrick expressly relied on mindes,see at,we do not.the mindes test originally developed from claims in which service members objected to a military discharge or other personnel action,and has generally not been applied in habeas cases,and,in fact,has eroded over time 
instead,we reaffirm the unflagging strength of the principles of comity and judicial noninterference with,and respect for,military operations that informed the mindes doctrine.thus,to decide this case on the merits without first applying the exhaustion doctrine would only encourage future litigants to deliberately flout military processes,and telegraph that we are no longer serious about,or concerned with,their integrity or autonomy.we therefore hold that a military service member must exhaust all intramilitary remedies before applying for a writ of habeas corpus seeking discharge from the military under the terms of his or her enlistment contract,unless the application falls within a limited number of exceptions to the exhaustion principle.consequently,unless winck can demonstrate that his petition implicates one or more of these exceptions,it is due to be denied 
generally,exhaustion is not required where no genuine opportunity for adequate relief exists,irreparable injury will result if the complaining party is compelled to pursue administrative remedies,or an administrative appeal would be futile.linfors,at citations omitted.here,winck argues that irreparable harm must be evaluated at the time the habeas petition was filed in district court,even on appeal o therwise,the military would always be able to avoid the irreparable harm exception by waiting until after they lose in the district court and then placing the petitioner on inactive reserve before they appeal,tactics that should not be permitted.appellee br.at.at the time of his original petition,winck claims that he would have suffered irreparable harm if required to exhaust his military remedies because he was faced with imminent deployment to the persian gulf,the same region in which the attack on the cole occurred.appellee br.at 
winck arguments,however,are without merit,besides the fact that he points to no authority,binding or persuasive,to support his reasoning.admittedly,it seems unwise to adopt a rule that would permit,and might even encourage,the military to seek a favorable ruling on the merits in the district court while holding the exhaustion defense in reserve for use on appeal if necessa
