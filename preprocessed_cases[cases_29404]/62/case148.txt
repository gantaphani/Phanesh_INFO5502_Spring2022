esther kiobel appeals the district court order denying her motion to compel attendance and to produce documents and quashing the subpoena duces tecum directed to victor oteri,a to the underlying class action suit pending in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
facts and proceedings 
this ancillary proceeding arises from a class action lawsuit pending in the united states district court for the southern district of new york in which kiobel and others allege that the royal dutch petroleum company,shell transport and trading company,and shell petroleum development corporation of nigeria,collectively,shell cooperated with and assisted the nigerian military in the brutal repression of the ogoni,a nigerian ethnic minority the underlying complaint alleges that the ogoni demanded that shell adhere to proper environmental standards and pay compensation for environmental damages in relation to its oil exploration and production activities in nigeria.in response to the ogoni demands,the nigerian military and police forces,allegedly supported and assisted by shell,retaliated against the ogoni by visiting a campaign of terror on them,which allegedly included launching armed attacks on their villages,subjecting the inhabitants to arbitrary arrest,confinement,and torture,and executing leaders of the protest following proceedings in a military kangaroo court.
during discovery in the underlying litigation,kiobel learned that a witness,victor oteri,resides in houston,texas.oteri served as the security coordinator for shell nigerian subsidiary during the time alleged in the complaint.in the united states district court for the southern district of texas,kiobel sought,procured,and then served a subpoena duces tecum on oteri in february.the subpoena ordered oteri to appear and to testify regarding shell alleged cooperation with the nigerian government and military in the campaign against the ogoni to thwart their peaceful protests against shell oil operations.the subpoena also ordered oteri to produce at the deposition documents relevant to kiobel underlying claims.
counsel for kiobel and oteri failed to agree on a date for oteri deposition or on the scope of the documents that oteri was to produce at the deposition.kiobel then issued a second subpoena in september,which was identical to the first.this subpoena required oteri to produce 
a ny and all documents in your control,possession,or have access to sic pertaining to your employment with the shell petroleum development company of nigeria any and all of your other business activities in nigeria.including,but not limited sic,all activities with the nigerian government,military,nigerian police,spy police and all other professional entities.
after communications between counsel for kiobel and oteri failed to produce any agreement on the scope of the subpoena or any possible date for the deposition,oteri filed objections to the subpoena duces tecum in the district court.
in response to oteri objections,kiobel filed a motion to compel attendance and production of documents in october.the district court treated oteri objections as a motion to quash,crediting the objections and quashing the subpoena.the following month,the district court denied kiobel motion to compel based on the prior order that quashed the subpoena.the court provided no explanation in either or to why it quashed the subpoena or denied the motion to compel.kiobel timely filed her notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction 
as a threshold matter,we must determine whether we have jurisdiction to review the discovery order that kiobel appeals.subject to exceptions not relevant here,we have jurisdiction over only final decisions of a district court in general,discovery orders do not constitute final decisions under section and are not immediately appealable and,we have held that discovery orders generally are not appealable under the cohen collateral order doctrine 
in auction galleries,american numismatic ass n,we held that a district court order granting discovery directed at a in a proceeding ancillary to the underlying litigation was not immediately appealable under section or the collateral order doctrine in,however,we specifically reserve d for another day and another case the issue whether a decision denying discovery to a party seeking it would be appealable in circumstances such as those present in this case.
despite our reservation in,we had previously held in in re that we have jurisdiction over the denial of a discovery order directed to a to an underlying lawsuit pending in another circuit.tom rubin was the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding pending in the united states bankruptcy court for the central district of california he initiated discovery against,houston,to the bankruptcy the united states district court for the southern district of texas the district court denied the discovery motion,and rubin appealed 
we held that the denial of the discovery order was immediately appealable in doing so,we stated that 
i t is true that normally the action by the district court on a discovery motion is interlocutory and not appealable.but of importance in the circumstances of this case is the requirement of rule a that the motion for discovery was required to be filed in the southern district of texas.since khtv is not a party to the bankruptcy in california,the only way in which the order of the district court denying discovery can be appealed is to this court.if this appeal is dismissed there is no review of the district court order.under these circumstances,appeal from such an order should lie.
we find that the denial of the discovery motion in this case is appealable 
rubin is directly applicable to the instant appeal.kiobel,like rubin,is a party to underlying litigation pending in another circuit.oteri,like,is a to the underlying litigation to whom the party has directed discovery.rule a required kiobel to seek her subpoena in the texas district court both here and in rubin,the district courts denied the discovery requests.any appeal of the texas district court denial lies only with this court.we conclude that the denial of kiobel discovery order is immediately appealable 
our holding is buttressed by an analysis of this interlocutory appeal under the cohen collateral order doctrine.as noted,the cohen doctrine authorizes a party to appeal a collateral order immediately by demonstrating that the order conclusively determines the disputed question,resolves an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.an order denying discovery directed to a to underlying litigation pending in another circuit conclusively resolves the only issues before the district issues affecting the of the merits of the underlying lawsuit.further,the party aggrieved by an order denying discovery from a nonparty outside the circuit in which the underlying lawsuit is pending would have no means of obtaining appellate review of that order absent immediate appeal.here,the second circuit will decide any appeal from the final judgment in the underlying class action lawsuit,and the second circuit has no authority to upset a discovery order entered by a district court in this circuit.the cohen collateral order exception supports our jurisdiction here.
oteri cites texaco,in re willy and in re as supporting the proposition that we have no jurisdiction over this appeal because the district court denial of kiobel motion to compel is an interlocutory discovery order.oteri reliance on these cases is misplaced.not one of these cases treats whether the denial of a discovery order directed to a to underlying litigation is immediately appealable.texaco,for example,treated an appeal of the denial of a discovery order directed to a party to the underlying proceeding under the collateral doctrine exception in willy and sessions,we denied mandamus petitions to parties who appealed the denial of a discovery motion directed at a party to the underlying proceedings 
oteri also seems to argue that we have no jurisdiction to entertain this appeal because kiobel does not appeal the order quashing the subpoena,only the order denying the motion to compel.oteri contends that the district court denied the motion to compel as moot because it had already quashed the subpoena in sum,oteri argues that kiobel appeals the denial of a moot motion.we reject this argument.the motion to compel,which kiobel appeals,is derivative of the subpoena that the district court quashed kiobel would not have had to file the motion to compel if oteri had complied with the subpoena.after the district court quashed the subpoena,the motion to compel was still outstanding because the district court failed to rule on it when it quashed the subpoena.kiobel appeal of the motion to seeks to enforce oteri compliance with the logically an appeal of the quashing of the underlying subpoena.oteri argument is meritless,and we hold under the authority of rubin that we have jurisdiction over this appeal.
motion to compel 
standard of review 
we review the grant of a motion to quash a subpoena for abuse of discretion we review a district court discovery rulings,including the denial of a motion to compel,for abuse of discretion we will affirm such decisions unless they are arbitrary or clearly unreasonable.
under federal rule of civil procedure,a court may quash or modify a subpoena if it fails to allow a reasonable time for compliance requires a person who is not a party to travel more than miles from where the person resides requires disclosure of privileged or protected matter or subjects a person to undue burden oteri challenges kiobel subpoena on the fourth ground only,that the subpoena is overbroad and subjects him to undue burden.
the moving party has the burden of to demonstrate that compliance with the subpoena would be unreasonable and oppressive.whether a burdensome subpoena is reasonable must be determined according to the facts of the case,such as the party need for the documents and the nature and importance of the litigation.to determine whether the subpoena presents an undue burden,we consider the following factors relevance of the information requested the need of the party for the documents the breadth of the document request the time period covered by the request the particularity with which the party describes the requested documents and the burden imposed further,if the person to whom the document request is made is a,the court may also consider the expense and inconvenience to the a court may find that a subpoena presents an undue burden when the subpoena is facially overbroad 
generally,modification of a subpoena is preferable to quashing it outright in circumstances analogous to this review of a denial of a motion for abuse of and other courts have held that a district court denial of such a motion,unaccompanied by written or constitute an abuse of discretion here,the district court quashed the subpoena and denied the motion to compel outright without providing oral or written reasons for doing so neither did the district court attempt to explain any deficiencies in either the subpoena or the motion so that kiobel might have an opportunity to cure any defects.nor did the district court attempt to modify the subpoena to cure any overbreadth the district court even failed to set or hold a hearing on the breadth of the subpoena.there is no record evidence that the district court considered and applied the factors listed above to determine whether the subpoena is overbroad.we hold that this constitutes an abuse of discretion under the circumstances present here.
having concluded that the district court abused its discretion when it quashed the subpoena and denied the motion to compel outright without giving any reasons whatsoever,we must now determine the appropriate remedy,which the parties dispute.kiobel asserts that the proper remedy is to remand to the district court with instructions that it grant the motion to compel.in contrast,oteri contends that the only proper remedy is a remand to the district court with instructions to provide this court with the reasons for which it denied the motion to compel and quashed the subpoena.
we find no case the parties have cited us to restricts our course of action when we conclude that the district court abused its discretion by failing to provide reasons for denying a motion to compel and quashing a subpoena.section of the united states code,however,aids our determination of the appropriate remedy here 
the supreme court or any other court of appellate jurisdiction may affirm,modify,vacate,set aside or reverse any judgment,decree,or order of a court lawfully brought before it for review,and may remand the cause and direct the entry of such appropriate judgment,decree,or order,or require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances 
under this provision,we ha ve the power to make such disposition of the case as justice may require.indeed,in the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction we have power not only to correct error in the judgment under review but to make such disposition of the case as justice requires.
section grants us broad power when it comes to how best to dispose of a matter under our review.here,we are convinced that a remand to the district court for the provision of reasons would be an exercise in futility.such a remand would unnecessarily prolong not only this dispute but the underlying litigation in the southern district of new york as well.considering the interests of judicial economy,the convenience to the parties,the likelihood of a subsequent appeal if the district court were to deny the discovery motion with reasons,and further delay of the underlying litigation in the southern district of new york,we conclude that modification of the subpoena followed by a remand is appropriate here.
as noted above,the subpoena requests 
a ny and all documents in your control,possession,or have access to sic pertaining to your employment with the shell petroleum development company of nigeria any and all of your other business activities in nigeria,including,but not limited sic,all activities with the nigerian government,military,nigerian police,spy police and all other professional entities.
oteri argues that the subpoena seeks irrelevant information kiobel does not need the information because she has already received shell documents the subpoena contains no specific time frame the period that the subpoena covers is enormous and kiobel has refused to particularize and narrow her document request 
oteri first argues that the subpoena seeks irrelevant information.under the federal discovery rules,any party to a civil action is entitled to all information relevant to the subject matter of the action before the court unless such information is privileged.discovery requests are relevant when they seek admissible evidence or evidence that is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.whether kiobel discovery requests are relevant thus turns on whether they are reasonably calculated to lead to evidence admissible as to her claims against shell.
here,the basis of the underlying complaint is that shell cooperated in the nigerian government campaign against the ogoni.oteri served as the security coordinator for shell nigerian subsidiary during the time alleged in the complaint,and,indeed,the documents that kiobel already possesses show that oteri was involved in the purchase of arms and ammunition for shell.the subpoena requests the documents that oteri possesses,controls,or has access to that pertain to his employment with shell.the subpoena further requests that oteri produce all documents that relate to his other business activities in nigeria,including those with the nigerian government,police,or military.the subpoena clearly requests information and documents that are relevant to kiobel complaint.as shell security coordinator,oteri knowledge of shell activities with the nigerian government is relevant to the claims that kiobel alleges in her complaint.
we find,however,that,as written,the subpoena document request is overbroad.oteri challenges the subpoe
