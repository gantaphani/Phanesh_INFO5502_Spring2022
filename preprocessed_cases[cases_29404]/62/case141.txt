linda meister is a civilian state employee of the texas adjutant general office.she brought several title vii claims related to her work,but the district court dismissed all of them.the district court concluded that her claims were incident to military service and held that they were under feres united states.we conclude,however,that feres is inapplicable to civilian jobs in the state military departments of texas.instead of applying feres,the court should have dismissed one of meister claims for failure to allege a prima facie title vii violation and evaluated the justiciability of the other two claims under mindes seaman,cir.we therefore affirm the dismissal of the first claim and reverse and remand for a mindes evaluation of the other two.
since,linda meister has worked as a civilian state employee for the texas adjutant general department of the texas national guard.she also happens to have been a officer in the texas air national guard,where her position was information management craftsman.
between and the end of,meister civilian position fell within the general category of administrative technician.her specific title was assistant schools program manager for the texas army national guard.meister job was to assist the schools program manager,major glen andrews,an active duty member of the texas army national guard.the schools program manager has various responsibilities,including scheduling and coordinating attendance at army training programs by members of the texas army national guard.
meister has alleged that andrews subjected her to a hostile work environment,although this is not the basis of her claims here.she filed a grievance concerning andrews behavior in october,which led to an investigation.four months after the completion of that investigation,andrews was transferred to another department.
andrews transfer vacated the position of schools program manager.this position,however,was designated as a federal position.this designation requires that the position be filled only by an active member of the military service.meister asked that the position be redesignated as a state position,which would have allowed her to hold the post as a civilian.this request was denied in early,and an national guard member was hired instead.
in december,meister was transferred to assistant personnel manager in the texas air national guard division.meister had not asked for the transfer and was unhappy about it.the new position involved the management and coordination of texas air national guard military personnel.meister duties in this job were the same as or similar to her duties as a officer in the texas air national guard.as with meister job as assistant schools program manager,active military service was not a prerequisite.
one year after her transfer,in december,meister filed suit against the texas adjutant general department and the adjutant general of the state of texas,brigadier general daniel james,iii,in his official capacity.meister claimed sexual harassment and discrimination in violation of title vii and the texas commission on human rights act tchra.specifically,she complained of the denial of a promotion to schools program manager and of her transfer to the position of assistant military personnel officer.
in february,meister applied for the position of state human resources manager,program administrator iv.this position involved the management and coordination of the state personnel functions of the adjutant general department.active military service was not a requirement,but meister never received an interview,and someone else was hired for the job.
in march,the defendants answered meister complaint and moved to dismiss the state law claims on the grounds of eleventh amendment immunity.the court granted this motion in june.
in november,meister amended her complaint,adding a title vii retaliation claim.meister alleged that she was denied promotion,harassed,and laterally transferred because she had complained of unlawful discrimination.this version of the complaint is the one that is relevant to this appeal,and it raises claims with respect to the following 
the defendants failure to promote meister to the schools program manager position 
meister involuntary transfer to the position of assistant air personnel manager and 
the defendants failure to promote meister to state human resource manager.
the defendants filed two motions to dismiss.the first,which was also a motion for summary judgment in the alternative,asserted that the claims were not justiciable under feres united states.in feres,the supreme court had held that military servicemen could not bring claims against the federal government under the federal tort claims act.the second motion addressed the merits.on august,the two motions were referred to a magistrate judge.he issued his report and recommendation on august that the first motion to dismiss be granted,and that the summary judgment motion be denied.in reaching this conclusion,the magistrate judge considered evidence beyond the pleadings.the second motion,to dismiss on the merits,was not mentioned.
on august,meister filed the following two objections to the magistrate judge report that the report failed to address the denial of promotion to the state human resources director position and that the magistrate judge failed to analyze justiciability under mindes seaman,cir.
after reviewing the case de novo,the district court issued an order on august,approving and accepting the magistrate judge report and granting the defendants motion to dismiss.meister then filed this appeal.
we will review the dismissal in this case as a summary judgment determination.under federal rule of civil procedure b,a district court may treat a b motion to dismiss as a summary judgment motion by considering material outside the pleadings.that is what the magistrate and district court judges did here.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.threadgill prudential securities group,cir.
we begin by observing that the plain language of title vii allows civilian employees of state national guard units to bring suit against their employers the question in this case,however,is not whether title vii provides meister a cause of action but whether the federal courts are permitted to review the military decision and to grant relief in this case.the issue,in other words,is simply whether meister claims are justiciable.
the first issue before us is whether the district court was correct in analyzing justiciability under feres.the magistrate judge report,which the district court adopted in full,asked whether the acts forming the basis of meister complaint were incident to service in the military.see united states stanley,d quoting feres,at.at.the report first applied this test to meister claim concerning the denial of promotion to schools program manager.the magistrate judge recognized that this position has a tremendous effect on military careers because it determines military occupational specialties and controlled training,thereby determining promotability of individual soldiers.for these reasons,the defendants command decision to maintain this requirement of active military service was one integrally related to the military unique structure.thus,the matter of meister promotion was not justiciable.
as for meister involuntary transfer claim,the magistrate judge found that meister new position as assistant military personnel officer involve d management and coordination of military activities.moreover,meister supervisor was an active member of the military.thus,the magistrate judge concluded that meister civilian position was inextricably intertwined with the national guard military mission and was therefore nonjusticiable.
the magistrate judge did not specifically analyze meister third in denying her an opportunity to compete for the state human resources manager position.but,as the district court pointed out,the magistrate judge concluded that all three of meister claims relate to personnel decisions that are inextricably intertwined with the unique structure of the texas national guard 
before we can evaluate the district court analysis,we need to determine the standard of review.the defendants contend that meister failed to object specifically to the magistrate judge reliance on feres.that would normally limit our review to one for plain error.douglass united services automobile,cir en banc.but when the district court has engaged in de novo review,we do not require these specific objections to the magistrate judge report as a prerequisite to full review.see douglass,at.in the present case,the district court engaged in such a de novo review.we therefore will not impose this objection requirement here and will instead address this legal issue de novo.
a first step in analyzing the applicability of feres is to review that case and its progeny.the holding in feres itself is actually quite narrow.in that case,three claimants brought negligence suits against the united states armed forces on behalf of deceased servicemen.the issue before the court was whether these suits could proceed under the federal tort claims act.the court explained that the ftca impact was merely waived immunity,putting the united states government in the same position as any other defendant.the ftca had not created a new cause of action.thus,the government only faced liability to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.feres,at.at.
in analyzing whether analogous liability would exist under federal law between private individuals,the court focused on the plaintiffs relationship to the defendant,not the nature of the claim itself.in other words,the court tried to find a private relationship analogous to the relationship.the court did not,however,seek a federal analogue to state negligence law.
ultimately,the court concluded that there was no private relationship similar to that between soldier and government.thus,the plaintiffs had failed to establish liability of a private individual even remotely analogous to that being asserted by the plaintiffs,at.at.as a result,soldiers could not recover for injuries that ar ose out of or were in the course of activity incident to service,at.at.
little was done with feres until chappell wallace,d.by that time,a new cause of action had been formulated by the bivens suit for violations of constitutional rights.thus,the court did not need to consider available state law provisions and could instead evaluate the defendant conduct for constitutional violations.the plaintiffs were seeking redress for discrimination in duty assignments and performance evaluations.but the court rejected their claim despite the existence of bivens 
the special nature of military life,the need for unhesitating and decisive action by military officers and equally disciplined responses by enlisted personnel would be undermined by a judicially created remedy exposing officers to personal liability at the hands of those they are charged to command.
at.at.the court also explained that the constitution granted congress plenary authority to regulate military life,and that congress had done so by setting up a judicial system separate from article iii courts,at.at.this suggested that the courts lacked the constitutional foundation to enter this field in the absence of congressional imprimatur.taking these factors into consideration,the court concluded that enlisted military personnel may not maintain a suit to recover damages from a superior officer for alleged constitutional violations,at.at.
the court extended this principle to claims in united states shearer,d,where the plaintiff was the administratrix of an army private who had been murdered by another serviceman.the private had been and at the time.the plaintiff asserted that the army had been negligent in failing to exert control over the murderer.the court rejected this claim as well,citing feres and chappell,and noting that allowing the claim to proceed would involve the courts in military management,evaluating basic choices about discipline,supervision,and control of a serviceman,at.at.
in united states stanley,d,the court reestablished the importance of the test,first promulgated in feres.the plaintiff was a former serviceman.during his tour of duty,the military had given him lsd as part of an experiment into the drug effects.he argued that the feres principle against allowing his bivens claims to proceed was limited to suits by a subordinate against a superior officer.those would be the only cases where judicial involvement would interfere with military discipline.but the court was concerned that if this were the test,judicial inquiry into the extent that particular decisions involved military discipline would interject the judiciary into the very role it was trying to management.the court therefore rejected all claims that arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to military service,at.at.its reason for choosing this simple test was that it provides a line that is relatively clear and that can be discerned with less extensive inquiry into military matters,at.at.
although several circuits,including ours,have applied feres to cases involving plaintiffs who were not members of the federal armed services,these extensions of the doctrine have been extremely limited.in crawford texas army national guard,cir,we applied feres to and claims brought by members of the texas national guard.doing otherwise would have involved the courts in military management.see also,jorden national guard bureau,cir claim by state national guard member brown united states,cir same martelon temple,cir same.
similarly,some circuits have extended the feres doctrine to title vii and other claims brought by civilian national guard technicians.mier owens,cir wright park,cir wood united states,cir.the national guard technician act created this special type of position with the military,allowing civilians to serve military functions,but requiring those civilians to be members of the national guard.b.thus,the special hybrid nature of these technicians warranted application of feres.mier,at wright,at wood,at.
the lesson we draw from these cases is this applicability of feres test depends upon the relationship between the plaintiff and the government.the court made that clear in feres,and subsequent decisions,especially chappell,have explained why this relationship is should not interfere with military discipline and management.these are areas where we have little competence or authority to proceed.the circuits that have extended feres test beyond claims brought by plaintiffs in the federal armed services have done so in limited and analogous circumstances.military discipline is equally important in the state national guards.the same is also true with respect to the unique role of national guard technicians.we are aware of no decisions,however,extending the test beyond these limited circumstances.
in the present case,meister jobs as assistant schools program manager and assistant personnel manager were civilian assignments.she was not subject to military discipline or the military hierarchy.she could quit whenever she wanted.the fact that she happened to work for the adjutant general office did not render those roles the same as roles in the military services for that reason,we conclude that the district court rejection of meister claims based upon the test was erroneous.
our conclusion that feres is inapplicable does not necessarily mean that meister claims may proceed.first,it is that we will not reverse a judgment of the district court if it can be affirmed on any legally sufficient ground,even one not relied upon by the district court.united states real property located at gateway.west,el paso county,texas,cir.second,meister claims may still be under other doctrines besides feres.we turn now to meister claims.
we begin with meister first claim,that the defendants improperly failed to promote her to the schools program manager position.
this claim fails because meister has failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.one of the elements of a prima facie case that a plaintiff must establish is that he or she was qualified for the position sought.haynes pennzoil,cir.but meister does not contest that the schools program manager posit
