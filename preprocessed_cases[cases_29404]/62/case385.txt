afghani militia forces captured salim ahmed hamdan in afghanistan in late november.hamdan captors turned him over to the american military,which transported him to the guantanamo bay naval base in cuba.the military initially kept him in the general detention facility,known as camp delta.on july,the president determined that there is reason to believe that hamdan was a member of al qaeda or was otherwise involved in terrorism directed against the united states.this finding brought hamdan within the compass of the president november,order concerning the detention,treatment,and trial of certain in the war against terrorism.accordingly,hamdan was designated for trial before a military commission.
in december,hamdan was removed from the general population at guantanamo and placed in solitary confinement in camp echo.that same month,he was appointed counsel,initially for the limited purpose of plea negotiation.in april,hamdan filed this petition for habeas corpus.while his petition was pending before the district court,the government formally charged hamdan with conspiracy to commit attacks on civilians and civilian objects,murder and destruction of property by an unprivileged belligerent,and terrorism.the charges alleged that hamdan was osama bin laden personal driver in afghanistan between and november,an allegation hamdan admitted in an affidavit.the charges further alleged that hamdan served as bin laden personal bodyguard,delivered weapons to al qaeda members,drove bin laden to al qaeda training camps and safe havens in afghanistan,and trained at the al al farouq camp.hamdan trial was to be before a military commission,which the government tells us now consists of three officers of the rank of colonel.brief for appellants at.
in response to the supreme court decision in hamdi rumsfeld,d,hamdan received a formal hearing before a combatant status review tribunal.the tribunal affirmed his status as an enemy combatant,either a member of or affiliated with al qaeda,for whom continued detention was required.
on november,the district court granted in part hamdan petition.among other things,the court held that hamdan could not be tried by a military commission unless a competent tribunal determined that he was not a prisoner of war under the geneva convention governing the treatment of prisoners.the court therefore enjoined the secretary of defense from conducting any further military commission proceedings against hamdan.this appeal followed.
the government initial argument is that the district court should have abstained from exercising jurisdiction over hamdan habeas corpus petition.ex parte quirin,in which captured german saboteurs challenged the lawfulness of the military commission before which they were to be tried,provides a compelling historical precedent for the power of civilian courts to entertain challenges that seek to interrupt the processes of military commissions.the supreme court ruled against the petitioners in quirin,but only after considering their arguments on the merits.in an effort to minimize the precedential effect of quirin,the government points out that the decision predates the abstention doctrine recognized in schlesinger councilman,d,and applied by this court in new cohen.councilman and new hold only that civilian courts should not interfere with ongoing proceedings against citizen servicemen.the cases have little to tell us about the proceedings of military commissions against alien prisoners.the serviceman in councilman wanted to block his for using and selling marijuana the serviceman in new wanted to stop his for refusing to obey orders.the rationale of both cases was that a military must be able to enforce a respect for duty and discipline without counterpart in civilian life,councilman,at,and that comity aids the military judiciary in its task of maintaining order and discipline in the armed services,new,at.these concerns do not exist in hamdan case and we are thus left with nothing to detract from quirin precedential value.
even within the framework of councilman and new,there is an exception to abstention a person need not exhaust remedies in a military tribunal if the military court has no jurisdiction over him.new,at.the theory is that setting aside the judgment after trial and conviction insufficiently redresses the defendant right not to be tried by a tribunal that has no jurisdiction.see abney united states,d.the courts in councilman and new did not apply this exception because the servicemen had not raised substantial arguments denying the right of the military to try them at all.new,at citing councilman,at.hamdan jurisdictional challenge,by contrast,is not insubstantial,as our later discussion should demonstrate.while he does not deny the military authority to try him,he does contend that a military commission has no jurisdiction over him and that any trial must be by.his claim,therefore,falls within the exception to councilman and,in any event,is firmly supported by the supreme court disposition of quirin.
in an argument distinct from his claims about the geneva convention,which we will discuss next,hamdan maintains that the president violated the separation of powers inherent in the constitution when he established military commissions.the argument is that article i,of the constitution gives congress the power to constitute tribunals inferior to the supreme court,that congress has not established military commissions,and that the president has no inherent authority to do so under article ii.see neal katyal laurence tribe,waging war,deciding guilt trying the military tribunals,yale.
there is doubt that this claim properly may serve as a basis for a court order halting a trial before a military commission,see united states cisneros,and there is doubt that someone in hamdan position is entitled to assert such a constitutional claim,see people mojahedin org.dep t of state,county sovereignty comm.dep t of state.in any event,on the merits there is little to hamdan argument.
the president military order of november,stated that any person subject to the order,including members of al qaeda,shall,when tried,be tried by a military commission for any and all offenses triable by a military commission that such individual is alleged to have committed.at.the president relied on four sources of authority his authority as commander in chief of the armed forces,art.ii,congress joint resolution authorizing the use of force and.the last three are,of course,actions of congress.
in the joint resolution,passed in response to the attacks of september,congress authorized the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations,organizations,or persons he determines planned,authorized,committed,or aided the attacks and recognized the president authority under the constitution to take action to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the united states.authorization for use of military force,stat.in re yamashita,which dealt with the validity of a military commission,held that an important incident to the conduct of war is the adoption of measures by the military commander,not only to repel and defeat the enemy,but to seize and subject to disciplinary measures those enemies who,in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort,have violated the law of war.id.at.the trial and punishment of enemy combatants,the court further held,is thus part of the conduct of war.id.we think it no answer to say,as hamdan does,that this case is different because congress did not formally declare war.it has been suggested that only wars between sovereign nations would qualify for such a declaration.see john bickers,military commissions are constitutionally sound a response to professors katyal and tribe.tech.even so,the joint resolution went as far toward a declaration of war as it might,and as far or further than congress went in the civil war,the philippine insurrection,the boxer rebellion,the punitive expedition against pancho villa,the korean war,the vietnam war,the invasion of panama,the gulf war,and numerous other conflicts.id.at.the plurality in hamdi rumsfeld,in suggesting that a military commission could determine whether an american citizen was an enemy combatant in the current conflict,drew no distinction of the sort hamdan urges upon us.at.
ex parte quirin also stands solidly against hamdan argument.the court held that congress had authorized military commissions through article of the articles of war.at.accord in re yamashita,at.the modern version of article is,which the president invoked when he issued his military order.section states that jurisdiction does not deprive military commissions of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by military commissions.congress also authorized the president,in another provision the military order cited,to establish procedures for military commissions.a.given these provisions and quirin and yamashita,it is impossible to see any basis for hamdan claim that congress has not authorized military commissions.see curtis bradley jack goldsmith,congressional authorization and the war on terrorism,harv.he attempts to distinguish quirin and yamashita on the ground that the military commissions there were in war zones while guantanamo is far removed from the battlefield.we are left to wonder why this should matter and,in any event,the distinction does not hold the military commission in quirin sat in washington,in the department of justice building the military commission in yamashita sat in the phillipines after japan had surrendered.
we therefore hold that through the joint resolution and the two statutes just mentioned,congress authorized the military commission that will try hamdan.
this brings us to hamdan argument,accepted by the district court,that the geneva convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war,geneva convention,ratified in,may be enforced in federal court.
treaties made,or which shall be made,under the authority of the united states,shall be the supreme law of the land,art.vi,cl.even so,this country has traditionally negotiated treaties with the understanding that they do not create judicially enforceable individual rights.see holmes laird,canadian transport united states.as a general matter,a treaty is primarily a compact between independent nations,and depends for the enforcement of its provisions on the interest and honor of the governments which are parties to it.head money cases.if a treaty is violated,this becomes the subject of international negotiations and reclamation,not the subject of a lawsuit.see charlton kelly.whitney robertson.foster neilson,pet,overruled on other grounds,united states percheman,pet.
thus,i nternational agreements,even those directly benefitting private persons,generally do not create private rights or provide for a private cause of action in domestic courts.restatement third of the foreign relations law of the united states cmt.a,at.the district court nevertheless concluded that the geneva convention conferred individual rights enforceable in federal court.we believe the court conclusion disregards the principles just mentioned and is contrary to the convention itself.to explain why,we must consider the supreme court treatment of the geneva convention of in johnson eisentrager,and this court decision in holmes laird,neither of which the district court mentioned.
in eisentrager,german nationals,convicted by a military commission in china of violating the laws of war and imprisoned in germany,sought writs of habeas corpus in federal district court on the ground that the military commission violated their rights under the constitution and their rights under the geneva convention.at.the supreme court,speaking through justice jackson,wrote in an alternative holding that the convention was not judicially enforceable the convention specifies rights of prisoners of war,but responsibility for observance and enforcement of these rights is upon political and military authorities.id.at.we relied on this holding in holmes laird,at,to deny enforcement of the individual rights provisions contained in the nato status of forces agreement,an international treaty.
this aspect of eisentrager is still good law and demands our adherence.rasul bush,d,decided a different and narrow question whether federal courts had jurisdiction under to consider challenges to the legality of the detention of foreign nationals at guantanamo bay.id.at.the court decision in rasul had nothing to say about enforcing any geneva convention.its holding that federal courts had habeas corpus jurisdiction had no effect on eisentrager interpretation of the geneva convention.that interpretation,we believe,leads to the conclusion that the geneva convention can not be judicially enforced.
although the government relied heavily on eisentrager in making its argument to this effect,hamdan chose to ignore the decision in his brief.nevertheless,we have compared the convention to the convention.there are differences,but none of them renders eisentrager conclusion about the convention inapplicable to the convention.common article of the convention states that parties to the convention undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present convention in all circumstances.the comparable provision in the version stated that the convention shall be respected in all circumstances.geneva convention of.the revision imposed upon signatory nations the duty not only of complying themselves but also of making sure other signatories complied.nothing in the revision altered the method by which a nation would enforce compliance.article of the convention states that its provisions are to be applied with the cooperation and under the scrutiny of the protecting powers this too was a feature of the convention.see geneva convention of.but article of the convention increased the role of the protecting power,typically the international red cross,when disputes arose i n cases of disagreement between the parties to the conflict as to the application or interpretation of the provisions of the present convention,the protecting powers shall lend their good offices with a view to settling the disagreement.here again there is no suggestion of judicial enforcement.the same is true with respect to the other method set forth in the convention for settling disagreements.article provides that at the request of a party to the conflict,an enquiry shall be instituted,in a manner to be decided between the interested parties,concerning any alleged violation of the convention.if no agreement is reached about the procedure for the enquiry,article further provides that the parties should agree on the choice of an umpire who will decide upon the procedure to be followed.
hamdan points out that the geneva convention protects individual rights.but so did the geneva convention,as the court recognized in eisentrager,at.the nato status of forces agreement,at issue in holmes laird,also protected individual rights,but we held that the treaty was not judicially enforceable.at.
eisentrager also answers hamdan argument that the habeas corpus statute,permits courts to enforce the individual rights set forth in the geneva convention.the convention specified individual rights but as we have discussed,the supreme court ruled that these rights were to be enforced by means other than the writ of habeas corpus.the supreme court rasul decision did give district courts jurisdiction over habeas corpus petitions filed on behalf of guantanamo detainees such as hamdan.but rasul did not render the geneva convention judicially enforceable.that a court has jurisdiction over a claim does not mean the claim is valid.see bell hood.the availability of habeas may obviate a petitioner need to rely on a private right of action,see wang ashcroft,cir,but it does not render a treaty judicially enforceable.
we therefore hold that the geneva convention does not confer upon hamdan a right to enforce its provisions in court.see huynh thi anh levi,cir.
even if the geneva convention could be enforced in court,this would not assist hamdan.he contends that a military commission trial would violate his rights under article,which provides that a prisoner of war can be validly sentenced only if the sente
