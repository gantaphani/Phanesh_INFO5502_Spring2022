adel hassan hamad was detained at guantanamo bay as an enemy combatant.he seeks damages for his detention and his treatment from former secretary of defense robert gates and numerous other military and civilian officials.we conclude,however,that e deprived the district court of jurisdiction over hamad claims.
hamad,a citizen of sudan,alleges that he was detained in pakistan in by pakistani security forces acting under the direction of an unknown american official.according to hamad,he was transferred to united states military custody and detained,first at bagram airfield in afghanistan,and then at guantanamo bay.
in july,the department of defense established combatant status review tribunals csrts to determine whether foreign nationals held at guantanamo bay qualified for detention as enemy combatants.boumediene bush,d memorandum from deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz re order establishing combatant status review tribunal a july,available at http.pdf wolfowitz memo.the department of defense defined the term enemy combatant as an individual who was part of or supporting taliban or al qaeda forces,or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the united states or its coalition partners.hamdan rumsfeld,d quoting wolfowitz memo.at.a csrt determined in march that hamad was an enemy combatant.the united states has not rescinded this designation.
in addition to establishing the csrt procedure,the department of defense established administrative review boards arbs to determine annually if enemy combatants detained at guantanamo bay,cuba should be released,transferred or continue to be detained based on an assessment of various factors,including the continued threat posed by each detainee.memorandum from deputy secretary of defense gordon england re revised implementation of administrative review procedures,enclosure july,available at england memo.see also boumediene,at roberts,dissenting describing the arb process.arbs were required to issue recommendations as to whether to r elease the enemy combatant without limitations to another country t ransfer the enemy combatant to another country with conditions agreed upon between that country and the united states or c ontinue to detain the enemy combatant.see england,enclosure.
in november,an arb panel determined that hamad continued to be a threat to the united states and its allies,but also decided that he was eligible to be transferred to sudan.as a result,in,after the united states concluded negotiations with sudan,hamad was transferred to that country 
in april,hamad filed an action for money damages in a federal district court in washington state against twentytwo united states military and civilian government officials,including former united states secretary of defense robert gates and one hundred unnamed federal officials,all in their individual capacities.in his complaint,hamad raised six claims under state common law and the alien tort statute.these six claims alleged violations of customary international law and the geneva conventions,including prolonged arbitrary detention,cruel,inhuman,or degrading treatment,torture,targeting of a civilian,denial of due process,and forced disappearance.in addition to these six claims,hamad seventh claim alleged a violation of his fifth amendment due process rights.hamad claims are premised on his allegations that he was wrongfully detained and subjected to torture and other forms of cruel treatment.he contends that the csrt erred in determining that he was an enemy combatant,and that the united states government detained him unlawfully for over two years after the arb decided to transfer him.
the district court dismissed all defendants other than gates for lack of personal jurisdiction.with respect to hamad six international law claims against gates,the district court granted the government motion to substitute itself for gates under the westfall act,d.because the district court concluded that the government had not waived its sovereign immunity for these international law claims,see id.b,k,it dismissed them.with respect to hamad sole remaining claim,a fifth amendment claim against gates,the district court held that it had subject matter jurisdiction over this claim,but dismissed it because the complaint did not plausibly allege that gates was personally involved in violating hamad rights.hamad timely appealed and the government cross appealed.
this appeal requires us to address a key threshold question whether the district court had jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action,given the provisions in e.this section provides 
no court,justice,or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the united states who has been determined by the united states to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination.
except as provided in paragraphs and of section e of the detainee treatment act of note,no court,justice,or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider any other action against the united states or its agents relating to any aspect of the detention,transfer,treatment,trial,or conditions of confinement of an alien who is or was detained by the united states and has been determined by the united states to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination.e.
the existence of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law that we review de novo.marin hosp.modesto empire traction,cir.
looking to the plain language of e,it is clear that this provision applies to hamad claims,and that,as a result,no court,justice,or judge has authority to hear hamad action.under e,courts lack jurisdiction over an action that meets the following five requirements the action is against the united states or its agents the action relates to any aspect of the detention,transfer,treatment,trial,or conditions of confinement of an alien who is or was detained by the united states the action relates to an alien who was determined by the united states to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or an alien awaiting such a determination the action is an action other than an application for a writ of habeas corpus,which is covered in e and the action does not qualify for an exception under e or of the detainee treatment act of dta,which provide the circuit jurisdiction over a narrow class of challenges by enemy combatants,see detainee treatment act of,div.a,title x,e,stat.
hamad action meets each of these requirements.it is against the united states or its agents and relates to aspects of hamad detention and treatment the first and second requirements,because hamad is seeking damages from united states military and civilian officers for his detention and treatment at guantanamo.hamad action satisfies the third requirement,because there is no dispute that a csrt determined that hamad was properly detained as an enemy combatant.it also meets the fourth requirement,because hamad is not seeking a writ of habeas corpus.finally,hamad claims do not fall into the narrow exception granted by e for suits under e or of the dta,which authorize limited circuit review.therefore hamad action also satisfies the fifth requirement.
although e applies by its terms,hamad contends that,in light of supreme court precedent and constitutional concerns,we may not apply e to his action.he makes three arguments.first,he asserts that boumediene struck down the whole of e,including e.second,he asserts that,even if boumediene struck down only e,e can not be severed from e and so both must fall together.finally,he asserts that,even if e survived boumediene,it is unconstitutional as applied to him.
in order to analyze these arguments,we must first review the complex historical context which forms their backdrop.
on september,the al qaeda terrorist network used hijacked commercial airliners to attack prominent targets in the united states.hamdi rumsfeld,d.in response,congress authorized the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations,organizations,or persons he determines planned,authorized,committed,or aided the terrorist attacks,or harbored such organizations or persons.authorization for use of military force of,stat.in hamdi five members of the court recognized that detention of individuals who fought against the united states in afghanistan for the duration of the particular conflict in which they were captured,is so fundamental and accepted an incident to war as to be an exercise of the necessary and appropriate force congress has authorized the president to use.boumediene,at internal quotation marks omitted.on the same day it issued its opinion in hamdi,the supreme court also issued rasul bush,which held that federal courts had jurisdiction under the version of the habeas statute,to hear guantanamo detainees habeas corpus challenges to the legality of their detention at the guantanamo bay naval base,d.taken together,hamdi and rasul established that the president had the authority to detain individuals pursuant to the authorization for use of military force,but that detainees held at guantanamo bay had a statutory right to file habeas petitions in federal court to challenge their detention.
shortly after the supreme court decided hamdi and rasul,the department of defense established combatant status review tribunals csrts to determine whether individuals detained at guantanamo were enemy combatants,as the department define d that term.boumediene,at.the department of defense defined enemy combatant as an individual who was part of or supporting taliban or al qaeda forces,or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the united states or its coalition partners.hamdan,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
in,congress responded to the supreme court decision in rasul,as well as the executive decision to establish combatant status review tribunals,by enacting the detainee treatment act of dta,div.a,title x,stat.in direct response to rasul holding that gave federal courts jurisdiction to hear habeas petitions by guantanamo detainees,the dta amended to include a new subsection,e,which limited the jurisdiction of the courts to entertain suits by guantanamo detainees see dta e.specifically,this amendment to imposed two additional jurisdictional limitations first,no court,justice,or judge could entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by a guantanamo detainee and second,no court could entertain any other action against the united states or its agents relating to any aspect of the detention by the department of defense of an alien at guantanamo bay.id.
congress provided two exceptions to this language in e and of the dta.first,building on the executive creation of csrts,e permitted the circuit to review the validity of any final decision of a combatant status review tribunal that an alien is properly detained as an enemy combatant.dta e a.specifically,the circuit could review whether a final decision of a csrt was consistent with certain specified procedures,and whether those procedures complied with the constitution and applicable federal law.dta e c second,dta e allowed the circuit to perform a limited review of convictions by military tribunals 
less than a year later,the supreme court held that the dta amendments to did not apply to cases pending before the dta effective date.see hamdan,at.the court reached this conclusion because the dta expressly provided that the limited review procedures of e and applied to pending cases,but was silent about whether the jurisdictionstripping amendments to also applied to these pending cases.id.at.
congress responded once again by enacting the military commissions act of mca,stat.section of the mca amended d scope of review the jurisdiction of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit on an appeal of a final decision with respect to an alien under this paragraph shall be limited to the consideration of i whether the final decision was consistent with the standards and procedures specified in the military order referred to in subparagraph a and ii to the extent the constitution and laws of the united states are applicable,whether the use of such standards and procedures to reach the final decision is consistent with the constitution and laws of the united states.e again,broadening its language id,stat.in direct response to hamdan holding,congress made unmistakably clear that the language of e would apply to pending cases.mca b the amendment made by subsection a adding the new e shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this act,and shall apply to all cases,without exception,pending on or after the date of the enactment of this act which relate to any aspect of the detention,transfer,treatment,trial,or conditions of detention of an alien detained by the united states since september.no further changes have been made to the language of e since this amendment.
the supreme court considered this amendment to e in boumediene.like in hamdan,the petitioners in boumediene argued that of the mca and its amendments to e were not a sufficiently clear statement of congressional intent to strip the federal courts of jurisdiction in pending habeas cases.boumediene,at.the supreme court rejected this argument,concluding that congress had finally succeeded in expressing its intent to apply the amendments to e in all pending cases and to deprive the federal courts of jurisdiction to entertain habeas corpus actions by guantanamo detainees designated as enemy combatants.id.at.
because the supreme court interpreted the amendment to e as depriving petitioners of the privilege of habeas corpus,it had to address the petitioners further argument that such a deprivation was unconstitutional as a violation of the suspension clause.under the suspension clause,t he privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended,unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.const.art.i,cl.to address this constitutional argument,the court had to first determine whether habeas corpus jurisdiction extended to foreign nationals detained outside of the boundaries of the united states.boumediene,at.after a thorough review of the history of the writ of habeas corpus and an analysis of earlier supreme court decisions considering the application of the writ to enemy aliens abroad,the supreme court concluded,as a matter of first impression,that the protection of the suspension clause extended to individual detainees at guantanamo.id.at.accordingly,congress could not enact a statute depriving guantanamo detainees of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus unless congress actions complied with the requirements of the suspension clause.id.because congress enactment of the mca did not so comply,the court concluded that petitioners could challenge their detention by means of a petition for habeas corpus.id.next,the court determined that the limited circuit review provided by the dta was not a sufficient substitute procedure for habeas,in part because it did not give detainees a sufficient ability to present exculpatory evidence.id.at.the court thus held that of the mca effects an unconstitutional suspension of the writ.id.at 
because boumediene holding and analysis focused on congress authority to suspend habeas corpus at guantanamo bay,it did not analyze whether e was constitutional.nor did the court address the question whether constitutional provisions other than the suspension clause,such as the fifth amendment,are applicable to guantanamo detainees.
we now consider hamad arguments in light of this historical context.implicitly acknowledging that e would bar his actions before this court and any other court if it were still in force,hamad asks us to conclude that e is no longer effective,either because it was struck down by boumediene or because congress would not have intended it to continue to have force once the supreme court invalidated e.
hamad first argues that we should interpret boumediene as invalidating e as a whole,not just e.hamad notes that boumediene did not expressly differentiate between e and when it concluded that e did not bar habeas petitions by guantanamo detainees.accordingly,hamad argues,we should read boumediene as striking down all of e,not just the subsection dealing with habeas petitions,e.
we disagree.although boumediene did not expressly differentiate between e and,the logic and context of the opinion make clear that the supreme court was addressing only e.unlike statutes,judicial opinions are not usually written with the knowledge or expectation that each and every word may be the subject of searching analysis.united states muckleshoot indian tribe,cir.rather,as we have long held,the language of the court must be read in the light of the facts before it.id.quoting julian petroleum courtney petroleum,cir.as we have explained,boumediene concluded that e deprived guantanamo detainees of habeas corpus review and that this deprivation was unconstitutional in light of the suspension clause.that rationale for invalidating e applies exclusively to e,the statutory subsection that specifically addresses jurisdiction over habeas actions,and has no applicability to e,the statutory subsection that applies to actions other than habeas petitions.indeed,the supreme court took pains to emphasize that it was invalidating e only to the extent that the statute barred the petitioners from filing habeas corpus actions o ur decision today holds only that petitioners before us are entitled to seek the writ that the dta review procedures are an inadequate substitute for habeas corpus and that petitioners in these cases need not exhaust the review procedures in the court of appeals before proceeding with their habeas actions in the district court.boumediene,at.given the court focus on habeas petitions and the narrowness of its holding,it is plain that the court was addressing only e.see kiyemba obama,the court actually referred to without specifying a particular subsection of e but its discussion of the suspension clause clearly indicates it was referring only to that part of codified at e.accordingly,we conclude that boumediene did not address e,let alone strike it down.
second,hamad contends that,even if boumediene did not expressly invalidate e,we can not sever that section from e,which the court did invalidate.in essence,he argues that,in striking down e,the court necessarily struck down e.
we also reject this argument.as a general rule,courts are to refrain from invalidating more of a statute than is necessary,united states booker,d internal quotation marks omitted,because a ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the intent of the elected representatives.ayotte planned parenthood of new england,d alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,when we invalidate an enactment because it is unconstitutional,we start with a presumption that the enactment is severable from the remainder of the section or act.see alaska airlines,brock,d.this presumption of severability is overcome only if something in the statute text or historical context makes it evident that congress,faced with the limitations imposed by the constitution,would have preferred no statute at all to a statute with the invalid part excised.free enterprise fund pub.accounting oversight,d quoting alaska airlines,at.in conducting this inquiry,we must retain those portions of the act that are constitutionally valid,capable of functioning independently,and consistent with congress basic objectives in enacting the statute.booker,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.congressional intent serves as the basis for this severability test.alaska airlines,at.
beginning with the second prong of the booker severability test,it is apparent that e is capable of functioning independently of e.in enacting e,congress dealt separately with two different categories of actions that could be brought by guantanamo detainees e addressed habeas petitions,while e addressed any other action.boumediene conclusion that e violates the suspension clause does not prevent e from functioning independently to bar actions directed at an alien detention or treatment.
hamad contends that boumediene interpretation of a and b of the mca shows that e can not function independently from e.as explained above,a amends e and,while b provides that these amendments apply to all cases pending on or after the date of the enactment of this act which relate to any aspect of the detention,transfer,treatment,trial,or conditions of detention of an alien detained by the united states.mca b.the boumediene petitioners argued that b applied only to the actions described in e because of the textual similarity between these two statutory provisions.compare mca b providing that the amendments to e apply to all cases relating to any aspect of the detention,transfer,treatment,trial,or conditions of detention of an alien detained by the united states,with e barring any other action relating to any aspect of the detention,transfer,treatment,trial,or conditions of confinement of an alien detained as an enemy combatant.the court rejected this argument,reasoning that the phrase any other action in e must be read by reference to e,which discusses habeas actions.boumediene,at emphasis added.read in context,the court concluded,habeas actions in e are a subset of the broader set of actions relating to any aspect of the detention,transfer,treatment,trial,or conditions of confinement of an alien.id.at.accordingly,boumediene held that b provision applied to habeas actions as well.id.at.
hamad seizes on the court statement that any other action in e must be read by reference to e as demonstrating that e can not function independently of e.we disagree.a subsection of a statute is capable of functioning independently as a fully operative law,alaska airlines,at internal quotation marks omitted,even if it must be understood by reference to an inoperative portion of the statute in order for its meaning to be clear.booker held,in striking down two sections of a statute as unconstitutional,that excised to these invalidated sections left the remaining sections valid and intact.at.boumediene invalidation of congress jurisdictionstripping provisions with respect to the subset of habeas actions does not mean that the provisions applicable to the rest of the set are nonfunctional.here,the reference in e to e merely makes clear the scope of e as applying to all actions.section e is fully operative because it bars jurisdiction over the subset of cases not covered by e.
we next turn to the third prong of the booker severability test,which asks whether retaining e is consistent with congress basic objectives in enacting the statute.booker,at.the structure of e indicates that congress was motivated by two concerns.first,congress sought to bar alien detainees from applying for habeas corpus,as reflected in e.but congress did not stop there.in sweeping language,e strips jurisdiction over any action that relates to any aspect of enemy combatants detention,transfer,treatment,trial,or conditions of confinement.this broad language indicates that congress was not concerned solely with habeas suits,but also sought to prevent alien detainees from bringing any other type of action that related to their detention or treatment.considering that the two sections of e address two different types of lawsuits,we see no reason that congress would not have enacted e bar on nonhabeas suits had it known that detainees could file for habeas 
moreover,the history of congress responses to supreme court decisions,as set forth above,further supports the conclusion that preserving e is consistent with congress basic objective in enacting the mca,which was to limit detainees access to the courts.after the supreme court held that federal courts had statutory jurisdiction to hear guantanamo detainees habeas petitions,rasul,at,congress passed e of the dta to strip the courts of jurisdiction to hear such petitions or any other claim,with the exception of certain narrow challenges that could be filed in the circuit.when the supreme court responded in hamdan,holding that the dta did not apply to pending claims,congress passed the mca to ensure that the provisions would apply to all pending claims.bismullah gates.clearly,congress consistent intent was to channel and narrowly limit detainees lawsuits of all sorts.preserving the provisions of e that limit detainees legal actions other than habeas is consistent with this goal.
finally,hamad argues that the absence of a severability clause indicates that congress did not intend these provisions to be severable,and thus holding otherwise would be inconsistent with congress objectives.but i n the absence of a severability clause,congress silence is just that silence and does not raise a presumption against severability.alaska airlines,at the lack of a severability clause carries no weight in our analysis because the text and historical context of e and make it evident that these two provisions are severable.
because e is capable of functioning independently,and is consistent with congress basic objectives in enacting the mca,we conclude that it is severable from e,and remains in effect,provided that it is constitutional.
we finally turn to hamad arguments that e,even if valid,is unconstitutional as applied to him.
hamad first argues that e is unconstitutional,because it deprives him of a federal forum to seek a remedy for violations of his constitutional rights.he asserts that the supreme court has never upheld such a statute,and that it has always presumed that congress did not intend to deprive plaintiffs of a federal forum.
hamad is correct that the supreme court has avoided the question whether congress may completely deny a plaintiff access to federal forum to seek a remedy for a violation of constitutional rights.see bowen.acad.of family physicians,d avoiding the serious constitutional question that would arise if the court construed a statute to deny a judicial forum for constitutional claims internal quotation marks omitted.but we can likewise avoid addressing this difficult issue,because hamad seeks only money damages,and the constitution does not require the availability of such a remedy,even where the plaintiff claim is based on alleged violations of constitutional rights.al zahrani rodriguez.the supreme court bivens cases make this clear.in wilkie robbins,the court noted that a bivens remedy is not an automatic entitlement no matter what other means there may be to vindicate a protected interest,and in most instances we have found a bivens remedy unjustified,d.indeed,the court has declined to recognize a bivens remedy in a variety of contexts.see,schweiker chilicky,d denial of social security benefits united states stanley,d injuries that arise out of military service bush lucas,d first amendment violations by federal employers.similarly,we have concluded that aliens not lawfully in the united states may not sue federal agents for money damages for wrongful detention.mirmehdi united states,cir.these cases underscore that money damages are not constitutionally required for every violation of constitutional rights.accordingly,e is not unconstitutional as applied to hamad claims for money damages.see al zahrani,at.
hamad next argues that e functions as an unconstitutional bill of attainder,asserting that it strips a discrete class of individuals,namely alien detainees,of access to the courts.we disagree.three key features brand a bill of attainder that the statute specifies the affected persons,and inflicts punishment without a judicial trial.seariver maritime fin.holdings mineta,cir.the supreme court has emphasized that a statute must show unmistakable evidence of punitive intent before it may be struck down as a bill of attainder.flemming nestor,d.in determining whether a statute inflicts punishment,we look to whether the statute falls within the historical meaning of legislative punishment or does not further nonpunitive legislative purposes.seariver,at quoting selective serv.pub.interest research group,d.
applying these principles,we conclude that e is not a bill of attainder because it does not inflict legislative punishment.jurisdictional limitations,such as the limitations imposed by e,do not fall within the historical meaning of legislative punishment.nagac derwinski,see also scheerer attorney,cir.rather,the concept of legislative punishment encompasses penalties such as imprisonment,banishment,the punitive confiscation of property by the sovereign and legislative enactment s barring designated individuals or groups from participation in specified employments or vocations.nixon adm r of,d.as we have explained,congress enacted e to limit and channel federal court review of detention and military commission decisions,not to impose any particular punishment on military detainees.because there is no evidence that congress had a punitive intent in enacting e,much less unmistakable evidence of punitive intent,seariver,at internal quotation marks omitted,we reject hamad argument that e constitutes a bill of attainder.
finally,hamad argues that e violates the equal protection component of the due process clause of the fifth amendment noting that e deprives alien enemy combatants of the ability to bring specified legal actions,while imposing no comparable legal disabilities on citizens,hamad argues that this distinction serves no compelling legislative purpose and would not survive strict scrutiny.
as an initial matter,the supreme court has not determined whether the fifth amendment protections even apply to hamad.prior to boumediene,the supreme court had never held that noncitizens detained by our government in territory over which another country maintains de jure sovereignty have any rights under our constitution.boumediene,at.although boumediene ultimately concluded that the suspension clause applies to aliens detained at guantanamo bay,the court expressly confined its holding to that constitutional provision alone.see id.at rasul myers,boumediene disclaimed any intention to disturb existing law governing the extraterritorial reach of any constitutional provisions,other than the suspension clause.
assuming,without deciding,that the fifth amendment protections apply to aliens detained outside the united states,the due process clause does not render e unconstitutional.where the fifth amendment applies,t he federal sovereign must govern impartially and is therefore generally subject to equal protection principles.hampton mow sun wong,d.here there is no dispute that e makes a distinction between aliens and citizens.in order to determine whether this classification is constitutional,we must first determine the appropriate standard of judicial review.
although the supreme court has noted the substantial limitations upon the authority of the states in making classifications based upon alienage,toll moreno,d,the federal government interests with respect to aliens differ substantially from those of the states,and there are legitimate reasons for congress to make classifications based on alienage,mathews diaz,d.these reasons include congress broad authority to make such classifications under its plenary power to regulate immigration and naturalization,see united states lopez flores,cir,as well as its authority to address the united states relations with foreign powers and other foreign policy concerns,mathews,at.indeed,legislation with respect to aliens is vitally and intricately interwoven with contemporaneous policies in regard to the conduct of foreign relations,the war power,and the maintenance of a republican form of government,and s uch matters are so exclusively entrusted to the political branches of government as to be largely immune from judicial inquiry or interference.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
accordingly,we review alienage classifications drawn by congress under a rational basis test.aleman glickman,cir lopez flores,at.only classifications that arbitrarily subject all resident aliens to different substantive rules from those applied to citizens will fail to survive that scrutiny.lopezflores,at quoting hampton,at accord united states montenegro,cir united states lue.cir.under the rational basis test,we will uphold a federal statute that makes a classification on the basis of alienage if it is rationally related to a legitimate government interest.montenegro,at internal quotation marks omitted.applying this test in lopez flores,we upheld th
