plaintiffs cynthia and craig corrie,mahmoud al sho bi,fathiya muhammad sulayman fayed,fayez ali mohammed abu hussein,majeda radwan abu hussein,and eida ibrahim suleiman khalafallah filed this action after their family members were killed or injured when the israeli defense forces idf demolished homes in the palestinian territories using bulldozers manufactured by caterpillar,a united states corporation.the idf ordered the bulldozers directly from caterpillar,but the united states government paid for them.the district court dismissed the action under federal rule of civil procedure b,finding it lacked jurisdiction because,inter alia,the political question doctrine precludes decision by an article iii court.
because we agree that plaintiffs claims present nonjusticiable political questions that deprive the district court of subject matter jurisdiction when construed under federal rule of civil procedure b,we do not reach the remaining questions presented under state,federal,and international law.plaintiffs action can not proceed because its resolution would require the federal judiciary to ask and answer questions that are committed by the constitution to the political branches of our government.
we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
facts and background 
a.the allegations in the complaint 
because this action was dismissed under federal rule of civil procedure b,we accept all facts alleged in the complaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.maduka sunrise,cir.
following the six day war in,israel occupied and took control of the west bank and gaza strip.caterpillar is the world leading manufacturer of heavy construction and mining equipment.among its customers is the idf,which since has utilized caterpillar bulldozers to demolish homes in the palestinian territories.according to plaintiffs complaint,caterpillar sold the bulldozers to the idf despite its actual and constructive notice that the idf would use them to further its home destruction policy in the palestinian territories a policy plaintiffs contend violates international law.seventeen members of plaintiffs palestinians and one killed or injured in the course of the demolitions.
facts beyond the 
the complaint alleges that caterpillar sold bulldozers to the idf,but it does not explain how those bulldozers were financed.there is undisputed evidence in the record,however,that the united states government paid for every bulldozer that caterpillar transferred to the idf.caterpillar submitted an affidavit by frank weinberg weinberg declaration,general manager of caterpillar defense federal products division,in which weinberg states that the united states government has approved and financed all contracts between israel and caterpillar dating back to at least,and that caterpillar does not sell products to the government of israel in sales that are not approved by the government.
appended to the weinberg declaration is a copy of a letter from the defense security cooperation agency dsca,an arm of the united states department of defense,sent in september to the israeli government and copied to caterpillar dsca letter.the letter grants f unding approval for the israeli government purchase of fifty caterpillar bulldozers under the foreign military financing program fmf.under the fmf,foreign governments enter into contracts directly with american defense contractors and then apply to the dsca for approval of funding on a basis the dsca letter also states that the dsca find s the proposed procurement to be consistent with the purposes of the arms export control act,et,which authorizes the fmf,see id.
plaintiffs introduced a letter from matthew reynolds,the acting assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs,indicating that israel acquired the bulldozers on a commercial contract basis financed through the fmf reynolds letter.at oral argument,plaintiffs did not dispute that the bulldozers were financed under the fmf.
amicus united states department of state confirms that funds requested by the executive and appropriated by congress were used by israel to purchase the equipment in question under the foreign military financing program.
district court proceedings 
plaintiffs filed an action in the district court alleging seven claims against caterpillar for war crimes extrajudicial killing under the torture victim protection act cruel,inhuman,or degrading treatment or punishment violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,et wrongful death public nuisance and negligent entrustment.the gravamen of each claim is that caterpillar provided the idf with equipment it knew would be used in violation of international law,and thus aided and abetted those violations.plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages declaratory relief an injunction directing caterpillar to cease providing equipment to the idf so long as its illegal practices continue and costs and attorneys fees.
plaintiffs contend we have jurisdiction over the palestinian plaintiffs claims under the alien tort statute ats,and over the claims of the relatives of rachel corrie,who are american,under the general federal question jurisdiction statute.
caterpillar moved to dismiss the action under rule b for failure to state a claim and under the act of state and political question doctrines.the district court granted the motion in a published opinion.d.it held that both the act of state and the political question doctrines precluded it from reaching the merits of the claims.alternatively,it held that all of plaintiffs claims failed on the merits.
plaintiffs timely appeal.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court dismissal for failure to state a claim or for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.arakaki lingle,cir.we may affirm on any basis fairly supported by the record.united states washington,cir.
iii.political question doctrine 
we face a threshold procedural hurdle concerning the scope of what we may consider in deciding this appeal.our political question analysis calls on us to examine the united states government role in financing the idf purchases of caterpillar bulldozers.but determining that role requires us to look beyond the face of the plaintiffs complaint and to other evidence in the record.we first consider,therefore,whether the doctrine limitation on federal courts is jurisdictional,or merely prudential.only if the doctrine is jurisdictional may we look beyond the facts alleged in the complaint to decide whether this case presents a political question.because we hold that the political question doctrine is jurisdictional in nature,we proceed,taking into consideration facts beyond the complaint.
in general,t he focus of any rule b in the trial court and on the complaint.schneider cal.dep t of corrections,cir.but when a motion to dismiss attacks the substance of the complaint jurisdictional allegations,we treat it as brought under rule b,even if it was improperly identified by the moving party as brought under rule b.clair city of chico,cir.under such circumstances,the court may expand its review and rely on affidavits or any other evidence properly before the court.id.citing thornhill publ g,cir.
plaintiffs complaint does not reference the government role in facilitating the sales at issue,but undisputed evidence in the record suggests that the united states pays for every bulldozer the idf purchases from caterpillar.before considering that evidence at the pleadings stage,we must decide whether the presence of a political question deprives a court of subject matter jurisdiction.to the extent the answer to that question is unclear,see arakaki,at,we now hold that it does.
the political question doctrine first found expression in chief justice marshall observation that q uestions,in their nature political,or which are,by the constitution and laws,submitted to the executive,can never be made in this court.marbury madison,cranch.the supreme court has since explained that t he nonjusticiability of a political question is primarily a function of the separation of powers.baker carr,d.baker outlined six independent tests for determining whether courts
