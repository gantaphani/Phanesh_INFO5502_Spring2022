over an period during his msang service,bryant allegedly observed various acts of misconduct by msang officials.bryant reported the alleged misconduct to superior officers and ultimately filed a complaint with the inspector general of the department of the air force.the inspector general undertook two separate investigations,in which a number of bryant allegations of wrongdoing were substantiated.bryant charges and the ensuing investigation were the subject of regular media coverage in local newspapers and a talk radio show.
according to bryant,msang and the individual appellees responded to bryant whistleblowing with a litany of retaliatory acts.these acts allegedly included actions such as attempts to force bryant resignation,reports,and assignment to a position under a junior officer.bryant also claims that msang officials committed acts of vandalism and violence,such as breaking into bryant vehicle,stealing his laptop,firing gun shots in and around his home,cutting the gasoline line to his wife vehicle,harassing him with anonymous phone calls,and physically assaulting him.several of the individual appellees also filed civil lawsuits against bryant,which he contends were retaliatory and lacked merit.based on these allegations bryant asserted federal and state law claims against msang and the individual appellees.
in august,the district court granted a motion to dismiss all claims against msang and the individual appellees in their official capacities.the district court dismissed all claims against msang because the military whistleblower protection act,does not create a cause of action,and insofar as msang is a state agency,all other claims are barred by the eleventh amendment.additionally,the district court held that all claims against msang and the individual appellees in their official capacities are barred under feres united states.in july,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the individual appellees in their individual capacities as to bryant military whistleblower protection act,mississippi whistleblower protection act,and,and assault and battery claims.the court also disposed of some,but not all,of bryant claims under and.finally,in july,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the individual appellees in their individual capacities as to bryant remaining and claims.the district court entered a rule b certification of final judgment as to those claims denied and parties dismissed by the orders of august,july,and july.bryant thereafter brought the instant appeal in which he contends that the district court erroneously applied the feres doctrine to dismiss the claims against msang and the individual appellees in their official capacities,incorrectly granted summary judgment in the july order,and misapplied first amendment law in determining that bryant and claims predicated on allegedly retaliatory litigation were barred.

bryant asserts that the district court erred in dismissing his claims against msang under the feres doctrine.his brief,however,substantively discusses the feres issue only in relation to his vandalism and violence claims against the individual appellees.the district court clearly held that feres was not a ground for disposing of the vandalism claims and only applied feres to bryant claims of retaliation against msang and the individual appellees.bryant military dep t of state of,d,bryant i.accordingly,the limited feres discussion in bryant brief centers around the wrong claims and the wrong parties.bryant failure to adequately brief the feres issue is a waiver of these claims.united states martinez,cir.bryant did not preserve the issue merely by mentioning it in the statement of issues.see,justiss oil ref,cir declining to address the merits of an issue raised only in the statement of issues and not argued in the body of the brief.accordingly,we decline to address the propriety of the district court dismissal under feres.
moreover,the decision below stands on independent grounds.the district court ruled that all of bryant claims against msang are barred by the eleventh amendment and that the,and claims are barred because msang is not a person under those statutes.bryant failed to argue that either of those determinations was incorrect.his failure to do so is fatal to his appeal of msang dismissal from this litigation.see,berry jefferson parish,cir unpublished an unbriefed argument is an unpreserved argument.see also fed.a a.
bryant next contends that the district court erroneously granted partial summary judgment in its july order.see bryant.military dep t,d,bryant ii bryant appeal addresses only the district court grant of summary judgment on his,and,and claims,and the state law assault and battery claims the district court ruled that bryant could not succeed on any first amendment claim because he failed to show that the individual appellees acted under color of state law.with respect to bryant and claims,the district court ruled that any claims under and fail because bryant could not demonstrate that the individual appellees were motived by racial or some other type of invidious,distinction.id.at citations omitted.the district court further found that bryant failed to create a genuine issue of material fact with respect to his claim based on allegations of vandalism and violence.finally,the district court dismissed bryant assault and battery claims as barred by the statute of limitations.
a claim for violation of first amendment rights must be brought pursuant to.to state a claim under,a plaintiff must allege facts showing that a person,acting under color of state law,deprived the plaintiff of a right,privilege or immunity secured by the united states constitution or the laws of the united states.ellison de la rosa,cir.a person acts under color of state law if he engages in the m isuse of power,possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law townsend moya,cir quoting united states causey,cir.however,a state officer does not act under color of state law if he pursues personal objectives without using or misusing the power granted to him by the state to achieve the personal aim.id.quoting harris rhodes,cir.
bryant first argued that his lawsuit addressed actions taken by the individual appellees as individuals,who just so happen to also be in the military but who act for no military purpose or reasons rather,they act for their own hatred against the plaintiff.bryant ii,d at.bryant further argued that the individual appellees actions occur ed off base,have no justifiable military purpose,and are perpetrated solely for personal reasons.id.recognizing that these allegations would doom his claims,bryant then contended that the individual appellees acted under color of state law because they clothe d themselves as members of the state militia and attempted to silence bryant for their own personal benefit,namely to protect their military careers.id.but the district court concluded that bryant allegations,inter alia,assault,vandalism,harassing phone calls,trying to get bryant fired from his civilian job,and firing gun shots near bryant home,even if undertaken to protect the individual appellees military positions,were not made possible by defendants military positions and did not occur in the course of defendants performing any of their military duties.id.
bryant has failed to point to specific facts showing there is a genuine issue whether the individual appellees acted under color of state law he makes only a conclusory assertion that these individuals wanted to protect their military careers.a motive to protect one career is a personal motivation,not specific to individuals possessing state authority,and without more,namely,an act under color state law in the performance of actual or pretended duties or done with a pretense of official authority,is not sufficient.see,delcambre delcambre,cir finding dismissal of a claim proper where an altercation arose of out of a personal family and political dispute and the police officer did not use or threaten to use any state authority during the altercation see also revene charles county comm rs,cir t he nature of the act is controlling.manning jones,finding that not all acts of state officials are under color of state law where motivation is personal and actor did not invoke or use any official authority.it does not follow from a desire to protect their military careers that any of these individuals actions were achieved through the use or misuse of power granted by the state.indeed,the allegations taken in the light most favorable to bryant implicate no exercise of state power whatsoever.no reasonable jury could render a verdict in bryant favor based on allegations of motive alone,and accordingly,the district court properly granted summary judgment on bryant claims.see reese anderson,cir.
bryant alleges that the individual appellees violated and and by forming an association known as the concerned guardsmen of mississippi to carry out acts of vandalism and violence and by filing retaliatory civil lawsuits against bryant.the district court found that a claim would not lie because the equal protection language of that section requires a showing that the conspiracy was motivated by discriminatory animus and whistleblowers are not a protected class.see bryant ii,d at.with respect to the claims,bryant pleadings alleged specific instances of vandalism and violence,but the district court found that summary judgment nonetheless was warranted because bryant failed to rebut the individual appellees evidence that other members of the community had a strong motive to dislike bryant and therefore could have perpetrated the acts of vandalism and violence.id.at.
section prohibits conspiracies to prevent,by force,intimidation,or threat a federal officer from discharging his duties or to injure him because of his lawful discharge of his duties.section prohibits conspiracies to deny any citizen equal protection of the laws or to injure a citizen for his efforts to ensure the rights of others to equal protection.section penalizes those with knowledge of and the power to prevent conspiracies who fail to do so.
on appeal,bryant contends that the individual appellees actions were intended to prevent him from discharging his duties as an msang officer and to impede him from engaging the due course of justice with the intent to deny the equal protection of the laws.bryant argues,without citation to any authority,that n o class status is need ed for such a claim under.we disagree.the language requiring intent to deprive of equal protection,or equal privileges and immunities,means that there must be some racial,or,invidiously discriminatory animus behind the conspirator action.see griffin breckenridge,d emphasis added referring to.this circuit has held that the animus requirement of applies equally to causes of action under the second clause of such as bryant claims here.daigle gulf state utils,cir noting the parallel language in and prohibiting certain conduct with an intent to deny equal protection of the laws.moreover,we have previously rejected the argument that whistleblowers are a protected class for purposes of claims.see garrie james gray,cir.because bryant status as a whistleblower does not entitle him to protection under,the district court correctly dismissed the claim.
bryant also appeals the district court grant of summary judgment on his claims predicated on vandalism and violence.a cause of action under requires no allegation of racial or discriminatory animus.see kush rutledge,d.accordingly,bryant failure to identify any such animus is no impediment.bryant ii,d at.nonetheless,the district court properly concluded that bryant claim is barred because he failed to create a genuine issue of material fact whether the individual appellees committed the alleged acts.bryant presented evidence that someone committed acts of violence,vandalism and harassment.for instance,someone sent an anonymous greeting card to his home congratulating bryant on having an illegitimate child.someone also apparently mailed letters to bryant employer,fedex,alleging among other things that bryant smuggled machine guns on a fedex plane.while bryant succeeded in presenting evidence of violence,threats and intimidation,he presented no direct evidence that any of the individual appellees perpetrated these acts.instead bryant pointed to circumstantial evidence that his whistleblowing activities were motive for msang officials to commit retaliatory acts.but the individual appellees responded with evidence that other members of the community were angered by bryant activities and thus shared a similar motive.once the moving party has shown that there is an absence of evidence to support the party cause,the must come forward with specific facts showing a genuine factual issues for trial.oliver scott,cir.to survive summary judgment,bryant was required to point to specific facts that would create a triable question whether the individual appellees,rather than someone else,committed the retaliatory acts.bryant failed to do so.his only response to individual appellees evidence of others motive was that he believed that the individual appellees motive was stronger.bryant belief is not evidence that creates a triable fact issue therefore,summary judgment was proper.
bryant also appeals the district court dismissal of his assault and battery claims against individual appellees,thomas temple and leslie wilkes.the alleged assault occurred,at the latest,on september,bryant did not file his suit until march.the district court found these claims time barred by mississippi statute of limitations.bryant tries to avoid the statute of limitations by arguing that the assault and battery were part of a pattern of ongoing and continuing threats,harassment,and intimidation.the individual appellees respond that assault and battery are not among the types of torts that can be classified as continuing and therefore are not exempted from the statute of limitations as continuing torts.
the statute of limitations for assault actions under mississippi law is one year.see ann.all actions for assault and battery shall be commenced within one year next after the cause of such action accrued,and not after.under mississippi law,the statute of limitations is tolled by the continuing tort doctrine where there is a repeated injury.see mccorkle mccorkle,so d.this principle applies,however,in situations where a defendant commits repeated acts of wrongful conduct,not where harm reverberates from a single,act or omission.smith sneed,so d.a continuing tort is one inflicted over a period of time,it involves a wrongful conduct that is repeated until desisted,and each day creates a separate cause of action.id.at.
bryant continuing tort theory fails.first,we find unavailing the argument that the allegations comprising bryant claims can be combined with the single incident of assault and battery to constitute a continuing tort.for one thing,a continuing tort is a wrongful conduct that is repeated until desisted,not an amalgam of various wrongs.id.emphasis added.second,while the district court opines that the assault and battery is not itself a continuing tort,we need not decide whether under mississippi law assault and battery may ever constitute a continuing tort an allegation of a single incident is plainly insufficient to meet the requirement that the wrongful conduct be repeated and that the harm not reverberate from one wrongful act of omission.id.at.the continuing tort doctrine does not apply and bryant assault and battery claim is barred.
finally,bryant appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in defendants favor on his claim based on allegations of retaliatory litigation.the allegedly retaliatory litigation includes a slander suit,two malicious prosecution suits,and an invasion of privacy suit filed by various individual appellees against bryant.in their first motion for summary judgment,the individual appellees had argued that the allegedly retaliatory suits could not form the basis of a claim.citing bill johnson restaurants nlrb,d,they contended that summary judgment was proper because the filing of a meritorious suit is not an actionable act of retaliation.they maintained that because their suits had a reasonable basis in fact and law they could not be held liable for retaliation.in its july order the district court denied the motion,explaining that it could not simply assume a reasonable basis for bringing the allegedly retaliatory lawsuits.bryant ii,d at.but in its june order the district court reconsidered the issue and reached the opposite conclusion after applying be k constr.nlrb,d.the district court found that bryant claim for retaliatory litigation was barred by the individual appellees first amendment right of access to the courts.it reasoned that bill johnson required the defendants to show that their lawsuits were meritorious,which they failed to do,while be k required that bryant show that defendants lawsuits were objectively baseless.applying be k,the district court granted summary judgment,concluding that bryant did not show that the litigation was objectively baseless.bryant.military dep t,d,bryant iii.
the first amendment of the federal constitution guarantees the right of access to the courts to petition for redress of grievances.cal.motor transp.trucking unlimited,d.we have found no case addressing the intersection of the right to petition with prohibition on conspiracies to interfere with a federal officer discharge of his duties.because the contours of first amendment petitioning jurisprudence have been largely fleshed out in the antitrust and labor context,we turn to these cases.the doctrine holds that the right to petition the government for redress is generally immune from antitrust liability unless the petitioning activity is a sham.see united mine workers pennington,d presidents conference noerr motor freight,d.baseless litigation is not immunized by the first amendment right to petition.bill johnson,at.but determining what litigation is sham or baseless requires the drawing of a difficult line to separate objectively reasonable claims from a pattern of baseless,repetitive claims which leads the factfinder to conclude that the administrative and judicial processes have been abused.cal.motor,at.in professional real estate investors,columbia pictures industries,the supreme court held that an objectively reasonable effort to litigate can not be sham regardless of subjective intent,d.the supreme court enunciated a test for sham litigation the lawsuit must be objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits,and only if the challenged litigation is objectively meritless may a court examine the litigant subjective motivation to determine whether the baseless lawsuit conceals an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor,through the use of the governmental process as opposed to the outcome.id.at.emphasis in original citations omitted.the plaintiff bears the burden to disprove the challenged lawsuit legal viability before subjective intent can be considered.id.this test looks at objective merit at the outset,not whether the claim ultimately prevailed.id.at.
the supreme court has drawn the contours of the first amendment petition right somewhat differently in the labor law context.in bill johnson,the case on which the district court july denial of summary judgment was based,the nlrb enjoined an employer from suing picketing employees for defamation on the ground that the employer suit constituted a retaliatory and unfair labor practice in violation of the national labor relations act.bill johnson,at.bill johnson developed two tests for merit,depending on the stage of the litigation at which the merit of the case is assessed.as to whether the nlrb could enjoin an ongoing suit,the court adopted the test for summary judgment,whether the lawsuit presents a genuine issue of material fact.if so,as in the case of bill johnson suit against the picketing employees,then the suit could not be enjoined.id.at.in dicta,the court spelled out a second test to be applied once the underlying litigation is completed.
if the employer case ultimately proves meritorious and he has judgment against the employees,the employer should prevail because the filing of a meritorious law suit,even for a retaliatory motive,is not an unfair labor practice.if judgment goes against the employer or if his suit is withdrawn or is otherwise shown to be without merit,the employer has had its day in court,the interest of the state in providing a forum for its citizens has been vindicated,and the board may then proceed to adjudicate the unfair labor practice case.the employer suit having proved unmeritorious,the board would be warranted in taking that fact into account in determining whether the suit had been filed in retaliation.
id.at.in a departure from the professional real estate investor objectively baseless test,bill johnson equated meritorious suits with winning and unmeritorious with suits that did not prevail.see id.thus,two different standards defining the contours of first amendment protection for petitioning activity exist under professional real estate investors the litigation must be found objectively baseless before subjective intent is considered,while under bill johnson,a reviewing court must simply look to whether the litigant won or lost the suit to determine whether it was meritorious.
the supreme court grant of certiorari in be k poised the court to clarify whether the objectively baseless or test should be the standard for determining what petitioning activity is and is not protected by the first amendment.the court was to determine whether the nlrb under bill johnson test could penalize employers who,for a retaliatory purpose,filed but lost objectively reasonable suits.see be k constr,d.but the supreme court did not ultimately answer that question.rather,it issued a narrow holding that the nlrb incorrectly interpreted the nlra in order to punish suits as retaliatory even though they may have been filed for a legitimate purpose.id.at.the court issued this narrow holding rather than address the constitutional question because it determined that the petitioning activity at issue was the class of reasonably based but unsuccessful lawsuits.see id.at.because the suits were reasonably based,the court could limit its consideration to the extent to which the nlrb could penalize such suits under the nlra which prohibits interfering,restraining,or coercing employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed in the nlra.id.at.here,there is no pending cause of action under the nlra.thus,be k does not answer the question of which test,professional real estate investors or bill johnson,should be applied in the first instance.nor does be k decide whether a litigant may be liable for bringing an unsuccessful but reasonably based suit that would not have been filed but for a motive to impose the costs of the litigation process,rega
