three detainees at bagram air force base in afghanistan petitioned the district court for habeas corpus relief from their confinement by the united states military appellants collectively the united states or the government moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction based on a of the military commissions act of,stat.mca.the district court greed with the united states that a of the mca purported to deprive the court of jurisdiction,but held that this section could not constitutionally be applied to deprive the court of jurisdiction under the supreme court test articulated in boumediene bush.the court therefore denied the motion to dismiss but certified the three habeas cases for interlocutory appeal under b.pursuant to that certification,the government filed a petition to this court for interlocutory appeal.we granted the petition and now consider the jurisdictional question.upon review,and applying the supreme court decision in boumediene,we determine that the district court did not have jurisdiction to consider the petitions for habeas corpus.we therefore reverse the order of the district court and order that the petitions be dismissed.
background 
a.the petitioners 
all three petitioners are being held as unlawful enemy combatants at the bagram theater internment facility on the bagram airfield military base in afghanistan petitioner fadi is a yemeni citizen who alleges he was taken into custody in.while petition asserts on information and belief that he was captured beyond afghan borders,a sworn declaration from colonel james gray,commander of detention operations,states that was captured in zabul,afghanistan.redha is a tunisian citizen who alleges he was captured in pakistan in.amin is a yemeni citizen who alleges he was captured in thailand in.both and allege they were first held in some other unknown location before being moved to bagram.
b.the place of confinement 
bagram airfield military base is the largest military facility in afghanistan occupied by united states and coalition forces.the united states entered into an accommodation consignment agreement for lands and facilities at bagram airfield with the islamic republic of afghanistan in,which consigns all facilities and land located at bagram airfield owned by afghanistan,or parwan province,or private individuals,or others,for use by the united states and coalition forces for military purposes.accommodation and consignment agreement for lands and facilities at bagram airfield between the islamic republic of afghanistan and the united states of america internal capitalization altered.the agreement refers to afghanistan as the host nation and the united states as the lessee.the leasehold created by the agreement is to continue until the united states or its successors determine that the premises are no longer required for its use.id.internal capitalization altered.
afghanistan remains a theater of active military combat.the united states and coalition forces conduct an ongoing military campaign against al qaeda,the taliban regime,and their affiliates and supporters in afghanistan.these operations are conducted in part from bagram airfield.bagram has been subject to repeated attacks from the taliban and al qaeda,including a march suicide bombing striking the gates of the facility,and taliban rocket attacks in june of resulting in death and injury to united states service members and other personnel.
while the united states provides overall security to bagram,numerous other nations have compounds on the base.some of the other nations control access to their respective compounds.the troops of the other nations are present at bagram both as part of the military coalition in afghanistan and as members of the international security assistance force isaf of the north atlantic treaty organization.the mission of the isaf is to support the afghan government in the maintenance of security in afghanistan.see res,doc,res,doc,res,doc.according to the united states,as of february,approximately states troops were serving in afghanistan as part of the isaf,representing other countries.see international security assistance force,international security assistance force and afghan national army strength laydown,h ttp.
c.the litigation 
appellees in this action,three detainees at bagram,filed habeas petitions against the president of the united states and the secretary of defense in the district court.the government moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,relying principally upon a of the military commissions act of.the district court consolidated these three cases and a fourth case,not a part of these proceedings,for argument.after the change in presidential administrations on january,the court invited the government to express any change in its position on the jurisdictional question.the government informed the district court that it adheres to its previously articulated position.
the district court,recognizing that the issue of whether the court had jurisdiction presented a controlling question of law as to which there were substantial grounds for difference of opinion,certified the question for interlocutory appeal under b.al maqaleh gates,d.we accepted the case for interlocutory review,in re gates.lexis.july,bringing the jurisdictional issue before us in the present appeal.
ii.analysis 
a.the legal framework 
while we will discuss specific points of law in more detail below,for a full understanding,we must first set forth some of the legal history underlying the controversy over the availability of the writ of habeas corpus and the constitutional protections it effectuates to noncitizens of the united states held beyond the sovereign territory of the united states.the supreme court first addressed this issue in johnson eisentrager.in eisentrager german nationals petitioned the district court for writs of habeas corpus.the eisentrager petitioners had been convicted by a military commission in china of engaging in,permitting or ordering continued military activity against the united states after surrender of germany and before surrender of japan.id.at.because,during that period,the united states and germany were no longer at war,hostile acts against the united states by german citizens were violations of the law of war.petitioners were captured in china,tried in china,and repatriated to germany to serve their sentences in landsberg prison,a facility under the control of the united states as part of the allied powers occupation.id.none ever entered the united states,nor were any held in the united states.
petitioners sought habeas relief,alleging that their confinement was in violation of the constitution and laws of the united states and the geneva convention.id.at see also eisentrager.forrestal.the district court held that under ahrens clark,statutory jurisdiction over habeas petitions did not extend to aliens who were neither confined nor convicted in the district of the court and whose custodians were beyond geographic boundaries of the district in which the court sat.the court dismissed the writ.the petitioners appealed.the court of appeals reversed the district court judgment.
the court of appeals read ahrens as having left open the governing questions of the controversy before it,and held that since t he right to habeas corpus is an inherent common law right,eisentrager forrestal,at,a jurisdictional statute could not deprive anyone of whatever would be the fundamental right to habeas corpus because of the provision in article i of the constitution that the federal government can not suspend the privilege,except when,in cases of rebellion or invasion,the public safety may so require.at citing const.art.i,cl.
the court reasoned that as congress could not effectuate by omission that which it could not accomplish by affirmative action,if the existing jurisdictional act had the effect of depriving a person entitled to the writ of his substantive right,the act would be unconstitutional,and therefore the court must construe it if possible to avoid that result.id.at.the court ruled that the district court that had jurisdiction over the superior officers of the immediate jailer would have jurisdiction to hear the petition and grant or deny the writ.id.at.the secretary of defense became the relevant official.he sought certiorari from the supreme court.the supreme court granted review and reversed.by way of introduction to its reasoning,the court noted that w e are cited to no instance where a court,in this or any other country where the writ is known,has issued it on behalf of an alien enemy who,at no relevant time and in no stage of his captivity,has been within its territorial jurisdiction.eisentrager,at.
the court went on to hold that the writ was unavailable to the enemy aliens beyond the sovereign territory of the united states.the court did not end its discussion with the language concerning sovereignty,however.it noted that trial of the writ would hamper the war effort and bring aid and comfort to the enemy.id.at.the court further noted that such trial would constitute effective fettering of a field commander,by allowing the very enemies he is ordered to reduce to submission to call him to account in his own civil courts and divert his efforts and attention from the military offensive abroad to the legal defensive at home.id.
the eisentrager case remained the governing precedent concerning the jurisdiction of united states courts over habeas petitions on behalf of aliens held outside the sovereign territory of the united states until the court revisited the question in rasul bush.in rasul the petitioners were aliens not from enemy nations who were captured abroad during hostilities between the united states and the taliban.the united states transported them to the naval base at guantanamo bay,cuba,which the united states holds under a lease agreement specifying that the united states recognizes the continuance of the ultimate sovereignty of the republic of cuba over the leased areas.id.at quoting the lease agreement.thus,the habeas corpus petitioners were foreign nationals,not from nations currently in a state of war with the united states,taken by the united states military,and transported to locations outside the sovereign territory of the united states.relying on eisentrager,the district court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.rasul bush,d.this court affirmed.in al odah united states,we called it the heart of eisentrager,that the writ can not be made available to aliens abroad when basic constitutional protections are not.id.at.the detainees petitioned for certiorari to the supreme court.the supreme court granted review.
the district court and the court of appeals had accepted the government argument that the relevant facts of rasul were not distinguishable from those in eisentrager in any material way.the supreme court,while not overruling eisentrager,explained that the lower courts had misinterpreted the earlier supreme court decision.the rasul court stated that the consolidated cases before it present the narrow but important question whether united states courts lack jurisdiction to consider challenges to the legality of the detention of foreign nationals captured abroad in connection with hostilities and incarcerated at the guantanamo bay naval base,cuba.at.the court explained that the eisentrager decision dealt primarily with constitutional jurisdiction,with little to say as to the petitioners statutory entitlement to habeas review.id.at emphasis in the original.more specifically,the rasul court opined that the eisentrager court was construing the effect of ahrens clark.the posture of the petitions before the eisentrager court was that the court of appeals had concluded that the ahrens decision created a statutory gap which the court of appeals in eisentrager had seen as an unconstitutional gap to be filled by reference to fundamentals.rasul at quoting at.the supreme court in eisentrager agreed that the ahrens decision controlled as to statutory jurisdiction but did not agree with the court of appeals that the gap was unconstitutional.the rasul court treated the ahrens analysis as being essential to the decision in eisentrager,and held that ahrens has been overruled by braden judicial circuit court of kentucky,in which,according to the rasul court,the supreme court held contrary to ahrens,that the prisoner presence within the territorial jurisdiction of the district court is not an invariable prerequisite to the exercise of district court jurisdiction under the federal habeas statute.id.at.
the rasul court reasoned that because braden overruled the statutory predicate to eisentrager holding,eisentrager did not compel a holding that the courts lack jurisdiction to issue the writ.the rasul court then held that the habeas statute did extend geographically to the base at which the petitioners were held in guantanamo.at common law,courts exercised habeas jurisdiction over the claims of aliens detained within sovereign territory of the realm id.at.citing lord mansfield from,the rasul majority stated that there was no doubt as to the court power to issue writs of habeas corpus if the territory was under the subjection of the crown.id.at citing king cowle,burr,eng.the court noted that no one questioned the district court jurisdiction over the custodians of the petitioners and therefore held that confers on the district court jurisdiction to hear petitioners habeas corpus challenges to the legality of their detention at the guantanamo bay naval base.id.at.finally,the court concluded that 
w hat is presently at stake is whether the federal courts have jurisdiction to determine the legality of the executive potentially indefinite detention of individuals who claim to be wholly innocent of wrongdoing.
at.the court a nswer ed that question in the affirmative,reverse d the judgment of the court of appeals and remand ed the cases for the district court to consider in the first instance the merits of the petitioners claims.id.
responding to the rasul decision,congress passed the detainee treatment act of,stat.dta,which president bush signed into law on december of that year.among other things,that act added a new provision to the habeas act which provided that 
except as provided in section of the dta,no court,justice,or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the department of defense at guantanamo bay,cuba or 
any other action against the united states or its agents relating to any aspect of the detention by the department of defense of an alien at guantanamo bay,cuba,who 
a is currently in military custody or 
b has been determined by the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant.
in june of,the supreme court decided hamdan rumsfeld,which reversed another decision of this court.see hamdan rumsfeld.in hamdan,the supreme court held that the dta did not operate to strip the federal courts of jurisdiction to hear petitions for writs of habeas corpus on behalf of guantanamo detainees that were pending at the time of the dta enactment.therefore,the supreme court reversed this court dismissal of the petitions and remanded again for further proceedings.
in october of,in response to the hamdan decision,congress passed the military commissions act of mca,stat.that act,among many other things,included a further amendment to the habeas statute.the new amendment reads 
no court,justice,or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the united states who has been determined by the united states to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination.
except as provided in section e and e of the dta,no court,justice,or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider any other action against the united states or its agents relating to any aspect of the detention,transfer,treatment,trial,or conditions of confinement of an alien who is or was detained by the united states and has been determined by the united states to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination.
congress went on to explicitly state 
the amendment made by subsection a shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this act,and shall apply to all cases,without exception,pending on or after the date of the enactment of this act which relate to any aspect of the detention,transfer,treatment,trial,or conditions of detention of an alien detained by the united states since september.
this clearer statement of congressional intent to strip the courts of habeas jurisdiction set the stage for an inevitable determination of the constitutionality of such a stripping in light of the suspension clause,const.art.i,cl.that case came to us in boumediene bush.a divided panel held that the statute was constitutional.
in boumediene,we reasoned that the rasul decision had not overruled eisentrager,and therefore the earlier case remained precedentially binding upon us.we read eisentrager as holding that constitutional habeas rights did not extend to any aliens who had never been in or brought into the sovereign territory of the united states.we further reasoned that congress power to regulate our jurisdiction permitted congress to strip the courts of any jurisdiction to hear habeas claims for aliens who had no constitutional right to habeas relief,without regard to the suspension clause.the supreme court in boumediene bush,reversed our decision.
at the outset,the supreme court agreed with our court that the military commissions act,e,did in fact deprive the federal courts of jurisdiction to entertain the habeas corpus actions by the detainees held at guantanamo bay.at.the court therefore faced the constitutional questions 
whether petitioners are barred from seeking the writ or invoking the protections of the suspension clause either because of their status,designation by the executive branch as enemy combatants,or their physical location at guantanamo bay.
in a thorough and detailed opinion,the court undertook its inquiry into the constitutional questions on two levels.first,it explored the breadth of the court holding in eisentrager still not overruled in response to the argument by the united states that constitutional rights protected by the writ of habeas corpus under the suspension clause extended only to territories over which the united states held de jure sovereignty.second,it explored the more general question of extension of constitutional rights and the concomitant constitutional restrictions on governmental power exercised extraterritorially and with respect to noncitizens.in so doing,the court set forth a broad historical narrative of the writ of habeas corpus and its function id.at.while the court concluded that the historical record did not provide a clear answer,it accepted the government position that the united states did not exercise de jure sovereignty over guantanamo bay,but took notice of the obvious and uncontested fact that the united states,by virtue of its complete jurisdiction and control over the base,maintains de facto sovereignty over this territory.id.at citing rasul,at.however,the court further concluded that the government premise that de jure sovereignty is the touchstone of habeas jurisdiction is unfounded.id.
the court reasoned that the adoption of a rule based on de jure sovereignty would be inconsistent with a long line of supreme court cases exploring the constitution geographic scope.id.in explaining this proposition,the court explored the series of opinions known as the insular cases,in which the court had addressed whether the constitution,by its own force,applies in any territory that is not a state.id.at citing de lima bidwell,dooley united states,armstrong united states,downes bidwell,hawaii mankichi,dorr united states.the boumediene court recalled the practical doctrine drawn from the insular cases and applied in such later decisions as reid covert,and united states,applying the constitution by its own force in territories which were destined for apparent statehood,but recognizing a more practical and selective application of constitutional protection of rights in territories temporarily held by the united states,or in acts by the united states government outside united states territory altogether.
more directly pertinent to the issue before us today,the court stated that nothing in eisentrager says that de jure sovereignty is or has ever been the only relevant consideration in determining the geographic reach of the constitution or of habeas corpus.at.the court explained that such a holding would have been inconsistent with the insular cases and reid.seeing no need to create such a conflict between its holdings,the court found what it called a common thread uniting the insular cases,eisentrager,and reid the idea that questions of extraterritoriality turn on objective factors and practical concerns,not formalism.id.
applying the common thread to the question of the jurisdiction of united states courts to consider habeas petitions from detainees in guantanamo,the court concluded that at least three factors are relevant in determining the reach of the suspension clause.id.at.those three factors,which we must apply today in answering the same question as to detainees at bagram,are 
the citizenship and status of the detainee and the adequacy of the process through which that status determination was made the nature of the sites where apprehension and then detention took place and the practical obstacles inherent in resolving the prisoner entitlement to the writ.
id.applying these factors to the detainees at guantanamo,the court held that the petitioners had the protection of the suspension clause.
application to the bagram petitioners 
our duty,as explained above,is to determine the reach of the right to habeas corpus and therefore of the suspension clause to the factual context underlying the petitions we consider in the present appeal.in doing so,we are controlled by the supreme court interpretation of the constitution in eisentrager as construed and explained in the court more recent opinion in boumediene.this is not an easy task,as illustrated by the thorough and careful opinion of the district court.while we are properly respectful of the district court careful undertaking of this difficult task,as we review rulings on motions to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure de novo,we reexamine the issue and ultimately reach a different conclusion.
at the outset,we note that each of the parties has asserted both an extreme understanding of the law after boumediene and a more nuanced set of arguments upon which each relies in anticipation of the possible rejection of the arguments.the united states would like us to hold that the boumediene analysis has no application beyond territories that are,like guantanamo,outside the de jure sovereignty of the united states but are subject to its de facto sovereignty.as the government puts it in its reply brief,t he real question before this court,therefore,is whether bagram may be considered effectively part of the united states in light of the nature and history of the presence there.reply br.of the united states at.we disagree.
relying upon three independent reasons,the court in boumediene expressly repudiated the argument of the united states in that case to the effect that the eisentrager court adopted a formalistic,test for determining the reach of the suspension clause.at.briefly put,the high court rejected that argument first on the basis that the eisentrager court further analysis beyond recitations concerning sovereignty would not have been undertaken by the court if the sovereignty question were determinative.the boumediene court explicitly did not accept the idea that the sovereignty discussion from eisentrager is the only authoritative language in the opinion and that all the rest is dicta.the court further determinations,based on practical considerations,were integral to part ii of its opinion and came before the decision announced its holding.id.second,the court rejected the government reading of eisentrager because the meaning of the word sovereignty in the eisentrager opinion was not limited to the narrow technical sense of the word and could be read to connote the degree of control the military asserted over the facility.id.the third reason is the one we noted above,that is,that the court concluded that such a reading of eisentrager as proposed by the united states would have marked not only a change in,but a complete repudiation of,the insular cases and later reid functional approach to questions of extraterritoriality.id.at.
true,the second factor articulated in boumediene for rejecting the government reading of eisentrager might apply differently in this case because of differences in the levels of control over the military facilities.but we must keep in mind that the second factor is only one of the three reasons offered by the boumediene court for the rejection of a formalistic,test for determining the reach of the suspension clause.id.at.whatever the force of the second reason offered by the court in boumediene,the first and third reasons make it plain that the court understanding of eisentrager,and therefore of the reach of the suspension clause,was based not on a formalistic attachment to sovereignty,but on a consideration of practical factors as well.we note that the very fact that the boumediene court set forth the test outlined above parallels the eisentrager court further reasoning addressed by the boumediene court in its rejection of the de jure sovereignty argument before it.that is,had the boumediene court intended to limit its understanding of the reach of the suspension clause to territories over which the united states exercised de facto sovereignty,it would have had no need to outline the factors to be considered either generally or in the detail which it in fact adopted.we therefore reject the proposition that boumediene adopted a test with the effect of substituting de facto for de jure in the otherwise rejected interpretation of eisentrager.
for similar reasons,we reject the most extreme position offered by the petitioners.at various points,the petitioners seem to be arguing that the fact of united states control of bagram under the lease of the military base is sufficient to trigger the extraterritorial application of the suspension clause,or at least satisfy the second factor of the three set forth in boumediene.again,we reject this extreme understanding.such an interpretation would seem to create the potential for the extraterritorial extension of the suspension clause to noncitizens held in any united states military facility in the world,and perhaps to an undeterminable number of other united facilities as well.significantly,the court engaged in an extended dialog with counsel for the petitioners in which we repeatedly sought some limiting principle that would distinguish bagram from any other military installation.counsel was able to produce no such distinction.see transcript of oral argument.again,such an extended application is not a tenable interpretation of boumediene.if it were the supreme court intention to declare such a sweeping application,it would surely have said so.just as we reject the extreme argument of the united states that would render most of the decision in boumediene dicta,we reject the first line of argument offered by petitioners.having rejected the arguments of both parties,we must proceed to their more nuanced arguments,and reach a conclusion based on the application of the supreme court enumerated factors to the case before us.
the first of the enumerated factors is the citizenship and status of the detainee and the adequacy of the process through which that status determination was made.citizenship is,of course,an important factor in determining the constitutional rights of persons before the court.it is well established that there are constitutional decisions of the supreme court expressly according differing protection to aliens than to citizens.united states,at.however,clearly the alien citizenship of the petitioners in this case does not weigh against their claim to protection of the right of habeas corpus under the suspension clause.so far as citizenship is concerned,they differ in no material respect from the petitioners at guantanamo who prevailed in boumediene.as to status,the petitioners before us are held as enemy aliens.but so were the boumediene petitioners.while the eisentrager petitioners were in a weaker position by having the status of war criminals,that is immaterial to the question before us.this question is governed by boumediene and the status of the petitioners before us again is the same as the guantanamo detainees,so this factor supports their argument for the extension of the availability of the writ.
so far as the adequacy of the process through which that status determination was made,the petitioners are in a stronger position for the availability of the writ than were either the eisentrager or boumediene petitioners.as the supreme court noted,the boumediene petitioners were in a very different posture than those in eisentrager in that there ha d been no trial by military commission for violations of the laws of war.at.unlike the boumediene petitioners or those before us,t he eisentrager petitioners were charged by a bill of particulars that made detailed factual allegations against them.id.at.the eisentrager detainees were entitled to representation by counsel,allowed to introduce evidence on their own behalf,and permitted to the prosecution witnesses in an adversarial proceeding.id.the status of the boumediene petitioners was determined by combatant status review tribunals csrts affording far less protection.under the csrt proceeding,the detainee,rather than being represented by an attorney,was advised by a personal representative who was not the detainee lawyer or even his advocate.id.the csrt proceeding was less protective than the military tribunal procedures in eisentrager in other particulars as well,and the supreme court clearly stated that t he difference is not trivial.id.at.
the status of the bagram detainees is determined not by a combatant status review tribunal but by an unlawful enemy combatant review board uecrb.as the district court correctly noted,proceedings before the uecrb afford even less protection to the rights of detainees in the determination of status than was the case with the csrt therefore,as the district court noted,while the important adequacy of process factor strongly supported the extension of the suspension clause and habeas rights in boumediene,it even more strongly favors petitioners here.al maqaleh,d at.therefore,examining only the first of the supreme court three enumerated factors,petitioners have made a strong argument that the right to habeas relief and the suspension clause apply in bagram as in guantanamo.however,we do not stop with the first factor.
the second factor,the nature of the sites where apprehension and then detention took place,weighs heavily in favor of the united states.like all petitioners in both eisentrager and boumediene,the petitioners here were apprehended abroad.while this in itself would appear to weigh against the extension of the writ,it obviously would not be sufficient,otherwise boumediene would not have been decided as it was.however,the nature of the place where the detention takes place weighs more strongly in favor of the position argued by the united states and against the extension of habeas jurisdiction than was the case in either boumediene or eisentrager.in the first place,while de facto sovereignty is not determinative,for the reasons discussed above,the very fact that it was the subject of much discussion in boumediene makes it obvious that it is not without relevance.as the supreme court set forth,guantanamo bay is a territory that,while technically not part of the united states,is under the complete and total control of our government.at.while it is true that the united states holds a leasehold interest in bagram,and held a leasehold interest in guantanamo,the surrounding circumstances are hardly the same.the united states has maintained its total control of guantanamo bay for over a century,even in the face of a hostile government maintaining de jure sovereignty over the property.in bagram,while the united states has options as to duration
