this case,which centers on a january bar fight in tacoma,washington,raises several questions of first impression in this circuit.central among them is whether the north atlantic treaty organization status of forces agreement,june,tias,precludes suit against the united kingdom under the foreign sovereign immunities act of fsia,et,for noncommercial torts committed by its servicemen while present within the united states.we conclude that,pursuant to the,moore exclusive tort remedy based on the allegations in his complaint is a suit against the united states under the federal tort claims act ftca,et.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of moore fsia claim for lack of jurisdiction.we also affirm the district court dismissal of moore claim under the freedom of information act foia,albeit on different grounds.
background 
on the evening of january,kenneth southall and several other members of the british military started a bar fight with robert moore,the in this case,at the lakewood bar and grill in tacoma,washington moore sustained serious injuries in the altercation.on january,moore filed this lawsuit,against southall,ten unnamed members of the british military,and the government of the united kingdom,in the united states district court for the western district of washington.the complaint stated two counts count i,styled as a freedom of information act request,seeks an order against the british government requiring the production of certain documents related to the incident.count ii seeks damages against southall,the doe,and the united kingdom,under the noncommercial tort exception to the fsia,a.
when none of the defendants appeared in the district court,moore filed a motion for an order of default.shortly thereafter,the united states filed an application for leave to appear as amicus curiae,along with a suggestion of lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court granted the application,and,on october,ruled that it lacked jurisdiction and,for that reason,declined to resolve any of the outstanding default and disclosure issues.
specifically,the court held that,because of the,
moore only claim giving rise to jurisdiction in this court is a claim against the armed forces of the host nation itself.because moore claim is against the united kingdom,rather than the united states,and directly implicates british forces while in the line of duty within the united states,this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.
citation omitted.because the district court found that it also lacked jurisdiction over the foia claim against the united kingdom,it dismissed that claim as well.after so concluding,the district court dismissed the case without prejudice.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
a.the foreign sovereign immunities act of 
the existence of subject matter jurisdiction under the fsia is a question of law reviewed de novo.in re estate of ferdinand marcos,human rights,cir.enacted in,the foreign sovereign immunities act is 
a comprehensive statute containing a set of legal standards governing claims of immunity in every civil action against a foreign state or its political subdivisions,agencies,or instrumentalities.the act codifies,as a matter of federal law,the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity,and transfers primary responsibility for immunity determinations from the executive to the judicial branch.
republic of austria altmann,d quoting verlinden cent.bank of nigeria,d citations omitted.the fsia thus ordinarily provides the exclusive source of subject matter jurisdiction over suits involving foreign states and their instrumentalities,as foreign states are presumed to be immune from the jurisdiction of united states courts unless one of the act exceptions to immunity applies.coyle garuda indonesia,cir quoting gates victor fine foods,cir citations omitted.
jurisdiction for claims brought against foreign states under the fsia is conferred by a which provides that 
the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any nonjury civil action against a foreign state as defined in section a of this title as to any claim for relief in personam with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity either under sections of this title or under any applicable international agreement 
thus,federal courts have been held to have jurisdiction over foreign states as defendants under the fsia only when that state is not entitled to is,when one of the statutory exceptions applies.see,altmann,at.at at the threshold of every action in a district court against a foreign state,the court must satisfy itself that one of the exceptions applies,as jurisdiction in any such action depends on that application.quoting verlinden,at.saudi arabia nelson,d u nless a specified exception applies,a federal court lacks subject over a claim against a foreign state.
one of the act exceptions from immunity,the tort exception,applies to suits 
in which money damages are sought against a foreign state for personal injury or death,or damage to or loss of property,occurring in the united states and caused by the tortious act or omission of that foreign state or of any official or employee of that foreign state while acting within the scope of his office or employment 
a.as we summarized in randolph budget,
in order to find that a foreign sovereign can be sued under the tortious activity exception a,the court must find that the tortious acts of individual employees of the sovereign were undertaken while in the scope of employment,and that the claim is not based upon the exercise or failure to exercise a discretionary function.because this case does not involve a discretionary function,only employment and scope of employment issues are in question.
cir citing joseph office of consulate of,cir were this personal injury suit governed by the noncommercial tort exception to the fsia,our inquiry would be guided by these standards.
agreements and the fsia 
unlike randolph,however,this suit was brought against foreign servicemen.litigation against members of foreign military forces who are within the united states and against members of the military abroad is guided by agreements,or sofas.see in re burt,cir richard erickson,status of forces agreements a sharing of sovereign prerogative.litigation in this country against members of the british military is governed by the.see brown ministry of defense.
subject to existing international agreements 
the first issue we must resolve is the relationship between the and the fsia.the central provision of the fsia,provides 
subject to existing international agreements to which the united states is a party at the time of enactment of this act a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states and of the states except as provided in sections to of this chapter.
emphasis added.
although this language is critical,its meaning is not entirely transparent.does subject to existing international agreements modify only shall be immune,so that existing international agreements can only permit suits against foreign states where the fsia would not or are the exceptions specified in also subject to existing international agreements,so that such agreements can preclude suit where the fsia would otherwise allow it no court has explicitly resolved this issue.see,siderman de blake republic of argentina,cir discussing language without resolving this question.
in argentine republic amerada hess shipping,d,however,the supreme court provided some guidance.amerada hess held that the treaty exception intended by the subject to existing international agreements phraseology applies when international agreements expressly conflic t with the immunity provisions of the fsia.id.at.quoting,at,reprinted in,alteration in original.this language suggests that any conflict with the fsia immunity provisions,whether toward more or less immunity,is within the treaty exception.
although there is no other pertinent judicial precedent,the house report accompanying the fsia is clear on this point 
like other provisions in the bill,section is subject to existing international agreements see section,including status of forces agreements if a remedy is available under a status of forces agreement,the foreign state is immune from such tort claims as are encompassed in sections a and a.
at,reprinted in at see also id.at,reprinted in at all immunity provisions in sections through are made subject to existing treaties and other international agreements to which the united states is a party.in the event an international agreement expressly conflicts with the fsia,the international agreement would control.emphasis added.
this conflict reading of is the only sensible one.under this interpretation of the fsia,preexisting international agreements could either expand or contract a foreign nation amenability to suit as compared to that provided under the fsia.to read otherwise,as permitting international agreements only to expand a foreign state exposure to suit but not to limit it,would allow the fsia implicitly to trump treaties precluding certain kinds of suits against foreign nations.given the lack of any specific indication that congress intended this alternate construction,we follow the canon of statutory interpretation that acts of congress should not be construed to conflict with international treaty obligations.freedom to travel campaign newcomb,cir citing sale haitian ctrs.council,d.we therefore hold that the fsia in its entirety is subject to such existing international agreements.if there is a conflict between the fsia and such an agreement regarding the availability of a judicial remedy against a contracting state,the agreement prevails.
the the fsia,and is therefore one of the existing international agreements covered by the caveat in.see,at,reprinted in at t he fsia would not alter the rights or duties of the united states under the nato status of forces agreement or similar agreements with other countries.because the fsia is subject to the,whether moore fsia claim may go forward turns on two inquiries does the apply in this case if so,does it expressly conflic t,amerada hess,at.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted,with the fsia if the applies and conflicts with the fsia,then the defendants may not be sued under the fsia.
application of the 
two provisions of the are central to this case.first,article i,paragraph defines force for purposes of the agreement to mean the personnel belonging to the land,sea,or air armed services of one contracting party when in the territory of another contracting party in the north atlantic treaty area in connexion with their official duties,art.i,a,at.the treaty goes on to state that the two contracting parties concerned may agree that certain individuals,units,or formations shall not be regarded as constituting or included in a force for the purposes of the present agreement.id.
under the basic definition,southall and the other ten doe defendants were all members of a force at the time of the tacoma incident the complaint alleges that they were active members of the british military present within the united states on active duty for the purposes of training exercises.they therefore were here in connexion with their official duties.
moore argues that the district court could not have known whether these defendants fall under the exception to the force definition,whether britain and the united states had agreed that any of the individuals named as defendants should not be regarded as constituting or included in a force under the.moore,however,points to no such agreement as he is relying on an exception within the text of the treaty,the burden is on him to show that the exception applies.see,united states henry,cir articulating the rule that a party who relies upon an exception to a statute made by a proviso or distinct clause,whether in the same section of the statute or elsewhere,has the burden of establishing and showing that he comes within the exception.because moore has not alleged any agreement in his complaint,we conclude that the defendants all come under the terms of the.
the assimilation provision 
the other key provision of the appears in article viii,paragraph 
claims arising out of acts or omissions of members of a force or civilian component done in the performance of official duty,or out of any other act,omission,or occurrence for which a force or civilian component is legally responsible,and causing damage in the territory of the receiving state to third parties,other than any of the contracting parties,shall be dealt with by the receiving state in accordance with the following provisions 
a claims shall be filed,considered and settled or adjudicated in accordance with the laws and regulations of the receiving state with respect to claims arising from the activities of its own armed forces.
art.viii,at emphasis added we observed some time ago that this provision does suggest that the foreign serviceman is assimilated into the united states military for this limited consideration.daberkow united states,cir.daberkow thus assumed that subparagraph a does not simply provide that suit can be filed against the foreign nation on the same basis that suit could be filed against the united states were the defendants our armed forces or members thereof.instead,daberkow suggested that,as the district court put the matter in this case,under this treaty,foreign servicemen are effectively considered members of the united states military for purposes of claims arising out of acts or omissions of the servicemen.
although we have never squarely so held,the ratification history supports this conclusion.see exec,at in the case of torts committed in the performance of duty,the local citizen who is injured proceeds against his own government exactly as he would if the injury had been caused by a member of his own government armed forces.so do the decisions of every district court that has looked at this question.see,greenpeace.at under the framework established by,the foreign serviceman is merged or assimilated into the united states military for the purposes of claims arising out of the acts or omissions of that foreign serviceman.lowry commonwealth of canada,aaskov aldridge,brown.at shafter united states,aff,cir.
the decisive support for construing this part of the as a merger provision comes from a contemporaneous act of international agreement claims act of,stat.codified as amended at.under the act,
when the united states is a party to an international agreement which provides for the settlement or adjudication by the united states under its laws and regulations,and subject to agreed pro rata reimbursement,of claims against another party to the agreement arising out of the acts or omissions of a member or civilian employee of an armed force of that party done in the performance of official duty,or arising out of any other act,omission,or occurrence for which that armed force is legally responsible under applicable united states law,claims may be prosecuted against the united states,or settled by the united states,in accordance with the agreement,as if the acts or omissions upon which they are based were the acts or omissions of a member or a civilian employee of an armed force of the united states.
a enacted specifically to codify the reimbursement procedures of the,see eyskens united states,d,niedbala united states,fed.cl,the act implements article viii of the by authorizing funds for payment of sofa claims,be they nato sofa or other sofas.the united states pays a pro rata share of awards as determined by the relevant sofa.niedbala,fed.cl.at.thus,congress,in enabling the claims procedures by enacting them into federal law,see aaskov.at,understood article viii as a merger provision,an interpretation we follow today.
moore complaint alleges that southall and the other ten unnamed defendants were acting within their official capacity.this suit is therefore governed by article viii,paragraph of the and moore must pursue such claims as though he were injured by the armed forces of the host nation itself.greenpeace.at.in short,the effect of nato sofa is to make the united states the only appropriate defendant in this suit.lowry.at.
the fsia,of course,provides for suits against foreign nations,not against t
