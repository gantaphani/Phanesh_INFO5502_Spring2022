this case involves violations of the arms export control act,which imposes export controls on defense articles and services without a license.john roth worked as a consultant on a united states air force defense research project,which had been awarded to atmospheric glow technologies,in knoxville,tennessee.the project entailed developing plasma technology for use on military aircraft.the government charged roth with exporting data from the project on a trip to china and allowing two foreign nationals in knoxville access to certain data and equipment in violation of the act.a jury in united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee convicted him of one count of conspiracy,fifteen counts of exporting defense articles and services without a license,and one count of wire fraud.he appeals his convictions.for the following reasons,we affirm.
background 
roth is a published author in the field of plasma technology and was a professor of electrical engineering at the university of tennessee at knoxville during the events underlying this case.his former student,daniel sherman,was a principal at atmospheric,of which roth was a minority owner.the two men had a paper explaining how plasma technology devices can be used to affect electrohydrodynamic flow,a topic relating to aircraft flight.
in october,the air force solicited contract proposals to develop plasma actuators that could be used to control the flight of small,subsonic,unmanned,military drone aircraft.the project would be broken down into phase i,which entailed developing the design of the actuators,and phase ii,which entailed testing the actuators in a wind tunnel and on a aircraft.
atmospheric submitted the winning phase i proposal and the air force awarded it the contract in may with roth working as a consultant for the project.at or around that time,sherman told roth that the project would be paid for with funds,which roth knew implied that the research would be subject to export control laws that prohibit allowing access to the research outside of the united states or to foreign nationals unless a license has been obtained.
when phase i was completed,roth assisted atmospheric in drafting the contract proposal for phase ii,which the air force also assigned to atmospheric.roth also assisted in writing,and signed,task order,a subcontract between him and atmospheric acknowledging that phase ii work was subject to export controls.the air force identified some of the technical data reports in the phase ii contract as being export controlled,such as the quarterly reports,technology transfer reports,final report,and test plan.jesse crump,who worked for the department of defense,testified at trial that the data contained in the weekly reports and quarterly reports was unquestionably export controlled information,partly because it could only be intended for military use.additionally,the contract and the subcontract incorporated federal regulations prohibiting foreign nationals from working on the project.nevertheless,roth proposed that two of his graduate research bonds,an american,and xin dai,a chinese work with him on the project.sherman originally protested dai involvement,so it was decided that bonds was to work at atmospheric on the export controlled data and dai would work at the university without access to the export controlled data.bonds testified at trial that the main reason for the separation of work was because of dai foreign citizenship and the export controlled data.roth did not think that dai needed to be shielded from the data and dai eventually gained access to the weekly reports from atmospheric.
as part of the testing of the plasma actuators,a device called the force stand was developed for the project and installed in labs at atmospheric and the university in the fall of.it was used to test the actuators and gather data before proceeding to the stage in which the actuators would be tested in a wind tunnel.dai worked with the force stand,and another graduate student named sirous nourgostar,an iranian national,had access to it multiple times.crump testified that the force stand was a defense article because it was designed specifically to collect data for this project,which had a military purpose.
in anticipation of dai completion of his doctorate,roth informed sherman and atmospheric that he intended to replace dai with nourgostar.after meeting with reluctance and opposition from sherman because of nourgostar foreign citizenship,and especially because of america contentious affairs with iran,roth sought support from carolyn webb,an administrator at the university who supervised research contracts.webb worried that some parts of the project might concern export controlled data and referred roth to robin witherspoon,the university officer in charge of export controls.at their initial meeting,roth explained to witherspoon that the project was military in nature,but that the subject of the research was part of the public domain,which meant it was publicly available,and,thus,not export controlled.witherspoon indicated that she was concerned that the data from the research was export controlled.she later followed up with roth via and phone to explain that she had concluded that the data was export controlled.at that time,dai was removed from the project.additionally,knowing of roth upcoming trip to lecture in china,witherspoon warned him that he could not take anything from phase ii abroad.in a similar vein,sherman obtained agreement from roth that he would not take any data from the project to china.
aside from the phase ii project,sherman and atmospheric submitted another contract proposal in may to the defense advance research projects agency,an arm of the department of defense that assigns and funds advanced weapons projects.roth and sherman spoke about roth working on the project,and roth sent sherman a plan for part of the project that was incorporated into the agency proposal.sherman roth a completed copy of the proposal,which contained export controlled information from the boeing company weapons division,and marked all but one of the pages with proprietary and export controlled information.
on may,roth traveled to china to lecture at universities regarding his work.he took with him a paper copy of a phase ii weekly report,a flash drive with electronic copies of phase ii reports,and a laptop computer on which was stored a copy of the agency proposal.neither roth nor anyone else accessed any of the electronic files stored on the thumb drive or the laptop,but roth had dai send him a copy of a paper containing phase ii data by way of a chinese professor address.roth later gave nourgostar access to the paper in the fall of.
on may,a grand jury in united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee returned an indictment against roth and atmospheric claiming that roth had taken phase ii data and the agency proposal to china,and both roth and atmospheric had allowed dai and nourgostar access to the data and the force stand.roth was charged with one count of conspiracy to export defense articles in violation of the act,fifteen counts of exporting defense articles in violation of the act,and one count of wire fraud.before the court delivered instructions to the jury,roth requested an instruction regarding willfulness that required the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew the data and items he allegedly exported were listed on the united states munitions list.additionally,he requested a separate instruction regarding ignorance of the law as a defense.however,the district court declined to deliver a separate instruction on ignorance of the law as an affirmative defense,and gave the jury the following instruction regarding willfulness 
to prove that defendant acted knowingly and willfully,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant voluntarily and intentionally violated a known legal duty.in other words,the defendant must have acted voluntarily and intentionally and with the specific intent to do something he knew was unlawful,that is to say,with intent either to disobey or disregard the law.negligent conduct,or conduct by mistake or accident,or with a good faith belief that the conduct was lawful,is not sufficient to constitute willfulness.
the jury found roth guilty of all counts on september.he timely filed a motion for judgment of acquittal on grounds of legal and factual insufficiency.he also filed a motion for a new trial,arguing that the district court jury instructions were improper because the court failed to read to the jury the proper instruction for willfulness and declined to give a separate instruction on ignorance of the law as a defense.the district court denied both motions.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,roth claims that the phase ii data and the data included in the agency proposal are not defense articles or services as a matter of law the district court incorrectly instructed the jury as to willfulness and improperly failed to deliver his proposed instruction regarding ignorance of the law and there was insufficient evidence to support the jury conclusion that he willfully exported the agency proposal.
defense articles and services under the act 
we review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.united states gagnon,cir citing united states parrett,cir.
the act allows for the president of the united states to identify defense articles and defense services on the united states munitions list that can not be exported without a license from the united states.a b.furthermore,section c imposes criminal penalties for a ny person who willfully violates any provision of the act.in part,the munitions list identifies as defense articles 
a aircraft,including drones which are specifically designed,modified,or equipped for military purposes.
h components,parts,accessories,attachments,and associated equipment including ground support equipment specifically designed or modified for the articles in paragraphs a through d of this category,excluding aircraft tires and propellers used with reciprocating engines.
i technical data as defined in and defense services as defined in directly related to the defense articles enumerated in paragraphs a through h of this category see for exemptions,except for hot section technical data associated with commercial aircraft engines.technical data directly related to the manufacture or production of any defense articles enumerated elsewhere in this category that are designated as significant military equipment sme shall itself be designated sme.
category viii.section of the code of federal regulations proceeds to define technical data as 
information which is required for the design,development,production,manufacture,assembly,operation,repair,testing,maintenance or modification of defense articles.this includes information in the form of blueprints,drawings,photographs,plans,instructions or documentation.
and section instructs that a defense service is,in relevant part,t he furnishing to foreign persons of any technical data controlled under this subchapter see,whether in the united states or abroad.
initially,we take note that courts may not review whether items are properly designated as defense articles on the munitions list.h.our query,therefore,is not whether technical data and components are defense articles,but whether the data from phase ii and the agency proposal and the force stand fall under the definitions of technical data and components.see united states.pulungan,cir referencing h.
roth argues that the phase ii data,agency proposal,and force stand were not defense articles because they were not developed to put plasma actuators on anything designated on the munitions list.he draws this conclusion because during the time he worked on the project,future stages of phase ii envisioned testing actuators on commercially available aircraft,which are not covered on the munitions list,before incorporating the actuators into military aircraft.he asserts that his removal from phase ii before actuators were ever applied to any aircraft signifies that his actions could have no connection to a military aircraft.
however,the federal regulations extend export controls to all stages of defense projects that are covered by the act,not just the final stages when military devices are directly involved.in pertinent part,the federal regulations define technical data,which is a category of defense article,as i nformation which is required for the design,development,production,manufacture,and assembly of defense articles such as drones.these terms envision that research requires multiple stages before a project reaches completion,and apply export controls to all those phases.furthermore,the regulations define components as parts,accessories,attachments,and associated equipment specifically designed or modified for the articles such as drones.id.the regulations have been written to cover a broad range of articles at all stages of research and development in projects covered by the act.
somehow,roth ignores the fact that the final goal of phase ii was to incorporate plasma actuators on military drone aircraft.while the project might have called for the data to be tested on a commercially available drone plane at some point in the project,roth admits that all the data collected,as well as the force stand that was developed to collect it,were derived for eventual military use.what is more,he does not argue that the data and force stand would not have been defense articles once they were used in conjunction with a military aircraft.this omission implies that the data and the force stand would have qualified as defense articles at some point.it seems that roth thinks that barriers exist between the stages of the project that prevent the defense article qualification from being imputed from one stage to another,which is incorrect according to.
because the final objective of this project was incorporating plasma actuators into military drones,the district court properly concluded that the underlying data and component were defense articles and services pursuant to,category viii.
jury instructions 
when a party claims a jury instruction improperly or inaccurately stated the law,we review that claim de novo.united states blanchard,cir smith,outboard marine,cir citing fisher ford motor,cir.on the other hand,a district court refusal to give a jury instruction is reviewed for abuse of discretion.smith,at citing fisher,at.roth claim that the court instructed the jury on the incorrect definition of willfulness is reviewed de novo.his claim that the court erred by not giving the jury an instruction on ignorance of the law as a separate and complete defense is reviewed for abuse of discretion.
willfulness 
neither the supreme court nor our court has defined willfulness under section c.roth argues that it requires the defendant to intentionally export defense articles or services that he specifically knows are on the munitions list.the government counters that willfulness under the statute only requires a defendant to know of the general unlawfulness of his conduct,not to know of the specific statutory provision he is violating.
a fundamental canon of statutory construction is that when interpreting statutes,the language of the statute is the starting point for interpretation,and it should also be the ending point if the plain meaning of that language is clear.thompson greenwood,cir citing united states boucha,cir.here,the language can not be our ending point as the supreme court has commented that willfulness can be a word of many meanings whose construction is often dependent on the context in which it appears.bryan united states,quoting spies united states.generally though,in criminal cases,in order to establish a willful violation of a statute,the government must prove that the defendant acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.id.quoting ratzlaf united states.
other circuits have interpreted the willfulness element of section c and produced different results.multiple circuits have interpreted willfulness as requiring a defendant to know generally that the act of exporting the underlying items is unlawful without requiring that the defendant know the items are on the munitions list.see united states murphy,ci
