background 
we begin with the regulatory scheme that frames this case.under the veterans preference act of,stat.codified at,a preference eligible who has been separated or furloughed without delinquency or misconduct,on request,is entitled to have his name placed on appropriate registers and employment lists for every position for which his qualifications have been established.a.the office of personnel management opm has adopted regulations to implement the requirements of section.the regulations are codified in subpart b of part of title of the code of federal regulations.see.
sections require that each agency maintain a reemployment priority list rpl and establish guidelines for the operation of its rpl.under section a,employees entered on an rpl enjoy,at a minimum,priority consideration over certain outside job applicants.once an employee is registered on the rpl,section b entitles him or her to priority placement when a vacancy in the agency arises.section b requires 
when a qualified individual is available on an agency rpl,the agency may not make a final commitment to an individual not on the rpl to fill a permanent or temporary competitive service position by 
a new appointment,unless the individual appointed is a qualified preference eligible or 
transfer or reemployment,unless the individual is a preference eligible,is exercising restoration rights under part of this chapter based on return from military service or recovery from a compensable injury or disability within year,or is exercising other statutory or regulatory reemployment rights.
although section b gives employees on the rpl significant priority over other applicants,subsection c allows an agency to choose certain employees over candidates on the rpl.in particular,under c i an agency may fill a specific position with a current,qualified employee of the agency through d etail or position change promotion,demotion,reassignment rather than with a qualified employee from the rpl.thus,a person registered on the rpl is not entitled to priority over internal applicants for a position.
section b requires that each agency establish and maintain a n rpl for each commuting area in which it separates eligible competitive service employees by rif,except as provided by paragraph c of this section.the section c exception states 
an agency need not maintain a distinct rpl for employees separated by reduction in force if the agency operates a placement program for its employees and obtains opm concurrence that the program satisfies the basic requirements of this subpart.the intent of this provision is to allow agencies to adopt different placement strategies that are effective for their particular programs yet satisfy legal entitlements to priority consideration in reemployment.
thus,the regulation requires that an agency maintain either an rpl or an alternate program that has obtained opm concurrence.
although agencies must maintain an rpl under sections a and b or an equivalent under section c,the regulations do not mandate that employees participate in available agency reemployment programs.section clarifies that placement on an agency rpl is not automatic.in order to be entered on an rpl,an employee must first complete an application,within the time frame set forth in section a.section a provides 
to be entered on the rpl,an eligible employee under must complete an application registration may take place as soon as a specific notice of separation under part of this chapter,or a certification of expected separation as provided in of this chapter,has been issued.the employee must submit the application within calendar days after the rif separation date.an employee who fails to submit a timely application is not entitled to be placed on the rpl.
even though an employee is not entitled to automatic entry on the rpl,he or she is entitled to receive information from the agency that may aid the employee in applying for the rpl.pursuant to b,at the time employees receive notices of separation or certifications of expected separation,the agency must give each eligible employee information about the rpl,including appeal rights.
employee appeal rights are established by section,which provides 
an individual who believes that his or her reemployment priority rights under this subpart have been violated because of the employment of another person who otherwise could not have been appointed properly may appeal to the merit systems protection board under the provisions of the board regulations.

at the time of the rif,the department of defense dod,of which the navy is a part,operated both an rpl and a separate priority placement program ppp.the dod ppp has not been approved by opm under c.the record contains rasing notice of,which mentions that he may be entitled to register in the dod priority placement program ppp.rasing asked to be registered in the ppp,but was refused registration because he did not meet the eligibility requirements for it.pursuant to the ppp operations manual employees are ineligible for the ppp if their performance or conduct is less than fully satisfactory.the finding that rasing performance was not fully satisfactory was based solely on the december,letter of unsatisfactory performance in the notice of rasing received,there was no mention of the rpl.
