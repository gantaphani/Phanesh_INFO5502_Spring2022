philip veitch,formerly a lieutenant commander in the navy chaplain corps,appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment to the navy.his complaint alleged that he had been constructively discharged for unconstitutional reasons that the navy had forced him out of the service in violation of his first amendment rights to free speech and free exercise of religion and in contravention of the establishment clause.the district court concluded that since veitch had resigned voluntarily,he lacked standing to bring his constitutional claims.we affirm.
veitch is an evangelical protestant minister in the reformed episcopal church.he joined the navy chaplain corps in and from june until september served in the corps as a commissioned officer,ultimately reaching the rank of lieutenant commander.this case has its origin in a recurrent dispute that took place between veitch and his command chaplain,captain ronald buchmiller,during veitch assignment to the naval support activity,naples,italy nsa naples.
essentially,veitch claims that captain buchmiller,a catholic priest,clashed with him because of buchmiller intolerance for veitch conservative protestant religious beliefs and practices.there seems to be little doubt that the relationship between the two was quite unfriendly,and,according to veitch,buchmiller repeatedly criticized him for his insistence on preaching sola doctrine that biblical teaching alone is authoritative,which is accepted by many protestant faiths but rejected by catholic and orthodox churches.continued friction led veitch to send rather caustic to buchmiller and to file an equal opportunity complaint eo complaint seeking relief from buchmiller harassment.
commander lawrence zoeller,a medical service officer,was assigned to investigate veitch complaint.zoeller concluded that veitch allegation of religious discrimination was unsubstantiated.in explaining his decision to recommend denying veitch complaint,zoeller described what he perceived to be the navy requirement of pluralism among religions.zoeller determined that veitch had failed to satisfy the basic tenet of pluralism in his preaching,and that buchmiller had been correct to counsel veitch on this problem.zoeller also found that veitch preaching was derogatory toward other faiths.zoeller transmitted his report to captain john coyne,the commanding officer at nsa naples.after reviewing zoeller report along with some of the sent from veitch to buchmiller,coyne contacted buchmiller to inform him that veitch behavior,as evidenced by his,demonstrated an unacceptable lack of respect for a superior officer and should not be tolerated in the future.
thereafter,veitch claims that buchmiller tore a reformation conference poster off his wall and continued to harass and criticize him.veitch claims that he was on the verge of filing a second eo complaint in response to buchmiller continued hostility.in the end,veitch chose not to file,but he did send buchmiller a fateful on february.veitch rebarbative missive was a broadside attack on buchmiller command and character.this prompted coyne to bring punishment against veitch in the form of a captain mast.veitch was presented with a charge sheet in february he was charged with disrespect towards a superior commissioned officer under article of the uniform code of military justice ucmj.he was also charged under article of the ucmj with failure to go to appointed place of duty,for having missed four staff meetings,without justification,in late.veitch consulted with his navy attorney and refused punishment.coyne then decided to bring the same charges against veitch at.
after further consultation with counsel,veitch submitted his resignation,which coyne endorsed.coyne did not further pursue the charges,but instead issued veitch a nonpunitive letter of caution.in april,veitch wrote to the department of defense inspector general dodig alleging that coyne and buchmiller had engaged in acts of reprisal for his decision to file the eo complaint he requested that the dodig investigate the circumstances surrounding his resignation.in may,the navy approved veitch resignation and set a november separation date.however,in july,when the dodig agreed to investigate veitch complaint through the navy inspector general nig,veitch requested permission to withdraw his resignation.veitch new commanding officer,captain brendan gray,strongly recommended disapproval of veitch request,and the navy denied his request in august.but in early november,the secretary of the navy suspended veitch resignation orders until the completion of the nig investigation into veitch retaliation complaint.on may,the nig completed its report,which found that veitch allegations of reprisal were unsupported.with the retaliation inquiry complete,veitch was finally separated from the navy on september.
veitch then sued the navy and several of its officers in federal district court in december.veitch included with his complaint a motion for a preliminary injunction.the district court denied veitch motion.see veitch danzig,d.defendants then filed a motion to dismiss,which was granted in part and denied in part.the court also ordered veitch to file an amended complaint or face dismissal of his entire case.see veitch danzig,civ,memorandum and order.veitch then filed a amended complaint alleging free speech,establishment,and free exercise claims fifth amendment claims claims for constructive discharge and violations of the religious freedom restoration act rfra.the district court granted summary judgment for defendants.
veitch would have us confront a rather troubling constitutional question whether chaplains in the armed services can be required to endorse pluralism in their religious practices.the services are understandably concerned about unit morale.and those of us old enough to remember world war ii movies will recall scenes of chaplains at the front line performing services for soldiers of different religions.on the other hand,veitch argument that a chaplain can not be obliged to preach counter to his or her religious beliefs consistent with the first amendment is hardly a frivolous claim.fortunately for unfortunately for need not decide this difficult question.we agree with the district court that veitch may not raise this issue because his resignation was voluntary and because the navy did not act unreasonably in refusing to permit veitch to withdraw his resignation.
veitch contends that we are obliged to consider his constitutional challenges because the navy alleged unlawful behavior coerced veitch into offering his resignation in other words,he alleges that he was constructively discharged.veitch pleadings never really indicate the source of his cause of action.at oral argument,veitch counsel asserted that his claim and request for injunctive reinstatement of his based on the constitution itself.the government did not object to appellant imprecision in his pleadings,nor did it deny that a claim for constructive discharge could be brought against the government directly under the constitution the government insisted instead that veitch resignation was wholly voluntary.in light of the parties posture,we shall assume,arguendo,that if the government illegally coerced an officer to resign,a constructive discharge claim could be brought although we have found no cases that explicitly discuss such a claim,there are,of course,quite a number of constructive discharge cases that arise in the title vii context.see generally.state police suders,d.to be sure,veitch does not purport to be raising a claim under title vii,and although this court has not squarely ruled on the question,we note that every circuit to address the issue has held title vii inapplicable to uniformed members of the armed services.see,fisher peters,cir brown united states,cir hodge dalton,cir randall united states,cir doe garrett,cir roper dep t of the army,cir.johnson alexander,cir see also collins sec y of the navy,nevertheless,title vii cases provide standards by which to judge constructive discharge claims,and the district court relied on them,in part,to determine that veitch resignation was voluntary.while a constitutional claim for constructive discharge might not track the standards used to decide title vii cases,we think it likely that actions that did not amount to a constructive discharge under title vii would not violate an employee constitutional protections.
veitch constructive discharge claim rests on four elements.the first,and by far the most important according to appellant,is the zoeller report.veitch focuses so heavily on the report because it is the only document in this case that both defines the doctrine of pluralism and acknowledges that the navy chaplain corps requires its chaplains to preach pluralistically.according to veitch,the zoeller report unconstitutional conclusions made his resignation the product of duress,which fact thus vitiates the voluntariness of his choice and entitles him to reinstatement.there are longstanding precedents in the federal circuit holding that resignations produced by unlawful government duress or coercion are invalid.see,carmichael united states.the test for duress is objective,and has three parts under a reasonable person standard,veitch must show he involuntarily accepted the terms of the government circumstances permitted no other alternative said circumstances were the result of the government coercive acts.id.veitch difficulty is that the zoeller report in no sense punished or threatened him it simply rejected his eo complaint against buchmiller.that zoeller nonbinding legal conclusions were not coercive acts seems obvious.
veitch argument seems to be that if the navy actions against,the dismissal of his eo unlawful,then they were per se coercive,whether or not those actions would actually force a reasonable person in veitch position to resign.for this extraordinary proposition,veitch relies on one court of claims case,roskos united states,in which the court said,an action is not voluntary if it is produced by government action which is wrongful.id.at emphasis added.but in that case,the illegal act was the unauthorized transfer of the plaintiff to another city,which the court described as one that left the employee with no practicable alternative but to resign.thus,roskos,far from announcing a new standard for challenges to government action,is entirely consistent with the federal circuit tripartite duress test.the roskos court simply found that circumstances permitted no other alternative.carmichael,at.it can hardly be claimed that the zoeller report left veitch with no practical alternative but resignation.indeed,veitch could have appealed the results of zoeller investigation,but chose not to do so.veitch thus had a reasonable alternative to resignation that negates the second duress requirement.see kim united states.
the second and third elements in veitch constructive discharge claim relate to the charges brought against him.it will be recalled that he was charged,inter alia,with disrespect to a superior officer under article of the ucmj.here veitch raises a rather subtle argument,relying on a district court opinion in our circuit,rigdon perry,for the proposition that military chaplains can not be superior commissioned officers as that term is used in,and so the article charge against him was improper.but rigdon did not deal with actions alleged to be disrespectful to a superior officer,and whether or not it is a sound interpretation of the ucmj,nothing prevented veitch from contesting his on that or any other ground.
a serviceman or woman has a congressionally enacted process of military appeals by which to contest allegedly unlawful charges.and this process,notably,does not include immediate resort to the federal courts.for instance,after a conviction,the accused has right to review of his or her sentence by the convening authority,and,following that,by the navy judge advocate general.see generally.in certain those involving sentences of dismissal or serviceman or woman has a right of appeal to the united states corps court of criminal appeals,and,by petition,to the united states court of appeals for the armed forces id.congress thus carefully designed a scheme of military appeals to prevent needless federal court review of military affairs.by resigning in the face of his charges,however,veitch neglected to exhaust his military court remedies.see parisi davidson,d recognizing the exhaustion requirement applied to when the accused could gain complete relief before such tribunals.veitch can not now escape the consequences of that decision by characterizing the charges themselves as evidence of coercion.successfully contesting the would have provided veitch full relief from the allegedly unlawful charge under article,and when full relief is available from a,civilian courts should require resort to that tribunal in the first instance.
veitch also claims that his appointed counsel led him astray by not telling him about rigdon and the possible defense to the that case provided.he relies chiefly on tippett united states,in which our neighbor court held that an army captain discharge was not voluntary if based on his army lawyer misrepresentation of his legal rights,id.at.veitch never fully develops his assertion that his navy lawyer failure to bring rigdon to his attention was a causal factor in his decision to resign.in tippett,it was essentially uncontested that the plaintiff had based his decision to resign on his military lawyer advice as to the effect his resignation would have on his subsequent intent to apply for a reserve commission.on the record before us,there is nothing to support a conclusion that veitch resigned because of his lawyer failure to discover favorable legal precedent,which,in this case,amounted to a single district court decision that is not binding precedent for any other court.such a conclusion is further undercut by the fact that veitch navy lawyer had the case for two days prior to veitch resignation.moreover,veitch was charged not only with an article offense,but also with an article violation failure to appear at an appointed place of duty and rigdon,even if correctly decided which we doubt,has no bearing on that charge.
finally,veitch asserts,relying on an analogy with title vii cases holding that a hostile work environment can be the cause of a constructive discharge,that he faced just such a hostile environment at nsa naples.as already noted,we assume,arguendo,that veitch may raise a constructive discharge claim directly under the constitution,but whether or not that is so,such a claim could not require less of a showing than would qualify under title vii itself.the district court concluded that veitch had not presented a triable issue of fact on the question of intolerable work conditions.on appeal,veitch argues that the district court ignored evidence of a hostile work environment and failed to give veitch the inferences to which he is entitled as the nonmoving party on a motion for summary judgment.we are by no means convinced that the district court erred in its evaluation of the evidence however,we do not believe it necessary to resolve these questions because,viewing the record in the light most favorable to veitch,his claims fail to make out a hostile work environment as a matter of law.
we have held that a plaintiff bringing an employment discrimination claim under title vii on the theory of constructive discharge must show that the employer deliberately created intolerable work conditions that forced the plaintiff to quit.clark marsh.the inquiry is objective did working conditions become so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee position would have felt compelled to resign suders,at.citing geoffrey weirich et,cumulative supplement to lindemann grossman.we have stated before that the mere existence of workplace discrimination is insufficient to make out a constructive discharge claim c onstructive discharge requires a finding of discrimination and the existence of certain aggravating factors.mungin katten muchin zavis,quoting clark,at emphasis added.aggravating factors are those aspects of a discriminatory work environment that,by making the workplace so disagreeable,prevent the reasonable employee from seeking remediation on the job.id
