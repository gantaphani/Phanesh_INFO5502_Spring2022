this case requires us to address the difficult balance the state secrets doctrine strikes between fundamental principles of our liberty,including justice,transparency,accountability and national security.although as judges we strive to honor all of these principles,there are times when exceptional circumstances create an irreconcilable conflict between them.on those rare occasions,we are bound to follow the supreme court admonition that even the most compelling necessity can not overcome the claim of privilege if the court is ultimately satisfied that state secrets are at stake.united states reynolds.after much deliberation,we reluctantly conclude this is such a case,and the plaintiffs action must be dismissed.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
we begin with the factual and procedural history relevant to this appeal.in doing so,we largely draw upon the panel language in mohamed jeppesen dataplan,cir.jeppesen i,rehearing en banc granted,cir.we emphasize that this factual background is based only on the allegations of plaintiffs complaint,which at this stage in the litigation we construe in the light most favorable to the plaintiff s,taking all their allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences from the complaint in their favor.doe united states,cir.whether plaintiffs allegations are in fact true has not been decided in this litigation,and,given the sensitive nature of the allegations,nothing we say in this opinion should be understood otherwise.
factual background 
the extraordinary rendition program 
plaintiffs allege that the central intelligence agency cia,working in concert with other government agencies and officials of foreign governments,operated an extraordinary rendition program to gather intelligence by apprehending foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorist activities and transferring them in secret to foreign countries for detention and interrogation by united states or foreign officials.according to plaintiffs,this program has allowed agents of the government to employ interrogation methods that would otherwise have been prohibited under federal or international law.relying on documents in the public domain,plaintiffs,all foreign nationals,claim they were each processed through the extraordinary rendition program.they also make the following individual allegations.
plaintiff ahmed agiza,an egyptian national who had been seeking asylum in sweden,was captured by swedish authorities,allegedly transferred to american custody and flown to egypt.in egypt,he claims he was held for five weeks in a squalid,windowless,and frigid cell,where he was severely and repeatedly beaten and subjected to electric shock through electrodes attached to his ear lobes,nipples and genitals.agiza was held in detention for two and a half years,after which he was given a trial before a military court,convicted and sentenced to years in egyptian prison.according to plaintiffs,v irtually every aspect of agiza rendition,including his torture in egypt,has been publicly acknowledged by the swedish government.
plaintiff abou elkassim britel,a italian citizen of moroccan origin,was arrested and detained in pakistan on immigration charges.after several months in pakistani detention,britel was allegedly transferred to the custody of american officials.these officials dressed britel in a diaper and a torn and shackled and blindfolded him for a flight to morocco.once in morocco,he says he was detained incommunicado by moroccan security services at the temara prison,where he was beaten,deprived of sleep and food and threatened with sexual torture,including sodomy with a bottle and castration.after being released and,britel says he was coerced into signing a false confession,convicted of charges and sentenced to years in a moroccan prison.
plaintiff binyam mohamed,a ethiopian citizen and legal resident of the united kingdom,was arrested in pakistan on immigration charges.mohamed was allegedly flown to morocco under conditions similar to those described above,where he claims he was transferred to the custody of moroccan security agents.these moroccan authorities allegedly subjected mohamed to severe physical and psychological torture,including routinely beating him and breaking his bones.he says they cut him with a scalpel all over his body,including on his penis,and poured hot stinging liquid into the open wounds.he was blindfolded and handcuffed while being made to listen to extremely loud music day and night.after months in moroccan custody,mohamed was allegedly transferred back to american custody and flown to afghanistan.he claims he was detained there in a cia dark prison where he was kept in near permanent darkness and subjected to loud noise,such as the recorded screams of women and children,hours a day.mohamed was fed spar ingly and irregularly and in four months he lost between and pounds.eventually,mohamed was transferred to the military prison at guantanamo bay,cuba,where he remained for nearly five years.he was released and returned to the united kingdom during the pendency of this appeal 
plaintiff bisher,a iraqi citizen and legal resident of the united kingdom,was arrested in gambia while traveling on legitimate business.like the other plaintiffs,claims he was put in a diaper and shackles and placed on an airplane,where he was flown to afghanistan.he says he was detained in the same dark prison as mohamed and loud noises were played hours per day to deprive him of sleep.alleges he was eventually transferred to bagram air base,where he was subjected to humiliation,degradation,and physical and psychological torture by officials,including being beaten,deprived of sleep and threatened with death.was eventually transferred to guantanamo in preparation for the flight,he says he was shackled and handcuffed in excruciating pain as a result of his beatings.was eventually released from guantanamo and returned to the united kingdom.
plaintiff farag ahmad bashmilah,a yemeni citizen,says he was apprehended by agents of the jordanian government while he was visiting jordan to assist his ailing mother.after a brief detention during which he was subject ed to severe physical and psychological abuse,bashmilah claims he was given over to agents of the government,who flew him to afghanistan in similar fashion as the other plaintiffs.once in afghanistan,bashmilah says he was placed in solitary confinement,in darkness,where he was deprived of sleep and shackled in painful positions.he was subsequently moved to another cell where he was subjected to light and loud noise.depressed by his conditions,bashmilah attempted suicide three times.later,bashmilah claims he was transferred by airplane to an unknown cia black site prison,where he suffered sensory manipulation through constant exposure to white noise,alternating with deafeningly loud music and light.bashmilah alleges he was transferred once more to yemen,where he was tried and convicted of a trivial crime,sentenced to time served abroad and released.
jeppesen alleged involvement in the rendition program 
plaintiffs contend that publicly available information establishes that defendant jeppesen dataplan,a corporation,provided flight planning and logistical support services to the aircraft and crew on all of the flights transporting each of the five plaintiffs among the various locations where they were detained and allegedly subjected to torture.the complaint asserts jeppesen played an integral role in the forced abductions and detentions and provided direct and substantial services to the united states for its extraordinary rendition program,thereby enabling the clandestine and forcible transportation of terrorism suspects to secret overseas detention facilities.it also alleges that jeppesen provided this assistance with actual or constructive knowledge of the objectives of the rendition program,including knowledge that the plaintiffs would be subjected to forced disappearance,detention,and torture by and foreign government officials 
summary of the claims 
plaintiffs brought suit against jeppesen under the alien tort statute,alleging seven theories of liability marshaled under two claims,one for forced disappearance and another for torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment.first am.compl.
with respect to the forced disappearance claim,plaintiffs assert four theories of liability direct liability for active participation,conspiracy with agents of the united states,aiding and abetting agents of the united states and direct liability because jeppesen demonstrated a reckless disregard as to whether plaintiffs would be subjected to forced disappearance through its participation in the extraordinary rendition program and specifically its provision of flight and logistical support services to aircraft and crew that it knew or reasonably should have known would be used to transport them to secret detention and interrogation.id.
on the torture and degrading treatment claim,plaintiffs assert three theories of liability conspiracy with agents of the in plaintiffs torture and degrading treatment,aiding and abetting agents of the in subjecting plaintiffs to torture and degrading treatment and direct liability because jeppesen demonstrated a reckless disregard as to whether plaintiffs would be subjected to torture or other cruel,inhuman,or degrading treatment by providing flight and logistical support to aircraft and crew it knew or reasonably should have known would be used in the extraordinary rendition program to transport them to detention and interrogation.id.
regarding jeppesen alleged actual or constructive knowledge that its services were being used to facilitate forced disappearance,plaintiffs allege that jeppesen knew or reasonably should have known that the flights involved the transportation of terror suspects pursuant to the extraordinary rendition program,that their knowledge of the objectives of the rendition program may be inferred from the fact that they allegedly falsified flight plans submitted to european air traffic control authorities to avoid public scrutiny of cia flights and that a jeppesen employee admitted actual knowledge that the company was performing extraordinary rendition flights for the government.id.similarly,plaintiffs allege that jeppesen knew or should have known that that torture would result because it should have known it was carrying terror suspects for the cia and that the governments of the destination countries routinely subject detainees to torture and other forms of cruel,inhuman,or degrading treatment.id.they also rely on state department country reports describing torture as routine in some of the countries to which plaintiffs were allegedly rendered,and note that jeppesen claims on its website that it monitors political and security situations as part of its trip planning services.id.
procedural history 
before jeppesen answered the complaint,the united states moved to intervene and to dismiss plaintiffs complaint under the state secrets doctrine.the of the cia,general michael hayden,filed two declarations in support of the motion to dismiss,one classified,the other redacted and unclassified.the public declaration states that d isclosure of the information covered by this privilege assertion reasonably could be expected to cause in some instances,exceptionally to the national security of the united states and,therefore,the information should be excluded from any use in this case.it further asserts that because highly classified information is central to the allegations and issues in this case,the risk is great that further litigation will lead to disclosures harmful to national security and,accordingly,this case should be dismissed.
the district court granted the motions to intervene and dis miss and entered judgment in favor of jeppesen,stating that at the core of plaintiffs case against defendant jeppesen are allegations of covert military or cia operations in foreign countries against foreign a subject matter which is a state secret.plaintiffs appealed.a panel of this court reversed and remanded,holding that the government had failed to establish a basis for dismissal under the state secrets doctrine but permitting the government to reassert the doctrine at subsequent stages of the litigation.jeppesen i,at.we took the case en banc to resolve questions of exceptional importance regarding the scope and application of the state secrets doctrine.see fed.a.
the government maintains its assertion of privilege on appeal,continuing to rely on general hayden two declarations.while the appeal was pending barack obama succeeded george bush as president of the united states.on september,the obama administration announced new policies for invoking the state secrets privilege,effective october,in a memorandum from the attorney general.see memorandum from the attorney to the heads of executive dep ts and agencies on policies and procedures governing invocation of the state secrets privilege,holder memo.the government certified both in its briefs and at oral argument before the en banc court that officials at the highest levels of the department of justice of the new administration had reviewed the assertion of privilege in this case and determined that it was appropriate under the newly announced policies.see redacted,unclassified br.for on reh g en banc br.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the interpretation and application of the state secrets doctrine and review for clear error the district court underlying factual findings.islamic,bush,cir.
iii.the state s ecrets doctrine 
the supreme court has long recognized that in exceptional circumstances courts must act in the interest of the country national security to prevent disclosure of state secrets,even to the point of dismissing a case entirely.see totten united states.the contemporary state secrets doctrine encompasses two applications of this principle.one completely bars adjudication of claims premised on state secrets the totten bar the other is an evidentiary privilege the reynolds privilege that excludes privileged evidence from the case and may result in dismissal of the claims see united states reynolds.we first address the nature of these applications and then apply them to the facts of this case.
a.the totten bar 
in the supreme court stated as a general principle that public policy forbids the maintenance of any suit in a court of justice,the trial of which would inevitably lead to the disclosure of matters which the law itself regards as confidential.totten,at emphasis added.the court again invoked the principle in,citing totten for the proposition that where the very subject matter of the action is a matter of state secret,an action may be dismissed on the pleadings without ever reaching the question of evidence because it is so obvious that the action should never prevail over the privilege.reynolds,at.this application of totten general we refer to as the totten designed not merely to defeat the asserted claims,but to preclude judicial inquiry entirely.tenet doe,d.
the court first applied this bar in totten itself,where the estate of a civil war spy sued the united states for breaching an alleged agreement to compensate the spy for his wartime espionage services.setting forth the general principle quoted above,the court held that the action was barred because it was premised on the existence of a contract for secret services with the government,which was a fact not to be disclosed.totten,at.
a century later,the court applied the totten bar in weinberger catholic action of education project.there,the plaintiffs sued under the national environmental policy act of,et,to compel the navy to prepare an environmental impact statement regarding a military facility where the navy allegedly proposed to store nuclear weapons.the court held that the allegations were beyond judicial scrutiny because,d ue to national security reasons,the navy can neither admit nor deny that it proposes to store nuclear weapons at the facility.id.citing totten,at.
the court more recently reaffirmed and explained the totten bar in a case involving two former cold war spies who accused the cia of reneging on a commitment to provide financial support in exchange for their espionage services.relying on totten core concern of preventing the existence of the plaintiffs relationship with the government from being revealed,the court held that the action was,like totten and weinberger,incapable of judicial review.tenet,at 
plaintiffs contend that the totten bar applies only to a narrow category of cases they say are not implicated here,namely claims premised on a plaintiff espionage relationship with the government.we disagree.we read the court discussion of totten in reynolds to mean that the totten bar applies to cases in which the very subject matter of the action is a matter of state secret.reynolds,at.a contract to perform espionage is only an example.id.this conclusion is confirmed by weinberger,which relied on the totten bar to hold that a case involving nuclear weapons secrets,and having nothing to do with espionage contracts,was beyond judicial scrutiny.see weinberger,at see also tenet,at characterizing weinberger as a case applying the totten bar.thus,although the claims in both totten and tenet were premised on the existence of espionage agreements,and even though the plaintiffs in both totten and tenet were themselves parties to the espionage agreements,the totten bar rests on a general principle that extends beyond that specific context.we therefore reject plaintiffs unduly narrow view of the totten bar and reaffirm our holding in that the bar has evolved into the principle that where the very subject matter of a lawsuit is a matter of state secret,the action must be dismissed without reaching the question of evidence,at.as we explain below,the totten bar is a narrow rule,but it is not as narrow as plaintiffs contend.
we also disagree with plaintiffs related contention that the totten bar can not apply unless the plaintiff is a party to a secret agreement with the government.the environmental groups and individuals who were the plaintiffs in weinberger were not parties to agreements with the united states,secret or otherwise.the purpose of the bar,moreover,is to prevent the revelation of state secrets harmful to national security,a concern no less pressing when the plaintiffs are strangers to the espionage agreement that their litigation threatens to reveal.thus,even if plaintiffs were correct that the totten bar is limited to cases premised on espionage agreements with the government,we would reject their contention that the bar is necessarily limited to cases in which the plaintiffs are themselves parties to those agreements.
b.the reynolds privilege 
in addition to the totten bar,the state secrets doctrine encompasses a privilege against revealing military or state secrets,a privilege which is well established in the law of evidence.reynolds,at a successful assertion of privilege under reynolds will remove the privileged evidence from the litigation.unlike the totten bar,a valid claim of privilege under reynolds does not automatically require dismissal of the case.in some instances,however,the assertion of privilege will require dismissal because it will become apparent during the reynolds analysis that the case can not proceed without privileged evidence,or that litigating the case to a judgment on the merits would present an unacceptable risk of disclosing state secrets.
reynolds involved a military aircraft carrying secret electronic equipment.id.at.after the plane crashed,the estates of three civilian observers killed in the accident brought tort claims against the government.in discovery,plaintiffs sought production of the air force official accident investigation report and the statements of three surviving crew members.the air force refused to produce the materials,citing the need to protect national security and military secrets.id.at.the district court ordered the government to produce the documents in camera so the court could determine whether they contained privileged material.when the government refused,the court sanctioned the government by establishing the facts on the issue of negligence in plaintiffs favor.id.at.
the supreme court reversed and sustained the government claim of privilege because there was a reasonable danger that the accident investigation report would contain references to the secret electronic equipment which was the primary concern of the mission.id.at.the court also provided guidance on how claims of privilege should be analyzed and held that,under the circumstances,the district court should have sustained the privilege without even requiring the government to produce the report for in camera review.id.at.the court did not,however,dismiss the case outright.rather,given that the secret electronic equipment was unrelated to the cause of the accident,it remanded to the district court,affording plaintiffs the opportunity to try to establish their claims without the privileged accident report and witness statements.id.at.
analyzing claims under the reynolds privilege involves three steps 
first,we must ascertain that the procedural requirements for invoking the state secrets privilege have been satisfied.second,we must make an independent determination whether the information is privileged finally,the ultimate question to be resolved is how the matter should proceed in light of the successful privilege claim.
at citation omitted quoting united states,cir.we discuss these steps in turn.
procedural requirements 
assertion of the privilege.the privilege belongs to the government and must be asserted by it it can neither be claimed nor waived by a private party.reynolds,at footnotes omitted.the privilege is not to be lightly invoked.id.this is especially true when,as in this case,the government seeks not merely to preclude the production of particular items of evidence as in reynolds but to obtain dismissal of the entire action.
to ensure that the privilege is invoked no more often or extensively than necessary,reynolds held that t here must be a formal claim of privilege,lodged by the head of the department which has control over the matter,after actual personal consideration by that officer.id.at footnote omitted.this certification is fundamental to the government claim of privilege.as we have observed in a different context,the decision to invoke the privilege must be a serious,considered judgment,not simply an administrative formality.united states grace,cir.en banc.the formal claim must reflect the certifying official personal judgment responsibility for this task may not be delegated to officials.the claim also must be presented in sufficient detail for the court to make an independent determination of the validity of the claim of privilege and the scope of the evidence subject to the privilege.
in the present case,general michael hayden,of the cia,asserted the initial,formal claim of privilege and submitted detailed public and classified declarations.we were informed at oral argument that the current attorney general,eric holder,has also reviewed and approved the ongoing claim of privilege.although reynolds does not require review and approval by the attorney general when a different agency head has control of the matter,such additional review by the executive branch chief lawyer is appropriate and to be encouraged.
timing.plaintiffs contend that the government assertion of privilege was premature,urging that the reynolds privilege can not be raised before an obligation to produce specific evidence subject to a claim of privilege has actually arisen.we disagree.the privilege may be asserted at any time,even at the pleading stage.
the privilege indisputably may be raised with respect to discovery requests seeking information the government contends is privileged.courts have repeatedly sustained claims of privilege under those circumstances.see,reynolds,at document production requests kasza browner,cir various discovery requests halkin helms.interrogatories,document production requests and oral depositions.in addition,the government may raise the privilege to prevent the disclosure of privileged information in a responsive pleading,as it did in ellsberg mitchell,and black united states,cir.see huey honeywell,cir explaining that the contents of an answer may be evidentiary lockwood wolf,cir holding that admis sions in opposing parties pleadings are admissible as evidence.
we also conclude that the government may assert a reynolds privilege claim prospectively,even at the pleading stage,rather than waiting for an evidentiary dispute to arise during discovery or trial.see,at d ismissal at the pleading stage is appropriate if state secrets are so central to a proceeding that it can not be litigated without threatening their disclosure.black,at dismissing the action at the pleading stage based on the government assertion of privilege over certain categories of information concerning intelligence operations farnsworth cannon,grimes,cir en banc per curiam see also,at recognizing that reynolds may result in dis missal even without await ing preliminary discovery.in some cases,the court may be able to determine with certainty from the nature of the allegations and the government declarations in support of its claim of secrecy that litigation must be limited or cut off in order to protect state secrets,even before any discovery or evidentiary requests have been made.in such cases,waiting for specific evidentiary disputes to arise would be both unnecessary and potentially dangerous.see sterling tenet,cir courts are not required to play with fire and chance further disclosure inadvertent,mistaken,or even would defeat the very purpose for which the privilege exists.the showing the government must make to prevail on a claim of state secrets privilege may be especially difficult when attempted before any request for specific information or evidence has actually been made,but foreclosing the government from even trying to make that showing would be inconsistent with the need to protect state secrets.
the court independent evaluation of the claim of privilege 
when the privilege has been properly invoked,we must make an independent determination whether the information is privileged,at.the court must sustain a claim of privilege when it is satisfied,from all the circumstances of the case,that there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose matters which,in the interest of national security,should not be divulged.reynolds,at.if this standard is met,the evidence is absolutely privileged,irrespective of the plaintiffs countervailing need for it.see id.at e ven the most compelling necessity can not overcome the claim of privilege if the court is ultimately satisfied that state secrets are at stake.halkin,at.
this step in the reynolds analysis places on the court a special burden to assure itself that an appropriate balance is struck between protecting national security matters and preserving an open court system,at.in evaluating the need for secrecy,we acknowledge the need to defer to the executive on matters of foreign policy and national security and surely can not legitimately find ourselves second guessing the executive in this arena.id.but the state secrets doctrine does not represent a surrender of judicial control over access to the courts,at.rather,to ensure that the state secrets privilege is asserted no more frequently and sweepingly than necessary,it is essential that the courts continue critically to examine instances of its invocation.ellsberg,at.we take very seriously our obligation to review the government claims with a very careful,indeed a skeptical,eye,and not to accept at face value the government claim or justification of privilege,at,though we must do so without forcing a disclosure of the very thing the privilege is designed to protect too much judicial inquiry into the claim of privilege would force disclosure of the thing the privilege was meant to protect,while a complete abandonment of judicial control would lead to intolerable abuses.reynolds,at.
we do not offer a detailed definition of what constitutes a state secret.the supreme court in reynolds found it sufficient to say that the privilege covers matters which,in the interest of national security,should not be divulged.id.at.we do note,however,that an executive decision to classify information is insufficient to establish that the information is privileged.see ellsberg,at t he privilege may not be used to shield any material not strictly necessary to prevent injury to national security.although classification may be an indication of the need for secrecy,treating it as conclusive would trivialize the court role,which the supreme court has clearly admonished can not be abdicated to the caprice of executive officers.reynolds,at.
how should the matter proceed 
when a court sustains a claim of privilege,it must then resolve how the matter should proceed in light of the suc cessful privilege claim,at quoting,at.the court must assess whether it is feasible for the litigation to proceed without the protected evidence and,if so,how.
when the government successfully invokes the state secrets privilege,the evidence is completely removed from the case.kasza,at.w henever possible,sensitive information must be disentangled from nonsensitive information to allow for the release of the latter.id.quoting ellsberg,at.however,there will be occasions when,as a practical matter,secret and nonsecret information can not be separated.in some cases,therefore,it is appropriate that the courts restrict the parties access not only to evidence which itself risks the disclosure of a state secret,but also those pieces of evidence or areas of question ing which press so closely upon highly sensitive material that they create a high risk of inadvertent or indirect disclosures.bareford dynamics,cir see also kasza,at i f seemingly innocuous information is part of a mosaic,the state secrets privilege may be invoked to bar its disclosure and the court can not order the government to disentangle this information from other,secret information.
ordinarily,simply excluding or otherwise walling off the privileged information may suffice to protect the state secrets and the case will proceed accordingly,with no consequences save those resulting from the loss of evidence,at quoting ellsberg,at see,webster doe,d permitting case to continue without privileged evidence reynolds,at same.
in some instances,however,application of the privilege may require dismissal of the action.when this point is reached,the reynolds privilege converges with the totten bar,because both require dismissal.there are three circumstances when the reynolds privilege would justify terminating a case.
first,if the plaintiff can not prove the prima facie elements of her claim with nonprivileged evidence,then the court may dismiss her claim as it would with any plaintiff who can not prove her case.kasza,at see also ellsberg,at.second,if the privilege deprives the defendant of information that would otherwise give the defendant a valid defense to the claim,then the court may grant summary judgment to the defendant.kasza,at quoting bareford,at accord in re sealed case,see also,tenenbaum simonini,cir.
third,and relevant here,even if the claims and defenses might theoretically be established without relying on privileged evidence,it may be impossible to proceed with the litigation evidence being inseparable from nonprivileged information that will be necessary to the claims or the case to a judgment on the merits would present an unacceptable risk of disclosing state secrets.see,in re sealed case,at if the district court determines that the subject matter of a case is so sensitive that there is no way it can be litigated without risking national secrets,then the case must be dismissed,at a proceeding in which the state secrets privilege is successfully interposed must be dismissed if the circumstances make clear that privileged information will be so central to the litigation that any attempt to proceed will threaten that information disclosure.bareford,at we are compelled to conclude that the trial of this case would inevitably lead to a significant risk that highly sensitive information concerning this defense system would be disclosed.fitzgerald penthouse int l,cir i n some circumstances sensitive military secrets will be so central to the subject matter of the litigation that any attempt to proceed will threaten disclosure of the privileged matters.farnsworth cannon,at dismissing the action at the outset because any attempt on the part of the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case would so threaten disclosure of state secrets that the overriding interest of the united states and the preservation of its state secrets precludes any further attempt to pursue this litigation id.at phillips,specially concurring and dissenting from the panel decision concluding that litigation should be entirely foreclosed at the outset by dismissal of the action if it appears that the danger of inadvertent compromise of the protected state secrets outweighs the public and private interests in attempting formally to resolve the dispute while honoring the privilege.as we shall explain,this circumstance exists here and requires dismissal.
iv.application 
we therefore turn to the application of the state secrets doctrine in this case.the government contends that plaintiffs lawsuit should be dismissed,whether under the totten bar or the reynolds privilege,because state secrets are so central to this case that permitting further proceeding s would create an intolerable risk of disclosure that would jeopardize national security.br.plaintiffs argue that the totten bar does not apply and that,even if the government is entitled to some protection under the reynolds privilege,at least some claims survive.the district court appears to have dismissed the action under the totten bar,making a threshold determination that the very subject matter of the case is a state secret.having dismissed on that basis,the district court did not address whether application of the reynolds privilege would require dismissal.
we do not find it quite so clear that the very subject matter of this case is a state secret.nonetheless,having conducted our own detailed analysis,we conclude that the district court reached the correct result because dismissal is warranted even under reynolds.recognizing the serious consequences to plaintiffs of dismissal,we explain our ruling so far as possible within the considerable constraints imposed on us by the state secrets doctrine itself.
a.the totten bar 
the categorical,absolute protection the court found necessary in enunciating the totten rule is appropriate only in narrow circumstances.tenet,at.the totten bar applies only when the very subject matter of the action is a state,when it is obvious without conducting 
the detailed analysis required by reynolds that the action c ould never prevail over the privilege.reynolds,at.the court has applied the totten bar on just three occasions,involving two different kinds of state secrets in tenet and totten the court applied the totten bar to the distinct class of cases that depend upon clandestine spy relationships,see tenet,at totten,at,and in weinberger the court applied the totten bar to a case that depended on whether the navy proposed to store nuclear weapons at a particular facility,see weinberger,at.although the court has not limited the totten bar to cases premised on secret espionage agreements or the location of nuclear weapons,neither has it offered much guidance on when the totten bar applies beyond these limited circumstances.because the totten bar is rarely applied and not clearly defined,because it is a doctrine with extremely harsh consequences and because conducting a more detailed analysis will tend to improve the accuracy,transparency and legitimacy of the proceedings,district courts presented with disputes about state secrets should ordinarily undertake a detailed reynolds analysis before deciding whether dismissal on the pleadings is justified.
here,some of plaintiffs claims might well fall within the totten bar.in particular,their allegations that jeppesen conspired with agents of the united states in plaintiffs forced disappearance,torture and degrading treatment are premised on the existence of an alleged covert relationship between jeppesen and the matter that the fourth circuit has concluded is practically indistinguishable from that categorically barred by totten and tenet,at on the other hand,allegations based on plaintiffs theory that jeppesen should be liable simply for what it should have known about the alleged unlawful extraordinary rendition program while participating in it are not so obviously tied to proof of a secret agreement between jeppesen and the government.
we do not resolve the difficult question of precisely which claims may be barred under totten because application of the reynolds privilege leads us to conclude that this litigation can not proceed further.we rely on the reynolds privilege rather than the totten bar for several reasons.first,the government has asserted the reynolds privilege along with the totten bar,inviting the further inquiry reynolds requires and presenting a record that compels dismissal even on this alternate ground.second,we have discretion to affirm on any basis supported by the record.see thigpen roberts,shanks dressel,cir.third,resolving this case under reynolds avoids difficult questions about the precise scope of the totten bar and permits us to conduct a searching judicial review,fulfilling our obligation under reynolds to review the government claim with a very careful,indeed a skeptical,eye,and not to accept at face value the government claim or justification of privilege,at 
b.the reynolds privilege 
there is no dispute that the government has complied with reynolds procedural requirements for invoking the state secrets privilege by filing general hayden formal claim of privilege in his public declaration we therefore focus on the second and third steps in the reynolds analysis first,whether and to what extent the matters the government contends must be kept secret are in fact matters of state secret and second,if they are,whether the action can be litigated without relying on evidence that would necessarily reveal those secrets or press so closely upon them as to create an unjustifiable risk that they would be revealed.in doing so,we explain our decision as much as we can without compromising the secrets we are required to protect.
whether and to what extent the evidence is privileged 
the government asserts the state secrets privilege over four categories of evidence.in particular,the government contends that neither it nor jeppesen should be compelled,through a responsive pleading,discovery responses or otherwise,to disclose information that would tend to confirm or deny whether jeppesen or any other private entity assisted the cia with clandestine intelligence activities information about whether any foreign government cooperated with the cia in clandestine intelligence activities information about the scope or operation of the cia terrorist detention and interrogation program or any other information concerning cia clandestine intelligence operations that would tend to reveal intelligence activities,sources,or methods.br.these indisputably are matters that the state secrets privilege may cover.see,tenet,at emphasizing the absolute protection the state secrets doctrine affords against revealing espionage relationships cia sims,d even a small chance that some court will order disclosure of a source identity could well impair intelligence gathering and cause sources to close up like a clam.in re sealed case,at prohibiting all discussion of intelligence sources,capabilities,and the like,at applying the privilege to the means,sources and methods of intelligence gathering ellsberg,at applying the privilege to the disclosure of methods or capabilities.
we have thoroughly and critically reviewed the government public and classified declarations and are convinced that at least some of the matters it seeks to protect from disclosure in this litigation are valid state secrets,which,in the interest of national security,should not be divulged.reynolds,at.the government classified disclosures to the court are persuasive that compelled or inadvertent disclosure of such information in the course of litigation would seriously harm legitimate national security interests.in fact,every judge who has reviewed the government formal,classified claim of privilege in this case agrees that in this sense the claim of privilege is proper,although we have different views as to the scope of the privilege and its impact on plaintiffs case.the plaintiffs themselves do not dispute that,during the course of litigation,there may well be relevant evidence that may be properly withheld pursuant to the privilege.br.of.see,at affirming the dismissal of a case involving essentially the same types of claims on the basis of the states secrets doctrine.
we are precluded from explaining precisely which matters the privilege covers lest we jeopardize the secrets we are bound to protect.see black,at care in protecting state secrets is necessary not only during a court review of the evidence,but in its subsequent treatment of the question in any holding a properly phrased opinion should not strip the veil from state secrets even if ambiguity results in a loss of focus and clarity.we can say,however,that the secrets fall within one or more of the four categories identified by the government and that we have independently and critically confirmed that their disclosure could be expected to cause significant harm to national security.
effect on the proceedings 
having determined that the privilege applies,we next determine whether the case must be dismissed under the reynolds privilege we have thoroughly considered plaintiffs claims,several possible defenses and the prospective path of this litigation.we also have carefully and skeptically reviewed the government classified submissions,which include supplemental information not presented to the district court.we rely heavily on these submissions,which describe the state secrets implicated here,the harm to national security that the government believes would result from explicit or implicit disclosure and the reasons why,in the government view,further litigation would risk that disclosure.
given plaintiffs extensive submission of public docu ments and the stage of the litigation,we do not rely on the first two circumstances in which the reynolds privilege requires is,whether plaintiffs could prove a prima facie case without privileged evidence,or whether the privilege deprives jeppesen of evidence that would otherwise give it a valid defense to plaintiffs claims.see kasza,at supra part instead,we assume without deciding that plaintiffs prima facie case and jeppesen defenses may not inevitably depend on privileged evidence.proceeding on that assumption,we hold that dismissal is nonetheless required under reynolds because there is no feasible way to litigate jeppesen alleged liability without creating an unjustifiable risk of divulging state secrets.see,at coming to the same conclusion in a related and comparable case,cert.denied,
we reach this conclusion because all seven of plaintiffs claims,even if taken as true,describe jeppesen as providing logistical support in a broad,complex process,certain aspects of which,the government has persuaded us,are absolutely protected by the state secrets privilege.notwithstanding that some information about that process has become public,jeppesen alleged role and its attendant liability can not be isolated from aspects that are secret and protected.because the facts underlying plaintiffs claims are so infused with these secrets,any plausible effort by jeppesen to defend against them would create an unjustifiable risk of revealing state secrets,even if plaintiffs could make a prima facie case on one or more claims with nonprivileged evidence.see kasza,at black,at p roof of the factual allegations in the amended complaint are so tied to the privileged information that further litigation will constitute an undue threat that privileged information will be disclosed.quoting and affirming the district court bareford,at t he danger that witnesses might divulge some privileged material during is great because the privileged and material are inextricably linked.we are compelled to conclude that the trial of this case would inevitably lead to a significant risk that highly sensitive information concerning this defense system would be disclosed.fitzgerald,at in examining witnesses with personal knowledge of relevant military secrets,the parties would have every incentive to probe dangerously close to the state secrets themselves.in these circumstances,state secrets could be compromised even without direct disclosure by a witness.farnsworth cannon,at t he plaintiff and its lawyers would have every incentive to probe as close to the core secrets as the trial judge would permit.such probing in open court would inevitably be revealing.it is evident that any attempt on the part of the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case would so threaten disclosure of state secrets that the overriding interest of the united states and the preservation of its state secrets precludes any further attempt to pursue this litigation.see also in re sealed case,at acknowledging the appropriateness of dismissal when unprivileged and privileged matters are so entwined that the risk of disclosure of privileged material is unacceptably high,although concluding that the case before the court did not fall within that category.
here,further litigation presents an unacceptable risk of disclosure of state secrets no matter what legal or factual theories jeppesen would choose to advance during a defense.whether or not jeppesen provided logistical support in connection with the extraordinary rendition and interrogation programs,there is precious little jeppesen could say about its relevant conduct and knowledge without revealing information about how the united states government does or does not conduct covert operations.our conclusion holds no matter what protective procedures the district court might employ.adversarial litigation,including pretrial discovery of documents and witnesses and the presentation of documents and testimony at trial,is inherently complex and unpredictable.although district courts are well equipped to wall off isolated secrets from dis closure,the challenge is exponentially greater in exceptional cases like this one,where the relevant secrets are difficult or impossible to isolate and even efforts to define a boundary between privileged and unprivileged evidence would risk disclosure by implication.in these rare circumstances,the risk of disclosure that further proceedings would create can not be averted through the use of devices such as protective orders or restrictions on testimony.
dismissal at the pleading stage under reynolds is a drastic result and should not be readily granted.we are not persuaded,however,by the dissent views that the state secrets privilege can never be asserted during the pleading stage to excise entire allegations,or that the government must be required to make its claims of state secrets with regard to specific items of evidence or groups of such items as their use is sought in the lawsuit.dissent.
a case may fall outside the totten bar and yet it may become clear during the reynolds analysis that dismissal is required at the outset.see,at explaining that the totten bar and the reynolds privilege form a continuum of analysis,and that in some cases the suit itself may not be barred because of its subject matter and yet ultimately,the state secrets privilege may nonetheless preclude the case from proceeding to the merits,even without await ing preliminary discovery.here,our detailed reynolds analysis reveals that the claims and possible defenses are so infused with state secrets that the risk of disclosing them is both apparent and inevitable.dismissal under these circumstances,like dismissal under the totten bar,reflects the general principle that public policy forbids the maintenance of any suit in a court of justice,the trial of which would inevitably lead to the disclosure of matters which the law itself regards as confidential,and respecting which it will not allow the confidence to be violated.totten,at.
although we are necessarily precluded from explaining precisely why this case can not be litigated without risking disclosure of state secrets,or the nature of the harm to national security that we are convinced would result from further litigation,we are able to offer a few observations.
first,we recognize that plaintiffs have proffered hundreds of pages of publicly available documents,many catalogued in the dissent appendix,that they say corroborate some of their allegations concerning jeppesen alleged participation in aspects of the extraordinary rendition program.as the government has acknowledged,its claim of privilege does not extend to public documents.accordingly,we do not hold that any of the documents plaintiffs have submitted are subject to the privilege rather,we conclude that even assuming plaintiffs could establish their entire case solely through nonprivileged as that may effort by jeppesen to defend would unjustifiably risk disclosure of state secrets,at concluding that virtually any conceivable response by government defendants to claims based on factual allegations materially identical to this case would disclose privileged information.
second,we do not hold that the existence of the extraordinary rendition program is itself a state secret.the program has been publicly acknowledged by numerous government officials including the president of the united states.even if its mere existence may once have been a matter which,in the interest of national security,should not be divulged,it is not a state secret now.reynolds,at,at concluding i n light of extensive government disclosures that a warrantless wiretapping program was not a matter of state secret.nonetheless,partial disclosure of the existence and even some aspects of the extraordinary rendition program does not preclude other details from remaining state secrets if their disclosure would risk grave harm to national security.see,at concluding that some undisclosed details of the wiretapping program were entitled to protection under the state secrets privilege halkin,at we reject,as we have previously,the theory that because some information about the project ostensibly is now in the public domain,nothing about the project in which the appellants have expressed an interest can properly remain classified or otherwise privileged from disclosure.quoting military audit project casey,see also bareford,at explaining that in some circumstances,disclosure of information by government officials can be prejudicial to government interests,even if the information has already been divulged from sources.
third,we acknowledge the government certification at oral argument that its assertion of the state secrets privilege comports with the revised standards set forth in the current administration september,memorandum,adopted several years after the government first invoked the privilege in this case.those standards require the responsible agency to show that assertion of the privilege is necessary to protect information the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause significant harm to the national defense or foreign relations.holder memo,supra,at.they also mandate that the department of justice will not defend an invocation of the privilege in order to i conceal viola tions of the law,inefficiency,or administrative error ii prevent embarrassment to a person,organization,or agency of the united states government iii restrain competition or iv prevent or delay the release of information the release of which would not reasonably be expected to cause significant harm to national security.id.at.that certification here is consistent with our independent conclusion,having reviewed the government public and classified declarations,that the government is not invoking the privilege to avoid embarrassment or to escape scrutiny of its recent controversial transfer and interrogation policies,rather than to protect legitimate national security concerns.
v.other remedies 
our holding today is not intended to to nonjudicial relief,should it be warranted for any of the plaintiffs.denial of a judicial forum based on the state secrets doctrine poses concerns at both individual and structural levels.for the individual plaintiffs in this action,our decision forecloses at least one set of judicial remedies,and deprives them of the opportunity to prove their alleged mistreatment and obtain damages.at a structural level,terminating the case eliminates further judicial review in this civil litigation,one important check on alleged abuse by government officials and putative contractors.other remedies may partially mitigate these concerns,however,although we recognize each of these options brings with it its own set of concerns and uncertainties.
first,that the judicial branch may have deferred to the executive branch claim of privilege in the interest of national security does not preclude the government from honoring the fundamental principles of justice.the government,having access to the secret information,can determine whether plaintiffs claims have merit and whether misjudgments or mistakes were made that violated plaintiffs human rights.should that be the case,the government may be able to find ways to remedy such alleged harms while still maintaining the secrecy national security demands.for instance,the government made reparations to japanese latin americans abducted from latin america for internment in the united states during world war ii.see mochizuki united states.
second,congress has the authority to investigate alleged wrongdoing and restrain excesses by the executive branch the power of the congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process.watkins united states,accord eastland servicemen fund,d.congress unquestionably has broad authority to investigate,to inform the public,and,ultimately,to legislate against suspected corruption and abuse of power in the executive branch.nixon adm r of,d powell,concurring see also branzburg hayes,d stewart,dissenting we have long recognized the value of the role played by legislative investigations.
third,congress also has the power to enact private bills.see nixon fitzgerald,d burger,concurring for uncompensated injuries congress may in its discretion provide separate nonjudicial remedies such as private bills.plaut spendthrift farm,private bills in congress are still common,and were even more so in the days before establishment of the claims court.office of pers.mgmt.richmond,d congress continues to employ private legislation to provide remedies in individual cases of hardship.because as a general matter the federal courts are better equipped to handle claims,see kosak united states,d stevens,dissenting,congress can refer the case to the court of federal claims to make a recommendation before deciding whether to enact a private bill,see see also banfi prods.united states,although congress alone will make the ultimate decision.when national security interests deny alleged victims of wrongful governmental action meaningful access to a judicial forum,private bills may be an appropriate alternative remedy 
fourth,congress has the authority to enact remedial legislation authorizing appropriate causes of action and procedures to address claims like those presented here.when the state secrets doctrine compels the subordination of appellants interest in the pursuit of their claims to the executive duty to preserve our national security,this means that remedies for violations that can not be proven under existing legal standards,if there are to be such remedies,must be provided by congress.that is where the government power to remedy wrongs is ultimately reposed.halkin helms,at footnote omitted.
vi.conclusion 
we,like the dissent,emphasize that it should be a rare case when the state secrets doctrine leads to dismissal at the outset of a case.nonetheless,there are such just those subject to totten per se rule,but those where the mandate for dismissal is apparent even under the more searching examination required by reynolds.this is one of those rare cases.
for all the reasons the dissent the impact on human rights,the importance of constitutional protections and the constraints of a do not reach our decision lightly or without close and skeptical scrutiny of the record and the government case for secrecy and dismissal.we expect our decision today to inform district courts that totten has its limits,that every effort should be made to parse claims to salvage a case like this using the reynolds approach,that the standards for peremptory dismissal are very high and it is the district court role to use its and other tools to full advantage before it concludes that the rare step of dismissal is justified.we also acknowledge that this case presents a painful conflict between human rights and national security.as judges,we have tried our best to evaluate the competing claims of plaintiffs and the government and resolve that conflict according to the principles governing the state secrets doctrine set forth by the united states supreme court.
for the reasons stated,we hold that the government valid assertion of the state secrets privilege warrants dismissal of the litigation,and affirm the judgment of the district court the government shall bear all parties costs on appeal.
i concur with judge fisher opinion and join fully in his result.i also concur with judge fisher analysis with respect to united states reynolds.i write separately only because i would decide this case under totten united states.
the totten bar requires our courts to dismiss cases where the very subject matter of the action is a matter of state secret.reynolds,at.in this case,every claim in the plaintiffs complaint is based on the allegation that officials of the united states government arrested and detained plaintiffs and subjected them to specific interrogation techniques.those alleged facts,not merely jeppesen role in such activities,are a matter of state secret.
a flawed procedure 
i agree with my colleagues in the majority that united states reynolds,is a rule of evidence,requiring courts to undertake a careful review of evidence that might support a claim or defense to determine whether either could be made without resort to legitimate state secrets.i part company concerning when and where that review should take place.
the majority dismisses the case in its entirety before jeppesen has even filed an answer to plaintiffs complaint.outside of the narrow totten context,the state secrets privilege has never applied to prevent parties from litigating the truth or falsity of allegations,or facts,or information simply because the government regards the truth or falsity of the allegations to be secret.within the reynolds framework,dismissal is justified if and only if specific privileged evidence is itself indispensable to establishing either the truth of the plaintiffs allegations or a valid defense that would otherwise be available to the defendant.see,kasza browner,cir.
this is important,because an approach that focuses on spe cific evidence after issues are joined has the benefit of confining the operation of the state secrets doctrine so that it will sweep no more broadly than clearly necessary.the state secrets doctrine is a judicial construct without foundation in the constitution,yet its application often trumps what we ordinarily consider to be due process of law.this case now presents a classic illustration.plaintiffs have alleged facts,which must be taken as true for purposes of a motion to dismiss,that any reasonable person would agree to be gross violations of the norms of international law,remediable under the alien tort statute.they have alleged in detail jeppesen complicity or recklessness in participating in these violations.the government intervened,and asserted that the suit would endanger state secrets.the majority opinion here accepts that threshold objection by the government,so plaintiffs attempt to prove their case in court is simply cut off.they are not even allowed to attempt to prove their case by the use of nonsecret evidence in their own hands or in the hands of third parties.
it is true that,judicial construct though it is,the state secrets doctrine has become embedded in our controlling decisional law.government claims of state secrets therefore must be entertained by the judiciary.but the doctrine is so dangerous as a means of hiding governmental misbehavior under the guise of national security,and so violative of common rights to due process,that courts should confine its application to the narrowest circumstances that still protect the government essential secrets when,as here,the doctrine is successfully invoked at the threshold of litigation,the claims of secret are necessarily broad and hypothetical.the result is a maximum interference with the due processes of the courts,on the most general claims of state secret privilege.it is far better to require the government to make its claims of state secrets with regard to specific items of evidence or groups of such items as their use is sought in the lawsuit.an official certification that evidence is truly a state secret will be more focused if the head of a department must certify that specific evidence sought in the course of litigation is truly a secret and can not be revealed without danger to overriding,essential government interests.and when responsive pleading is complete and discovery under way,judgments as to whether secret material is essential to plaintiffs case or jeppesen defense can be made more accurately.
by refusing to examine the voluminous public record materials submitted by plaintiffs in support of their claims and by failing to undertake an analysis of jeppesen ability to defend against those claims,the district court forced every judge of the court of appeals to undertake that effort.this was no small undertaking.materials the government considers top secret had to be moved securely back and forth across the country and made available in a cone of silence environment to first the panel assigned the case and then the active judges of this court to evaluate whether the case merited en banc consideration.this quite literally put the cart before the horse,depriving a reviewing court of a record upon which its traditional review function could be carried out this is more than a matter of convenience.making factual determinations is the particular province of trial courts and for sound reason they are good at it.not directing the district court to do that work sends exactly the wrong message in the handling of these critical and sensitive cases.finding remand unnecessary,as the majority does here,op.at,not only rewards district courts for failing to do their job,but ensures that future appeals courts will have to do that job for them 
this is an appeal from a rule dismissal,which means that the district court was required to assume that the allegations of the complaint are true,and that we construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff s.doe united states,cir.the majority minimizes the importance of these requirements by gratuitously attaching allegedly to nearly each sentence describing what plaintiffs say happened to them,and by quickly dismissing the voluminous publicly available evidence supporting those allegations,including that jeppesen knew what was going on when it arranged flights described by one of its own officials as torture flights.instead,the majority assumes that even if plaintiffs prima facie case and jeppesen defense did not depend on privileged evidence,dismissal is required because there is no feasible way to litigate jeppesen alleged liability without creating an unjustifiable risk of divulging state secrets.op.at.but jeppesen has yet to answer or even to otherwise plead,so we have no idea what those defenses or assertions might be.making assumptions about the contours of future litigation involves mere speculation,and doing so flies straight in the face of long standing principles of rule law by extending the inquiry to what might be divulged in future litigation we should have remanded this matter to district court to do the reynolds work that should have been done in the first place.
because of this fundamental defect in the posture of this matter,the remainder of the dissent focuses on the scope of the state secrets privilege rather than its application to speculative facts.
the totten bar 
while it chooses not to apply it,the majority correctly recites the general interpr
