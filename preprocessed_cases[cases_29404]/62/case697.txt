background 
this case has a tortuous history.the opinions of the court of federal claims in this matter provide a full description of that history.richey united states,richey i richey ii.at.we simply summarize here the relevant facts.
richey,a former captain in the regular army,received two adverse oers while in the service.the first oer covered the period from december,through september,oer,during which time richey was a squadron maintenance officer stationed at fort bliss,texas.richey ii.at.one of richey raters,major stephen speakes speakes,stated in the oer that richey was just not the man for the job and it showed.he would be better utilized in a concepts and doctrinal line of work where his intellect could be better utilized.id.at citation omitted.the second oer covered the period from january,through april,oer,during which time richey was serving in southwest asia in operation desert storm.id.at.in the oer,richey was rated below the average of his contemporaries.id.
while still in the service,richey unsuccessfully petitioned the officer special review board osrb for the removal of both oers.id.at.richey alleged that the oer was erroneous due to a hostile relationship between richey and his rater,speakes,and because he was not responsible for the inefficiency and incompetence of the regiment.id.at.with regard to the oer,richey contended that the senior rater had incorrectly evaluated the comparison of richey with other officers of the same grade under army reg.b,because the senior rater had generally rated other officers too high,such that the rated scores did not fall along a bell curve.id.at.the osrb denied richey petitions for removal of the oers.
richey then appealed the osrb denials to the corrections board,which denied relief.id.at.on april,after twice being passed over for promotion to the rank of major by selection boards that considered the adverse oers,richey received an involuntary honorable discharge,pursuant to the army up or out policy.id.at.
richey filed suit in the court of federal claims on july,claiming that the discharge was improper because it was the result of the two allegedly erroneous oers.id.at.while the case was pending,on november,we issued our decision in porter,at.before porter,as discussed in greater detail below,this court precedent required that,in a suit claiming relief on account of wrongful separation or relief from active duty,two elements had to be established in order for the plaintiff to prevail a there was a material legal error or an injustice in the proceedings of the correction board,or other entity within the military department,which led to the adverse action against the plaintiff,and also b that there is an adequate nexus or link between the error or injustice and the adverse action.hary united states,superseded by statute as stated in porter,at see also engels united states,sanders united states,en banc.in porter we held that the enactment of superseded this precedent,insofar as that precedent required proof of lack of causation in all cases.at.we held that under section,once it is determined that the initial promotion board decision involved administrative error,the matter should be referred to a special selection board ssb for a determination of whether to promote the officer based on a military record purged of the error,and that an ssb determination not to promote is dispositive.id.
on for summary judgment on the administrative record,over ten months after our decision in porter,the court of federal claims remanded the case to the corrections board.richey i.at.in its opinion,the court failed to rely on or even cite to our controlling opinion in porter.instead,the court concluded that in order to determine whether richey removal was improper,it was required to apply the test of hary,the decision effectively overruled by section.id.at citing hary,at.the court determined that it could not apply the hary test with regard to the oer,because the board opinion was vague and conclusory.id.at.the court found that the administrative record is deficient in that this court can not properly determine from said record the merits of richey contentions.id.the court,therefore,remanded to the corrections board with instructions to make specific,numbered findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding external circumstances that could have affected richey job performance,the degree to which the rater was biased against richey,and the nexus between the oer and richey.id.at.
the court found that the oer was tainted with error.following hary,the court ordered the corrections board to make findings regarding the nexus between the oer,which we find to be in error,and richey nonpromotion.id.at.the court retained jurisdiction over the case and deferred ruling on the motions for summary judgment until the corrections board factual findings and legal conclusions on remand are presented to this court.id.the court also ordered the government to file with the court every days a status report regarding the proceedings on remand.id.
on remand,after holding an evidentiary hearing,the corrections board determined that the oer was substantially inaccurate because of procedural error on the part of the senior rater in comparing richey with officers of the same grade.richey ii.at.therefore,the corrections board ordered that the oer be corrected to award richey a top block or highest rating for the period.id.at.the corrections board initially determined that the oer was not substantially inaccurate,but the assistant secretary of army review boards the secretary overruled this determination and ordered that the oer be deleted from richey record.id.thus,both oers were determined to be erroneous.however,rather than determining whether there was a nexus between the erroneous oers and richey,the corrections board submitted richey military record to four separate ssbs,pursuant to b,for a decision as to whether richey should be promoted to the rank of major.id.
the first two ssbs considered richey military record with the correction of the oer as ordered by the board,but without the deletion of the oer,and denied richey application for promotion.id.at.the second two ssbs considered richey military record with both the oer deleted and the oer corrected,but also declined to promote richey.id.pursuant to section,the ssbs submitted written reports to the secretary that were signed by each member of the board and certified that t he board,acting under oath and having in view the special fitness of an officer and the efficiency of the army,has carefully considered the record of every officer whose name was furnished to it under section,title.at.
throughout the period of time between the court of federal claims first remand of august,and the decision on appeal of july,the court required the government to file monthly status reports regarding the progress of the remand proceedings.during this period the court remanded the case back to the corrections board an additional three times,on november,february,and june,in order to request certain specific findings which were either not made by the board or not submitted to the court.richey ii.at.on june,the government submitted to the court the ssb decisions denying richey promotion on his corrected military record.the government also filed with the court copies of richey complete military record as it appeared before each of the four ssbs.
on this record,the court of federal claims considered anew the cross motions for judgment on the administrative record.once again,despite our decision in porter,the court stated its conclusion that it was bound to apply the test articulated in hary.id.at.with regard to the oer,the court determined that although the government has not,as per our previous orders,submitted to the court any document clearly indicating what standards the ssbs applied in rendering their decisions,id.at,it would defer to the ssbs ultimate conclusion that richey would still not have been promoted in and absent the erroneous oer.id.at.
with regard to the oer,however,the court came to a different conclusion.the court found that the corrections board had failed to address the second nexus element of hary,as the court had directed in its remand order.the court noted,t his question regarding the nexus between the erroneous and adverse oer and richey nonpromotion the harmless error test was responded to by the corrections board in a conclusory fashion.id.at.because of this omission,the court found,we are unable to properly determine if the clear legal error committed by defendant was harmless error to richey under the hary test enunciated by our first opinion in this case.id.at.the court further found that it could not determine if the decisions of the ssbs were proper,because the text of the four ssbs decisions do es not show what standards they used and how they justified making their determination denying richey application for promotion.id.at.the court stated that the ssbs decisions submitted to us were wholly conclusory and,apparently,a rubber stamping of the board ultimate conclusion to deny richey relief.id.the court expressed doubt that an additional remand would likely generate answers to our questions previously posed to the government.id.at.
therefore,the court decided,we will render a decision herein with what we have before us.id.the court then concluded that because the oer was tainted with legal error and because of the failure of the board to address the nexus question,it would grant richey the following relief 
richey shall be reinstated to his former position of captain in the regular army from the date of this invalid honorable discharge until such time as his record is properly passed upon by a special selection board,or other duly authorized body,with a reasoned and fully expressed decision indicating that his application for promotion or permanent rank was evaluated fairly as required by law.additionally,we order that any subsequent decision by the army regarding any prospective request by richey for promotion is not to be applied retroactively to a date prior to this opinion.
id.the court also awarded richey all attendant back pay and benefits from the date of his discharge to the date of the court opinion,an payment in the amount of,and all additional relief as determined by the secretary of the army and to which plaintiff is entitled.richey united states,judgment.
for the first time the court addressed the conflict between its approach and our decision in porter.the court recognized that o ur ruling here,however,is in some conflict with a portion of the porter decision.id.at.but the court evidently disagreed with porter reading of the statute.after summarizing the holding of porter,the court stated that the rule of porter constituted a position we reject because of the plain language of and the distinguishing facts of this case.id.at.specifically the court took issue with porter holding that ssb decisions relate back to and stand in the place of original promotion board decisions,stating,we do not believe requires a relation back in all instances.id.at.the court attempted to distinguish porter on the grounds that in porter,the court apparently,had a complete record before it,whereas,in contrast,w e have no such decision we have only naked conclusions made by the ssbs involved,stated to us as four,nearly identical,decisions.id.at.the court therefore held that in the present case,the failure of the corrections board to demonstrate harmless error would result in the reinstatement of richey.
the government timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.we review the grant or denial of motions for summary judgment upon the administrative record without deference.info.tech.applications united states.
discussion 
there is no longer any issue here concerning the erroneous nature of the and oers,and there is no question but that these oers were improperly considered by the original selection boards that declined to promote richey.the first question in this case is whether the court of federal claims had authority to require the corrections board to make findings regarding the nexus between richey erroneous oers and richey.we hold that under our decision in porter,it did not.
congress has given the military secretaries the power to correct military records using civilian corrections boards.a.an officer seeking correction of military records may either apply as an initial matter to a corrections board,or file suit under the tucker act in the court of federal claims.heisig united states.if an officer elects to pursue a remedy before the corrections board,after the board renders a final decision,the officer may effectively obtain review of that decision in the court of federal claims by filing suit under the tucker act.sanders,at.typically,if suit is filed just in the court of federal claims,that court will require resort to a corrections board while the matter remains pending in that court.
the tucker act,as amended,gives the court of federal claims the authority to remand appropriate matters to any administrative or executive body or official with such direction as it may deem proper and just.a.but this provision does not give the court of federal claims unlimited authority to require subordinate bodies to conduct investigations and find facts.any remand must be consistent with the statutory scheme under which the agency has taken action.in the present case,the court of federal claims remand to the agency requiring it to make a nexus finding went beyond its authority,because under b,in cases such as this,the corrections board should not make a nexus finding,but rather should refer the officer military record,purged of its errors,to an ssb for a determination of whether the officer should be promoted.
before the enactment of section in,our decisions in sanders,hary,and engels would have supported the action taken by the court of federal claims in this case.in sanders,we held that,where an officer demonstrates that his military record contains defective oers,the ultimate burden is on the government to show that the officer would not have been promoted had his record contained no error.at.in hary,we further refined the test of sanders,holding that in order for a claimant to prevail,it must be shown that 
a there was a material legal error or an injustice in the proceedings of the correction board,or other entity within the military department,which led to the adverse action against him,and also b that there is an adequate nexus or link between the error or injustice and the adverse action.
in porter,however,we held that the enactment of section,at least in large part had overruled those decisions,insofar as they required the government to prove harmless error.at.section b provides 
if the secretary of the military department concerned determines,in the case of a person who was considered for selection for promotion by a promotion board but was not selected,that there was material unfairness with respect to that person,the secretary may convene a special selection board under this subsection to d
