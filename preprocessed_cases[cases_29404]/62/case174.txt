in this case,david browning,a male,claims that the army use of a matrix of criteria to determine which applicant was best qualified for an open position was a pretext designed to mask a discriminatory motive.browning worked in the ammunitions operation division aod at the blue grass army depot bgad in richmond,kentucky as a material handler and forklift.in,the bgad civilian personnel office advertised that an explosives and handler supervisor position was open in the aod.browning and five other individuals applied for this position.smiley courtney,the chief of the aod,prepared a matrix of criteria to determine which applicant was best qualified.after reviewing the applications,courtney ranked browning third.courtney subsequently awarded the position to steven rhodus,a supervisor whom courtney had ranked as the applicant.
claiming that he was discriminated against because of his age,browning filed a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc in march of.the eeoc found that the army had a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for hiring rhodus.browning then filed suit in the district court,alleging age discrimination in violation of the age discrimination in employment act adea.the district court granted summary judgment to the army on all claims.on appeal,browning argues that the district court erred in holding that he had failed to present sufficient evidence to raise a jury question as to whether the army reason for not promoting him was a pretext designed to hide unlawful discrimination.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
william ware,a subject matter expert,initially ranked the applicants for the explosives and handler supervisor position pursuant to bgad policy,and he ranked all of them as highly qualified.courtney received the applications following this initial ranking,but he did not review ware evaluation or ascertain the ages of any of the applicants.
pursuant to a commander directive on selection procedures,courtney was responsible for developing a method to evaluate the applicants qualifications.the directive gave courtney the authority to select the job criteria relevant to the position.he proceeded to develop a rating element criteria matrix based upon the description of the job and his personal knowledge of the job requirements.to create the matrix,courtney reviewed the original job description and developed the following five criteria that he believed were necessary to perform the job,with the five criteria adding up to points supervisory experience worth points,or,experience worth points,or,ammunition experience worth points,or,general supply experience worth points,or,and education worth points,or.under criterion administrative,courtney created five subparts,each worth one point oral and written communication competency,managerial experience,policy implementation competency,decisionmaking competency,and competency.courtney developed the criteria and created the matrix before he received any of the applications.
because courtney had served as a supervisor to all six candidates,he did not conduct interviews for the position and did not review the information in the applicants personnel files.courtney claims that he did not know the respective ages of the applicants or that browning was eligible for early retirement.after reviewing the applications and assigning each applicant a point value based on the matrix that he had created,courtney ranked the six applicants.browning ranked third with points,and rhodus ranked first with points.although courtney acknowledged that browning possessed experience,he awarded browning just one out of five possible points for that criterion,explaining that he awarded points to applicants only if they had outstanding capacity in a particular category.courtney selected rhodus for the position in august of based on rhodus matrix score and his ability to work with upper management.
after learning that rhodus had been selected for the position,browning scheduled a meeting with courtney because browning believed that courtney had discriminated against him on the basis of age.courtney told browning that browning experience and expertise were better utilized in his current position and that rhodus was selected due to his strong administrative skills.browning,however,thought that he was more qualified than rhodus because he had completed coursework in technical ammunition and because he had years of supervisory experience compared with rhodus years.
although the position in question requires administrative experience,browning claims that courtney overvalued the criterion because the job description stated that only of the position was administrative while the matrix valued administrative experience at.following his meeting,browning requested eeoc counseling and later filed a formal complaint with the eeoc.joseph simeone,an eeoc investigator,held a factfinding conference in february of.he ultimately concluded that browning claim of age discrimination had no basis in fact.
browning then requested a hearing before an eeoc administrative law judge alj,who found that the army had a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for hiring rhodus instead of browning.the agency adopted the alj recommendation both initially and after completing its internal appeals procedure.browning sec y of the army,eeoc doc,wl.browning then filed suit in federal court.the district court ultimately granted summary judgment in the army favor.on appeal,browning contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because he had allegedly raised genuine issues of material fact on the issue of pretext and because the army purportedly relied on subjective criteria not listed in the job description.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.minadeo ici paints,cir.summary judgment is proper where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
burden of proof 
the approach articulated in mcdonnell douglas green,d,and further refined in texas department of community affairs burdine,d,applies in the present case because browning presented no direct evidence of discrimination.see bush dictaphone,cir holding that c laims under the adea are typically analyzed within the framework set forth in mcdonnell douglas where the plaintiff presents no direct evidence of discrimination.under this approach,browning must first establish a prima facie case by showing that he was at least years old at the time of the alleged discrimination,he was qualified for the job,he suffered an adverse employment action,and he was replaced by someone substantially younger.id.
the parties do not dispute that browning made out a prima facie case.once browning established his prima facie case,the burden shifted to the army to offer a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.id.again,the parties agree that the army met its burden.as a result,the presumption of discrimination no longer exists,and browning must prove that the reasons offered by the army were in fact pretextual in order to prevail.id.the ultimate burden of persuasion remains with browning at all times.see reeves sanderson plumbing,d although intermediate evidentiary burdens shift back and forth under this framework,the ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact remains at all times with the plaintiff.citation and quotation marks omitted.
