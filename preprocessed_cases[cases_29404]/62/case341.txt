habeas petition presented the question whether he was part of and therefore justifiably detained under the authorization for use of military force,stat.the district court considered the government two factual returns and three traverses,in addition to a substantial record that included intelligence reports,interrogation summaries,expert declarations,and direct and transmitted live from guantanamo.the court found no reliable evidence in the record that petitioner was a member of and ruled that he should be released.obama,mem.op.at,wl.the government brought this appeal and.
the authorization for use of military force empowers the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations,organizations,or persons he determines planned,authorized,committed,or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september,or harbored such organizations or persons,in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the united states by such nations,organizations or persons,a.a ll necessary and appropriate force includes the power to capture and detain those described in the congressional authorization.hamdi rumsfeld.the government may therefore hold at guantanamo and elsewhere those individuals who are part of,the taliban,or associated forces.see awad obama,slip op.at.june,obama.
whether fit that description was and is the ultimate issue.the obvious preliminary question is what sort of factual showing does the government,or the detainee,have to make in this court the question is open.held that the government does not have to prove the legality of detention beyond a reasonable doubt or by clear and convincing evidence.see at see also awad,slip op.at.also decided that the standard is constitutionally permissible.at.but we have yet to decide whether that standard is required.id.at see also awad,slip op.at.
the district judge in this case adopted the preponderance standard.mem.op.at.other district judges in our circuit have done the same.see,awad,slip op.at.their rationale is unstated.after boumediene,the district judges met in executive session and decided to coordinate proceedings in guantanamo habeas cases.see in re guantanamo bay detainee litig,d.on november,the coordinating judge issued a case management order.in re guantanamo bay detainee,misc,wl.the order stated,among other things,that the government should bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the petitioner detention is lawful.order at.in support,the order cited boumediene.but boumediene held only that the extent of the showing required of the government in these cases is a matter to be determined,
boumediene also held that in determining the scope of the writ,the analysis may must begin with precedents as of,for the court has said that at the absolute minimum the clause protects the writ as it existed when the constitution was drafted and ratified.id.at quoting ins cyr.yet we are aware of no precedents in which eighteenth century english courts adopted a preponderance standard.even in later statutory habeas cases in this country,that standard was not the norm.for years,in habeas proceedings contesting orders of deportation,the government had to produce only some evidence to support the order.cyr,at bakhtriger elwood,cir.in such cases courts did not otherwise review factual determinations made by the executive.cyr,at citing ekiu united states.in habeas petitions challenging selective service decisions,the government also had the minimal burden of providing some evidence to support the decision.see eagles ex rel.sanders.habeas petitions contesting courts martial required the government to show only that the military prisoner had received,in the military tribunal,full and fair consideration of the allegations in his habeas petition.see burns wilson.and in response to habeas petitions brought after an individual arrest,the government had to show only that it had probable cause for the arrest.ex parte bollman,cranch.
after oral argument,we ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs discussing what factual showing if any the government must make to justify detaining.the supplemental briefs we received were not exactly illuminating.the government stated that in the circumstances currently presented in this guantanamo habeas litigation,a preponderance standard is appropriate,supp.br.of appellants at,although a different and more deferential standard may be appropriate in other cases or contexts,supp.reply br.of appellants at readily agreed with the government that the preponderance standard should govern his case.supp.br.of appellee at.we are thus left with no adversary presentation on an important question affecting many pending cases in this court and in the district court.although we doubt,for the reasons stated above,that the suspension clause requires the use of the preponderance standard,we will not decide the question in this case.as we did in,we will assume arguendo that the government must show by a preponderance of the evidence that was part of.at.
the district court divided the government evidence into five categories in rough chronological order trip to afghanistan his meetings with bin laden his stay in an guesthouse his military training at al farouq and his other,later activities in afghanistan.mem.op.at.we will generally follow the court organization,but before we get to the specifics we need to mention an error that affects much of the district court evaluation of the evidence.the error stems from the court failure to appreciate conditional probability analysis.united states,denying rehearing.
many mundane mistakes in reasoning can be traced to a shaky grasp of the notion of conditional probability.john allen paulos,innumeracy mathematical illiteracy and its consequences.the key consideration is that although some events are independent coin flips,for example,other events are dependent the occurrence of one of them makes the occurrence of the other more or less likely john allen paulos,beyond numeracy ruminations of a numbers man.paulos gives this example the probability that a person chosen at random from the phone book is over pounds is quite small.however,if it known that the person chosen is over six feet four inches tall,then the conditional probability that he or she also weighs more than pounds is considerably higher.innumeracy.
those who do not take into account conditional probability are prone to making mistakes in judging evidence.they may think that if a particular fact does not itself prove the ultimate proposition,whether the detainee was part of,the fact may be tossed aside and the next fact may be evaluated as if the first did not exist,at.this is precisely how the district court proceeded in this case ties to bin laden can not prove he was part of and this evidence therefore must not distract the court.mem.op.at.the fact that stayed in an guesthouse is not in itself sufficient to justify detention.id.at.attendance at an training camp is not sufficient to carry the government burden of showing that he was a part of.id.at.and so on.the government is right the district court wrongly required each piece of the government evidence to bear weight without regard to all or indeed any other evidence in the case.this was a fundamental mistake that infected the court entire analysis.br.of appellants at.
having tossed aside the government evidence,one piece at a time,the court came to the manifestly that there is no reliable evidence in the record that petitioner was a member of the taliban.mem.op.at.when the evidence is properly considered,it becomes clear that the very likely than not a part of.and that is all the government had to show in order to satisfy the preponderance standard.awad,slip op.at see concrete pipe prods.of,constr.laborers pension trust,citing in re winship,harlan,concurring.
served in the yemeni army for two years and was later employed as a security guard at the yemeni state oil company.in july he took a leave of absence from his job and left his wife and his two children to travel with his sister amani to afghanistan by way of pakistan.amani had entered into an arranged marriage with riyadh abd almujahid,a yemeni citizen then residing in kandahar.
riyadh was affiliated with.he arranged for amani and trip to afghanistan.he helped them obtain passports from the passport agency in their hometown of.he then sent to the yemeni capital city of.was instructed to wear a red jacket and wait outside a specified building for a man he did not know.this man,ali yayha,recognized and gave him two plane tickets and travel money.yayha also arranged for and amani to obtain visas.the government presented evidence that paid for and amani trip.admitted that the sort of arrangements that riyadh made for him and his sister were the same as those used for bringing jihadist recruits to afghanistan and he described how riyadh had obtained travel funds from the saudi who handled the money for in kandahar.that was an recruit is also supported by a witness addressed by the district was a redacted.
riyadh was from mujahidin that is,those who fought against the russians and in the afghan civil war.many mujahidin frequented the guesthouse riyadh operated in kandahar.stayed at riyadh house,located in the same compound.told interrogators that riyadh had achieved a very high status in like,riyadh was described to interrogators as a redacted and admitted that riyadh compound was very close to the compound of mullah omar,the leader of the taliban.
bin laden hosted the celebration of riyadh marriage to sister.bin laden held the celebration at his compound,which described as surrounded by a concrete fence further secured by a large metal gate.inside the compound,a group of armed guards draped in munitions belts,grenades,and kalashnikov rifles welcomed the wedding guests.at the party,bin laden gave a speech congratulating riyadh.and bin laden were introduced and sat next to each other during the meal.
several days later,bin laden summoned for another meeting.according to,at his meeting bin laden asked him about people he was connected with in of whom were involved in jihad.the events following the meeting,including showing up at the training camp,suggest that more transpired in the meeting than what related.in the habeas proceedings,tried to explain his personal audience with bin laden on the basis that meeting with bin laden was common for visitors to kandahar.mem.op.at.this is,as the government points out,utterly implausible.story was contradicted by the undisputed evidence that in usama bin laden,who knew he was a military target of the united states,had gone into hiding under tight security br.of appellants at.
as to the latter point the district court said nothing,despite the principle that false exculpatory statements are strong guilt.see,united states penn,cir united states meyer,cir.the court characterized the rest of the evidence about meetings with bin laden as sensational and compelling but not actual,reliable evidence that would justify detention.mem.op.at.the court statements are incomprehensible.on what possible ground can the court say that the evidence on this subject was,on the one hand,compelling,and yet say,on the other hand,that it was not actual and reliable all that comes to mind is the idea that two personal meetings with bin laden are not enough to prove that an individual is part of.if that is what the court intended,then it was once again engaging in the mistaken reasoning we mentioned in connection with conditional probability analysis.the court rounded off its discussion by characterizing the government presentation as merely indicating that had familial ties to usama bin laden,a statement incorrect as a factual matter family ties were to a top aide of bin laden and one that misses the strong thrust of the evidence.the evidence derived its power not only from family relationships,but also from his meetings with bin laden.that close association made it far more likely that was or became part of the organization.
rather than grasping this essential point,the district court called the evidence regarding the meetings a that should not divert the court from its essential nature of own conduct,upon which this case must turn.mem.op.at.here again the court remarks are perplexing.if meetings with bin laden were not his own conduct,whose conduct were they 
the next event in this narrative greatly strengthened the government case against.not long after his second meeting with bin laden,moved to the al nebras guesthouse.he said he wanted to go there because it was a gathering place for muslims,as if that distinguished it from any other place he stayed during his time in afghanistan.al nebras was not just another gathering place it served as a staging area for recruits en route to the al farouq training camp.was treated like a recruit.staff at the guesthouse instructed him and the other recruits on how to pack and prepare for their training before taking a bus to al farouq.the district court seemed to think that stay at the or two evidence in his favor because it was so brief.but the court failed to take into account that al nebras functioned as a way station.
the district court dealt with this evidence in the following way the guesthouse evidence is not in itself sufficient to justify detention.mem.op.at.note the not in itself.again the court erred.voluntary decision to move to an guesthouse,a staging area for recruits heading for a military training camp,makes it more,very was himself a recruit.there is no other sensible explanation for his actions.this is why we wrote in that an individual attendance at an guesthouse is overwhelming evidence that the individual was part of.at.
left the guesthouse after a few days and,as expected,entered al farouq training camp.by then it was august.at least eight of the september hijackers had trained at al farouq.while was there,he received training in grenades,other weapons,and basic physical fitness,as well as some classroom instruction.his statements to interrogators indicated that he had a deep knowledge of the operation of al farouq.he described camp leaders in a manner that showed he was familiar with them he reported details of the camp training regimen and layout and he identified the types of weapons used for training.he also knew the training routines of other recruits.
the district court seemed to think it important to determine motive for attending the training camp.we do not understand why.whatever his motive,the significant points are that was intent on attacking the united states and its allies,that bin laden had issued a fatwa announcing that every muslim had a duty to kill americans,and that voluntarily affiliated himself with.
according to,he stayed at al farouq for seven to ten days,and then was expelled for smoking tobacco,a violation o
