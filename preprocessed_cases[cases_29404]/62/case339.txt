adham mohammed ali awad,a detainee at guantanamo bay,cuba,appeals from the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.we find no reversible error in the district court finding that awad was part of al qaeda in december of.awad admits that he traveled to afghanistan in for the purpose of engaging in armed conflict against and allied forces.evidence from multiple sources clearly supports the proposition that in december of awad joined a group of al qaeda fighters who had barricaded themselves inside a hospital and that these al qaeda fighters treated awad as one of their own.the correctness of the district court factual findings is further confirmed by the appearance of awad name on several al qaeda documents.we also reject awad challenges to the district court legal holdings as the issues have already been resolved by a prior decision of this court.accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of awad petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
background 
legal framework 
in the wake of the terrorist attacks of september,the congress of the united states passed a joint resolution t hat the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations,organizations,or persons he determines planned,authorized,committed,or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september,or harbored such organizations or persons,in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the united states by such nations,organizations,or persons.authorization for use of military force,stat.aumf.acting under the authority of the aumf,the united states initiated a military campaign in afghanistan against the taliban regime and the al qaeda forces it protected.in pursuit of this campaign and in other parts of the world,still acting under the aumf,the united states has captured and detained members of the enemy force.see hamdi rumsfeld,plurality op.
the united states houses some of the detainees it captures at a secure military base at guantanamo bay,cuba.the proper role of federal courts in evaluating the military detention of individuals held at guantanamo bay has developed over the past decade and has involved all three branches of government.the history of the litigation over the jurisdiction of federal courts to review the united states detention of individuals at guantanamo bay is set forth in boumediene bush,and we need not repeat the history here.boumediene settled the question of our jurisdiction by holding that united states courts do have jurisdiction to entertain petitions for writs of habeas corpus from such prisoners.the present case involves such a petition.
b.the events at mirwais hospital 
on or about december,a small number of injured al qaeda fighters around nine entered the mirwais hospital in afghanistan.these fighters went to the second floor,barricaded themselves inside,and held their position through the display of weapons and the threat of killing everyone in the building.local afghan and allied forces laid siege to the hospital to try and break the al qaeda barricade.this siege was to last for almost two months.during this time,the part of the hospital not under al qaeda control continued to function and treat patients.
only two people left the barricaded area alive.on december redacted,majeed al joudi al joudi,purportedly one of the al qaeda fighters,was tricked into leaving the barricaded area and was captured by afghan forces.his captors quickly turned him over to united states forces.interrogators obtained a number of statements from al joudi during subsequent interrogations.then on december redacted,the al qaeda fighters surrendered a man with an amputated right leg to the afghan forces at the hospital.this man was quickly transferred to control.during subsequent interrogation,the united states was able to identify this man as adham mohammed ali awad awad,a yemeni national who had traveled to afghanistan in,and the petitioner before us.
the siege on the hospital continued for another month.in early january,one of the al qaeda fighters was killed by his own grenade as he attempted to escape from the barricaded area.the standoff finally ended the last week of january,when afghan and allied forces killed the remaining al qaeda fighters and retook the area of the hospital they had held.
c.this litigation 
awad,who has been held at guantanamo bay,cuba,since shortly after his capture in,filed a petition in for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the district of columbia.the district court stayed awad petition during the jurisdictional litigation leading to boumediene.after boumediene established that federal courts have jurisdiction to hear petitions for writs of habeas corpus from detainees at guantanamo bay,the district court lifted the stay of awad case.
the government responded to awad petition and asserted that it had the authority to detain awad under the aumf.as part of its defense of its detention of awad,the government filed a factual return in the district court.
the government introduced into evidence multiple statements from awad interrogations.awad told his interrogators that he was born in in khor maxar,yemen.he traveled to kandahar,afghanistan in.in either november or december of,he was injured in an air raid his injuries were serious enough to require eventual amputation of his right leg.at multiple times,awad told his interrogators that his purpose in traveling to afghanistan was to receive weapons training and to fight and allied forces.see isn knowledgeability brief,he went to afghanistan to become a fighter,isn sir july,i went there to afghanistan for two reasons to visit an islamic nation,and to have weapons training.isn sir july,the purpose of his trip was to relax,gain weapons training and join the fight in afghanistan.
the government also introduced into evidence a list of names known as the tarnak farms document.it is undisputed that tarnak farms was an al qaeda training camp in afghanistan that provided advanced weapons training to militants.when and allied forces captured the facility,they found a undated document.one of the items within the document was a list of names.in the list of names,the name abu waqas was listed twice,with one of the entries being crossed out.the government alleges that abu waqas is awad kunya,his honorific or pseudonym.along with the list of names,this document also contained notes from a weapons course.instructions in small arms such as,sniper rifle,rocket launchers such as,han,notes on aiming and distance calculations.notes on types of ammunition and its specifications.instruction from a course.joint appendix.
the government also introduced several statements of al joudi,the other person captured at mirwais hospital.on december redacted,redacted,al joudi gave his interrogators the names and descriptions of the eight al qaeda fighters he had seen in the mirwais hospital.one of the descriptions was of abu wakaas,a old yemeni male had his right leg amputated.redacted,interrogation report of al joudi.the government alleges that abu wakaas is another transliteration of awad kunya.five of the names provided by al joudi including awad match with names on the list in the tarnak farms document.
to further bolster its case,the government introduced into evidence contemporaneous news reports describing what occurred at the mirwais hospital.several of these news reports provided the general background of the siege at the hospital and the events that occurred within.see thomas ricks and karl vick,reports calm in afghanistan on christmas eve at kandahar hospital,arrest brings gunfire.post,at drew brown,armed patients,not the sick,biggest concern at hospital,miami herald,at.
some of the other news articles directly implicate awad as being part of the al qaeda force at the hospital.one article described how the al qaeda fighters turned over a sick comrade yesterday,saying they could not care for him the fighters surrendered their comrade because they believed his amputated leg had become infected,witnesses said.drew brown,group holed up in hospital the seven wounded fighters threatened to commit suicide.one seriously injured man was,phil,at.the reporter went on to quote an eyewitness to the exchange who described the al qaeda fighters as saying when handing over the man with the amputated leg he is our friend,but we can not take care of him,so we must turn him over to you,regardless of what you do with him.id.another news report quoted a doctor who went in to talk to the people behind the barricade.karl vick,for al qaeda patients,cautious care with grenades strapped to their sides,injured fighters focus wrath on.post,at.the doctor reported that all the people said we have just one way,and that is jihad against america.id.
in support of his petition,awad introduced into evidence an unsigned affidavit,a declaration from his counsel,and additional statements he made to his interrogators.awad argued that he had purposes in going to afghanistan other than to fight and allied forces.he contended that while he traveled to afghanistan to fight,he did not succeed in his goal of joining the fight.he claimed that he was injured by an airstrike while walking through a market in kandahar,not near the kandahar airport as the government maintains.awad asserted that he went to the hospital for care,and in some way ended up behind the barricade.he denied having become part of al qaeda.after making their filings,the parties for judgment on the record.the district court held a hearing on the parties on july.
on august,the district court entered a memorandum order denying awad petition for a writ of habeas corpus.awad obama,d.the district court said that it formally received all the evidence offered by either side but assessed it for consistency,the conditions in which the statements were made and documents found,the personal knowledge of a declarant,and the levels of hearsay.id.at.the district court dealt first with the legal issues in the case.it held that the government had the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence the lawfulness of awad detention.id.at.the court also held that the government authority to continue to detain awad depended on the continuation of hostilities,not on the individual threat posed by awad if he were released.id.at.
the court then proceeded to its factual analysis.the court found that the reason awad went to afghanistan was to join al qaida to fight against the after the september attack on the world trade center.id.with regard to the tarnak farms document,the court rejected awad denial that the name abu waqas referred to him because he had identified himself with such a name previously.id.but the court found the government claim that awad had received training at tarnak farms unsupported because w e do not know the purpose of the list or when it was written.id.at.
the court made a factual finding that awad was injured on november or,and went to the hospital shortly thereafter.id.at.the court then discussed the remaining evidence.id.at.redacted the court concluded,based on all these factual findings,that it appears more likely than not that awad was,for some period of time,part of al qaida.at the very least awad confessed reasons for traveling to afghanistan and the correlation of names on a the sic list and clearly tied to al qaida make it more likely than not that he knew the al qaida fighters at the hospital and joined them in the barricade.id.the district court denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.id.awad appeals from this adverse judgment.
ii.analysis 
awad makes several legal and factual challenges to the district court decision.before considering the legal challenges,we will first address awad challenges to the factual findings of the district court.
evidentiary challenges 
awad makes three types of evidentiary arguments.first,he challenges the district court reliance on certain individual pieces of evidence.second,he defends two of the district court factual findings that were favorable to him.third,he argues that considering all of the evidence before the court,it was clear error to find that he was part of al qaeda through his actions behind the barricade in mirwais hospital.we will consider these challenges in turn.
we review a district court factual findings for clear error,regardless of whether the factual findings were based on live testimony or,as in this case,documentary evidence.see anderson city of bessemer.we further note that t his standard applies to the inferences drawn from findings of fact as well as to the findings themselves.overby ass of letter carriers,quoting halberstam welch,alteration in overby.a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire record is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.boca investerings partnership,quoting united states united states gypsum.but i f the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,the court of appeals may not reverse it where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.overby,at quoting city of bessemer,at omission in overby.
we will begin with awad challenges to the individual items of evidence.in evaluating these challenges,we do not weigh each piece of evidence in isolation,but consider all of the evidence taken as a whole.united states bowie,w e have been mindful of our responsibility to evaluate the impact of the undisclosed evidence not in isolation,but in light of the rest of the trial record.
awad makes a general attack that the district court committed error in relying upon unreliable hearsay evidence.this general attack,however,does not further awad case.we have already held that hearsay evidence is admissible in this type of habeas proceeding if the hearsay is reliable.see albihani obama,t he question a habeas court must ask when presented with hearsay is not whether it is is always what probative weight to ascribe to whatever indicia of reliability it exhibits.the supreme court plurality opinion in hamdi,at,expressly states 
t he exigencies of the circumstances may demand that,aside from these core elements,proceedings may be tailored to alleviate their uncommon potential to burden the executive at a time of ongoing military conflict.hearsay,for example,may need to be accepted as the most reliable available evidence from the government in such a proceeding.
thus,the fact that the district court generally relied on items of evidence that contained hearsay is of no consequence.to show error in the court reliance on hearsay evidence,the habeas petitioner must establish not that it is hearsay,but that it is unreliable hearsay.this awad has not done.
the district court relied upon the tarnak farms document to corroborate the statements of al joudi and redacted awad alleges it was error for the district court to use the tarnak farms document for any purpose,as it had previously refused to rely on the tarnak farms document to show that awad trained at tarnak farms.awad misreads the district court opinion.the district court did not hold that the tarnak farms document was useless or unreliable.the district court only found that the document was not necessarily a list of trainees,so it could not substantiate a finding that awad trained at tarnak farms.d at.but such a finding does not preclude the district court from using the document for other purposes.even though the district judge did not know what the purpose of the list of names was,he knew that it was a list found in an al qaeda document discovered at a terrorist training camp that contained two listings of awad kunya.awad does not challenge the district court factual finding that the references in the document are to him.the district court took the tarnak farms document,considered the circumstances of the document,and weighted it accordingly in its analyses of the various questions with which it was presented.it was not error for the district court to find the document relevant on some issues,but not others.
awad attacks the district court reliance on statements of al joudi.awad asserts that the government assessed al joudi was lying when he denied his own i
