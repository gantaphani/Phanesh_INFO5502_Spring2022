campbell plastics engineering,campbell plastics appeals the decision by the armed services board of contract appeals asbca or board upholding an administrative contracting officer aco demand for title to an invention developed pursuant to a contract between campbell plastics and the army chemical research,development and engineering center army or government.see in re campbell plastics eng g,asbca,wl.because we conclude that campbell plastics failed to comply with the invention disclosure provisions of the contract,we affirm.
on september,campbell plastics named venture plastics,at the time entered into a contract,with the army to develop certain components of an aircrew protective mask,as part of a program for small disadvantaged business concerns pursuant to section a of the small business act,a.see implementing section a programs.
section i of the contract incorporates numerous clauses from the federal acquisition regulations fars,including a patent by the contractor clause from far that requires a contractor to disclose any subject invention developed pursuant to a government contract and sets forth certain substantive requirements for doing so.the clause further provides that the government may obtain title if the contractor fails to disclose the invention within two months from the date upon which the inventor discloses it in writing to contractor personnel responsible for patent matters.section i also incorporates from far a of subject inventions clause which requires the contractor to disclose subject inventions in interim reports furnished every twelve months and final reports furnished within three months after completion of the contracted work.subsection of the contract,titled patent rights reports,requires the contractor to submit all interim and final invention reports required by patent clause in section i on a dd form,report of inventions and subcontracts.
on october,richard campbell,president of campbell plastics,submitted to the army a dd form wherein he expressly stated no inventions.at a conference on november,an army representative told campbell that a dd form was due at least once every twelve months from the date upon which the contract was awarded.shortly thereafter,on december,campbell faxed several handwritten drawings to jeff hofmann,an aco representative.one of the drawings identified a location for a sonic weld or snap fit.campbell submission was the first in a series of progress reports and drawings submitted during campbell plastics work under the contract that referenced sonic welding to varying degrees.
on december,campbell faxed a handwritten letter to hofmann seeking to reopen the question of the sonic welding.the letter included an explanation of the advantages of sonic welding and the assembly concept.on january,campbell provided hofmann with two protective masks that had side ports.in a january monthly progress report,campbell plastics noted,we are also testing sonic welding the kapton film in a housing.this also has to be tested for leakage and tension.on february,campbell faxed hofmann a drawing of a side port having a sonic weld.in a monthly progress report submitted on march,campbell plastics identified the task of t esting of sonic welding the kapton film in a housing,and reported that sonic welding looks viable.campbell plastics further reported that a prototype mold is currently being fabricated to prove out the feasibility of sonic welding the kapton film and maintaining tension.
on march,campbell faxed hofmann a sketch of the side port voicemitter and the following note i am having this sketched up and a simple mold made to test sonic concept.on march and,campbell faxed various diagrams of the lens retaining system and the front voicemitter housing and speaking unit,and indicated that certain joints were to be sonic welded.in monthly progress reports dated april and june,campbell plastics reported on its testing of the use of sonic welding.on july,campbell faxed drawings of the lens retaining system to hoffman and stated specifically that the assembly was sonic welded.on july and august,campbell submitted cost estimates and noted in each that the concept of sonic welding was nearly complete.
on october,joseph stehlik,aco,wrote to campbell to remind him that an interim report of inventions and subcontracts,preferably on a dd form,must be delivered at least every twelve months from the date of the contract,listing the subject inventions during the period and also certifying that the required procedures for identifying and disclosing subject inventions have been disclosed.in the letter,stehlik requested that campbell plastics submit an interim report within ten days.on october,campbell submitted a dd form but did not disclose an invention.
in a monthly progress report dated june,campbell plastics stated,eyelens retaining system,branson satisfied with sonic weld under design restrictions.on september,campbell submitted a dd form that again indicated that no invention had been developed under the contract.campbell plastics did not submit another dd form for the remainder of the contract period,and it received no further request from the army to do so.in monthly progress reports dated october and november,campbell plastics reported continued work on the sonic welding process.
on february and november,campbell faxed hofmann drawings that identified changes in the dimensions of the eyelens retaining system to facilitate sonic welding.
in june,the army published a report titled,design of the,aircrew,protective mask.the report disclosed research conducted by the army from october through july,and referenced sonic welded components in the mask.
in august,campbell plastics contacted an attorney who soon after drafted a patent application for a sonic welded gas mask and process.campbell plastics filed the application on october.the patent and trademark office uspto made the application available to the army for the limited purpose of making a secrecy determination pursuant to.pursuant to the uspto request,the army reviewed campbell plastics application by january.
the patent application issued on april,as patent the patent.the patent expressly reserved for the government a license and the right in limited circumstances to require the patent owner to license others on reasonable terms as provided for by the terms of contract no.awarded by the army.on april,campbell plastics notified the army in writing of the patent.
after an exchange of letters between the parties regarding the army claim to joint ownership of the subject invention,including one in which the army admitted that it had,by june,a report drafted by government employees that provided an enabling disclosure of the invention,the aco ultimately concluded that campbell plastics forfeited title to the patent by failing to comply with far.
on march,campbell plastics appealed the aco decision.both parties filed for summary judgment.though campbell plastics conceded in its motion that its disclosure was not in the form of a dd form as was required by the contract,campbell plastics argued that it disclosed all technical aspects of the invention to the army and that the army admittedly had an enabling disclosure of the subject invention by june.campbell plastics furthermore argued that forfeiture is not favored by law,especially where the government suffered no genuine harm.in short,campbell plastics framed its failure to comply with the contract as one in form only,which should not result in the forfeiture of title to the subject invention.
in denying the appeal,the board ruled that campbell plastics failed to satisfy its contractual obligation to inform the army that it considered sonic welding to be an invention.the board further ruled that any information the army gleaned from its review of the patent application for secrecy determination purposes and its own june report was not provided by campbell plastics,and that forfeiture was appropriate under the circumstances.finally,the board recognized that far d,which specifies when the government may obtain title to a subject invention,vests the army with some discretion in determining whether to take t
