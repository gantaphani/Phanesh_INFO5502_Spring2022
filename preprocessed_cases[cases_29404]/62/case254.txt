this appeal presents the question of whether the immunity doctrine,as embraced by our circuit in mier owens,cir,was superseded by the national defense authorization act for fiscal year amendments,a,stat,codified at u.a.we conclude that the amendments did not repeal the immunity doctrine,and we affirm the district court dismissal of the action.
pursuant to the doctrine of immunity,members of the armed forces may not bring an action against the government or armed service personnel for injuries during activity under the control or supervision of a commanding officer.hodge dalton,cir citation omitted.the doctrine applies whenever a legal action would require a civilian court to examine decisions regarding management,discipline,supervision,and control of members of the armed forces of the united states.id.at quotation omitted see also stauber cline,cir see generally feres united states,origin of the doctrine.the doctrine arises out of the sensitive nature of military operations,the unique relationship of the soldier to his superiors,and the special role of the miliary in providing national defense.united states brown.
but what of the circumstance when a civilian is employed by the military or,more relevant to our analysis,when an individual serves in the dual role of civilian and military employee in mier owens,we applied the doctrine of immunity to hold that we could not entertain a title vii claim brought by a dual status technician in the army national guard.at.if no events had intervened,the result in this case would be clear.mier would dictate that we apply the doctrine of immunity and affirm the dismissal of the suit.however,zuress argues that the amendments have altered the legal landscape,and two of our sister circuits have disagreed on that question.compare williams wynne,cir holding that the amendments did not affect prior doctrine with jentoft united states,holding that the amendments allowed a dual status national guard technician to bring an equal pay act claim against the military.

zuress was employed as a dual status air force reserve technician at luke air force base from july to june.she served in a civilian capacity as a operations staff specialist for the operations group and in a military capacity as an air force reserve captain in the operations group.
zuress alleges that the air force violated her rights under title vii by failing to promote her failing to extend her military retirement date as long as she had requested temporarily detailing her to a position and forcing her retirement.she contends that this unfair treatment began in september after she wrote a letter to senior defense department officials describing inappropriate sexual behavior following a fighter squadron naming ceremony and that it escalated when she agreed to serve as a character witness in a coworker discrimination case.zuress alleges that,in retaliation,her former military commander refused to return her salute and her supervisors gave her two average performance reports,eliminating her chance for promotion.because military officers twice passed up for promotion must separate from the military,zuress performance reports guaranteed her forced retirement.
according to her complaint,zuress realized upon receiving her second performance report that she would not be promoted and would be ineligible to remain in the air force reserves.the denial of promotion meant losing her civilian position as well.
she submitted military retirement paperwork in january,went on leave,and requested a leave of absence to search for another position.allegedly in a retaliatory gesture,her supervisor denied her request for a leave of absence and granted a leave instead.zuress then cancelled her request for leave and returned to work.when she returned,she was detailed to a lower grade position.in march,zuress learned that she had not been promoted and would be forced to retire.three months later,she retired from the air force reserve and was separated as a civilian employee.
zuress filed a complaint in district court alleging that the air force had violated her rights under title vii,naming the secretary of the air force as the sole defendant.on the secretary motion,the district court dismissed zuress amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.this appeal followed.
