at issue is for privately owned pipelines under the houston ship channel channel being relocated as part of the project by the united states army corps of engineers and the port of houston authority to widen and deepen the channel.the corps and the port appeal the partial summary judgment awarded the pipeline owners inter alia,the port was held responsible for the relocation cost.owners conditional is from the district court denial of their alternative summary judgment claim that the project was for a harbor and that,accordingly,the port would have to bear half of the relocation cost.
the principal are whether,as held by the district court,the port must bear the cost,pursuant to.water code relocation cost to be borne by district if it required the relocation and,if not,whether,in requiring owners to relocate the pipelines at their expense,the corps was properly enforcing both the federal navigational servitude and the corps associated federal permit authority.
texas law does not control.consistent with,inter alia,the corps authority to enforce its permits,owners were required to relocate their pipelines at their expense.concerning owners conditional,the project was not for a harbor therefore,the port was not required to bear half of the relocation cost.vacated in part affirmed in part and rendered.
the rivers and harbors act of,et,prohibits construction in navigable waters of the united states unless the work has been approved by the secretary of the army.pursuant to this act,and for more than years,the corps has regulated such construction,in part by issuing permits under of that act.these permits provide,inter alia,that pipelines and other structures beneath navigable waters are to be relocated at no expense to the united states if required by federal navigation interests or projects.in the and,the corps issued permits to owners to install pipelines beneath the channel.each permit mandates as required by navigation needs and at no cost to the government.
similarly,when the texas legislature granted ownership of the land under the channel to the port in,the port was given authority to franchise or lease the land for limited periods and purposes.see act of march,ch.laws.accordingly,in addition to a federal permit,each owner holds a license from the port.one license condition is that owners must relocate their pipelines at their cost if necessary for the channel.
in,the house committee on public works authorized a study for improving channels,including the channel.the reconnaissance report for this study was completed in.
the next step was the water resources development act of,stat.et.it contained the following provision 
the interests here,the port for a harbor navigation project shall perform or assure the performance of all relocations of utilities necessary to carry out the project,except that in the case of a project for a deep draft harbor deeper than feet of the cost of each such relocation shall be borne by the owner of the facility being relocated and of the cost shall be borne by the interests.
a emphasis added.
the feasibility study for the project was completed in.in may,the corps published a draft report for public review that recommended proceeding with the channel expansion.the draft report stated that owners would bear the cost for relocation of approximately pipelines.no owner responded to the corps about this notice.
the final version of the limited reevaluation report lrr was published in november.the lrr estimated the pipeline relocation cost would exceed million and,as did the draft report,the lrr stated that owners would bear that cost.again,the corps received no response from owners.at the end of the comment period,the lrr was incorporated in the chief of engineers report chief report,which was transmitted to congress by the secretary of the army.
the project was authorized by the water resources development act of,stat.et.that act provided t he removal of pipelines and other obstructions that are necessary for the project shall be accomplished at expense,id.a,stat.at and the project would be substantially in accordance with the plans,and subject to the conditions,described in the chief report,id.a,stat.at.again,one condition in that report was for the relocation cost to be borne by owners.
as required for commencing the project,the port entered into a project cooperation agreement pca with the corps in june.a see,stat.shortly thereafter,as requested by the port,the corps,by to owners,enforced the permit conditions and instructed owners to relocate their pipelines at their expense because of the project requirements.owners complied.
in november,however,owners filed this action,seeking a declaration that the corps were void.simultaneously,owners filed an action in state court,claiming pursuant to.water code,the port had required the relocation and was therefore responsible for the cost and the port not paying it was an unconstitutional taking.in the alternative,owners state action claimed the project was for a harbor pursuant to,subject to its mandated among the port and owners.
the state action was removed by the port and consolidated with this action.the port counterclaimed,seeking a declaration that either or the permits required owners to pay the relocation cost.
in early,on for summary judgment,the district court granted partial judgment to owners,holding did not amend the provisions of pursuant to,state law was to answer the question under texas law,that cost was to be borne by the port and the licenses issued by the port placing cost with owners were preempted by texas law.the district court amended the corps to owners to reflect this ruling.on the other hand,the district court rejected owners alternative claim that the project was for a harbor.
a summary judgment is reviewed de novo,texas soil recycling,intercargo ins,cir.the corps and port contest the port being liable for the relocation cost and the amendment of the corps.if those rulings are vacated,owners contest the ruling.
as the district court concluded,the language in neither nor explicitly allocates the relocation cost.the district court ruled that texas law required the port to bear it.
taking a similar approach,owners contend that,not,establishes the port cost liability.support is found in the conference report this cost allocation question is to be resolved between the interest port and the owners of the facilities being relocated.conf,at,cong.along this line,owners claim the port must bear the cost pursuant to.water code,which provides if a district in the exercise of powers conferred by this subchapter port improvement requires the relocating of any pipeline,the relocating shall be done at the sole expense of the district.
the corps and port maintain,not,controls and places it on owners.as discussed in part,infra,it is not necessary to resolve whether or controls.in any event.water code does not apply.first,to trigger that section application,the port had to require the relocation.it did not and can not do so.second,as discussed infra,the federal navigational servitude applied through the permits can not be trumped in the absence of a clear congressional waiver.
as quoted in part earlier.water code provides if a district in the exercise of the powers conferred by this subchapter or in the exercise of the power of eminent domain or the police power requires the relocating of any pipeline,the relocating shall be done at the sole expense of the district.emphasis added.this provision is not applicable because the port did not require the corps did.
in this regard,the district court held,and owners contend 
the corps issued the removal notices at the port request,acting as the port agent in requiring the owners to relocate the pipelines.the port can not escape its obligation to pay by shunting its order through an agent.
