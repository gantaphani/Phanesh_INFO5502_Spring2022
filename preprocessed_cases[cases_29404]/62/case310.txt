michael henrie severely injured his arm while working at hill air force base hill field using an apparatus to hold large,heavy parts for painting.he filed a products liability claim against northrop grumman corporation ngc,the manufacturer of the apparatus.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of ngc.henrie appealed.we affirm.
background 
henrie is an experienced professional civilian painter who had worked for the military at hill field for years.on july,while painting stealth bomber parts,henrie injured his arm and shoulder using a device known as a glass fixture.vol.i.the glass fixture is the largest of eleven different fixtures,each designed to hold a different part of the aircraft during the application of paint or another coating.it is comprised of two square frames,one which rotates within the other,somewhat like a gyroscope.the frames are attached to a wheeled base.the fixture is used as follows the workers place the inner frame of the fixture in a horizontal position.the frame position is secured with two pins,one located on each side of the frame.once the aircraft part is loaded on the frame and clamped,two persons standing on the wheel base to each side of the fixture remove the pins while several others hold the frame and then move it to a vertical position.the pins are reinserted when the frame and the aircraft part reach the vertical position.after completing work on the part,the process is reversed.two men pull the pins while several others hold the frame to prevent uncontrolled rotation of the heavily weighted end of the part the aircraft part is then packaged for shipping.
prior to the accident,henrie had been working in the program for approximately a year and a half.the painting department employed seven or eight employees.henrie first contact with the fixtures was at ngc california manufacturing plant located on the pico rivera air force base pico.henrie and another painter were sent for thirty days of observation training in february.in april or may,he and two other employees were again sent to pico for six weeks of training.finally,in late,he returned to pico for a month to do production work.at pico,the frame devices ran on monorails.the air force requested northrop grumman to modify the frames to fit on a wheeled base for use at hill field after pico closed in early.the devices were designed solely for use by the painters at hill field.
henrie testified he and a fellow worker established the frame procedure after the fixtures arrived at hill field without instructions.see supra use of fixture.henrie and the other painters used the various fixtures every day after the equipment arrived at hill field up to the day of the accident.four or five months before the accident,the air force modified the glass fixture.henrie and his reported a swivel which allowed the aircraft part to rotate within inner frame which caused them safety concerns.at their request,the swivel was welded solid.
on july,henrie supervisor assigned him and fellow employee,isaac donohue,to unload the glass from the fixture and package it for shipping.the two men went to each side of the fixture and stood on the base to release the pins.henrie then called out to others in the area for assistance in lowering the part and frame to the horizontal position.as he looked over his shoulder,henrie saw a bunch of people standing behind him.vol.at.he mistakenly assumed they were there to assist with the frame and yelled to donohue to pull the pin.both men released the pins simultaneously.when henrie turned to help with the frame,the weighted side of the frame spun down and caught his arm.donohue was knocked off the fixture base.henrie fractured his elbow and dislocated his shoulder,eventually requiring several surgeries.
on june,henrie filed his claim against ngc alleging strict product liability for the design and manufacture of an unreasonably dangerous product,negligent design,testing,manufacture and distribution,and breach of an implied warranty of merchantability and fitness.on january,ngc filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims,contending the device worked exactly as designed and was not unreasonably dangerous.the district court deferred consideration of the motion until the completion of discovery.
after discovery,ngc renewed its motion for summary judgment.in response,henrie offered a report from his expert,eberhard bramberg,opining the painting device was defective because it unnecessarily placed the workers in the rotational path of the device and the hazard could have been easily eliminated by placing the rotation points around the part center of gravity by installing a worm gear drive in bramberg opinion ngc also failed to follow basic hazard analysis in the design and manufacture of the product.
on april,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of ngc.it determined,under utah law,a plaintiff must meet both an objective and subjective test to demonstrate the product was unreasonably dangerous,the first element of a strict products liability claim.relying on brown sears,roebuck,the court determined the fixture was unreasonably dangerous under an objective test.cir.however,because henrie experience and training gave him knowledge of the precise danger that caused his injury,the court concluded he could not show the product was unreasonably dangerous to him.the district court then determined henrie negligence and implied warranty claims must fail for the same reason.it granted summary judgment in favor of ngc on all claims.
on appeal,henrie argues the district court incorrectly applied utah law because there was an economically reasonable alternative to prevent the design defect,and therefore,his knowledge of the defect does not defeat his claim.as his second issue,henrie claims to have presented sufficient evidence to create a material issue of fact as to whether ngc negligently failed to engage in a basic hazard analysis.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to henrie.see allen minnstar,cir internal citations omitted.summary judgment is proper only if the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in diversity cases our role is to ascertain and apply the proper state law,here that of utah,with the goal of insuring that the result obtained is the one that would have been reached in the state courts.we review de novo the district court rulings with respect to state law.allen,at citations omitted.
at issue here is the interpretation of utah code ann,a part of the utah products liability act.normally,the federal court must defer to the most recent decisions of the state highest court.wankier crown equip,cir.however,where no controlling state decision exists,the federal court must attempt to predict what the state highest court would do bound by ordinary principles of stare decisis.id.thus,when a panel of this court has rendered a decision interpreting state law,that interpretation is binding on district courts in this circuit,and on subsequent panels of this court,unless an intervening decision of the state highest court has resolved the issue.id.
strict products liability 
henrie contends the district court erroneously applied utah code ann,a part of the utah products liability act.this provision states in relevant part 
defect or defective condition making product unreasonably presumption 
in any action for damages for personal injury,death,or property damage allegedly caused by a defect in a product 
no product shall be considered to have a defect or to be in a defective condition,unless at the time the product was sold by the manufacturer or other initial seller,there was a defect or defective condition in the product which made the product unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer.
as used in this act,unreasonably dangerous means that the product was dangerous to an extent beyond which would be contemplated by the ordinary and prudent buyer,consumer or user of that product in that community considering the product characteristics,propensities,risks,dangers and uses together with any actual knowledge,training,or experience possessed by that particular buyer,user or consumer.
despite the language in subsection of the statute,henrie argued his knowledge of the defect does not bar his claim if he can show the defect could be economically and practically eliminated.relying on brown sears,the district court disagreed.
in brown,the plaintiff alleged a riding lawnmower was unreasonably dangerous in the absence of an automatic blade when the mower was operated in reverse.brown,at.the plaintiff sought recovery under theories of strict liability and negligence.addressing strict liability,we noted,t he law governing strict products liability in utah has two sources the common law and a statute,utah code ann.although some reported opinions refer to both sources,the utah courts have devoted virtually no attention to examining the interrelationship between the statute and the common law.id.at.in our review of the statute we stated 
section states that to be unreasonably dangerous,a product must be more dangerous than contemplated by the ordinary and prudent person,considering the product characteristics,propensities,risk,dangers and uses together with any actual knowledge,training,or experience possessed by that particular buyer,user or consumer.the words together with do not signal that the items considered together are alternatives w e must read together with as conveying cumulation.under subsection a product is unreasonably dangerous if its actual dangers exceed its perceived dangers.the words together with indicate that there are two components to the product perceived dangers an ordinary person understanding of the product,together with the understanding possessed by the particular person.
id.at.we concluded imposes an objective consumer expectations test supplemented by a subjective test based on the individual knowledge,training,and experience of the particular buyer,user,consumer,or,possibly,victim.id.because individual information regarding the product would ordinarily increase the particular person appreciation of the product danger,the subjective test increases the extent of the perceived danger beyond that contemplated by the ordinary and prudent person.id.
applying these principles to henrie strict liability claim,the district court determined the painting device failed the objective test it was unreasonably dangerous to the ordinary user.however,given henrie extensive training on and knowledge of the fixtures,the glass fixture was not unreasonably dangerous under the subjective test.henrie now argues brown does not apply,and if it does,it should be overruled.
to demonstrate brown is in conflict with utah law,henrie relies primarily on house armour of america,utah house i where the utah court of appeals held the presence of an open and obvious danger is merely one factor for the trier of fact to consider when assessing the liability of the defendant in a strict liability does not operate as a complete bar to the injured party recovery.in house armour of america,utah house ii the utah supreme court clarified this holding,concluding the obviousness of an inherent danger in a product can act as a complete bar to a products liability action if the danger can not be economically alleviated.id.at.henrie also points to mulherin,utah,where the utah supreme court announced that the comparative fault principles enunciated in utah code ann.applied with equal force in strict product liability actions.he maintains the application of comparative fault combined with his evidence of a safer design indicates the utah courts would not bar his claim even though he knew of the fixture danger.
contrary to henrie contentions,however,none of these decisions negate the need for a plaintiff to meet the statutory definition of an unreasonably dangerous product to succeed on a strict liability claim.while we agree with the ultimate conclusion of the district court that henrie failed to show a necessary element of his claim,the district court did not need to reach the subjective test see gomes wood,cir.this court may affirm the district court on any ground adequately supported by the record so long as the parties have had a fair opportunity to address that ground,cert.denied,d.henrie failed to demonstrate a defective product under the objective consumer test,the first part of utah test.
the district court determined the fixture was unreasonably dangerous under the objective consumer test solely on henrie evidence of a safer and economical alternative design.although this evidence is an essential part of his claim,by itself it is not enough.for example,in brown,the plaintiff production of an expert report proposing a safer design could not save his strict liability claim in the absence of a product defect.see brown,at.in addition to a safer alternative design,henrie must show the product was dangerous to an extent beyond which would be contemplated by the ordinary and prudent buyer,consumer or user of that product in that community.utah code ann.this sentence is more fully explained in comment g,restatement second torts which considers a defective condition to be present only where the product is,at the time it leaves the seller hands,in a condition not contemplated by the ultimate consumer,which will be unreasonably dangerous to him.further,comment i states,unreasonably dangerous means dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it,with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics.
in house ii,the utah supreme court recognized the sophisticated user may be the community for which a product is designed.there,the defendant argued a police officer could not bring a products liability claim against the manufacturer of body armor because the police officer was part of a highly trained community.the court stated 
as the court of appeals noted,defendants need not show that house actually knew about the danger but that the community to which house belongs generally knows about the danger in other words,to sustain a conclusion that no duty was owed to the user because of his professional status,the court must find the record evidence to be undisputed that the user actually knew of the danger or that,based on the user special expertise and the circumstances of the transaction,the supplier reasonably could have believed that he knew of the danger.
house,at citations omitted see also ici explosives,usa,cir applying oklahoma law the consumer was a farmer and there was no indication the ammonium nitrate was less safe than expected by farmers.lamer mckee,alaska the ordinary consumer was the professional garage door repairman and a number of experienced repairmen testified product failure was a surprise.rojas lindsay,idaho,the ordinary user with ordinary knowledge common to the community would be,for purposes of this case,a farmer or a qualified maintenance person.here,henrie and the other painters were similarly members of a small,professional group of painters with the equipment at issue here.
the uncontradicted evidence reveals ngc manufactured and designed eleven fixtures specifically for use by the professional painters at hill field.the record reveals no other use or contemplated use for the equipment.all the painters regularly used the equipment and henrie does not argue the other painters working at hill field were not fully aware,as he was,of the danger if the pins were pulled without sufficient manpower to control the aircraft part descent.indeed,there had been no other incidents where a part spun out of control nor were any injuries caused by the fixtures when used in the normal manner,despite their daily use,until the date of henrie injury.thus,there was no defect beyond what this unique community of users,the stealth bomber painters,contemplated.because henrie did not establish the fixture was an unreasonably dangerous product under the objective test,there was no need for the district court to apply the supplemental inquiry 
as his final argument,henrie claims utah policy suppor
