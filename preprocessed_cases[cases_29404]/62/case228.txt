background

specifically,aguilar turcios pleaded guilty to violating ucmj article as a result of his violation of department of defense dod directive r a,which provides that government computers shall be for official use and authorized purposes only and that such authorized purposes do not include uses involving pornography.
aguilar turcios also pleaded guilty to and was convicted of bringing discredit upon the armed forces under ucmj article,by wrongfully and knowingly possess ing visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct,which conduct was prejudicial to good order and discipline of the armed forces.id.d.

removal proceedings 
in,the federal government initiated removal proceedings against aguilar turcios,charging him as removable under a a iii for having been convicted of an aggravated felony.the government alleged that aguilar turcios convictions under ucmj articles and amounted to violations of a and a both of which address conduct involving child pornography,and therefore qualify as aggravated felonies under a i 
agency decisions 
the immigration judge ij assigned to aguilar turcios removal proceeding determined that neither the article nor the article violations qualified categorically as an aggravated felony under a i.turning to the modified categorical analysis,the ij first held that aguilar turcios article conviction was not an aggravated felony because article does not refer to child pornography.the ij was not persuaded that the specific facts with which aguilar turcios was charged became an element of the article conviction for purposes of the categorical rule the ij reached the opposite conclusion for aguilar turcios article conviction,concluding that because child pornography is a subset of pornography and aguilar turcios pleaded guilty to a charge containing the phrase minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct the same language that appears in a and a article conviction qualified as an aggravated felony 
aguilar turcios appealed the ij decision regarding his article conviction to the bia.the government did not appeal the ij decision regarding the article conviction.the bia affirmed the ij decision in a per curiam order.
and ninth circuit decisions 
aguilar turcios petitioned for review of the bia order,and we granted the petition and remanded the case to the bia aguilar turcios holder aguilar turcios i,cir,withdrawn by cir.
like the ij,we concluded that an article conviction for violating dod directive r a is not categorically an aggravated felony.id.at.we also held that the modified categorical approach did not apply to the question of whether aguilar turcios article conviction was an aggravated felony.id.at.we applied the missing element rule from navarro lopez gonzales,cir en banc,which limited the application of the modified categorical approach to statutes of conviction that are divisible into several crimes and barred application of the rule where a statute of conviction was missing an element of the generic crime.aguilar turcios i,at.concluding that both article and dod directive r a were missing the element of a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,we held that the modified categorical approach did not apply and that aguilar turcios article conviction did not meet the generic definition of aggravated felony.id.
judge bybee dissented,calling into question the validity and wisdom of the navarro lopez missing element rule and concluding that aguilar turcios article conviction necessarily shows that he committed the aggravated felony of knowing possession of child pornography because t he only pornography that aguilar turcios admitted to accessing on his government computer during the plea colloquy were the six images of child pornography.id.at,bybee,dissenting.
following publication of our original opinion in this case,the government filed a petition for rehearing en banc.the petition sought reconsideration of the nazarro lopez rule.before we could rule on the government petition,a majority of the court active judges granted rehearing in another case,united states aguila montes de oca aguila montes,to consider the same question.cir.we therefore held this case in abeyance pending the en banc opinion in aguila montes.
aguila montes overruled navarro lopez missing element rule,cir en banc.as a result of the holding in aguila montes,we withdrew our original opinion in this case and requested supplemental briefing from the parties as to what effect,if any,aguila montes had on the outcome of aguilar turcios case.aguilar turcios holder,cir.in a new opinion,we applied aguila montes and concluded that the facts necessary to support aguilar turcios article conviction did not satisfy the elements of a or a.aguilar turcios holder aguilar turcios ii,cir,withdrawn by cir.therefore,we once again held that aguilar turcios article conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony.id.at.judge bybee again dissented.
but this turned out not to be the end of aguilar turcios case.the supreme court granted certiorari in another case,descamps united states,to reconsider the rule we established in aguila montes.the supreme court subsequently abrogated aguila montes and held that sentencing courts may not apply the modified categorical approach when a defendant statute of conviction contains an indivisible set of elements.descamps united states.in light of descamps,we withdrew our second opinion in this case.aguilar turcios holder,cir.we once again consider the merits of this case,applying the principles outlined in descamps.
ii.jurisdiction 
generally,we have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal under a see also galindo romero holder,cir.we lack jurisdiction,however,to review final orders of removal against aliens who have committed certain criminal offenses,including aliens convicted of aggravated felonies.see id.a c.of course,we have jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction.see daas holder,cir luu le ins,cir.because our resolution of the merits of whether aguilar turcios article conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony under federal law determines whether we have jurisdiction over his final order of removal,the jurisdictional question and the merits collapse into one.id.quoting ye ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.if we determine that aguilar turcios article conviction is not an aggravated felony,then we have jurisdiction over the final order of removal and must grant his petition if we determine,however,that it is an aggravated felony,we lose our jurisdiction and the agency has the final word on aguilar turcios removal.see martinez perez gonzales,cir.
