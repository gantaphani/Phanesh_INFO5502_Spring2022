this case arises under the federal aviation act,et as amended.robert newton petitions for our review of an order of the national transportation safety board ntsb determining that it lacked jurisdiction to review the decision of the utah air national guard ang to withdraw permanently newton atcs certificate.we have jurisdiction under,f,a,to review the ntsb order.we affirm.
background 
newton became an air traffic controller in,when the federal aviation administration faa issued his first atcs certificate.this certificate authorizes the bearer to perform specified duties at a designated facility.he worked for the faa at civilian facilities in idaho and utah until.in he became certified to work as a controller at hill air force base,and obtained a position with the range control squadron of the utah ang.in he was employed as a civilian air traffic controller working for the department of defense at hill.in his atcs certificate was reissued,apparently only because there was no room for additional certifications and ratings on his old one.
on december,the utah ang suspended newton atcs certificate and restricted him from performing duties because i t has been determined that he is a hazard to aviation safety for repeated failure in performing the duties of an air traffic control supervisor.at.his atcs certificate was permanently withdrawn by the ang on february,and he was therefore not authorized to perform any function related to atc in the air national guard or usaf.id.at.newton appealed the withdrawal of the atcs certificate to the ntsb under,which permits the ntsb to review on appeal the denial,amendment,modification,suspension,or revocation of a certificate issued by the secretary of transportation under section,or of title.the timing and other procedural requirements for an appeal to the ntsb are governed by.
on june,an ntsb administrative law judge alj issued an order not accepting appeal and terminating proceeding for lack of jurisdiction.at.the alj observed that the ntsb statutory jurisdiction to review certificate actions encompasses only orders of the faa respecting certificates issued under chapter.the alj decided that the atcs certificate was not such a certificate.he rejected newton arguments that his atcs certificate was an airman certificate under a,and even if it was not an airman certificate,it was nonetheless a certificate issued under chapter.newton appealed the alj decision to the board.rejecting newton arguments relying on faa order a,a handbook entitled,certification and rating procedures,the ntsb affirmed the jurisdictional conclusions of the alj and denied the appeal.
ii.standard of review 
we review the ntsb factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence.b,f.in other respects the scope of our review is governed by of the administrative procedures act apa.see jifry fed.aviation,applying apa review to pilots challenge to the revocation of their airman certificates boca airport,fed.aviation,applying apa to extent that does not govern standard of review.under the apa we may overturn nonfactual aspects of the decision only if they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.boca airport,at quoting a.in particular,we have held that we review issues of law,such as matters of statutory interpretation,de novo.see bennett transp.safety,cir see also kratt garvey,cir de novo review of issues of law on appeal from ntsb.
under the line of cases following chevron,natural resources defense council,d,we ordinarily defer to an agency interpretation of an ambiguous statute that it implements.see mcgraw barnhart,cir see also donnelly fed.aviation,applying chevron to an faa statutory interpretation.there are three agency pronouncements relevant to this case the ntsb adjudication of newton appeal faa regulations governing airman certificates and the faa handbook,faa order a,which establishes atcs certificates and contrasts them with airman certificates.
different types of agency pronouncements are entitled to different degrees of deference.in united states mead,d,the supreme court held 
a dministrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for chevron deference when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.delegation of such authority may be shown in a variety of ways,as by an agency power to engage in adjudication or rulemaking,or by some other indication of a comparable congressional intent.
under this holding the ntsb adjudication would appear to qualify for chevron deference,although the extent to which such deference should be accorded an agency interpretation of its own jurisdictional statute has been a matter of dispute.compare,mcbryde comm.to review circuit council conduct disability orders of the judicial conf.of the,applying chevron deference to agency interpretation fleischmann,office of workers comp.programs,cir same with.steel supply sec.of labor,cir chevron deference is not applicable to an agency jurisdictional determination bolton merit.prot,same.see generally cass sunstein,chevron step zero.as for the faa regulations,they are clearly entitled to chevron deference.see toomer city cab,cir regulations promulgated by an agency in exercising congressionally granted rulemaking authority are entitled to deference under chevron.the faa handbook,in contrast,was not issued as a regulation.nevertheless,insofar as the handbook is interpreting the provisions of the federal aviation act governing air traffic controllers,it is entitled to deference to the extent that it is persuasive,see mcgraw,at friends of airport fed.aviation,cir and it is entitled to great deference insofar as it is interpreting the agency own regulations,see auer robbins,d archuleta stores,in re stores,cir.see humanoids group rogan,cir a gency interpretations that lack the force of law such as those embodied in opinion letters and policy statements do not warrant deference when they interpret ambiguous statutes but do receive deference under auer when interpreting ambiguous regulations.internal quotation marks omitted.should we encounter an inconsistency between the interpretation of the ntsb and that of the faa,we would likely give greater deference to the faa as the primary agency overseeing the certification provisions of the federal aviation act.see olson fed.mine safety health review,cir addressing possibility of conflict between interpretations by federal mine safety and health review commission and mine safety and health administration.in the following discussion we have no quarrel with any relevant pronouncements of the ntsb or the faa.to the extent that we should accord deference to such pronouncements,our conclusions are only strengthened.
iii.analysis 
the ntsb jurisdiction in this case is determined by,which states in relevant part 
the national transportation safety board shall review on appeal 
the denial,amendment,modification,suspension,or revocation of a certificate issued by the secretary of transportation under section,or of this title 
section governs the faa issuance of airman certificates and specifically provides for an ntsb appeal by a n individual whose application for the issuance or renewal of an airman certificate has been denied by the faa.id.c.section governs orders by the faa administrator amending,modifying,suspending,or revoking any part of a certificate issued under this chapter,id.b,and provides that a person adversely affected by an order of the administrator under this section may appeal the order to the national transportation safety board,id.d.section relates to the revocation of airman certificates for violations.
a first reading of may suggest that the ntsb authority extends only to actions with respect to a certificate issued by the secretary of transportation under section,or but since no certificates are issued under the latter two sections,it is clear that under section,or does not modify the term certificate issued by the secretary of transportation,which immediately precedes the prepositional phrase.rather,the phrase must modify denial,amendment,modification,suspension or revocation.in other words,provides the ntsb with appellate authority over the administrator actions taken under,or with respect to certificates issued by the secretary of transportation.newton contends that the revocation of his atcs certificate was a revocation by the administrator under.
the question before us,then,is whether the revocation of the atcs certificate was an order by the administrator revoking a certificate issued under chapter of title.b.on appeal newton raises the same arguments he presented to the ntsb.his first two arguments relate to the nature of the atcs certificate.first,he argues that the revocation of newton atcs certificate was a revocation of an airman certificate issued under.aplt br.at.in the alternative,he argues that even if his certificate is not an airman certificate,it is nonetheless a certificate issued under chapter.b.his third argument relates to the identity of the entity that took the adverse action against him.he contends that the ang suspension and withdrawal of his atcs certificate was in essence a revocation by the faa administrator so the action comes within the scope of,because the ang was acting as the administrator agent.but we need not address this point,because we reject newton other two arguments.we discuss those two arguments in turn.
airman certificates 
under chapter of title,the faa administrator may issue airman certificates,type certificates,production certificates,airworthiness certificates,air carrier operating certificates,airport operating certificates,air agency certificates,and air navigation facility certificates.a.the administrator shall issue an airman certificate to an individual when the administrator finds,after investigation,that the individual is qualified for,and physically able to perform the duties related to,the position to be authorized by the certificate.id.a.once such a certificate has been issued,the administrator may issue an order amending,modifying,suspending or revoking it.id.b.such an order is appealable to the ntsb.id.d see king transp.safety,cir noting the procedure,including review in a federal appellate court,for appealing an faa certificate action.
newton contends that his atcs certificate is an airman certificate issued under a and.airman is defined by statute as 
an individual 
a in command,or as pilot,mechanic,or member of the crew,who navigates aircraft when under way 
b except to the extent the administrator of the federal aviation administration may provide otherwise for individuals employed outside the united states,who is directly in charge of inspecting,maintaining,overhauling,or repairing aircraft,aircraft engines,propellers,or appliances or 
c who serves as an aircraft dispatcher or air traffic operator.
a emphasis added.although acknowledging that thousands of air traffic controllers are employed by the faa in facilities other than air traffic control towers,aplt br.at,newton claims that his atcs certificate is for an air traffic operator.we disagree.
we think it elementary that a certification as an air traffic operator must be an authorization to operate an air traffic control tower,or at least to work at one.yet newton does not argue that he has worked at one or that his atcs certificate authorized him to work at one.therefore,we do not see how his atcs certificate could be considered an airman certificate for an air traffic operator.moreover,if we had doubts on that score we would accord some level of deference to the faa administrator view of the matter,see mcgraw,at agency informal interpretation of statute can be persuasive archuleta,at agency interpretation of ambiguities in its own regulations is entitled to great weight and it is clear that the administrator considers and treats atcs certificates as distinct from airman certificates.
the term air traffic operator is not defined by statute,but the faa has issued implementing regulations for airman certificates within this category.see.these regulations discuss the issuance of certificates for air traffic operators cto certificates and mandate that n o person may act as an air traffic control tower operator at an air traffic control tower in connection with civil aircraft unless he h olds an air traffic control tower operator certificate issued to him under this subpart.id.a.the regulation does not mention atcs certificates.
the program for issuance of atcs certificates is administered under faa order a,a handbook entitled,certification and rating procedures,published on august.the first paragraph of the handbook describes its scope this handbook specifies uniform procedures for the certification and rating of all air traffic controllers operating in the national airspace system.these procedures apply to all faa,dod civilian and military,and civilian nonfederal personnel engaged in air traffic control activities.at a faa order a.
newton contends that this handbook supports his view that atcs certificates are airman certificates for operators.in our view,however,it does the opposite.the handbook repeatedly states that an atcs certificate is distinct from a cto certificate.the second paragraph of the handbook explicitly differentiates between cto certificates and atcs certificates.it states this handbook provides for the issuance of control tower operator cto certificates to all air traffic controllers who serve as control tower operators.all other persons serving as air traffic controllers will be issued air traffic control specialist atcs certificates.id.at b.further emphasizing the distinction between cto and atcs certificates,the introduction paragraph of the handbook states 
under the federal aviation act of fa act,an air traffic control tower operator is included within the definition of airman.section of the act makes it unlawful for any person to serve as an airman in connection with any civil aircraft in air commerce without an appropriate airman certificate.the act authorizes the issuance of airmen certificates,specifying the capacity in which the holders are authorized to serve.persons operating in control towers are required by part of the federal aviation regulations far to possess a control tower operator cto certificate and an appropriate facility rating,or be qualified for the operating position at which they act and under the supervision of a holder of a facility rating for that control tower.other persons whose responsibilities and duties involve the operational handling of instrument flight rule ifr traffic shall possess a valid faa air traffic control specialist certificate with the appropriate facility rating.this handbook provides procedures for the administration of the air traffic controller certification program.
id.at emphasis added.
newton creatively asserts that this introduction conclusively establishes that the faa believes that atcs certificates are airman certificates.aplt br.at.despite the paragraph stating that p ersons operating in control towers must have cto certificates and o ther persons must have atcs certificates,he argues 
the introductory paragraph of the faa order specifically cites the statute which prohibits air traffic control tower operators from acting in that capacity without an airman certificate and authorizes the faa to issue airman certificates.it then identifies one such certificate for p ersons operating in control towers.it subsequently identified another certificate for all other persons whose responsibilities and duties involve the operational handling of ifr traffic.this language indicates that the faa believed it was acting pursuant to its authority to issue airman certificates when it created the air traffic control specialist certificates and that such certificates are airman certificates.accordingly,it is more than fair to say that faa order a substantively defined the term air traffic control tower operator to include two classes of air traffic controllers air traffic controllers providing air traffic control in control towers and air traffic controllers providing air traffic control from any oth
