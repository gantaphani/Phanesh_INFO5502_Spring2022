charles coffman appeals the district court order granting summary judgment to chugach support services,chugach on coffman claims of employment discrimination due to his active military status,in violation of the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act of userra,et.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
background 
in october,the united states air force awarded,a contract to provide base support services at tyndall air force base in panama city,florida.in the same month,hired coffman as a hazardous materials specialist to work at tyndall.from that time through november,coffman worked for and served as a officer in the air force reserve.in july,alex gunn,project manager,promoted coffman to the position of hazardous materials program manager.that promotion included a pay raise for coffman.
there is some confusion over whether coffman position as manager was exempt from collective bargaining agreement as a position.one of former officers,steve kukak,testified that gunn did not have the authority to make coffman position exempt from the collective bargaining agreement by adding duties and pay.apparently,discovered the mistake over coffman promotion while coffman was away on active duty.as the district court noted,however,this particular dispute over coffman position is ultimately immaterial.at the time he left,and at the time he returned from active duty,coffman considered his position one of management.
in november,the air force ordered coffman to return to active military duty for one year.coffman notified the proper authorities at about his return to active service.consequently,hired rhonda cruz as a temporary replacement for coffman during his absence.
on october,while coffman was still away on active duty,the air force awarded the base support services contract at tyndall to chugach,replacing as the primary contractor.the services that chugach provided at tyndall were similar to those services had provided.then became a subcontractor with chugach on the project at tyndall.both chugach and maintained separate contracts with the air force.for the portion of the project that was not subcontracted out,chugach sent in a transition team to interview about employees for employment positions with chugach.
previously,in anticipation of chugach taking over,coffman had sent chugach his resume,service orders,and a letter explaining his interest in retaining,and returning to,his former position as a hazardous materials specialist.as a result,chugach interviewed coffman in september,but the interview was not for a specific position.coffman testified that he thought this interview was merely a courtesy meeting.during the interview,coffman mentioned that he held a managerial position prior to his reactivation.coffman stated that the chugach representatives seemed surprised and shocked to learn that he held a position as a manager.sometime during the interview,the parties discussed an available position that was similar to coffman previous position with,but different in that the chugach position was a union position.coffman testified that he made it clear during the interview that he was willing to talk with chugach and work something out regarding the discrepancies between the available position and his former position.
adrian darkow,the head of chugach team,testified that he was involved in the interview with coffman.he remembered discussing a management position and believed that coffman was looking for a management position.according to darkow,the discrepancies between the positions are why chugach did not have a position for coffman.darkow also claimed that,at some point,he discussed coffman situation with representatives and left with the understanding that would be rehiring coffman.additionally,darkow asserted that coffman military status was not a factor in chugach decision not to hire him.patrick mccredie,another one of the chugach representatives who was also present at coffman interview,testified that he thought coffman and the representatives were discussing a vehicle maintenance position.he recalled that chugach did not have a vehicle management position available for coffman.he also stated that coffman military status had nothing to do with chugach decision not to hire him.
chugach then interviewed cruz for environmental hazardous materials specialist,the chugach position similar to coffman former position and,at the interview,offered her a permanent job,which she accepted.originally,chugach compensated cruz at the same pay rate she had received in her prior employment with.later,chugach increased her compensation to the union pay rate,as chugach agreed to abide by collective bargaining agreement until it could negotiate its own agreement with the union.cruz duties at chugach were similar to her duties at,except for some additional tasks,such as security.
out of former employees,chugach hired.coffman was one of the three employees not hired.coffman was the only employee on military leave at the time of the transition from to chugach.
on november,the air force gave coffman an honorable discharge from active military service.in the same month,coffman returned to tyndall and began working for as a vehicle control coordinator.coffman did not wish to remain in this position,but wanted to return to his position.thus,in january of,coffman mailed a letter to chugach president,robert westermann,requesting to be reinstated to his position.in the letter,coffman specifically mentioned his reemployment rights under the userra.chugach denied his request and asserted that decision to bring him back to a position of comparable pay and status satisfied the requirements of the userra.
procedural history 
in september,coffman filed a complaint against chugach and seeking damages,attorney fees,and reinstatement to his former position under the userra.counts i and iii alleged that chugach violated the userra and reemployment provisions respectively.count ii alleged that violated the userra provision.coffman and eventually settled their dispute.
both chugach and coffman filed motions for summary judgment.chugach filed a motion on counts i and iii.coffman filed a motion for partial summary judgment only as to count iii,asking for reinstatement to his position.the district court granted chugach motion and entered final judgment in favor of chugach.coffman then timely appealed the district court order.
