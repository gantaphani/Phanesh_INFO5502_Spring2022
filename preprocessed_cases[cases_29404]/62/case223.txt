a special agent of the naval criminal investigative service ncis launched an investigation for online criminal activity by anyone in the state of washington,whether connected with the military or not.the agent found evidence of a crime committed by a civilian in the state and turned it over to civilian law enforcement officials.the civilian,michael dreyer,was prosecuted,convicted,and sentenced to eighteen years in prison.we hold that the ncis agent investigation constituted improper military enforcement of civilian laws and that the evidence collected as a result of that investigation should have been suppressed.
background 
in late,ncis special agent steve logan began investigating the distribution of child pornography online.several months later,from his office in georgia,agent logan used a software program,roundup,to search for any computers located in washington state sharing known child pornography on the gnutella network 
agent logan found a computer using the internet protocol ip address sharing several files identified by roundup as child pornography he downloaded three of the files,two images and a video,from that computer.after viewing the files,agent logan concluded that they were child pornography.
thereafter,agent logan made a request for an administrative subpoena for the name and address associated at the time of the downloads with the ip address.he submitted his request to ncis representative at the national center for missing and exploited children,which turned the request over to the federal bureau of investigation fbi.the fbi sent an administrative subpoena to comcast.comcast responded by providing dreyer name and address in algona,washington.
after receiving that information,agent logan checked a department of defense dod database to determine if dreyer had a military affiliation.he found that dreyer had no current military affiliation agent logan then wrote a report summarizing his investigation and forwarded it and the supporting material to the ncis office in the state of washington.that office then turned the information over to officer james schrimpsher of the algona police department.
officer schrimpsher verified that dreyer lived in algona based on property and utility records.because officer schrimpsher had never worked on any case involving internet crimes or child pornography,he contacted the internet crimes against children task force for assistance and was referred to detective ian polhemus of the seattle police department.detective polhemus reviewed some of the information in the ncis report,and provided officer schrimpsher with a sample of a search warrant affidavit.
subsequently,officer schrimpsher sought,and was issued,a search warrant by a state court judge officer schrimpsher,along with several other officers,including detective polhemus,detective timothy luckie of the seattle police department,and sergeant lee gaskill of the algona police department,executed the search warrant.at dreyer residence,detective luckie conducted an preview search of a desktop computer he found in the house he identified some images as possible child pornography and directed the algona officers to seize the computer.
months later,united states department of homeland security special agent cao triet huynh applied for a warrant to search the electronic media seized from dreyer home.huynh based his application on the media found by agent logan and detective luckie,as well as incriminating statements dreyer made during the car ride.a federal magistrate judge issued a search warrant.the resulting forensic examination of dreyer computer revealed many videos and images of child pornography.
dreyer was charged with one count of distributing child pornography on april,in violation of a and b,and one count of possessing child pornography on july,in violation of a b and b.he moved to suppress the evidence seized during the july,search,as well as the evidence found during the later federal search of the computer.
in his reply brief on his suppression motion,dreyer argued that,as an ncis agent,agent logan had no lawful authority to investigate civilian crime.the government filed a surreply addressing that argument.the parties addressed this issue again at the hearing on the motion to suppress.following an evidentiary hearing,the district court orally denied his motion to suppress.
subsequently,following a jury trial,dreyer was convicted of both charges and sentenced to months of incarceration and lifetime supervised release.he timely appealed.
discussion 
dreyer argues that the fruits of the ncis investigation into his online file sharing should have been suppressed because military enforcement of civilian laws is prohibited.because the issue of whether the ncis involvement violated the limitations on military enforcement of civilian laws is a mixed question of fact and law which is primarily legal,we review de novo the district court denial of dreyer motion to suppress based on this claim.united states hitchcock,cir,as amended by cir.
the posse comitatus act pca,prohibits army and air force military personnel from participating in civilian law enforcement activities.united states chon,cir in addition,congress has directed t he secretary of defense to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to prevent direct participation by a member of the army,navy,air force,or marine corps in civilian law enforcement activities unless otherwise authorized by law.congress has authorized certain exceptions to,such as permitting the military to make equipment and facilities available to civilian law enforcement and allowing the military to provide support in particular situations,such as during an emergency situation involving a weapon of mass destruction.see.none of these specific exceptions are at issue here.
we have previously recognized that,a lthough the pca does not directly reference the navy,restrictions apply to the navy as a matter of department of defense dod and naval policy.chon,at see also united states khan,cir.specifically,dod policy states that its guidance on the posse comitatus act is applicable to the department of the navy and the marine corps as a matter of dod policy,with such exceptions as may be provided by the secretary of the navy on a basis.dod directive dodd enclosure,t he secretary of the navy,using nearly identical language,has adopted this policy.chon,at citing former secretary of the navy instructions secnavinst b march,see secnavinst c.
the government maintains that,even though restrictions apply to the navy,they do not apply to civilian ncis agents.chon rejected the same argument.there,as here,the government argued that does not apply to the ncis because most of its agents are civilians,and it is headed by a civilian director with a civilian chain of command.id.at.the government based its first argument on provisions in dod and naval policies that 
exempt four categories of people from restrictions members of reserve components when not on active duty members of the national guard when not in the federal service civilian employees of dod unless under the direct command and control of a military officer and military service members when off duty and in a private capacity.
id.at.chon interpreted these exemptions to mean that the pca and restrictions function to proscribe use of the strength and authority of the military rather than use of the private force of the individuals who make up the institution.id.in other words,while dod personnel may participate in civilian law enforcement activities in their private capacities,they may not do so under the auspices of the military.id.applying this understanding,chon held that the restrictions do apply to civilian ncis agents who represented and furthered the interests of the navy,and were not distinguishable by the civilians who might interact with them from members of the military.id.these same exemptions are maintained in the regulations and policies today.see secnavinst c e dodd,enclosure see also a dodi,enclosure.we see no basis for revisiting our prior interpretation of them.
chon also rejected the government second contention,that the ncis should be exempt from restrictions because it is headed by a civilian director with a civilian chain of command.at.the court reasoned that the ncis director has a direct reporting relationship to the chief of the naval operations,a military officer,and so d espite a civilian director,the ncis continues to be a unit of,and accountable to,the navy.id.the government argues that chon reasoning has been undermined,because the reporting relationship between the ncis director and the chief of naval operations was eliminated in when the secretary of the navy issued instruction.
the government is incorrect.at the time that chon was decided,the command structure of ncis was set forth in instruction b,which provided,the director,ncis reports directly to the secretary of the navy,and i n addition,the director,ncis reports to the chief of naval operations for physical,personnel and information security.secnavinst b.instruction has since cancelled instruction b,see secnavinst,and now provides,the director,ncis reports directly to the secretary of the navy,and i n addition,the director,ncis serves as special assistant for naval investigative matters and security to the chief of naval operations,secnavinst a.that the ncis director still serves as the special assistant to the chief of naval operations means a reporting relationship continues to exist.in addition,instruction created a board of directors that oversees ncis strategy and operations the board includes several military officers.see secnavinst c establishing board of directors including the vice chief of naval operations and the assistant commandant of the marine corps.so the change in ncis policies regarding its command structure did not undermine this portion of chon reasoning.
more fundamentally,the government assertion that there is a meaningful difference between civilian and other employees of the navy for the purposes of the restrictions is unsound.the dod policies have consistently proclaimed that they set forth restrictions on participation of dod personnel in civilian law enforcement activities.see dodd,enclosure dodi,enclosure.they do not limit their reach to personnel only.and any contention to the contrary is belied by the abundantly clear expressions in the most recent regulations and policy instructions.both state that they a ppl y to civilian employees of the dod components,and that their restrictions on direct participation in civilian law enforcement apply to all actions of dod personnel worldwide,with dod personnel defined to include federal military officers and enlisted personnel and civilian employees of the department of defense.e,c dodi e,c,glossary part ii 
accordingly,we chon holding that ncis agents are bound by restrictions on direct assistance to civilian law enforcement.
the regulations and policies implementing the pca and generally prohibit direct military involvement in civilian law enforcement activities but permit indirect assistance such as the transfer of information obtained during the normal course of military operations or other actions that do not subject civilians to the use of military power that is regulatory,prescriptive,or compulsory.united states hitchcock,at citations omitted.prohibited direct assistance includes u se of military personnel for surveillance or pursuit of individuals,or as undercover agents,informants,investigators,or interrogators.dodd,enclosure.
we have set forth three tests for determining whether military involvement in civilian law enforcement constitutes permissible indirect assistance the involvement must not constitute the exercise of regulatory,proscriptive,or compulsory military power,must not amount to direct active involvement in the execution of the laws,and must not pervade the activities of civilian authorities.hitchcock,at quoting khan,at if any one of these tests is met,the assistance is not indirect.khan,at.
agent logan roundup surveillance of all computers in washington amounted to impermissible direct active involvement in civilian enforcement of the child pornography laws,not permissible indirect assistance.he acted as an investigator,an activity specifically prohibited as direct assistance.dodd,enclosure,see also red feather.at activities which constitute an active role in direct law enforcement include investigation of crime and other like activities.agent logan actions were akin to the conduct that the fourth circuit held violated these regulations in united states walden,cir,where marines engaged in undercover investigations into store employees illegal firearms sales to minors and to individuals not residents of the state.
also,agent logan engaged in his investigation not in any support capacity to civilian law enforcement,but rather as an independent actor who initiated and carried out this activity.his actions thus were not incidental to the overall investigation into dreyer,or limited to backup support.khan,at united states klimavicius viloria,cir.the results of his investigation served as the primary basis for the state search warrant.officer schrimpsher conducted no significant additional investigation before procuring the warrant he only verified that dreyer lived at the address he was given and that the descriptions that agent logan provided of the files seemed to describe child pornography.without agent logan identification of dreyer,his computer,and the child pornography on his computer,there would have been no search and no prosecution.
accordingly,agent logan actions amounted to direct assistance to civilian law enforcement.the government nonetheless argues that agent logan investigation was proper because it falls into the independent military purpose exception to the prohibition on direct assistance.
the policies and regulations create an exception to the general prohibition on direct involvement where there is an independent military purpose,that is,where the military participation is undertaken for the primary purpose of furthering a military or foreign affairs function of the united states,regardless of incidental benefits to civilian authorities.hitchcock,at quoting dod directive,enclosure.such military activities include i nvestigations and other actions related to enforcement of the uniform code of military justice.dod directive,enclosure.
the uniform code of military justice prohibits distribution of child pornography by a member of the armed forces.it has assimilated the elements of the federal child pornography statute through article,its general provision that prohibits all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.see,united states brown,cir.in,the president issued executive order,adding to the manual for courts martial a specific article provision for child pornography.investigation by military law enforcement officers of possession and distribution of child pornography by military personnel is therefore proper.
but agent logan search was not reasonably focused on carrying out such a legitimate military investigation ncis is authorized to investigate criminal operations that significantly affect the naval establishment.secnavinst c,b.agent logan understood that he did not have the authority to search any location,but had to limit his searches to areas where there was a department of navy interest.yet,agent logan search did not meet the required limitation.he surveyed the entire state of washington for computers sharing child pornography.his initial search was not limited to united states military or government computers,and,as the government acknowledged,agent logan had no idea whether the computers searched belonged to someone with any affiliation with the military at all.instead,it was his standard practice to monitor all computers in a geographic area,here,every computer in the state of washington.
agent logan further investigation into dreyer specific computer and identity also was not reasonably limited to searching for crimes that significantly affect the naval establishment.secnavinst c,b.agent logan testified that roundup displays the geographic location of the ip address within a to mile radius.the screen shot for agent logan search shows that roundup identified the geographic location for dreyer ip address as federal way,washington.agent logan did not report at the evidentiary hearing on the suppression motion or at trial that he chose to pursue that ip address based on this geographic identification.
agent logan did write in his administrative subpoena request that the suspect ip was identified in area of large dod and usn saturation indicating likelihood of suspect.but the record contains no evidence establishing any meaningful military saturation of the area at issue.although the government represents that federal way,washington is located within thirty miles of several military installations,it also is similarly near both seattle and tacoma,as well as much of the surrounding metropolitan areas the area circling federal way the approximate area of a circle with a radius encompasses much of the state civilian population.that agent logan ended his investigation once he confirmed that dreyer had no current military affiliation is of no matter his overly broad investigation until that point had already exceeded the scope of his authority.
the government position that the military may monitor and search all computers in a state even though it has no reason to believe that the computer owner has a military affiliation would render the pca restrictions entirely meaningless.to accept that position would mean that ncis agents could,for example,routinely stop suspected drunk drivers in downtown seattle on the that a driver is a member of the military,and then turn over all information collected about civilians to the seattle police department for prosecution.
the government position that the military may search the entire civilian population of a state is also inconsistent with a basic principle underlying the pca and the related statutes and regulations,a traditional and strong resistance of americans to any military intrusion into civilian affairs.laird tatum,d.the pca was originally enacted on the understandings that t he great beauty of our system of government is that it is to be governed by the people,and that if we use the military power to discharge those duties that belong to civil officers and to the citizens,we have given up the character of our government it is no longer a government for liberty it is no longer a government founded in the consent of the people it has become a government of force.cong.rec.remarks of benjamin hill.consistent with those fundamental premises,dod policy warns against an expansive reading such as the one espoused by the government here directive specifically notes that the independent military purpose exception must be used with caution,and does not include actions taken for the primary purpose of aiding civilian law enforcement officials or otherwise serving as a subterfuge to avoid the restrictions of the pca.dodd,enclosure.
the lack of any reasonable connection between the military and the crimes that agent logan was investigating separates this case from those in which we have applied the independent military purpose exception.in hitchcock,for example,the defendant sold lsd to lake,a marine,who was,in turn,selling lsd to other military personnel on his base.at.ncis agents participated in the investigation in order to determine whether the defendant had sold drugs to other military personnel besides lake.id.at.hitchcock held the independent military purpose exception applicable because the military participation was justified to determin e the extent to which the defendant lsd was being used and distributed on the military base in violation of the uniform code of military justice,and to help maintain law and order on a military installation.id.quoting dodd,enclosure.and chon applied the exception where ncis agents were investigating the theft of military equipment from a naval facility,and so were acting with the independent military purpose of recovering military equipment.at 
thus,we hold that agent logan broad investigation into sharing of child pornography by anyone within the state of washington,not just those on a military base or with a reasonable likelihood of a navy affiliation,violated the regulations and policies proscribing direct military enforcement of civilian laws.
having held that agent logan investigation violated the restrictions on the use of the military to enforce civilians laws,we consider whether suppression of the resulting evidence should have been ordered here.we have held that an exclusionary rule should not be applied to violations of until a need to deter future violations is demonstrated.united states roberts,cir,superseded by statute on other grounds as recognized in khan,at.such a need exists here,as there is evidence of widespread and repeated violations of these provisions.id.
the record here demonstrates that agent logan and other ncis agents routinely carry out broad surveillance activities that violate the restrictions on military enforcement of civilian law.agent logan testified that it was his standard practice to monitor any computer ip address within a specific geographic location,not just those specific to military only,or government computers.he did not try to isolate military service members within a geographic area.he appeared to believe that these overly broad investigations were permissible,because he was a federal agent and so could investigate violations of either the uniform code of military justice or federal law.
the extraordinary nature of the surveillance here demonstrates a need to deter future violations.so far as we can tell from the record,it has become a routine practice for the navy to conduct surveillance of all the civilian computers in an entire state to see whether any child pornography can be found on them,and then to turn over the information to civilian law enforcement when no military connection exists.this is squarely a case of the military undertaking the initiative to enforce civilian law against civilians.there must be an exceptional reason to invoke the exclusionary rule for violation of posse regulations,united states harrington,cir,and the broad use of military surveillance of overwhelmingly civilian populations is an exceptional reason.
agent logan carried out these searches repeatedly.he was monitoring another computer at the same time that he found dreyer ip address.and he was involved with at least twenty other child pornography investigations.further,agent logan was not the only ncis agent who engaged in such searches.he began carrying out these searches with two other agents at least several months before he found dreyer ip address 
that a need to deter future violations exists is further supported by the government litigation positions.the government is arguing vehemently that the military may monitor for criminal activity all the computers anywhere in any state with a military base or installation,regardless of how likely or unlikely the computers are to be associated with a member of the military.such an expansive reading of the military role in the enforcement of the civilian laws demonstrates a profound lack of regard for the important limitations on the role of the military in our civilian society.
the existence of these factors make this case unlike those in which courts have declined to require suppression of the evidence resulting from a violation of these laws.in roberts,we concluded that suppression was not necessary because the violation there was not widespread or repeated.at.similarly,in united states walden,cir,after holding that the marines activities violated the navy regulations,the fourth circuit declined to require suppression,based primarily on the fact that this case is the first instance to our knowledge in which military personnel have been used as the principal investigators of civilian crimes in violation of the instruction,and so it was unaware of any other violation,let alone widespread or repeated violations.and in united states johnson,cir,the court held that exclusion would not be appropriate there because there was no evidence in the record that the conduct complained of occurred frequently or even repeatedly.
in contrast,we have here abundant evidence that th
