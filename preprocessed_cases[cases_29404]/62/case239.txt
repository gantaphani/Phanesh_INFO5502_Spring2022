enhanced penalties apply to violations involving certain medals,including the purple heart.id.c,d.defendant pleaded guilty to the portion of subsection a that criminalizes the act of knowingly wear ing a medal whoever knowingly wears any decoration or medal authorized by congress for the armed forces of the united states or any colorable imitation thereof,except when authorized under regulations made pursuant to law,is guilty of a crime id.a.defendant does not argue that his conduct intentionally wearing a fraudulently obtained medal deserves first amendment protection.that is,he does not challenge the statute as applied to him.instead,he brings a facial first amendment challenge to the statute.he argues that,on its face,the statute is overbroad 
the first step in overbreadth analysis is to construe the challenged statute it is impossible to determine whether a statute reaches too far without first knowing what the statute covers.williams,at.the challenged statute states whoever knowingly wears any decoration or medal authorized by congress for the armed forces of the united states or any colorable imitation thereof,except when authorized under regulations made pursuant to law,is guilty of a crime.a.by its terms,anyone who knowingly wears a military medal or colorable imitation thereof has committed a crime,except when authorized under regulations made pursuant to law.id.
the parties have directed us to very few regulations authorizing the wearing of medals.under those regulations,the valid recipient of a military medal is the only person who may wear the medal.see,a the wearing of any decoration,service medal,badge,service ribbon,lapel button,or insignia prescribed or authorized by the department of the army and the department of the air force by any person not properly authorized to wear such device is prohibited.emphasis added army regulation,available at,rule d n o person except a member of the army may wear the uniform,or a distinctive part of the uniform of the army unless otherwise authorized by law.to our knowledge,there are no regulations permitting any person other than the valid recipient to wear a military medal in any circumstances.
defendant asserts,then,that any person other than the valid recipient who wears a military medal,or a colorable imitation thereof,is guilty of a crime,regardless of context or circumstances.from that premise,defendant and amicus provide a long list of examples of conduct that one typically thinks of as harmless or protected speech,but that would constitute a crime under defendant reading of the statute.for instance,under that reading,the following persons have committed a crime actors who have worn military medals or colorable imitations in films or other theatrical productions schoolchildren who have worn medals given to them by soldiers grieving spouses or parents who have worn medals at military funerals grandchildren who have worn their grandparents medals in veterans day parades children and adults who have worn medals or colorable imitations to halloween costume parties others who may have worn medals as part of other artistic expression,such as a hypothetical band called the purple hearts others who have worn them simply as a fashion statement or because they like the way the medals look a who created a replica of a silver star in the privacy of his workshop,put it on,and then immediately melted it down and a protestor who has dressed up like a guantanamo prisoner and,to make a political statement,wore a friend medal.defendant argues that those examples render the statute overbroad under the second type of facial challenge recognized by the supreme court in the first amendment context,whereby a law may be invalidated as overbroad if a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional,judged in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.united states stevens,internal quotation marks omitted.
the statute could be read as broadly as defendant suggests.we agree with defendant that such a broad statute might raise serious constitutional concerns.see id.holding that a federal law criminalizing the possession of animal cruelty videos and photographs was facially overbroad because the statute applies to common depictions of ordinary and lawful activities,and that these depictions constitute the vast majority of materials subject to the statute.because defendant reading raises a serious doubt as to the statute constitutionality,we must first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.zadvydas davis,internal quotation marks omitted.
whether as a matter of pure statutory interpretation,constitutional avoidance,or both,we disagree with defendant expansive
