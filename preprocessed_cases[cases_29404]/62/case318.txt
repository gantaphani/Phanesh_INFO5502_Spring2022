this case is about the proceeds of a servicemembers group life insurance sgli policy covering ronald rice decedent.cindy rice plaintiff was decedent wife and had been the beneficiary of this policy,but decedent changed the beneficiary to his mother days before he committed suicide.plaintiff argues that the change was invalid because decedent lacked sufficient mental capacity at that time and his mother exerted undue influence over him.the district court granted summary judgment to the insurance company on the issue of undue influence,and a jury found against plaintiff on the issue of mental capacity.on appeal,plaintiff argues that the district court incorrectly instructed the jury that there is a rebuttable presumption of mental capacity there was sufficient evidence to overcome summary judgment on the issue of undue influence and she was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of mental capacity.we affirm on all issues.
background 
decedent committed suicide on may.as a member of the army reserves,he carried a life insurance policy from the office of servicemembers group life insurance osgli,which is a subsidiary of the prudential insurance company of america.on april,days before his death,decedent changed the beneficiary of this policy from his wife,plaintiff,to his ailing mother,wilma evans.at the same time,he filed a record of emergency data in which he instructed the army to inform only his mother if he died.it did not list plaintiff,their daughter,erika,or his four sons from a previous marriage.earlier,on january,decedent had signed a military benefits form that listed his former wife,kathy rice,as his spouse and ended his children eligibility for benefits.the misinformation on this form may have been due to glitches in the military computer system.
decedent had a history of clinical depression,for which he had received some treatment,and had attempted suicide before.friends and family testified that decedent was acting somewhat strangely in the weeks leading up to his suicide.the rices marriage was under strain,and at times decedent was considering divorcing plaintiff and moving back to west virginia with his mother,evans.
evans testified that during the last few months of his life,decedent was calling her at least daily,as opposed to two to three times a month before then.phone records show that the two spoke for minutes on april,the day before he designated her the beneficiary of his life insurance policy.evans testified that they did not discuss the life insurance policy until several days after he had changed it.
plaintiff sought payment from the osgli after decedent death.the osgli provided plaintiff an opportunity to document decedent lack of mental capacity when he changed the beneficiary of his insurance policy.because plaintiff provided only lay affidavits rather than a medical opinion,the osgli paid evans.
plaintiff brought this suit,arguing both that decedent did not have the mental capacity to change beneficiaries on april and that evans exercised undue influence on him.the district court granted summary judgment on the undue influence question.after a trial on the issue of mental capacity,the jury found for the osgli.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
both parties concede,and the district court accepted,that federal jurisdiction over this case is conferred by.nonetheless,we have an independent duty to examine our jurisdiction.maier epa,cir.we ultimately conclude that we have jurisdiction,but on different grounds than that advanced by the parties.
the jurisdictional provision relied on by the parties provides,the district courts of the united states shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action or claim against the united states founded upon the sgli subchapter.plaintiff lawsuit,however,is not against the united states.rather,it is against the osgli,a division of the prudential insurance company and therefore a private entity.this is in accordance with the governing regulations,which state that a ctions at law or in equity to recover on the policy,in which there is not alleged any breach of any obligation undertaken by the united states,should be brought against the insurer.
several district courts have assumed without analysis that or its predecessor,former,confer federal jurisdiction over suits against the osgli or prudential,kilburn sgli,stratton sgli,noting that no objection has been made to the court taking of jurisdiction under former none of these cases provide analysis of the jurisdictional question,and thus they do not constitute strong precedent on the issue.united states tucker truck lines.t his court is not bound by a prior exercise of jurisdiction in a case where it was not questioned and it was passed sub silentio.
in any event,we reject this position as inconsistent with the plain language of.we therefore follow the majority of courts that look to some other statutory basis for federal jurisdiction.see,shannon united states,cir discretionary pendant party jurisdiction melton white,federal question prudential ins.of am.moorhead,diversity and federal question.
we see two other provisions that might support plaintiff allegation of federal jurisdiction.the first is,the diversity jurisdiction statute.we examine the face of the complaint to determine whether a party has adequately presented facts sufficient to establish diversity jurisdiction.the party asserting jurisdiction must allege facts essential to show jurisdiction.gaines ski apache,cir.thus,the complaint must allege that the plaintiff and defendant are citizens of different states and that the amount in controversy is greater than.a.a corporation is treated as a citizen of the state where it is incorporated and the state where it has its principal place of business.id.c.
here,the complaint alleges that plaintiff is a citizen of oklahoma,but does not set forth the citizenship of the osgli or the amount in controversy.w here the pleadings are inadequate,we may review the record to find evidence that diversity exists.gaines,at.we have reviewed the record and do not find that it establishes diversity jurisdiction.
the other potential basis for federal jurisdiction is,the federal question statute.this section confers jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law.for a case to arise under federal law,the federal question must be apparent on the face of a complaint,and plaintiff cause of action must be created by federal law or,if it is a cause of action,its resolution must necessarily turn on a substantial question of federal law,and that federal law in turn must create a private cause of action.merrell dow pharms.thompson,d erwin chemerinsky,federal jurisdiction ed.
for the purposes of this appeal,we need not determine whether plaintiff has asserted a cause of action under state or federal law.it is sufficient for us to find that the issues of mental capacity and undue influence are governed by federal law these issues raise substantial questions of federal law that must be resolved and the federal sgli statute gives rise to an implied private cause of action.
first,federal law governs the issues of mental capacity and undue influence in this case.as the seventh circuit explained in a different context,
sgli is a federal program in fact,technically the government rather than the serviceman is the policyholder as we have both a government contract and a federal statute the case for using federal law to answer the question of who is to receive the proceeds of the insurance policy is compelling.
often a court asked to fill a gap in a federal statute will do so by borrowing a state common law but borrowing state law would be a mistake in the case of soldiers life insurance policies.frequently the policy is issued wherever the soldier happens to be stationed when thoughts of mortality assail him it would be arbitrary to subject issues arising under the policy to the law of a particular state.better that these policies should be governed by a uniform set of rules untethered to any particular jurisdiction.congress desire for uniformity is reflected in the statute detailed provision regarding who shall receive the proceeds if a beneficiary is not named.

second,to recover on the insurance policy,plaintiff must prove she is the beneficiary and to do so she must show that decedent purported change was ineffective,either because he lacked the capacity to do so or because he was under undue influence at the time.these are substantial,the only disputed issues in the which the outcome of this lawsuit turn.
third,there is an implied cause of action under the sgli statute for beneficiaries against the osgli.parker osgli,d.whether a federal statute contains an implied cause of action is ultimately a question of determining what congress intended.karahalios fed of fed.employees,d.such congressional intent can be implied by the text or structure of the statute.alexander sandoval,d.although the text of the sgli statute is silent,we believe its structure shows that congress intended to allow private causes of action to enforce the provisions of sgli policies.the statute requires beneficiaries to make claim s for payment under some circumstances,but contains no mechanism administrative or otherwise to enforce the insurance contract.b,c.in addition,the applicable regulations contemplate that beneficiaries may bring a ctions at law or in equity to recover from the osgli.further,the interpretation and administration of an insurance policy issued under the authority of the servicemen insurance statute is supplied by federal common law.athmer,at.although none of this refers explicitly to a federal forum,it would be somewhat anomalous for congress to rely completely on state causes of action when,as explained above,federal law governs most aspects of the insurance policy and preempts inconsistent state law,and when the federal government has important interests at stake.for these reasons,we find that the sgli statute contains an implied private cause of action.
because this case involves substantial federal questions,the federal courts have jurisdiction under.we exercise jurisdiction over this appeal under.
ii.mental capacity 
the district court instructed the jury that the law presumes that ronald rice,the deceased,had the mental capacity to change the policy beneficiary to his mother.the instructions also stated that this presumption could be outweighed by evidence to the contrary and that plaintiff had to establish decedent lack of mental capacity by the greater weight of the evidence.plaintiff raises two objections to the presumption instruction first,that there is no general presumption of mental capacity to change one beneficiary and second,that the presumption was rebutted and should not have been included in the jury instructions.only the first of these objections was raised below.

the question of mental capacity is not addressed in the sgli act.
w hen a question relating to the interpretation and administration of an insurance policy issued under the authority of the servicemen insurance statute arises that is not answered by the statute itself the answer is to be supplied by federal common law.since the concept of federal common law is nebulous when a statute is in the picture,it might be better to jettison the concept in that context and say simply that in filling gaps left by congress in a federal program the courts seek to effectuate federal policies.
athmer,at citations omitted.we must therefore fashion appropriate rules on the requisite mental capacity to change one insurance beneficiary.
we have not previously addressed this precise issue.in wiley united states,cir,we recognized a presumption in favor of mental capacity when the insured had been declared competent by the veterans administration and a state court.here,however,decedent was never declared competent or incompetent by any court or agency.
nonetheless,under these circumstances,we find no reversible error in the district court instruction.most important,the presumption of mental capacity tracks plaintiff burden of proof on the issue.plaintiff took no objection to the court instruction on the burden of proof,and reading the instructions together,we believe they stated the law correctly.
our holding is supported by other courts that have noted a federal presumption of mental capacity in the insurance context.see,howells state bank novotny,cir noting a presumption of mental capacity to assign one life insurance policy metro.life ins.anderson,noting the legal presumption of mental capacity to change one insurance beneficiary couch on insurance ed.the fact that a policy was issued raises the presumption that the insured was of sound mind at the time the contract was entered into,and clear proof is required to establish that he or she lacked sufficient capacity.footnotes omitted.we also draw support from the department of veterans affairs,which in administrative proceedings involving the validity of a change in beneficiary applies a general but rebuttable presumption that every testator possesses testamentary capacity.c.
state law also supports the district court instruction.see,commercial union ins.schmidt,cir applying minnesota law lynn magness,stating that the law presumes every man to be sane and to possess the requisite mental capacity to change his beneficiary matthews acacia mut.life ins,the law presumes every person sane,and casts the burden of establishing insanity on the one asserting its existence.estate of galland rosenberg,a presumption exists that the decedent possessed the requisite mental capacity to make his designation.finally,the instruction is consistent with our jurisprudence in other areas of the law.for example,under federal law,the capacity of a person offered as a witness is presumed,and in order to exclude a witness on the ground of mental incapacity,the existence of the incapacity must be made to appear.united states haro,cir.
in sum,the district court correctly found that federal law generally presumes a person mental capacity in this context.
instructing the jury on presumptions 
because plaintiff did not raise this objection below,we review the challenged instruction only to see whether it is patently plainly erroneous and prejudicial.zimmerman first fed.sav.loan ass n,cir.no party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict,stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.emphasis added.only rarely will we reverse based on allegedly erroneous instructions to which there was no objection at trial the party claiming plain error has the heavy burden of demonstrating fundamental injustice.medlock ortho biotech,cir quotation marks omitted.
the full text of the challenged instruction is as follows 
presumptions are rules based upon experience or public policy and are established in the law to assist a jury in discovering the truth.presumptions take the place of evidence unless and until outweighed by evidence to the contrary.
in this case,the law presumes that ronald rice,the deceased,had the mental capacity to change the policy beneficiary to his mother.
