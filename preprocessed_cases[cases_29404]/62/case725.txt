steven thorne and laura raccina entered into a stipulated marital dissolution judgment in under which agreed to accept percent of steven military retired pay starting in based on his rank and pay level at the time of the judgment.in,laura sought to set aside the judgment because she learned that courts apply the time rule for apportioning a pension community and separate property interests.the trial court found that the parties contractual intention was to enter into an agreement that complied with california law and held that the division of the pension was contrary to law.it therefore modified the judgment to divide steven pension according to the time rule.on steven appeal,we conclude that the trial court erred and reject laura alternative arguments to uphold the modification,which urge that the pension is a partially omitted asset and extrinsic mistake justifies the modification.we therefore reverse the order granting laura motion and direct the trial court to deny the motion.
background 
the parties married in and separated in.they sought the assistance of the judge advocate general jag officer in their efforts to draft a marital settlement agreement msa.using information from the jag,laura typed a marital agreement.steven offered modifications.the parties negotiated and then signed a final marital agreement.on june,steven obtained in propria persona an uncontested judgment of dissolution by declaration,to which was attached the agreement.
the included the following provisions pertaining to steven pension the parties hereby agree that the nonmilitary spouse is awarded of the military member retired pay as her separate property,based upon the military member rank and pay level at the time this agreement is executed.one half of this amount shall be provided on the and of each month starting june.should husband not be entitled to military retirement pay,due to his own actions,an equivalent amount shall be provided based upon the military member rank and pay level at the time this agreement is executed.one half of this amount shall be provided on the and of each month starting june.should husband not be entitled to military retirement pay,through no fault of his own,of any settlement moneys shall be provided to wife.if spouse remarries then the entitlement to the retirement portion is forfeited.

the did not reserve jurisdiction over any issue.
on april,laura,now represented by counsel,filed a motion to modify or set aside the judgment.she specifically sought the following relief that paragraph of the marital settlement agreement attached to the judgment and made a part thereof relating to military retirement pay,be or amended to comply with california law.her declaration asserted the following at the time we entered into the marital settlement agreement i was not represented by counsel and the marital settlement agreement was prepared by steven justice advocate general jag counsel through the military.i was led to believe by the jag representative that what was being proposed to me was in fact law,which i now understand is not correct.her points and authorities asserted that she was entitled to a modification under a theory because her community property rights to steven military retirement was sic not correctly adjudicated,the msa that was incorporated into the judgment incorrectly awarded her with less than her community share of the military pension according to california laws.in addition,it was a serious error that the msa prepared by the jag office created an unfair advantage for the military spouse by stating that laura property rights to the military spouse retirement benefits ended upon laura remarriage.she continued that under california family law,the community property interest in retirement benefits is the time rule.she concluded that she was entitled to her community share of steven disposable retirement pay as of the date of his retirement from the military.the court should the portion of the judgment that divides the military pension so that it can be modified according to california law.
steven filed a responsive declaration in propria persona that pointed out that neither steven nor laura was represented by the jag,the jag had no stake in providing any advantage to either side,and the jag role is to provide information and awareness,not counsel.he added that the jag provides a handout guide to give an overview of the legal process,which will help you do your own uncontested dissolution or separation.he offered that laura drafted the agreement from a jag template.he essentially argued that the judgment was unambiguous in defining laura rights in his pension laura was not awarded a percentage of steven retired pay,but in fact a percentage of a fixed dollar amount,based on the grade and years of service at the time of judgment.and he argued that the judgment was final and not subject to attack for mistake of law under code of civil procedure section relief must be sought within six month of judgment or family code section,subdivision e relief must be sought from stipulated or uncontested judgments within one year of judgment.at the hearing in response to the trial court question,he stated that he had not been aware of the time rule.
laura filed a reply in which she asked the trial court to provide for the error in this judgment to be ruled as an omitted asset,since the pension division was not according to the time rule and did not provide for my community share of the military pay according to california law and rule that the section that terminates my property rights upon remarriage is contrary to both federal and california law and can not be enforced.she added that her belief was that the jag attorney was supposed to be an impartial party specifically there to preclude this violation of the law but that he was not providing information and awareness when he failed to mention to us that the document did not comply with both federal and california family law.i would have never signed any of the documents if he had informed me the msa did not comply with the law.she argued,without specifics,that the trial court could grant relief under family code section,subdivision a,because she was kept in ignorance or fraudulently prevented from fully participating in the proceeding relief must be sought within one year of discovery of the fraud,or under family code section omitted asset because the retirement benefit was a partially omitted asset in that the true value of the asset was not disclosed nor divided according to established california community property laws.her theory was that by not providing laura her total community property share of the military retirement,the asset has been partially omitted and,therefore,the court has jurisdiction to set aside that part that is incorrect and provide a fair and equitable judgment.she claimed that the court has a duty to make sure that there are not judgements sic or orders that are contrary to the law and,therefore,this was contrary to the law and void on its face as a contract.and so,therefore,it can not be adjudicated.it actually void and therefore unenforceable.
the trial court reasoned that the issue was one of contract interpretation governed by family code section,subdivision a,which provides that a court shall make whatever orders are necessary or appropriate to ensure that each party receives the party full community property share in any retirement plan.it then found the following there exists credible evidence before the court contained in the pleadings and documents filed in this matter,together with the oral evidence presented at the hearing,that the parties intended to enter into a legally binding agreement which complied with california law.they sought and obtained assistance from the judge advocate general officer,and relied on his recommendations.the officer did not suggest that the division set forth in the agreement was contrary to law,and in fact,steven stated that the parties were unaware of the time rule at the time they entered into the agreement.the court thus interprets the agreement,in accord with the parties intention,as one which complies with the law.it ordered that the be amended to divide steven pension according to the time rule.it also noted that the provision was void under civil code section and ordered that the amended judgment clarify that laura pension share not be forfeited upon remarriage.
discussion 
generally,once a marital dissolution judgment has become final,the court loses jurisdiction to modify or alter it.in re marriage of mcdonough d,mueller walker d.under the doctrine of res judicata,i f a property settlement is incorporated in the divorce decree,the settlement is merged with the decree and becomes the final judicial determination of the property rights of the parties.giovannoni giovannoni d.in short,marital property rights and obligations adjudicated by a final judgment can not be upset by subsequent efforts to modify the judgment.
the sole remedy with respect to a judgment adjudicating a property division is a timely motion under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,a timely appeal or,after the time for code of civil procedure section,subdivision b relief expires,a family code section et proceeding on grounds and within time limits hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group,see also in re marriage of heggie th,heggie in re marriage of rosevear th.
the trial court therefore had no jurisdiction to modify the judgment in this case.the period under code of civil procedure section and the period under family code section,subdivision e,the only arguably applicable family law provision,had long since expired.laura makes no argument to the contrary.
there are three exceptions to the general rule.
first,a judgment may contain an express reservation of jurisdiction authorizing the court to subsequently modify it.berry berry d,mueller walker,supra,d at.in this case,the judgment does not contain such a provision 
second,the trial court may divide a community property asset not mentioned in the judgment.before the enactment of family code section,courts allowed a former spouse to bring a separate partition action to divide assets omitted from a dissolution judgment berry berry,supra,d at see also henn henn cal d.currently,the court has continuing jurisdiction to award community estate assets or community estate liabilities to the parties that have not been previously adjudicated by a judgment in the proceeding.
and third,the trial court may give equitable relief from an otherwise valid judgment for extrinsic fraud or mistake.kulchar kulchar cal d.
laura urges that the second and third exceptions apply in this case.
laura first contends that the trial court analysis can support an theory because the judgment omitted a portion of steven military retirement divided only the amount of retirement pay that steven would have received if he had retired in,at the time of the agreement.we disagree.
the mere mention of an asset in the judgment is not controlling.see bowman bowman d.t he crucial question is whether the benefits were actually litigated and divided in the previous proceeding.miller miller d.thus,the issue is whether the judgment fails to resolve any portion of the parties interests in steven pension,resulting in a partially omitted asset to be divided according to family code section.see in re marriage of simundza th,simundza in re marriage of melton th,melton.
in the context of this case,whether steven pension was actually litigated and divided necessarily depends on the language of the.
marital settlement agreements incorporated into a dissolution judgment are construed under the statutory rules governing the interpretations of contracts generally.citation.the basic goal of contract interpretation is to give effect to the parties mutual intent at the time of contracting.citations.when a contract is reduced to writing,the parties intention is determined from the writing alone,if possible.citation.the words of a contract are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense.simundza,supra,th at.
here,the words of the judgment expressly divide steven entire pension.the words allocate to laura a fixed pension amount of steven retired pay.the words set the date when the pension payments begin starting in june.without more,these words express a fixed formula percent of retired pay.however,the words also qualify the of formula retired pay at the rank and pay level held in.thus,the parties agreed on the percentage allocated to laura as of steven retirement date but they calculated the percentage as if steven retired at his rank and pay level.the whole pension retired pay was considered.there is nothing left to divide.laura argument that part of the pension was omitted from the judgment because the judgment did not take into account steven years of service after is belied by the words of the judgment.
laura reliance on melton is erroneous.there,the judgment allocated to the wife one half of the monthly fixed retirement benefit to which the husband is entitled,the whole amount being,the one half amount being and one half of the sum of the monthly variable retirement benefit applicable to the husband plus or minus one half of any percentage change in unit value.melton,supra,th at.the amounts of and were based on the pension plan administrator calculations of the husband future pension and the calculations were attached as exhibits to the judgment and incorporated.in making his calculations,the plan administrator assumed that the husband would retire at a certain age,in a specified job classification,and with no changes in the benefit plan.when the husband ultimately began receiving retirement benefits at an older age,with a different job classification,and under an amended retirement plan,the value of the pension was significantly higher than the administrator estimate.upon the wife motion to interpret and implement the judgment or to set aside the judgment for extrinsic fraud or mistake,the trial court relied on the judgment reservation of jurisdiction to implement the plan,and on its inherent equitable powers and determined the parties intent was to divide the pension benefits equally.id.at.as we did in this case,we held that the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction by rewriting the judgment.however,we concluded that only a portion of the husband pension was explicitly divided by the stipulated judgment.id.at.we therefore remanded the case for a hearing on how to divide the omitted portion of the husband pension.
thus,in melton,the judgment divided the pension in half and merely estimated what a half would amount to when the estimate proved to be incorrect,the error was an omitted asset.here,the judgment allocated an pension amount as calculated the calculation results in a fixed pension calculation made for the judgment in and a calculation made on retirement in would be identical there is no omission in this case.
this case is akin to simundza.there,the stipulated judgment allocated to the wife from the husband pension upon retirement monthly for years.when the husband ultimately retired,the wife claimed that the value of the pension had increased since the judgment and reasoned that the judgment only partially divided the pension.she urged that the parties intent was to equally divide the pension community interest,whi
