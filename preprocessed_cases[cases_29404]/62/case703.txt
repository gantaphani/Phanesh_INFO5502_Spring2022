background 
on july,captain ronald deangelo of the park police found a photocopy of a purported parody entitled the quest,the final passage home,in his inbox,written by someone who identified himself as the phantom.besides containing sexually explicit passages and references to some characters as moorish,the quest insinuated that several easily identifiable officers were lesbians and that an officer married to another member of the park police had had an adulterous liaison with a third member of the park police.captain deangelo filed an administrative complaint on july.that complaint led to an investigation by the internal affairs office of the park police.
on august,appellant farrell,then a lieutenant with the park police,was interviewed by internal affairs.during that interview,farrell admitted that he was the sole author and creative force behind the quest,which,he explained,was in part strictly fictional and in part based on actual acts of members of the park police,referred to in the quest by made up names that actually identified people and in some cases by made up names that were created to see if it would catch on.according to farrell,the quest was a parody of medieval tales whose purpose was to bring issues to the force attention out of frustration that he could not address in any other way,though farrell acknowledged that if you are a sick individual and you wish to read it a certain way you can read it any way you wish.farrell admitted that he wrote the quest at home in installments,typed it into the computer at work,and surreptitiously distributed copies of it within the park police over a period of several months.
on november,almost sixteen months after farrell admitted writing the quest,deputy chief alvin hinton,commander,operations division,proposed that farrell be demoted to the rank of sergeant to promote the efficiency of the service,based on the following charge 
charge unbecoming an officer,use of demeaning,defamatory,or degrading remarks comments,or statements involving subordinates,peers,and supervisory personnel.
the letter also listed the general orders that deputy chief hinton believed farrell had violated 
general order,iv a an officer shall refrain from conduct that impairs the efficiency of the force or causes the loss of public confidence in the force.
general order iv b an officer shall maintain decorum,command of temper,and exercise patience and discretion at all times.harsh,violent,profane,or insolent language shall not be used.the officer shall conduct in a professional manner.
general order ii all officers shall render respect to supervisors and associates excerpt.
general order ii an officer shall comply with all general orders,special orders,memorandums,or directives that may be issued by the chief or designee.
farrell was also charged with violating a general order that required all officers to comply with all general orders,special orders,memorandums,or directives that may be issued by the chief or designee,which included memorandum,the pertinent sexual harassment policy.the quest,according to the charge letter,was written in double entendre style that could be and,in fact,was construed by some as sexually explicit,graphic,and even pornographic.the letter explained 
supervisors,especially police officers,occupy positions of great trust and responsibility.the behavior described above evidences that you have seriously breached the relationship in your dealings with your superiors,peers,and subordinates.additionally,it has impacted on the confidence i have in your ability to function as a supervisor.
the demotion was from shift commander,a position in which the employee directly supervises others but is subject to very little supervision himself,to sergeant,a position which,though still supervisory,is subject to significantly more direct supervision.farrell was also charged with misuse of government equipment,for which he was ultimately punished with a suspension 
on july,after farrell had replied to the charge letter,acting chief of the park police carl holmberg issued a decision letter which sustained the charge and the demotion,despite farrell past performance and his length of employment as a united states police officer.as a supervisor,you are expected to serve as an example for subordinate officers to emulate,the letter said.your behavior is shocking and reflects little respect on your part for others,particularly minorities and women because of references to some characters as moorish,which farrell had admitted meant that they were black,and sexually explicit remarks about female members of the park police.chief holmberg later testified that because the quest took a while to compose,to produce,and to distribute,farrell transgression proved that he did not work well absent supervision and thus had to be demoted.chief holmberg acknowledged in his decision letter that farrell had been ill with cancer while he was writing the quest,but he declined to mitigate the penalty because farrell had not adduced any evidence that his medical condition had affected his ability to perform professionally or impaired his judgment.chief holmberg did not sustain the charge of sexual harassment,however.he also testified that he would have imposed the same penalty had farrell not also misused government property.
the national park service uses a manual entitled discipline and adverse actions,which supplements directives from the office of personnel management and the department of the interior.it includes as an appendix a disciplinary action guide,commonly known as the table of penalties,a copy of which is attached to this opinion.it sets out,in table form,offenses and the range of penalties suggested for the first,second,and subsequent offenses.at his deposition,chief holmberg acknowledged that he had relied on offense c of the table,but he later corrected himself and testified that he had used offense a in the table and the accompanying note when selecting farrell penalty because that was the closest guide that i could come to in the table of penalties.offense a reads 
discrimination because of sex,color,religion,national origin,age,physical or mental handicap,political affiliation,marital status,or other factor.a use of critical,demeaning,slanderous,inflammatory,defamatory,ignominious or degrading remarks,comments,gestures,observations,or statements.
the table suggests that the penalty for a first such offense may range from a written reprimand to a suspension but note counsels that i f the employee occupies a supervisory or managerial position,serious consideration should be for the first removal of supervisory responsibilities or reassignment from the supervisory position which may involve a demotion.despite his consultation of a,chief holmberg later testified that he had not sustained a charge of sexual harassment,only conduct unbecoming an officer.chief holmberg also admitted that he had not applied paragraph of the table,which covers making false,malicious or highly irresponsible statements against supervisors,other employees,or subordinates has a maximum penalty of a suspension and makes no reference to note.
farrell appealed his demotion to the board.the administrative judge affirmed after a trial at which farrell did not testify.farrell dep t of interior,mspb,initial decision.she found that the charge of conduct unbecoming an officer had been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.id.at.although the administrative judge found that sexual harassment had been neither charged nor proved,proof of the violation was not necessary to sustain the charge of conduct unbecoming an officer.id.at.chief holmberg consultation of guideline a was not error,the administrative judge held,because an agency table of penalties is only one factor to be considered in assessing the reasonableness of a penalty,and an agency may deviate from the guidelines where a more severe penalty is reasonable.id.at citing chatman dep t of army.the administrative judge also found that the penalty had the requisite nexus with the offense and was consistent with the factors enunciated in douglas veterans administration,mspb.initial decision at.
the board affirmed.farrell dep t of interior,docket no,final order.farrell timely appealed his demotion to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

c yates merit.prot.
although the appellant does not contest that some discipline is warranted for his authorship of the quest,appellant br.at,he argues that the park police acted unlawfully by failing to abide by their table of penalties.as noted above,the appellant was charged with conduct unbecoming an officer,use of demeaning,defamatory,or degrading remarks,comments,or statements involving subordinates,peers,and supervisory personnel.the government urges that the park police did not in fact depart from the table in assessing the penalty of demotion for this charge.we disagree.
paragraph a,which the government argues is applicable,covers use of critical,demeaning,slanderous,inflammatory,defamatory,ignominious or degrading remarks,comments,gestures,observations,or statements.paragraph a makes reference to note,which provides if the employee occupies a supervisory or managerial position,serious consideration should be for the first removal of supervisory responsibilities or reassignment from the supervisory position which may involve a demotion.the government argues that paragraph a covers the appellant conduct because it is substantively identical to the charged offense and that note authorizes demotion even for a first offense for supervisory personnel.appellee br.at.if the language of a were divorced from the preamble,the government might well be correct.that language,however,must be read together with the preamble to paragraph discrimination because of sex,color,religion,national origin,age,physical or mental handicap,political affiliation,marital status,or other factor.the administrative judge specifically found that the appellant had not been charged with,nor had the agency proved,sexual harassment.initial decision at.and the government at oral argument conceded that the appellant was not charged with discrimination because of sex.we hold that the language of the preamble limits paragraph a,that paragraph refers only to charges of discrimination,and that appellant was not charged with discrimination.
appellant argues that paragraph was the applicable portion of the table.it covers making false,malicious or highly irresponsible statements against supervisors,other employees,or subordinates.its maximum penalty for a first offense is a suspension,and it contains no reference to note.we agree with the appellant that paragraph is the most relevant portion of the table.thus the table itself does not prescribe the penalty that was imposed here.but that does not resolve the question of whether the departures from the table are permissible.
we accordingly must decide whether the table of penalties is binding on the park police.in power united states,our predecessor court made clear that t he first test for an invalid penalty is whether or not the sanction exceeds the range of permissible punishment specified by statute or regulation.id.at.here the parties agree that neither a statute nor an applicable regulation fixes the requisite punishment and that the table was not promulgated as a formal regulation or as the result of notice and comment rulemaking.
if an agency policy statement is intended to impose obligations or to limit the rights of members of the public,it is subject to the administrative procedure act,and,with certain exceptions,must be published in the federal register as a regulation.b c.if it is not,it is invalid.see generally org.of veterans advocates,sec y of veterans affairs.
here,however,we have a different situation.the issue is not whether the agency statement is binding on the public,but whether it is binding on the agency itself.the effect of such agency statements has been addressed frequently.the general consensus is that an agency statement,not issued as a formal regulation,binds the agency only if the agency intended the statement to be binding.see,vitarelli seaton,d service dulles,d united states alameda gateway,cir chiron transp.safety,troy browner,am.portland cement alliance envtl.prot.agency,prof ls patients for customized care shalala,cir rapp united states dep t of treasury,office of thrift supervision,cir.but see united states.ass fed.communications comm n,policy statement not binding on agency unless promulgated as legislative rule otherwise invalid cmty.nutrition inst.young.
the primary consideration in determining the agency intent is whether the text of the agency statement indicates that it was designed to be binding on the agency.vitarelli,at.service,at.alameda gateway,at chiron,at james united states parole comm n,cir prof ls patients for customized care,at brock cathedral bluffs shale oil,pac.gas fed.power comm n.for example,in service dulles,d,a seminal case considering whether the secretary of state could discharge an employee without following the procedures set forth in an unpublished manual,the supreme court held that the manual bound the secretary in part because it purported to set forth definitively the procedures and standards to be followed.id.at.see also vitarelli,at.
this methodology for determining whether an agency is bound by a previous statement is consistent with that taken in our previous cases.for example,in hamlet united states,cert.denied,d,this court held that a statement in a federal personnel handbook,regardless of whether it was published or promulgated under the standards set out in the apa is a regulation entitled to the force and effect of law only if,among other things,the promulgating agency intended the provision to establish a binding rule.id.at.
this approach has also been specifically applied to penalty schedules.in rapp,the tenth circuit held that the office of thrift supervision ots was free to depart from a penalty matrix it had published in the federal register and impose a harsher penalty because the record establishe d that the ots never intended to bind itself to the matrix.at.in daub united states,our predecessor court considered a table of penalties which contained a preface that advised that it will be used as a guide in imposing disciplinary action and may not successfully meet the demands of all situations,so that deciding officials must use judgment in determining proper action for violations not covered.id.at.the court found that this advisory language made the table it was a guide to administrative officers,and not an immutable schedule.id.
in this case,the document is called a guide.for each offense,a range of penalties is given,sometimes without indication of how the penalty should be determined.it contains no mandatory language.the table appears as appendix a in a personnel manual applicable to the national park service as a whole,national park service personnel issuance release discipline and adverse actions,basic fpm,nps fpm hereinafter manual.the manual explains that the table only 
provides a general framework within which supervisors may exercise sound judgment in dealing with particular circumstances,although ordinarily the penalty selected will fall within the range provided by the guide.the guide does not replace supervisory judgment and,with the exception of misuse of a government vehicle,does not require specific penalties 
manual at.appendix a itself notes that a penalty may vary from those contained in this guide.id.at
