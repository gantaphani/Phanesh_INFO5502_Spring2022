in jim turner,a petty officer aboard the uss antietam,was found guilty of sexual misconduct in two shipboard proceedings.the first was a proceeding under article of the uniform code of military justice,resulting in a reduction in pay grade and a forfeiture of two months salary in the second,an administrative discharge board,though rejecting some of the charges,resolved that he should be discharged from the navy with an other than honorable discharge.discharge followed in due course.turner petitioned the secretary of the navy to clear his record and rescind his discharge.the secretary ultimately rejected the petition.turner then brought an action in district court to overturn the secretary decision,but the court eventually granted summary judgment for the navy.turner appeals this judgment,arguing that the shipboard proceedings were not supported by substantial evidence and that several other errors require that the secretary decision be reversed.we reject these arguments and affirm the district court.
turner served in the navy for about seven years.in april his commanding officer,captain frank,learned of complaints by two of turner shipmates,petty officer john king and seaman apprentice lee poore,that turner solicited homosexual acts and falsified records apparently in the interest of inducing sexual cooperation.frank ordered chief petty officer clanahan to conduct an investigation.at its close,three sailors the two original accusers and seaman chad maurer signed sworn statements accusing turner of homosexual propositioning and assault.according to the statements,turner asked king and maurer to engage in sexual acts with him,improperly touched or pushed all three witnesses,signed his approval on phony performance qualifications for king,and used indecent language namely,blunt descriptions of the proposed acts.captain frank convened a proceeding under article,known as a captain mast,to determine if turner had committed these offenses and to impose punishment if he had.although a member of the armed forces normally has a right to demand trial by in lieu of punishment,member of the navy attached to a no such choice.a.he was charged with four counts of soliciting another to commit a homosexual act,four counts of indecent language,two counts of indecent assault against poore and maurer,one count of assault with intent to commit sodomy against poore,one count of making a false official statement,and one count of conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed services.
at the article proceeding,maurer,poore,and king testified to the truthfulness of their sworn statements,which were offered into evidence.turner presented character witnesses but did not testify.he was found guilty of all charges.captain frank imposed punishment consisting of demotion of one pay grade and forfeiture of pay per month for two months.turner appealed the punishment claiming lack of substantial evidence but the authorized superior officer affirmed.
almost immediately captain frank referred turner to an administrative discharge board adb to determine whether he should be discharged from the navy and whether that discharge would be an honorable one.the underlying acts being considered were the same.maurer,poore,and king testified against turner,as did two other sailors corroborating their testimony.turner testified on his own behalf,denying all charges.he also presented character witnesses and through counsel the witnesses against him.the adb rejected all of the charges relating to king and the charge of indecent assault relating to maurer.it also rejected the charges of assault with intent to commit sodomy and indecent assault on poore,finding that incident instead to have been a proposition for sexual acts.they found turner guilty of the remaining charges that had been brought under article and decided that he should be separated from the navy with an other than honorable discharge.
turner challenged the board findings,but the navy formally accepted its recommendation on august,turner was discharged with an other than honorable classification.turner petitioned the secretary of the navy,who initially addresses such petitions through the board for correction of naval records bcnr,to reverse the article penalties and the discharge.over a dissent,the bcnr found error on several procedural points as well as a lack of sufficient corroboration.it recommended that his record be cleared.a deputy assistant secretary of the navy rejected the bcnr recommendation without comment,relying on the bcnr dissent.a.
turner then challenged the secretary decision in district court.among other points,he argued that the secretary had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying his arguments without explanation.the court agreed and,though retaining jurisdiction,remanded to the secretary to assess turner arguments and articulate a reasoned basis for whatever decision he should make.after doing so and adhering to the navy original position,the assistant secretary moved successfully for summary judgment in district court.turner appeals the grant of summary judgment on several grounds.
turner raises a number of procedural points and also argues that the outcomes of the navy proceedings are not supported by substantial evidence.the substantial evidence issue is conventional,its particulars not justifying a published opinion.although the parties agree that we should review for substantial evidence a formula governing our scope of review,neither mentions the burden of proof in the article proceeding,on which in fact there appears to be division among the various services.compare manual of the judge advocate general,department of the navy b stating that the standard is a preponderance of the evidence with air force instruction observing that no specific standard of proof applies to article proceedings,but noting that in a court martial,which a service member is entitled to choose,the reasonable doubt standard would apply and with department of the army form beyond a reasonable doubt.as the navy applied a standard of preponderance of the evidence and turner has not objected,we apply that standard,without deciding on its propriety.on this basis we find the evidence sufficient.we now turn to the various procedural claims.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.teamsters local union united parcel.we review the decisions of the secretary under the arbitrary and capricious standard of the apa.cone caldera.
of the procedural claims,the most difficult is turner argument that captain frank abused his discretion in proceeding against him under article,which under the statute is for minor offenses,b,even though,he says,the navy itself regarded his conduct as extremely serious.we take that issue first,and then turn to the other procedural claims in the order of their chronological appearance.
were turner offenses minor for purposes of article 
under article a commanding officer may impose disciplinary punishments for minor offenses without the intervention of a.b.turner argues that his offenses were not minor within the meaning of this provision,and that therefore he was subject to prosecution only by.a commanding officer is to exercise personal discretion in evaluating each case as to whether nonjudicial punishment is appropriate,see manual for the manual,part,at d,so the claim is effectively for abuse of discretion,see united states gammons,citing the manual,as turner appears to acknowledge.see appellant opening brief at.
the government notes that f makes clear that an article proceeding is not a bar to for a serious crime or offense growing out of the same act or omission to prevent double punishment,it provides that the punishment in the article proceeding will be taken into account in the later.f.because f appears to assume that article will sometimes be applied to serious crimes,the government suggests that the commanding officer discretion to choose article is nonreviewable.but f makes clear that the serious crime it refers to is one not properly punishable under this article,and by using the phrase growing out of the same act or omission the statute may merely anticipate smaller charges being pursued through article without precluding prosecution by of more serious charges arising out of the same act.thus the text does little to advance a claim of unlimited discretion.
the structure of military punishment procedures,however,counsels extremely broad discretion for the commanding officer.the uniform code supplies four levels of punishment,summary,special,and general progressing upward in both procedural protections and possible punishments.see.no matter how serious the offense may be,punishments imposed under article will be relatively minor.thus the system tends to regulate itself.a major offense will normally be prosecuted by because that is the only way a serious penalty may be given.in adopting article congress saw it as a device for protecting the service member from the stigma of a,with consequent likely loss of later civilian job opportunities,and also protecting the military from the effect of a on the member efficiency and morale.see,reprinted in,see also gammons,at.especially when the objection is posed for the first time after the option has effectively lapsed,close review of the commanding officer choice of article would hardly advance these interests a commanding officer choice of article might be clouded by fear of the choice being upset because the offense was too serious.
it is thus unsurprising that courts,though reviewing these choices,have given great deference to a commander treatment of an offense as minor.gammons,for example,after quoting the senate report mentioned above,found that the statute vested discretion in the commander in order to promote the policy of disposing of allegations at the lowest possible level based upon individual circumstances.at see also cappella united states,t he commanding officer has broad discretion to determine whether a particular alleged offense is sufficiently serious to warrant rather than nonjudicial punishment under article.cochran,iii united states.so far as appears,there is only one case in which the commanding officer was found to have abused his discretion,hagarty united states,and later cases have noted that hagarty involved extreme circumstances.as the cappella court said,the captain engaged in angry,profane and abusive conduct toward the accused and violated four procedural requirements of a captain mast.cappella,at quoting hagarty,at,and citing hagarty,id.at see also cochran.at.
nonetheless,the maximum penalty is obviously very relevant to a commanding officer decision whether to use article.the manual for says that o rdinarily minor offenses do include ones carrying a maximum penalty if pursued by of dishonorable discharge or more than a year confinement.manual,part v,at e.had turner been prosecuted by general courtmartial for indecent assault and assault with attempt to commit homosexual sodomy,his maximum sentences for each crime would have been five and ten years respectively,as well as dishonorable discharge not the same as the other than honorable administrative discharge that turner received.see,part ii,at b b part iv,at e,e.if this were the sole criterion,the offenses could hardly be considered minor.
but commanding officers,with court approval,consider other factors as well,and courts have affirmed use of article for offenses carrying sentences as long as turner.see,united states rivera,wl where a drug offense posed a maximum of ten years imprisonment if prosecuted by general courtmartial.the manual expressly mentions the nature of the offense and the circumstances surrounding its commission the offender age,rank,duty assignment,record and experience and the maximum sentence imposable for the offense if tried by general.manual,part,at e.in this case,turner had a respectable record of seven years of military service and the exact circumstances surrounding the charges placed his conduct at the less culpable end of their technical elements.
for example,in one charge of indecent assault the witness maurer said that while sharing a hotel room with turner,he had gotten drunk,and woke up naked he had no recollection of how his clothes were removed or any other circumstance.there was no evidence whatever that any sexual act ever happened.and the other charge of indecent assault and the charge of assault with intent to commit sodomy both arose from a single incident in which turner had pushed poore onto the bed with expressions of intent to commit a sexual act.not only did no such act occur,but circumstances were such that poore initially thought turner was horseplaying,and the force used was nothing to what the formal name of the charge conjures up.
turner argues that various navy communications and documents suggest that the navy itself understood turner offenses to be very serious.the notice advising turner of his adb proceedings referred to his article offenses as serious offense s an message from the antietam to navy authorities mentioned the extreme sensitivity of case and seriousness of charges and the potential for an international incident and captain frank wrote in a report that he view ed turner conduct as sexual harassment of the most egregious nature.but none of these rather inflamed remarks was expressed in the context of deciding whether he should be tried at an article proceeding.the meaning of a term often varies with context one might reasonably view allegations as serious as a general,as in this case,for purposes of seeking the service member administrative separation for commission of a serious offense,see naval military personnel manual minor for purposes of article.
turner,though having some access to counsel,did not raise this argument either when told that he would be subjected to article,nor on appeal from its outcome.in this case,acquiescence at the time may have little weight,as turner had a chance only for one conversation by satellite phone with a lawyer in the brief time before the start of the article proceeding.and at the appeal stage,his counsel may have shared the idea voiced by the court in hagarty that such appeals may not raise jurisdictional issues,see at we doubt that conclusion,as e allows appeals claiming the punishment is unjust and hagarty offers no reason why a reviewing officer could not so classify punishment from a jurisdictionally defective proceeding.in any event,had turner raised his objection at the time,the navy would have been able to bring a proceeding without much difficulty.with him out of the navy,it no longer can.see united states ex rel.toth quarles.whether or not turner at the time actually preferred article as he well might in view of its lower punishments and lesser stigma,surely others in his position would not want their commanding officer judgment distorted by undue fear of reversal on this ground.see also gammons,at noting a service member failure to assert claim of offense at his article appeal or later proceeding.
in light of the facts and the highly deferential scope of review,we reject the argument that the character of turner offenses barred use of article.we now turn to his narrower procedural objections.
credible evidence to begin an investigation 
turner argues that captain frank violated the defense department do ask,do tell regulations by initiating an investigation of homosexual misconduct without credible evidence that there was a basis for discharge he particularly invokes the requirement that there be information from a reliable person.see dod dir.encl,f.we assume the regulations enforceability,although enclosure states that its procedures create no substantive or procedural rights,id.g,and the navy staunchly denies enforceability.turner asserts that petty officer king could not be considered a reliable person in view of several blotches on his military record and the adb wholesale rejection of his testimony.but we can put king aside,as frank also relied on seaman apprentice poore,against whose reliability turner presents a much weaker challenge.
for poore,the worst that turner can say is that he was a friend of king and waited seven after king report turner conduct.but poore made his statements under oath and had a reason for his delay.he alleged that turner ha
