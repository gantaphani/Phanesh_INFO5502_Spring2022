the owners of a sudanese pharmaceutical plant sued the united states for unjustifiably destroying the plant,failing to compensate them for its destruction,and defaming them by asserting they had ties to osama bin laden.the district court dismissed their complaint.a panel of this court affirmed,holding that the political question doctrine barred the plaintiffs claims.after granting rehearing en banc,we now affirm the district court on the same ground.
on august,the terrorist network headed by osama bin laden bombed united states embassies in kenya and tanzania.hundreds were killed and thousands injured.on august,the united states responded by launching nearly simultaneous missile strikes against two targets a terrorist training camp in afghanistan and a factory in sudan believed to be associated with the bin ladin network and involved in the production of materials for chemical weapons.president william clinton,address to the nation on military action against terrorist sites in afghanistan and sudan,pub.papers,hereinafter address to the nation.
president clinton addressed the american people,explaining the objective of this action and why it was necessary.id.at.our target was terror our mission was clear to strike at the network of radical groups affiliated with and funded by usama bin ladin,perhaps the preeminent organizer and financier of international terrorism in the world today.id.the risks from inaction,to america and the world,would be far greater than action,the president proclaimed,for that would embolden our enemies,leaving their ability and their willingness to strike us intact.id.at.
in a letter to the congress consistent with the war powers resolution,the president reported that the strikes were a necessary and proportionate response to the imminent threat of further terrorist attacks against personnel and facilities and were intended to prevent and deter additional attacks by a clearly identified terrorist threat.president william clinton,letter to congressional leaders reporting on military action against terrorist sites in afghanistan and sudan,pub.papers.the following day,in a radio address to the nation,president clinton explained his decision to take military action,stating,our goals were to disrupt bin ladin terrorist network and destroy elements of its infrastructure in afghanistan and sudan.and our goal was to destroy,in sudan,the factory with which bin ladin network is associated,which was producing an ingredient essential for nerve gas.president william clinton,the president radio address,pub.papers.citing compelling evidence that the bin ladin network was poised to strike at us again and was seeking to acquire chemical weapons,the president declared that we simply could not stand idly by.id.
other government officials elaborated upon the president justifications for the attack on the plant.on the day of the strike,the secretary of defense stated that bin laden had some financial interest in contributing to this particular facility.compl.at,pharm.indus.united states,d civ.an unnamed senior intelligence official asserted at a press briefing,w e know that bin laden has made financial contributions to the sudanese military industrial complex,of which,we believe,the shifa pharmaceutical plant is part.id.and on august,the national security advisor maintained that osama bin laden was providing key financial help for the plant.id.
the plaintiffs in this case are the pharmaceutical industries company,the owner of the plant,and salah el din ahmed mohammed idris idris,the principal owner of.they allege that striking the plant was a mistake,that it was not a chemical weapons facility,was not connected to bin laden or to terrorism,and was not otherwise a danger to public health and safety.id.at.instead,the plaintiffs contend,the plant was sudan largest manufacturer of medicinal products,responsible for producing over half the pharmaceuticals used in sudan.because the case comes to us on appeal from a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction,we take the plaintiffs allegations as true.see hosp.supply united states.
according to the plaintiffs,within days of the attack,the press debunked the president assertions that the plant was involved with chemical weapons and associated with bin laden.confronted with their error,senior administration and intelligence officials backpedaled,issuing what the plaintiffs characterize as revised or new justifications for the strike and conceding that any relationship between bin laden and the plant was indirect.compl.at.although the united states attacked the plant without knowing who owned it,officials learned within three days of the strike that idris was the owner.after that point,unidentified government officials began telling reporters that idris maintained direct or indirect financial relations with bin laden,purchased the plant on bin laden behalf,acted as a front man or agent for bin laden in sudan,and had ties to bin laden.id.at.the plaintiffs contend that neither the contemporaneous nor justifications for the attack were true all of the justifications for the attack advanced by the united states were based on false factual premises and were offered with reckless disregard of the truth based upon grossly incomplete research and unreasonable analysis of inconclusive intelligence.id.at.
this lawsuit is only one of several actions the plaintiffs pursued to recoup their losses.they also sued the united states in the court of federal claims,seeking million as just compensation under the takings clause of the constitution.the court dismissed the suit on the ground that the enemy target of military force has no right to compensation for the destruction of property designated by the president as enemy property.pharm.indus.united states,fed.cl.the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed,holding that the plaintiffs takings claim raised a nonjusticiable political question.see pharm.indus.united states,cert.denied.on the legislative front,one member of the house of representatives introduced a bill to compensate those who suffered injuries or property damage in the missile strike,see,cong,and a resolution directing the claims court to investigate the matter and issue a report to the house,see res,cong.citing.both the bill and the resolution died in committee.
the plaintiffs brought this action in the united states district court for the district of columbia after the cia denied their requests for compensation for the plant destruction and for a retraction of the allegations that the plaintiffs were involved with terrorism.the plaintiffs sought at least million in damages under the federal tort claims act,claiming negligence in the government investigation of the plant ties to chemical weapons and osama bin laden and trespass in its destruction of the plant without consent or justification.compl.at.their complaint also included a claim under the law of nations seeking a judicial declaration that the united states violated international law by failing to compensate them for the unjustified destruction of their property.finally,the plaintiffs claimed that the president and other senior officials defamed them by publishing false statements linking idris and the plant to bin laden,international terrorism,or chemical weapons,knowing those statements were false or making them with reckless disregard for their veracity.the plaintiffs sought extraordinary relief a declaration that claims made by agents of the united states that idris or are connected to osama bin laden,terrorist groups or the production of chemical weapons are false and defamatory and a n order requiring the united states to issue a retraction of those claims in the form of a press release.id.at.
the district court granted the government motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction,see.b,concluding that sovereign immunity barred all of the plaintiffs claims.see,d at.the court also noted that the complaint likely present ed a nonjusticiable political question.id.at.the plaintiffs filed a motion to alter the judgment with respect to their claims for equitable relief,which the district court denied.see pharm.indus.united states,wl.
the plaintiffs appealed,challenging only the dismissal of their claims alleging a violation of the law of nations and defamation.the plaintiffs have abandoned any request for monetary relief,but still seek a declaration that the government failure to compensate them for the destruction of the plant violated customary international law,a declaration that statements government officials made about them were defamatory,and an injunction requiring the government to retract those statements.a divided panel of this court affirmed the district court,holding that these claims are barred by the political question doctrine.see pharm.indus.united states.we vacated the panel judgment and ordered rehearing en banc.see pharm.indus.united states,app x.
it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is,marbury madison,cranch,but some q uestions,in their nature political,are beyond the power of the courts to resolve,id.at.the political question doctrine is essentially a function of the separation of powers,baker carr,and excludes from judicial review those controversies which revolve around policy choices and value determinations constitutionally committed for resolution to the halls of congress or the confines of the executive branch,japan whaling ass am.cetacean soc y.see also united states,explaining that the doctrine is designed to restrain the judiciary from inappropriate interference in the business of the other branches of government.
that some governmental actions are beyond the reach of the courts reflects the constitution limitation of the judicial power of the united states to cases or controversies.const.art.iii see daimlerchrysler cuno,the doctrines of mootness,ripeness,and political question all originate in article iii case or controversy language,no less than standing does.schlesinger reservists comm.to stop the war,t he concept of justiciability,which expresses the jurisdictional limitations imposed upon federal courts by the case or controversy requirement of art.iii,embodies both the standing and political question doctrines.it is therefore familiar learning that no justiciable controversy exists when parties seek adjudication of a political question.massachusetts epa.
in the seminal case of baker carr,the supreme court explained that a claim presents a political question if it involves 
a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion or the impossibility of a court undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.
at.to find a political question,we need only conclude that one of these factor s is present,not all.schneider kissinger.
disputes involving foreign relations,such as the one before us,are quintessential sources of political questions.bancoult.mcnamara.because these cases raise issues that frequently turn on standards that defy judicial application or involve the exercise of a discretion demonstrably committed to the executive or legislature,baker,at,m atters intimately related to foreign policy and national security are rarely proper subjects for judicial intervention,haig agee.yet it is error to suppose that every case or controversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond judicial cognizance.baker,at.even in the context of military action,the courts may sometimes have a role.see gilligan morgan.therefore,we must conduct a discriminating analysis of the particular question posed in the specific case before the court to determine whether the political question doctrine prevents a claim from going forward.baker,at see,wilson libby,holding the political question doctrine did not bar a challenge to disclosures identifying a previously covert agent and therefore implicat ing national security because the plaintiffs claims did not challenge any foreign policy or national security decisions entrusted to the executive branch.
in undertaking this discriminating analysis,we note,for example,that the political question doctrine does not bar a claim that the government has violated the constitution simply because the claim implicates foreign relations.see chadha,u.holding the legislative veto unconstitutional despite its use in matters of foreign affairs and the war powers.because the judiciary is the ultimate interpreter of the constitution,baker,at,in most instances claims alleging its violation will rightly be heard by the courts.see,chadha,at no policy underlying the political question doctrine suggests that congress or the executive,or both acting in concert and in compliance with art.i,can decide the constitutionality of a statute that is a decision for the courts.but see,nixon united states,whether senate has violated its duty to try impeachments presents a political question luther borden,how.guarantee clause is enforceable only by congress.similarly,that a case may involve the conduct of the nation foreign affairs does not necessarily prevent a court from determining whether the executive has exceeded the scope of prescribed statutory authority or failed to obey the prohibition of a statute or treaty.see japan whaling,at o ne of the judiciary characteristic roles is to interpret statutes,and we can not shirk this responsibility merely because of the interplay between the statute and the conduct of this nation foreign relations.see,trans world airlines,franklin mint,holding the political question doctrine does not bar consideration of whether a civil aeronautics board order is inconsistent with the warsaw convention see also david barron martin lederman,the commander in chief at the lowest the problem,doctrine,and original understanding,harv,if there is a party with constitutionally sufficient standing to demand judicial protection from a presidential refusal to obey a statute during war,it is not clear why there should be a general rule that courts must leave the question to the political branches.
we have consistently held,however,that courts are not a forum for reconsidering the wisdom of discretionary decisions made by the political branches in the realm of foreign policy or national security.in this vein,we have distinguished between claims requiring us to decide whether taking military action was wise a policy choice and value determination constitutionally committed for resolution to the halls of congress or the confines of the executive branch and claims p resenting purely legal issues such as whether the government had legal authority to act.campbell clinton,tatel,concurring quoting japan whaling,at.accordingly,we have declined to adjudicate claims seeking only a determination whether the alleged conduct should have occurred.harbury hayden.despite some sweeping assertions to the contrary,see,kissinger,whatever kissinger did as national security advisor or secretary of state can hardly be called anything other than foreign policy unreviewable under the political question doctrine.internal quotation marks omitted,the presence of a political question in these cases turns not on the nature of the government conduct under review but more precisely on the question the plaintiff raises about the challenged action.see campbell,at tatel,concurring.
the political question doctrine bars our review of claims that,regardless of how they are styled,call into question the prudence of the political branches in matters of foreign policy or national security constitutionally committed to their discretion.a plaintiff may not,for instance,clear the political question bar simply by recasting such foreign policy and national security questions in tort terms.schneider,at explaining the courts could not determine whether taking military action was wrongful as an element of a wrongful death claim.contrary to the position adopted by judge statute providing for judicial review does not override article iii requirement that federal courts refrain from deciding political questions.see sierra club morton,congress may not confer jurisdiction on art.iii federal courts to resolve political questions,because suits of this character are inconsistent with the judicial function under art.iii.internal citation omitted gilligan,at stating a circuit judge correctly read baker carr when he wrote that simply order ing compliance with the standards set by congress could draw the courts into a nonjusticiable political question,over which we have no jurisdiction quoting morgan rhodes,cir celebrezze,concurring in part and dissenting in part chi.air lines,waterman,u,declining to construe a statute to require judicial review of foreign policy decisions wholly confided by our constitution to the political departments of the government,executive and legislative vieth jubelirer,plurality opinion citing waterman for the proposition that t he judicial power created by article iii,of the constitution is not whatever judges choose to do or even whatever congress chooses to assign them citations omitted.for example,in reviewing the secretary of state designation of a group as a foreign terrorist organization under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act,we may decide whether the government has followed the proper procedures,whether the organization is foreign,and whether it has engaged in terrorist activity,but we may not determine whether the terrorist activity of the organization threatens the security of united states nationals or the national security of the united states,id.a c.see people mojahedin org.of iran dep t of state pmoi.whether this last criterion has been met presents a nonjusticiable political question because the secretary assessments of whether the terrorist activities of foreign organizations constitute threats to the united states are political judgments,decisions of a kind for which the judiciary has neither aptitude,facilities nor responsibility and have long been held to belong in the domain of political power not subject to judicial intrusion or inquiry.pmoi,at quoting waterman,at.neither a common law nor statutory claim may require the court to reassess policy choices and value determinations the constitution entrusts to the political branches alone.japan whaling,at.
the conclusion that the strategic choices directing the nation foreign affairs are constitutionally committed to the political branches reflects the institutional limitations of the judiciary and the lack of manageable standards to channel any judicial inquiry into these matters.see generally nixon,at t he concept of a textual commitment to a coordinate political department is not completely separate from the concept of a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it the lack of judicially manageable standards may strengthen the conclusion that there is a textually demonstrable commitment to a coordinate branch.we must decline to reconsider what are essentially policy choices because t he judiciary is particularly ill suited to make such decisions,as courts are fundamentally underequipped to formulate national policies or develop standards for matters not legal in nature.japan whaling,at quoting united states ex rel.joseph cannon.in military matters in particular,the courts lack the competence to assess the strategic decision to deploy force or to create standards to determine whether the use of force was justified or.
the complex,subtle,and professional decisions as to the control of a military force are essentially professional military judgments,subject always to civilian control of the legislative and executive branches.the ultimate responsibility for these decisions is appropriately vested in branches of the government which are periodically subject to electoral accountability.
gilligan,at.it is not the role of judges to,with the benefit of hindsight,another branch determination that the interests of the united states call for military action.
the case at hand involves the decision to launch a military strike abroad.conducting the discriminating analysis of the particular question posed by the claims the plaintiffs press on appeal,baker,at,we conclude that both raise nonjusticiable political questions.the claim asks the court to decide whether the united states attack on the plant was mistaken and not justified.compl.at.the defamation claim similarly requires us to determine the factual validity of the government stated reasons for the strike.if the political question doctrine means anything in the arena of national security and foreign relations,it means the courts can not assess the merits of the president decision to launch an attack on a foreign target,and the plaintiffs ask us to do just that.therefore,we affirm the district court dismissal of the plaintiffs and defamation claims.
the plaintiffs complaint asserts that customary international law requires states to compensate foreign nationals for property destruction that is mistaken and not justified.the united states purportedly violated this norm when the cia denied the plaintiffs request for compensation for the destruction of the plant.see id.at.because we hold this claim barred by the political question doctrine,we need not decide whether customary international law requires compensation in these circumstances,or,if so,whether the plaintiffs have adequately stated a federal cause of action.see generally sosa.
we begin our analysis with the rule we have already identified and upon which both parties agree courts can not reconsider the wisdom of discretionary foreign policy decisions.see appellants en banc br.at.the plaintiffs claim falls squarely within this prohibition because it would require us to declare that the bombing of the plant was mistaken and not justified.whether an attack on a foreign target is is whether it is warranted or a quintessential policy choice and value determination constitutionally committed for resolution to the halls of congress or the confines of the executive branch.japan whaling,at.the plaintiffs appear to recognize this.on appeal they imply that they need only prove the united states failed to compensate them for an attack that was mistaken.see appellants en banc br.at see also id.at conceding that whether the attack was reasonable and justified when it occurred presents a nonjusticiable question.by asserting the bombing was mistaken,the plaintiffs apparently mean that the united states would not have launched the strike if the relevant decisionmakers knew at the time what they allegedly know the plant was neither involved in producing chemical weapons nor associated with bin laden.see id.at describing the plant as targeted in error id.at arguing the bombing was mistaken because evidence has emerged that the plant was in fact innocent property.but the political question doctrine does not permit us to mimic the constitutional role of the political branches by guessing how they would have conducted the nation foreign policy had they been better informed.whether the circumstances warrant a military attack on a foreign target is a substantive political judgment entrusted expressly to the coordinate branches of government,gilligan,at,and using a judicial forum to reconsider its wisdom would be anathema to the separation of powers.undertaking a counterfactual inquiry into how the political branches would have exercised their discretion had they known the facts alleged in the plaintiffs complaint would be to make a political judgment,not a legal one.
moreover,baker prudential considerations counsel judicial restraint as well.first,the court lacks judicially manageable standards to adjudicate whether the attack on the plant was mistaken and not justified.see baker,at reno,explaining the courts are ill equipped to determine the authenticity and utterly unable to assess the adequacy of the government reasons for deeming nationals of a particular country a special threat.we could not decide this question without first fashioning out of whole cloth some standard for when military action is justified.the judiciary lacks the capacity for such a task.as we once said of a claim that certain covert operations were wrongful,there are no judicially discoverable and manageable standards for the resolution of such a claim.schneider,at see also id.to determine whether drastic measures should be taken in matters of foreign policy and national security is not the stuff of adjudication,but of policymaking.second,the decision to take military action is a policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion.baker,at.such foreign policy decisions are delicate,complex,and involve large elements of prophecy they are decisions of a kind for which the judiciary has neither aptitude,facilities nor responsibility waterman,at.in short,the decision to launch the military attack on the plant was constitutionally committed to the political branches,see,const.art.i,cl.id.art.ii,cl.see also schneider,at,and this court is neither an effective nor appropriate forum for reweighing its merits.see harbury,at.because the plaintiffs claim requires the court to that decision,we conclude that it presents a nonjusticiable political question.
indeed,the claim suffers from flaws similar to those the federal circuit identified in the plaintiffs previous claim that the bombing was a taking because it was mistaken.as the federal circuit explained,in essence the plaintiffs are contending that the president failed to assure himself with a sufficient degree of certainty of the factual basis for his decision to strike the plant,at.the plaintiffs would have the federal courts provide them with an opportunity to test that contention,and in the process,require this court to elucidate the standards that are to guide a president when he evaluates the veracity of military intelligence.id.this we can not do.
in refusing to declare the attack mistaken and not justified,we do not mean to imply that the contrary is true.we simply decline to answer a question outside the scope of our authority.by requiring that we reserve judgment,the political question doctrine protects the congress and the executive from judicial invasion of their sphere,antolok united states,opinion of sentelle,and guards against the reputation of the judicial branch being borrowed by the political branches to cloak their work in the neutral colors of judicial action,pmoi,at quoting mistretta united states.
the plaintiffs also claim that anonymous government officials defamed them by making statements linking them to bin laden and international terrorism.this claim fares no better than their claim.it too would require the court to reconsider the merits of the decision to strike the plant by determining whether the government justifications for the attack were false.see restatement second of torts a.
we begin by noting that the court can not judge the veracity of the president initial public explanations for the attack for the same reasons we can not examine whether the attack was mistaken and not justified.the president statements justifying the attack are inextricably intertwined with a foreign policy decision constitutionally committed to the political branches,bancoult,at,because determining whether the president statements were true would require a determination whether the alleged conduct should have occurred,harbury,at.a decision in favor of the plaintiffs would unavoidably involve a rejection of the clinton administration stated justifications for launching the missile strike.a decision against the plaintiffs would affirm the wisdom of the administration decision to attack.
the plaintiffs maintain,however,that even if the political question doctrine bars review of the president initial justifications for the attack,the court may nevertheless judge the veracity of the subsequent justifications,which,they allege,offer different explanations for the strike.these allegedly defamatory statements are reviewable,the plaintiffs contend,because they do not state the actual justification for the decision to attack the plant.appellants en banc reply br.at.rather,the plaintiffs allege that these statements are post hoc pretext defamatory efforts at political damage control.see also compl.at stating the action arises out of false and defamatory statements made by united states government officials seeking to justify the destruction of the plant compl.at alleging government officials continued to justify their actions with statements intended to suggest that idris was,in fact,associated with terrorism.according to the plaintiffs,we can review these later justifications for the attack because they bear no relation to the president initial the plant was associated with bin laden and involved in producing chemical weapons.
we disagree.the allegedly defamatory statements can not be severed from the initial justifications for the attack.the court can not adjudicate the truth of the government later justifications because,despite the plaintiffs arguments to the contrary,they are fundamentally the same as the initial justifications.in reaching this conclusion,we need look no further than the plaintiffs complaint.taking all of its allegations as true,we find no material difference between the allegedly defamatory statements and the president contemporaneous explanation of his decision to take military action.on the day the united states destroyed the plant,president clinton told the american people that he ordered the strike in part because the plant was associated with the bin laden network and was a chemical facility.compl.at,see also address to the nation,pub.papers at president william clinton,remarks in martha vineyard,massachusetts,on military action against terrorist sites in afghanistan and sudan,pub.papers.in their prayer for relief,the plaintiffs describe the allegedly defamatory statements as claims that idris or are sic connected to osama bin laden,terrorist groups or the production of chemical weapons.compl.at see also id.at detailing numerous statements to news reporters falsely describing salah idris as an associate of osama bin laden and international terrorist organizations.this characterization of the allegedly defamatory statements closely tracks the president own description of his reasons for launching the attack.
all of the allegedly defamatory statements essentially repeat the president initial justification for the strike.each describes a connection between bin laden and the plant through its owner,salah idris.for example,intelligence officials stated idris dealt financially with members of islamic jihad,which had been absorbed into bin laden terror network.id.at.and government officials claimed the owner and manager of the plant were front men for bin laden.see also id.at citing a washington official describing idris as a partner with bin laden in other sudanese businesses id.at quoting one official asserting that idris may have purchased the plant on bin laden behalf and that he involved in money laundering,that he involved in representing a lot of bin laden interests in sudan.contrary to the plaintiffs contentions,these statements do not represent a break from the president contemporaneous explanation of his reasons for launching the strike.at most,they elaborate upon the nature of the connection between the plant and bin connection the president offered on the day of the attack as one reason for taking military action.declaring these later statements true or false would require us to make the same judgment about the president initial justification for the attack.
the plaintiffs contend that idris alleged ties to bin factual issue at the heart of their defamation not have played any part in the decision to bomb the plant because,at the time of the strike,the united states thought the plant was owned by the sudanese government and not by idris.therefore,they argue,the court could declare the government allegations that idris was connected to bin laden false without undermining the government actual justifications for the attack.see appellants en banc br.at appellants en banc reply br.at.to be sure,at least one anonymous official had previously suggested the plant belonged to the sudanese military industrial complex.see compl.at.but this is beside the point.as the plaintiffs conceded before the en banc court,t he owner of the plant was immaterial to president clinton decision to attack the plant.oral arg.recording at.the president explained that the united states targeted the plant because it was associated with bin laden,and officials continued to assert that same rationale when they told reporters the plant owner was financially linked to bin laden network.a court pronouncement that the plant owner had no financial ties to bin laden would directly contradict the government justification for the attack by disclaiming the asserted association between the plant and the bin laden network.
the plaintiffs further argue that the political question doctrine does not block their defamation claim because by the government own admission,the accusations challenged as defamatory formed no part of the decision to attack the plant.appellants en banc br.at emphasis added.but none of the statements quoted in the complaint imply such an admission.the plaintiffs rely on one statement,which referenced n ew evidence obtained since the attack.see id.at quoting compl.at.the rest of the statement,however,makes clear that their reliance is misplaced new evidence obtained since the attack,one official said,starts to make the link between the plant current owner,salaheldin idris,and bin laden more direct.compl.at.the official assertion that new evidence made the connection between bin laden and idris more direct does not give rise to an inference,as the plaintiffs suggest,that there was no prior evidence of such a nexus.indeed,the statement of another anonymous official quoted in the complaint suggests that the newer evidence merely corroborated the evidence existing at the time of the attack.see id.at quoting an anonymous official statement that intelligence collected after the strike increasingly points to ties with osama bin laden emphasis added.this emphasizes that the veracity of the allegedly defamatory statements is inextricably intertwined,bancoult,at,with the merits of the actual justifications for the attack and underscores the nonjusticiability of the plaintiffs defamation claim.
we conclude our political question analysis by addressing the plaintiffs argument that they are asking nothing more than that we review the government designation of them as supporters of the nation enemies,something courts have done in other contexts.see appellants en banc br.at.this argument fails.
the plaintiffs point first to cases permitting judicial review of the enemy status of persons detained after being seized by the military on the battlefield.see,boumediene bush.parhat gates.but the political question doctrine does not preclude judicial review of prolonged executive detention predicated on an enemy combatant determination because the constitution specifically contemplates a judicial role in this area.see boumediene.at the suspension clause protects the rights of the detained by affirming the duty and authority of the judiciary to call the jailer to account.emphasis added hamdi rumsfeld,discussing the courts and constitutionally mandated roles of reviewing and resolving claims of citizens challenging their military detention.the plaintiffs can point to no comparable constitutional commitment to the courts for review of a military decision to launch a missile at a foreign target.bancoult,at w hile the presence of liberties could require us to address limits on the foreign policy and national security powers assigned to the political branches,no such constitutional claims are at issue in this case.
the plaintiffs also point to another line of cases in which courts have reviewed executive branch determinations that a certain asset is enemy property or belongs to a terrorist organization and therefore is eligible for seizure pursuant to statute.see,e,chai dep t of state,holy land found.for relief dev.ashcroft,von zedtwitz sutherland,bond united states.cl.these cases are not helpful to the plaintiffs for the same reasons the detainee cases are not.none required the courts to scrutinize a decision constitutionally committed wholly to the political branches.indeed,the supreme court has suggested that judicial review of designations made to effect statutorily authorized asset seizures is constitutionally mandated.see societe internationale pour participations industrielles et commerciales,rogers,the summary power to seize property which is believed to be is rescued from constitutional invalidity under the due process and just compensation clauses of the fifth amendment only by those provisions of the act which afford a claimant a later judicial hearing as to the propriety of the seizure.bancoult,at c laims based on the most fundamental liberty and property rights of this country citizenry,such as the takings and due process clauses of the fifth amendment,are justiciable,even if they implicate foreign policy decisions.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.no comparable constitutional commitment to the judiciary exists in this case.see paul davis,holding that defamation by the government,when it harms reputation alone,does not constitute a deprivation of liberty or property under the due process clause.the plaintiffs do not ask whether the government conduct was prohibited by the constitution.instead,they seek declarations that the president should not have launched a military strike that the plaintiffs deem unwise and ill founded,and an injunction requiring the government to retract its justifications for the attack.the constitution denies the courts the ability to grant such extraordinary relief.
our colleagues agree that the district court lacked jurisdiction but would affirm on a different ground.their proposed alternative relies on the rule that federal courts lack jurisdiction to hear legally insubstantial claims.the supreme court and this court have applied this rule narrowly,setting a high bar for dismissal that plaintiffs claims do not meet.
dismissal for lack of jurisdiction because of the inadequacy of a federal claim is proper only when the claim is so insubstantial,implausible,foreclosed by prior decisions of the supreme court,or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy.steel citizens for a better env t,internal quotation marks omitted.but see,rosado wyman,characterizing this doctrine as more ancient than analytically sound.this ground for jurisdictional dismissal is,as a general matter,reserved for complaints resting on truly fanciful factual allegations,best kelly,but also has some limited application to claims resting on insubstantial legal theories.
l egal claims may be so insubstantial as to deprive federal courts of jurisdiction if prior decisions inescapably render the claims frivolous.hagans lavine.that said,previous decisions that merely render claims of doubtful or questionable merit do not render them insubstantial.id.thus,to qualify as insubstantial,a claim unsoundness must so clearly result from the previous decisions of the supreme court as to foreclose the subject and leave no room for the inference that the question sought to be raised can be the subject of controversy.ex parte poresky,internal quotation marks omitted.
ord district of columbia,some alterations in original.
plaintiffs claims are not so unsound as to warrant dismissal on this jurisdictional ground.there is room for the inference that the question s sought to be raised can be the subject of controversy.poresky,at see,at ginsburg,dissenting some of our cases do imply a plaintiff may obtain a retraction from the united states for defamation by one of its officers federal rather than common law likely governs idris claim.perhaps the district court would have dismissed plaintiffs claims for failure to state a claim under rule b had the case proceeded to the merits.but whether a claim is so insubstantial as to deprive the federal courts of jurisdiction is a separate question from whether a complaint is subject to dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure b for failing to state a claim on which relief may be granted.ord,at.the cases relied upon by the concurrence might render plaintiffs claims of doubtful or questionable merit,but they do not foreclose the subject and therefore do not render them insubstantial.id.at quoting hagans,at,and poresky,at.jurisdiction is not defeated by the possibility that the averments might fail to state a cause of action on which petitioners could actually recover.bell hood.
our concurring colleagues charge the court with sub silentio expand ing executive power.concurring op.of judge ginsburg at quoting concurring op.of judge kavanaugh at.to the contrary,it is they who would work a sub silentio expansion.by asserting the authority to decide questions the constitution reserves to congress and the executive,some would expand judicial power at the expense of the democratically elected branches.and by stretching beyond all precedent the limited category of claims so frivolous as not to involve a federal question,all would permit courts to decide the merits of disputes under the guise of a jurisdictional holding while sidestepping obstacles that are truly jurisdictional.
straightforward application of our precedent makes clear that the plaintiffs face such an obstacle here.under the political question doctrine,the foreign target of a military strike can not challenge in court the wisdom of retaliatory military action taken by the united states.despite their efforts to characterize the case differently,that is just what the plaintiffs have asked us to do.the district court dismissal of their claims is 
i join part i of judge kavanaugh opinion concurring in the judgment because the plaintiffs have not alleged a cause of action i write separately to make an additional point about the opinion for the court.that opinion expands the political question doctrine well beyond the bounds delineated in baker carr,and the court need to consider whether application of the political question doctrine in a statutory case threatens the separation of powers arises only because of that unwarranted expansion.
the court today expands the political question doctrine by reading into several of our recent cases something of a new political decision doctrine.on that approach,we are first to identify some conduct or decision the opinion alternates constitutionally committed to the executive and then to ask whether the plaintiff claim call s into question,require s the court to reassess,or is inextricably intertwined with that executive conduct or decision.op.at.if so,then the claim is,regardless whether the court would actually have to decide a political question in order to resolve it.
the court approach departs sharply from that prescribed in baker carr,which calls for a discriminating inquiry into the precise facts and posture of the particular case in order to detect a political question presence,at unless there is such a question and it is inextricable from the case at bar,then we are to decide it,even if our decision may have significant political overtones.japan whaling ass am.cetacean,see also campbell clinton,tatel,concurring resolving the issue in this case would require us to decide not whether the air campaign was wise but whether the president possessed legal authority to conduct the military operation.the innovation adopted by the court contravenes the supreme court teaching that t he doctrine of which we treat is one of political questions,not one of political cases.baker,at.
if the court today followed baker carr,then there would be no occasion to consider whether the application of the political question doctrine in a statutory case threatens the separation of powers by,as judge kavanaugh says,systematically favor ing the executive branch over the legislative branch,op.at.under baker carr a statutory case generally does not present a political question because the interpretation of legislation is a recurring and accepted task for the federal courts.id.at quoting japan whaling,at.for rare exceptions in which a statute called for a decision constitutionally committed to the president and hence not subject to judicial review,see chicago southern air lines,waterman steamship,and people mojahedin org.of iran dep t of state,of the three findings mandated by the statute,secretary of state finding that an organization terrorist activity threatens national security is nonjusticiable.
under the court new political decision doctrine,however,even a straightforward statutory case,presenting a purely legal question,is if deciding it could merely reflect adversely upon a decision constitutionally committed to the president.compare,zivotofsky sec y of state,edwards,concurring the secretary first zivotofsky claim is a nonjusticiable political specious these questions involve commonplace issues of statutory and constitutional interpretation,and they are plainly matters for the court to decide.with id.at griffith,for the court plaintiff invites the courts to call into question the president exercise of the recognition power.this we can not do.we therefore hold his statutory claim presents a nonjusticiable political question because it trenches upon the president constitutionally committed recognition power.as judge kavanaugh notes,such a holding sub silentio expand s executive power at the expense of the legislature.op.at.the result of staying the judicial hand is to upset rather than to preserve the constitutional allocation of powers between the executive and the legislature.
in august,president clinton ordered the military to bomb both the factory in sudan and al qaeda training camps in afghanistan.the goals were to kill leaders of al qaeda and to destroy al qaeda infrastructure.president clinton explained to congress and the american people that he ordered the bombings in furtherance of the nation inherent right of in the wake of al qaeda attacks on property and personnel in kenya and tanzania.as authority for the bombings,president clinton cited his power under article ii of the constitution.
plaintiffs pharmaceutical industries company and its owner,salah idris,allege that their factory in sudan was wrongly destroyed in the bombings and that they were reputationally harmed by later executive branch statements linking them to osama bin laden.as relevant here,they have brought a federal defamation claim and an alien tort statute claim against the united states.
the government correctly contends that plaintiffs have not alleged a cognizable cause of action indeed,plaintiffs have not come close.plaintiffs complaint should be dismissed on that basis alone,as part i of this opinion explains.but the majority opinion instead relies on the political question doctrine to dismiss the complaint.i disagree with the majority opinion political question analysis,as part ii of this opinion spells out.
federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over claims that are so insubstantial,implausible,foreclosed by prior decisions of this court,or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy.steel citizens for a better env t,internal quotation marks omitted.plaintiffs two claims in this case fall into that category.
pharmaceutical industries company operated a factory in sudan that was bombed in august by the united states military,at the specific direction of president clinton.in later press reports,anonymous government officials were quoted as linking and its owner,idris,to osama bin laden.and salah idris then sued the united states,advancing two claims of relevance here.first,to obtain relief for the allegedly false statements by government officials that had linked plaintiffs to bin laden,plaintiffs raised a federal defamation claim against the united states.the problem for plaintiffs is that there is no federal cause of action for defamation available against the united states.second,plaintiffs claimed that the failure of the united states to compensate them for the allegedly mistaken bombing and destruction of their property violated a customary international law norm recognized under the alien tort statute.but plaintiffs have cited no customary international law norm that would require compensation by the united states under the alien tort statute for mistaken bombings.
first,plaintiffs assert a federal defamation claim against the united states.there is no such cause of action.
congress has enacted a number of causes of action that can be brought against the united states or against government officials for acts taken in their official capacities.see,administrative procedure act,et federal tort claims act,westfall act,tucker act,a.but congress has not created a defamation cause of action against the united states.
moreover,the supreme court has never recognized a federal defamation cause of action against the united states.indeed,the court has not endorsed any federal causes of action against the government during the period.and the court several times has expressly declined to do so,noting that creation of new causes of action is a function typically best left to congress.see,postal serv.flamingo,alexander sandoval,myers fdic,fdic meyer,united states california,united states standard oil.
plaintiffs cite three cases from this court to support their argument that there is a federal cause of action for defamation available against the united states.see info.agency krc,cmty.for creative pierce,expeditions unlimited aquatic enters.smithsonian,en banc.but none of those decisions holds that there is such a federal cause of action.
in this court,plaintiffs also attempt to argue that the administrative procedure act supplies a cause of action for defamation.but that,too,is wrong the apa contains no cause of action for defamation.moreover,plaintiffs can not use the,as relevant here,prohibits executive action that is not in accordance with law to vindicate a purported federal right that does not exist.a see also,alaska.
in addition to a federal cause of action,plaintiffs might also be alleging a purported state cause of action against the united states,although their complaint never quite says as much.even so,any such cause of action may not be brought against the united states absent congressional authorization to that effect.tarble case,barr matteo,federal officers acting in their official capacities have immunity from suit,including against defamation suits.in our constitutional system,the states do not regulate the federal government,either directly or through state tort law,at least absent congressional consent.const.art.vi,cl.the ftca and westfall act do expressly borrow or permit state tort causes of action against the united states in certain carefully defined circumstances.but those statutes do not apply here,as plaintiffs concede.and contrary to plaintiffs inventive arguments,the apa does not borrow state law or permit state law to be used as a basis for seeking injunctive or declaratory relief against the united states.as counsel for the government succinctly and correctly stated at oral argument state tort law does run against the united states,so it not a federal law that can be pointed to as a substantive law which is being transgressed for an apa cause of action.tr.of oral arg.at see in re supreme beef processors,cir 
plaintiffs also seek a declaration that the united states violated customary international law,as cognizable under the alien tort statute,because the united states failed to compensate plaintiffs for the allegedly mistaken destruction of their property.
the alien tort statute,or ats,authorizes suits brought by an alien for a tort only,committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the united states.the ats covers a relatively modest set of actions alleging violations of the law of nations including certain norms established as of,which the court identified as violation of safe conducts,infringement of the rights of ambassadors,and piracy.sosa.the ats may encompass other established customary international law norms so long as they do not have less definite content and acceptance among civilized nations than the historical paradigms familiar when was enacted in.id.at.
plaintiffs allege that the actions of the united states violated an established customary international law,the obligation of a government to compensate citizens of other nations for the mistaken destruction of their innocent property.br.at.but plaintiffs cite no authority suggesting that the mistaken destruction of property during extraterritorial denial of an administrative claim seeking compensation for the an established norm of customary international law.furthermore,the determination whether a norm is sufficiently definite to support a cause of action should and,indeed,inevitably must involve an element of judgment about the practical consequences of making that cause available to litigants in the federal courts.sosa,at.if the plaintiffs were correct,the federal courts presumably would be flooded with ats a minimum,claims seeking declaratory relief for alleged violations of customary international law the united states for allegedly mistaken property damage in every war,including the ongoing wars in iraq and afghanistan.plaintiffs provide no persuasive reason for the federal judiciary to embark on such a novel and endeavor in the absence of congressional direction.
in short,plaintiffs attorneys have worked hard to find some basis in law for plaintiffs complaint.but they have located no such basis plaintiffs two claims are so insubstantial,implausible,foreclosed by prior decisions of this court,or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy.steel,at.the district court judgment dismissing plaintiffs complaint should be affirmed for that reason alone 
the straightforward approach outlined in part i of this opinion would readily resolve this case.but the majority opinion instead relies on the notoriously murky and unsettled political question doctrine to dismiss the complaint.libyan arab republic,bork,concurring.because of the importance of the political question doctrine to the law of this circuit,i believe it important to respond to the majority opinion and to explain my disagreement with its political question theory.
the key point for purposes of my political question analysis is this plaintiffs do not allege that the executive branch violated the constitution.rather,plaintiffs allege that the executive branch violated congressionally enacted statutes that purportedly constrain the executive.the supreme court has never applied the political question doctrine in cases involving statutory claims of this kind.as judge edwards has correctly explained,the proper separation of powers question in this sort of statutory case is whether the statute as applied infringes on the president exclusive,preclusive authority under article ii of the constitution.see zivotofsky sec y of state,edwards,concurring.that is a weighty one that must be confronted directly through careful analysis of article ii,not resolved sub silentio in favor of the executive through use of the political question doctrine.
the political question doctrine has occupied a more limited place in the supreme court jurisprudence than is sometimes assumed the court has relied on the doctrine only twice in the last years.see walter nixon united states,gilligan morgan.the court has invoked the doctrine in cases in which i the constitution textually and exclusively commits interpretation of the relevant constitutional provision to one or both of the political branches or ii the constitutional provision at issue supplies no judicially manageable or discoverable standards for resolving the case.see walter nixon,at.
importantly,the supreme court has invoked the political question doctrine only in cases alleging violations of the constitution.this is a statutory case.the supreme court has never applied the political question doctrine in a case involving alleged statutory violations.never.
as the supreme court has explained,the interpretation of legislation is a recurring and accepted task for the federal courts.japan whaling ass american cetacean soc y,u.under article iii of the constitution,one of the judiciary characteristic roles is to interpret statutes,and we can not shirk this responsibility merely because our decision
