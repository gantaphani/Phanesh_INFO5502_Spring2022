background 
in march,the army awarded parsons contract no.d the prime contract,an contract for work in iraq.the cost reimbursement contract incorporated various federal acquisition regulations far,including regulations relating to reimbursement of subcontractor costs during the contract and after termination for convenience.subsequently,parsons entered into a basic ordering agreement boa agreement or subcontract with odell,effective as of march.the subcontract required odell to construct health care facilities and deliver medical equipment in iraq pursuant to the prime contract.initially,the contract did not specify an overhead rate.
in may,prime contract task order was issued for the construction,restoration,rebuilding,and development of public projects in iraq,and in october,task orders and issued requiring the construction of various health care facilities in iraq.parsons awarded odell subcontract task orders to support task orders,and.
on october,parsons and odell amended their subcontract,effective march,to reflect the parties agreement that odell was entitled to compensation for its overhead and general and administrative g a costs.specifically,the amendment added paragraph c a,which states that a of will be added to subcontractor direct labor rates to cover g a,overhead and other indirect costs supplemental app.in accompanying remarks,the parties noted that this provision was inadvertently omitted from the original subcontract.the parties again amended the subcontract on january,effective march,to better clarify paragraph c a to the subcontract.the newly amended language read a of will be added to odell direct labor rates to cover g a,overhead and some other in direct costs.first emphasis added second and fourth alterations in original.despite these amendments,odell continued to invoice its costs to parsons at a.
on february,the defense contract audit agency dcaa determined that odell provisional indirect cost rate for was and informed odell that it had been billing parsons using the incorrect.on march,the army terminated for convenience task orders,and.four days later,on march,odell submitted a memorandum to parsons with an attached invoice for the difference between the odell had billed parsons and the rate that dcaa determined was odell provisional indirect cost rate.parsons refused to pay the invoice,explaining that the was a provisional indirect rate and its time and materials boa with odell did not entitle odell to use a of percent.supplemental app.
the government,through a modification to the prime contract,assigned termination contracting officer tco authority to the defense contract management agency.in july,parsons submitted a termination settlement proposal for each terminated task order to the tco,none of which mentioned the additional costs odell sought or any rate issues between parsons and odell.pursuant to settlement of the prime contract,the tco requested that the dcaa audit parsons billed costs for task order of the prime contract,including odell costs.the dcaa june report discussed,inter alia,the appropriate for labor costs incurred under the subcontract.the dcaa clarified that the markup discussed in its initial audit would not apply to this subcontract as the rate is a fixed rate specified in the subcontract agreement.
on july,odell submitted a revised invoice totaling for the claimed difference between the labor costs previously billed at and the costs billed at the revised of in august,parsons submitted three payment approval requests reflecting the costs submitted by odell to the tco.the tco orally informed parsons that it would not settle directly with odell pursuant to far because it was not in the best interest of the government.on december,parsons submitted a sponsored certified claim for payment under the contract disputes act of cda on behalf of odell to the procurement contracting officer pco the claim was accompanied by a cda certification and sought reimbursement for for costs incurred under the subcontract for task orders,and on january,the pco denied the claim and parsons filed an appeal to the board.
on appeal,the government moved to dismiss for a lack of jurisdiction,arguing that parsons routine requests for payment did not amount to a claim under the cda.parsons countered that because its requests for payment occurred two years after the termination of the task orders and thus could not be subject to routine invoicing and termination procedures,the request was and sufficient in itself to constitute a claim.the board agreed with the government that parsons had failed to submit a valid sponsored claim and dismissed parsons appeal for lack of jurisdiction.parsons global,asbca,bca.the board determined that the request for odell costs incurred under the subcontract was routine as such,it did not become a claim under the cda until it was disputed by the government or the government unreasonably delayed payment.id.because its routine request was not in dispute,the board held that parsons had not submitted a claim under the cda for which it had jurisdiction.id.the board also questioned whether parsons,without conducting its own audit of the subcontractor costs,was actually liable to odell for the costs because of statements that it will pay odell only to the extent the government pays it.id.
this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction to review the board final decision under a.
discussion 
pursuant to b,we review decisions by the board on questions of law de novo.thus,we review the board determination of jurisdiction under the cda and its interpretation of the applicable far provisions de novo.dev.mchugh.
as a prerequisite for the board jurisdiction,the cda requires a contractor to present a valid claim over which the contracting officer has rendered a final decision.england swanson.because the statute itself does not define what constitutes a claim,we evaluate whether a particular request for payment amounts to a claim based on the far implementing the cda,the language of the contract in dispute,and the facts of each case.james ellett constr.united states,reflectone,dalton,en banc.the far defines claim as follows 
claim means a written demand or written assertion by one of the contracting parties seeking,as a matter of right,the payment of money in a sum certain,the adjustment or interpretation of contract terms,or other relief arising under or related to the contract a voucher,invoice,or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim.the submission may be converted to a claim,by written notice to the contracting officer as provided in a,if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
far emphasis added.under this definition,demands for payment can be classified into two categories routine and.as this court,sitting en banc,explained in reflectone,dalton,if the request is,all that is required is that it be a written demand,seeking,as a matter of right,the payment of money in a sum certain the request does not need to be in dispute.at.if the request for payment is routine,a dispute is necessary for it to constitute a claim under the cda.id.at.
the distinction between a routine and request for payment is a factual one,dependent on the circumstances in which the requested costs arose.a routine request is one incurred and submitted in accordance with the expected or scheduled progression of contract performance.ellett,at.such requests are made under the contract,not outside it and include invoices,vouchers,progress payments,and other requests for costs under the contract terms.reflectone,at.by contrast,a request is one seeking compensation b
