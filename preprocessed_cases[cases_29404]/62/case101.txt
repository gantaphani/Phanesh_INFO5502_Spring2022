section of title,enacted in the adam walsh child protection and safety act of,authorizes the civil commitment of sexually dangerous persons in the custody of the bureau of prisons.a.the district court dismissed the government petition for civil commitment under upon finding that an individual convicted and sentenced by united states army but housed within a facility operated by the united states bureau of prisons bop what the bop calls a contractual boarder was not in the custody of the bureau of prisons under the statute.for the reasons that follow,we affirm 
appellee benjamin barnard joshua was an army officer stationed in germany.he was prosecuted by military in for sexually molesting children in violation of the uniform code of military justice the ucmj.after joshua pleaded guilty,the sentenced him to years imprisonment.the also ordered loss of pay and dishonorable discharge.joshua began serving his prison sentence with an army garrison in germany.he was later transferred to the united states disciplinary barracks in leavenworth,kansas usdb leavenworth,operated by the military.
in june,when usdb leavenworth was being,the army transferred joshua to the bop.he was initially housed at the federal correctional institute in sandstone,minnesota,and later transferred to the federal correctional institute in butner,north carolina.because of his military prisoner status,the bop housed joshua under a may memorandum of agreement between the army and bop the memorandum regarding transfer of military prisoners to the federal bureau of prisons.under this agreement,the bop promised to house up to military prisoners for the army convenience.the bop has called such prisoners c ontractual boarders.b.although they become subject to all bop administrative and institutional policies and procedures,the memorandum states that military prisoners within bop facilities remain in permanent custody of the army,which retain s clemency authority.
on march,eight days before joshua scheduled release,the attorney general certified him as sexually dangerous and the government filed a petition for civil commitment under joshua moved to dismiss the petition,claiming that he was not in the custody of the bureau of prisons.a.reasoning that custody in this context referred to legal authority over joshua sentence legal custody rather than to immediate physical confinement by the bop physical custody,the district court granted the motion to dismiss.this appeal followed.
on february,the government filed a motion in the district court to stay joshua release pending appeal.the district court denied that motion on march,and the government sought similar relief in this court.recognizing the potential for our decision on the motion to moot the underlying joshua would likely be outside the bop control once granted temporary relief and expedited briefing and oral argument.
this appeal raises a question of statutory interpretation,a quintessential question of law,which we review de novo.stephens ex rel.astrue,cir.section lists three categories of people whom the attorney general may commit for sexual dangerousness 
in relation to a person who is in the custody of the bureau of prisons,or who has been committed to the custody of the attorney general pursuant to section d,or against whom all criminal charges have been dismissed solely for reasons relating to the mental condition of the person,the attorney general may certify that the person is a sexually dangerous person 
a emphasis added.because the government contends that joshua falls within the first category we must interpret the statutory language in the custody of the bureau of prisons.id.reasoning that custody in this context refers to legal rather than physical custody,joshua asserts that this statutory language does not cover military prisoners convicted and sentenced by but then housed within a bop facility for the army convenience.although declining to define custody,the government argues that congress intended the language to cover people serving a military prison sentence within a bop facility.
because the legal issue presented concerns joshua confinement by civilian authorities after being convicted and sentenced by military,we preface our analysis by clarifying the difference between the military and civilian criminal justice and penal systems.having markedly different substantive laws and separate adjudicative proceedings,the se systems are separate as a matter of law.united states dowty,see also schlesinger councilman,o f necessity,military law is a jurisprudence which exists separate and apart from the law which governs in our federal judicial establishment.
congress has enacted numerous federal criminal statutes,codified mostly in title,that are applicable to civilians and military personnel alike.unlike states criminal laws arising from a plenary power to legislate for the general welfare,federal criminal statutes are somewhat limited because they must derive from congress powers specifically enumerated by article i,section.by contrast,the ucmj contains broader criminal prohibitions applicable to military personnel,codified in title,that derive from congress constitutional authority to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces.const.art i,cl.see weiss united states,t he constitution contemplates that congress has plenary control over rights,duties,and responsibilities in the framework of the military establishment,including regulations,procedures,and remedies related to military discipline.internal quotations omitted.accordingly,w hile a civilian criminal code carves out a relatively small segment of potential conduct and declares it criminal,the uniform code of military justice essays more varied regulation of a much larger segment of the activities of the more tightly knit military community.parker levy.for example,the ucmj contains criminal prohibitions against insubordination,maltreatment of subordinates,and malingering.
these distinct bodies of criminal law are enforced by different prosecutorial and court systems.whereas the attorney general has responsibility for prosecuting federal crimes,congress granted him no authority to enforce the ucmj against military personnel.see reserving such authority to the president,the secretary of defense,the secretary for each military branch,and various commanding military officers.furthermore,whereas civilian courts are the normal repositories of power to try persons charged with crimes against the united states,reid covert,congress created a separate court system for the military under article i,see chappell wallace,congress has established a comprehensive internal system of justice to regulate military life,taking into account the special patterns that define the military structure.this system consists of military trial courts called,courts of criminal appeals,and the united states court of appeals for the armed forces.
the civilian and military court systems have markedly different safeguards and procedures.see parker,recognizing the establishment and development of a system of military justice with fundamental differences from the practices in the civilian courts,overruled on other grounds,solorio united states,united states mariea,cir m ilitary and the civilian court system constitute totally separate systems of justice,with different procedures,protections and personnel.for example,whereas federal district judges have life tenure and authority to hear any matter properly presented,military trial judges not only lack life tenure but also do not serve for fixed terms and may perform judicial duties only when assigned to do so.weiss,at see palmore united states,the exigencies of military discipline require the existence of a special system of military courts in which not all of the specific procedural protections deemed essential in art.iii trials need apply.quoting,at.furthermore,various procedural protections available in federal district courts are absent from military.most notably,lack the constitutional guarantees of indictment by grand jury and trial by jury.see,at see also reid,at t he fifth and sixth amendments require that certain express safeguards,which were designed to protect persons from oppressive governmental practices,shall be given in criminal which can not be given in a military trial.
beyond separate military courts,congress also created a military penal system distinct from the bop,which houses offenders convicted and sentenced by federal district courts.see a authorizing the establishment of such military correctional facilities as are necessary for the confinement of offenders against the ucmj.this system includes confinement facilities for detention,regional corrections facilities,and united states disciplinary barracks providing incarceration for military prisoners for all services.army reg.to.whereas the attorney general directly controls the bop,military penal institutions fall outside his authority.see describing duties of t he bureau of prisons,under the direction of the attorney general,but stating that t his section shall not apply to military or naval penal or correctional institutions or the persons confined therein.
having clarified the difference between the military and civilian criminal justice and penal systems,we now consider whether joshua is in the custody of the bureau of prisons for purposes.a.when interpreting statutes we start with the plain language.stephens,at.in interpreting the plain language of a statute,we give the words of a statute their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning,absent an indication congress intended them to bear some different import.directv,nicholas,cir internal quotations omitted.w hen the statutory language is plain,we must enforce it according to its terms.jimenez quarterman.if the language is ambiguous,in that it lends itself to more than one reasonable interpretation,our obligation is to find that interpretation which can most fairly be said to be imbedded in the statute,in the sense of being most harmonious with its scheme and the general purposes that congress manifested.newport news shipbuilding dry dock brown,cir internal quotations omitted.
the district court concluded that joshua was not in the custody of the bureau of prisons under upon finding that the word custody referred to legal custody meaning legal authority over detention rather than to physical custody meaning immediate physical confinement.the only other appellate decision to address this statutory language reached the same conclusion.see united states,cir rejecting a n interpretation that would allow physical custody alone to suffice and instead read ing custody more narrowly as including all federal offenders,but not those housed in the bop as a service to another entity which is responsible for that individual incarceration.
although asserting that joshua is indeed in the custody of the bureau of prisons for purposes,the government never defines the operative term custody.neither in briefing nor in response to repeated questions during oral argument has the government clarified what custody actually signifies.instead,the government asserted that custody without dispute includes at minimum persons serving federal criminal sentences in a bureau of prisons facility.reasoning that the phrase persons serving federal criminal sentences would include military prisoners because the ucmj had been enacted by congress,the government concluded that the sole issue becomes whether congress specifically intended to exclude military prisoners from.declining to propose criteria for determining when the bop has custody,the government maintained that we need not define custody to determine whether reaches joshua 
we are constrained to disagree that we can avoid defining custody.interpreting the phrase in the custody of the bureau of prisons obviously requires deciding what congress meant by the word custody.indeed,we are obligated to interpret statutory language so that every word possesses a coherent,unabsurd meaning.see united states rippetoe,cir t he rule is well settled that all laws are to be given a sensible construction and that a literal application of language which leads to absurd consequences should be avoided whenever a reasonable application can be given consistent with the legislative purpose.under nearly identical circumstances,the seventh circuit expressed the same opinion 
we are entrusted with the duty to read so as to have ascertainable meaning,and the ad hoc conclusory determination advocated by the government provides no guidance to courts,the ice,the bop,or those housed at bop facilities,as to whether they are in the custody of the bop for purposes of the act.the term must be given a meaning that is capable of being applied beyond the narrow facts here,and the government is unwilling to advocate any such articulable definition.
at citing downey crabtree,cir,for rejecting the government argument that nonviolent offense should be defined at the bop discretion,and noting that the federal courts have ultimate responsibility of statutory interpretation.we can not simply conclude ad hoc that reaches joshua without actually interpreting the applicable statutory language,including the word custody.
we thus consider what custody means under,beginning our analysis with ordinary usage.see directv,at noting that when interpreting plain language we give the words of a statute their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning internal quotations omitted.as has been suggested,the word custody carries two common meanings relating to government detention.see rumsfeld padilla,noting concerning habeas corpus that custody may mean either physical or legal custody depending on context.sometimes the word refers to physical custody,directly limiting an individual physical freedom.see black law dictionary ed noting that physical custody indicates c ustody of a person such as arrestee whose freedom is directly controlled and limited.other times the word refers to legal custody,having lawful authority over an individual detention.see id.noting that legal custody indicates t he detention of a person by virtue of lawful process or authority.
because custody under could mean either physical or legal custody,we must decide which definition can most fairly be said to be imbedded in the statute,in the sense of being most harmonious with its scheme and the general purposes that congress manifested.brown,at.three distinct considerations suggest that the word custody in this context refers to legal rather than to physical custody.
first,the statute reaches any sexually dangerous person who is in the custody of the bureau of prisons who has been committed to the custody of the attorney general pursuant to section d because of incompetency to stand trial or against whom all criminal charges have been dismissed solely for reasons relating to the mental condition of the person.a.because the second and third categories include only persons who are in the federal criminal process and thus under the authority of the attorney general as head of the department of justice,the first category is consistent with those other categories if read as including those remanded to the custody of the bop after a federal conviction,at see united states fisher,cir when interpreting a statute,rules of statutory construction require that we give meaning to all statutory provisions and seek an interpretation that permits us to read them with consistency.interpreting custody to mean physical custody would also render the second and third categories superfluous because the first category would encompass them.see endowment for the arts finley,statutory interpretations that render superfluous other provisions in the same enactment are strongly disfavored.internal quotations omitted lane united states,cir noting the basic principle of statutory interpretation instructing courts to avoid a reading which renders some words altogether redundant internal quotations omitted.
second,reading the word custody to mean physical custody produces absurd results that congress could not reasonably have intended.see griffin oceanic contractors,i nterpretations of a statute which would produce absurd results are to be avoided if alternative interpretations consistent with the legislative purpose are available.un
