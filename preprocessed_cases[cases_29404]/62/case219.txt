background 
military commission authority 
congress,by authorizing the use of military force following the september,terrorist attacks,gave the president the power to detain certain individuals as a fundamental and accepted incident to war.boumediene bush,quoting hamdi rumsfeld,plurality opinion.shortly thereafter,president bush issued an order providing for military commission trials of noncitizens he had reason to believe had been or currently were members of or had otherwise participated in terrorist activities directed at the united states.detention,treatment,and trial of certain non citizens in the war against terrorism.a department of defense order created the combatant status review tribunal to determine whether the executive branch had properly designated noncitizen detainees as enemy combatants.memorandum from deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz re order establishing combatant status review tribunal a july,available at.absent such a designation,military commissions lack authority over detainees.providing that the mca purpose is to establish procedures governing the use of military commissions to try alien unlawful enemy combatants engaged in hostilities against the united states hamdi rumsfeld,stating that a citizen held in the united states as an enemy combatant must be given a meaningful opportunity to contest the factual basis for that detention,his designation as an enemy combatant.
after legal challenges on multiple fronts,in hamdan rumsfeld,the supreme court invalidated,as violations of the uniform code of military justice and the geneva conventions,a number of the commission procedures authorized by statute and executive order.in response to hamdan,congress enacted the military commissions act of,stat.mca,e see boumediene,at.the mca authorized trial by military commission for alien unlawful enemy combatant s.mca.
in,congress largely superseded the mca and provided detainees certain additional procedural safeguards.military commissions act of,stat.mca,et.relevant to these proceedings,the mca authorized the president to establish military commissions to try alien unprivileged enemy belligerents,as opposed to the earlier designation,enemy combatants,for violations of the law of war and other offenses triable by military commissions.a b.the offenses specified in the mca are triable by military commission only if the offense is committed in the context of and associated with hostilities.id.c.under the mca,hostilities are any conflict subject to the laws of war.id.
ii.al nashiri 
al nashiri,a saudi national,was arrested in dubai in and held in custody.in september,alnashiri was transferred to guantanamo bay,where he remains in detention.the following year,a combatant status review tribunal determined that al nashiri was an enemy combatant.charges against al nashiri alleging nine violations of the mca were referred to the military commission convening authority in.the charges included the three referenced terrorist plots,conspiring with osama bin laden and others between and to commit terrorism and murder in violation of the law of war,and other related charges.
following referral of these charges,al nashiri formally requested that macdonald not convene a military commission.al nashiri principally argued that the commission could not try him for the alleged offenses because they did not occur in the context of and were not associated with hostilities.this argument was based on a statement by president clinton in response to the cole bombing suggesting that it was a peacetime attack congress failure to declare war or pass any other authorization for the use of military force in response to the cole bombing president bush failure to certify the existence of hostilities in yemen until his war powers resolution report to congress in september and the fact that congress first recognized an armed conflict in yemen in a senate resolution 
macdonald issued orders convening a commission to try al nashiri for the charges associated with the three terrorist plots.in response,al nashiri filed suit in the western district of washington naming macdonald,the sole defendant,in his individual capacity.the complaint alleges that macdonald military commission referral violated c article iii of the constitution and the fifth,sixth,and eighth amendments because the alleged offenses did not occur,as a matter of law,in the context of and were not associated with hostilities.he requested a declaratory judgment stating that neither the president nor congress certified the existence of an armed conflict subject to the laws of war in yemen prior to september and that macdonald acted beyond his authority and in violation of the constitution by issuing orders to convene a military commission with the power to recommend the sentence of death for allegations relating to the three bombing incidents.
the district court dismissed al nashiri suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the grounds that mca and sovereign immunity barred the claims.in the alternative,the court reasoned that even if it had subject matter jurisdiction,principles of restraint articulated in schlesinger councilman,counseled in favor of the court abstention from exercising equitable jurisdiction.
discussion 
military commissions act 
we first consider the threshold question of whether mca stripped the district court of subject matter jurisdiction over al nashiri action.the answer,according to hamad,is yes.
section of the military commissions act provides 
no court,justice,or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the united states who has been determined by the united states to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination.
except as provided in paragraphs and of section e of the detainee treatment act of note,no court,justice,or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider any other action against the united states or its agents relating to any aspect of the detention,transfer,treatment,trial,or conditions of confinement of an alien who is or was detained by the united states and has been determined by the united states to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination.
subsection is not applicable because al nashiri is not seeking a writ of habeas corpus.subsection,however,plainly applies to al nashiri action.see gross fbl fin,inc,statutory construction must begin with the language employed by congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.internal quotation marks omitted.to begin,al nashiri seeks equitable relief based upon a action against an agent of the united states,macdonald as the convening authority.al nashiri,a saudi national,does not contest his designation as an enemy combatant.instead,he challenges the government authority to proceed with his military commission trial,arguing that the alleged offenses did not occur in the context of hostilitie
