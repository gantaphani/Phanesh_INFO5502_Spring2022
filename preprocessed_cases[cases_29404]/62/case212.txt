this case comes to us for a second time.the lawsuit arises from a dispute between darold maxfield and his former employer,cintas corporation cintas.after cintas terminated maxfield employment in august,maxfield brought this action alleging race discrimination and violations of the uniform services employment and reemployment rights act userra,et.the district court granted summary judgment for cintas on all claims.in a prior opinion,we affirmed the dismissal of the claims,but reversed and remanded for further proceedings on maxfield claims under userra.maxfield cintas,cir maxfield i.
on remand,the district court again granted summary judgment for cintas on the userra claims,and maxfield appeals.we conclude that cintas second motion for summary judgment presented the same legal issue that we resolved in our first decision on an evidentiary record that is not substantially different from the record that we considered originally.accordingly,the law of the case dictates that the motion for summary judgment should have been denied.we therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment and remand the case for trial on maxfield claims under userra.
the facts of the case are set forth at length in our opinion in maxfield briefly,as they relate to the userra claims,maxfield has served in the united states army,either in active duty or reserve status,since.he was hired by cintas in july as a service sales representative.he then accepted positions in february as a production supervisor and in may as a facility outside sales representative fos.in july,randy lewis,general manager of cintas facility in maumelle,arkansas,granted maxfield a military for reserve duty from july to september.when maxfield returned from duty in august,cintas transferred him from the fos position to the position of proactive service trainer pst.on january,cintas granted maxfield a military leave of absence through june.in march,cintas eliminated the pst position,and when maxfield returned from military leave,cintas placed him in a telemarketing position.on august,cintas approved military leave for maxfield on august,and.after a dispute over whether maxfield improperly sought to use vacation leave and leave while on military leave for the three days in august,cintas terminated maxfield on august.
maxfield alleges that cintas discriminated against him based on his military service when the company transferred him in august,and when it terminated him in august.in our first opinion,we held that by transferring maxfield from the fos position to the pst position,cintas denied him a benefit of employment within the meaning of userra.maxfield i,at.we further held that maxfield presented sufficient evidence to support a finding that his military status was a motivating factor in cintas decision to transfer him,and that the burden of proof shifted to cintas to show that it would have taken the same action absent maxfield military status.id.at see gagnon sprint,cir explaining that unlike the framework used in title vii cases,userra shifts the burden of persuasion,as well as production,to the employer,abrogated on other grounds,desert palace,costa,d.we concluded that although cintas claimed that it transferred maxfield because he incurred four consecutive months of sales deficits in the fos position,there was still a genuine issue of fact whether maxfield reserve status was a motivating factor in the transfer.maxfield i,at.
with respect to maxfield termination,we held maxfield satisfied his initial burden to show a genuine issue of material fact that his military status was a motivating factor in cintas decision to terminate him,and that the burden of proof shifted to cintas to show that it would have made the decision absent maxfield military status.id.at.we then stated that cintas evidence concerning the circumstances of maxfield leave requests was sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether cintas would have terminated maxfield in any event,and remanded the case for further proceedings.id.
on remand,cintas moved again for summary judgment on the userra claims.in support of its motion,cintas produced an affidavit from lewis,the general manager,which was generated after our first decision.in that affidavit,lewis asserted that even had maxfield not been associated with the military in any way,lewis would have made the same decision to transfer maxfield from the fos position to the pos position in august,and to discharge him in august.the district court,relying on the lewis affidavit,concluded that maxfield had failed to come forward with any evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether cintas would have taken the same employment actions,even absent his military status.the court granted summary judgment and dismissed the complaint.
because this appeal follows a previous decision of another panel concerning whether cintas was entitled to summary judgment on maxfield userra claims,two longstanding rules of practice are implicated.the that when a court decides upon a rule of law,that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages of the same case.little earth of the united tribes,dep t of hous.and urban,cir quoting arizona california,d.this doctrine prevents the relitigation of settled issues in a case,thus protecting the settled expectations of the parties,ensuring uniformity of decisions,and promoting judicial efficiency.id.we will consider a previously decided issue under the doctrine only if substantially different evidence is subsequently introduced or the decision is clearly erroneous and works manifest injustice.id see houghton mcdonnell douglas,cir quoting pyramid life ins.curry,cir.the second applicable prior panel rule provides that one panel of this court has no authority to overrule an earlier decision of another panel.this rule reinforces the doctrine when a case returns to a panel of this court after a prior decision,united states mosby,cir liberty mut.ins.elgin warehouse,cir.because the court has a strong interest in avoiding repetitive litigation,we may raise these doctrines sua sponte.see dilaura power auth.of,cir bollinger oregon,cir unpublished wilson united states,cir although counsel for appellee has not suggested by motion or otherwise,either in the trial court or in this court,that the appeal is barred,we are of the opinion that it is barred by the doctrine of res judicata,and that we should so hold.
having thoroughly reviewed our prior decision in this case,and the arguments and evidence presented by the parties at the various stages of the litigation,we conclude that our decision in maxfield i dictates that the grant of summary judgment for cintas must be reversed.cintas presents the same arguments in support of summary judgment that we rejected on the first appeal,and the evidence of record is not substantially different from that considered by the court in maxfield to explain our conclusion,we set forth a comparison of cintas present position with the matters considered and resolved in our prior decision.
cintas now argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on maxfield claims under userra,because even though a reasonable jury could find that cintas was motivated by maxfield military status,no reasonable jury could reject cintas argument that it would nonetheless have taken the adverse employment actions for permissible reasons.cintas says that it would have implemented the job transfer in august because maxfield experienced negative sales commissions for four consecutive months in.the company argues that it would have terminated maxfield in august,because he deviated from proper procedure when he sought to substitute paid sick leave and vacation leave for military leave,and attempted to gain extra paid days off by fraudulent means.appellee br.these precise arguments were advanced as grounds for affirming the district court grant of summary judgment on the first appeal,and we rejected them.
in its first appellate brief,cintas argued as follows
