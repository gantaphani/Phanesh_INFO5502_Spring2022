the issue in this case is whether a provision of the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act userra,b,which protects the employment rights of members of the armed forces,precludes the enforcement of individual contracts to arbitrate such disputes.we hold that it does not.accordingly,we reverse the district court contrary conclusion.
background 
appellee garrett was hired by circuit city in,while he was a member of the marine reserves.in,circuit city adopted an associate issue resolution program consisting of a nationwide policy for resolving disputes.when the associate issue resolution program was implemented,each associate,including garrett,received a copy of a receipt form,an associate issue resolution handbook,a dispute resolution rules and procedures arbitration rules,and an arbitration form.garrett acknowledged,in writing,his receipt of the policy information,and did not of the arbitration provision within the time period allowed under the policy.
garrett alleges that between december and march,as the american military was preparing for combat in iraq,he began to receive unjustified criticism and discipline from his supervisors.in march,garrett was fired,an action he attributes solely to his status as a marine reserve officer.
garrett sued under userra,and the district court agreed with his contention that b of userra overrides the enforcement of the arbitration agreement.circuit city has appealed from the court judgment denying its motion to compel arbitration.
ii.discussion 
this court reviews de novo a district court ruling on a motion to compel arbitration.am.heritage life ins.lang,cir.
the arbitration agreement between garrett and circuit city provided that claims arising out of cessation of employment would be settled by final and binding arbitration,enforceable by and subject to the federal arbitration act faa,et.to determine whether the agreement between the parties is enforceable,we first review the supreme court arbitration decisions,and then construe userra.
the faa was enacted to reverse the longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration agreements and to place arbitration agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.gilmer lane,d.the faa states that written arbitration agreements are valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.the court has reinforced the strong federal policy favoring arbitration.mitsubishi,at.at.accordingly,once a party makes an agreement to arbitrate,that party is held to arbitration unless congress itself has evinced an intention to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory rights at issue.mitsubishi motors soler,d.garrett bears the burden to prove that congress intended to preclude a waiver of a judicial forum for userra claims.see gilmer,at.at.
in gilmer,the supreme court considered the favored status of arbitration in the employment context when an individual subject to an arbitration agreement alleged a violation of federal discrimination statutes.gilmer,at.at.the court held that statutory discrimination claims under the age discrimination in employment act were subject to mandatory arbitration under the faa.id.at.at.in so holding,the court clarified several issues concerning the faa application it is by now clear that statutory claims may be the subject of an arbitration agreement,enforceable pursuant to faa,id.at.at although arbitration involves submission to an alternate,nonjudicial forum,it does not require a party to forego substantive rights afforded by the particular statute,arbitration is not inconsistent with the important social policies being addressed by federal statutes,id.at.at and limited discovery provisions are nevertheless sufficient to allow a fair opportunity to present discrimination claims,id.at.at.
the court also distinguished between an agreement enforceable pursuant to the faa and union collective bargaining agreements.id.at.at.although both agreements may include arbitration provisions,they may require different treatment under federal law.id.at.at.when all employees in a unit are represented by a union,the collective interest of the bargaining unit may impinge upon individual substantive rights.id.to that end,decisions reflected a concern for the tension between collective representation and individual statutory rights.id.at.at.the court stated,however,that such tension is not present in the enforcement of individual agreements between an employee and the employer.see id.
finally,gilmer elaborated on the difference between substantive rights conferred by congress,such as the prohibition of age discrimination,which must be preserved,even in the arbitral forum,and procedural rights,which include choice of forum and may be waived without running afoul of the substantive intent of congress.id.at.at 
because the parties agreed to arbitrate the dispute at issue the agreement is enforceable unless garrett can demonstrate that congress intended to preclude arbitration.see mitsubishi,at.at.congressional intent will be discoverable in the text of userra,its legislative history,or an inherent conflict between arbitration and userra underlying purposes.gilmer,at.at.
text of userra 
userra antidiscrimination provision prohibits an employer from denying initial employment,reemployment,or any other benefit of employment to a person on the basis of membership in a uniformed service,application for membership,performance of service,application for service,or obligation of service.a.garrett contends,and the district court agreed,that b of userra precludes binding arbitration in stating 
this chapter supersedes any state law including any local law or ordinance,contract,agreement,policy,plan,practice or other matter that reduces,limits,or eliminates in any manner any right or benefit provided by this chapter,including the establishment of additional prerequisites to the exercise of any such right or the receipt of any such benefit.
according to garrett,a right or benefit provided by userra is a plaintiff right to bring suit in federal court.indeed,userra provides two methods for a protected person to enforce substantive rights against a private employer.a person may file a complaint with the secretary of labor who will investigate and attempt to resolve the complaint and request that the secretary refer the matter to the attorney general for further prosecution.a.alternatively,a person may pursue a civil action in federal court,forgoing all agency participation.a in this case,garrett chose the second method.
it is not evident from the statutory language that congress intended to preclude arbitration by simply granting the possibility of a federal judicial forum.as noted above,the supreme court has held that by agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim,a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than a judicial forum.mitsubishi,at.at.in cases involving the sherman act the securities exchange act of the civil protections of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico and the securities act of the court has held substantive statutory rights enforceable through arbitration.with this in mind,it is significant that section b does not mention mandatory arbitration or the faa,notwithstanding that the gilmer decision,issued only three years before enactment of b,extended mandatory arbitration to employment agreements.when congress enacts laws,it is presumed to be aware of all pertinent judgments and opinions of the judicial branch.united states barlow,cir.congress was on notice of gilmer in but did not speak to the issue in the text of b.the text of b is not a clear expression of congressional intent concerning the arbitration of servicemembers employment disputes 
when properly interpreted,b can be harmonized with the faa and mandatory arbitration.its operation and meaning turn,in part,on the terms right or benefit provided by this chapter.the purpose of b is the protection of any right or benefit provided by chapter of userra.b.chapter codifies the rights of soldiers and reservists to reemployment,to leaves of absence,to protection against discrimination and to health and pension plan benefits,among others.see generally.these are substantive rights.additionally,defines rights for the purposes of the chapter 
the term benefit,benefit of employment,or rights and benefits means any advantage,profit,privilege,gain,status,account,or interest other than wages or salary for work performed that accrues by reason of an employment contract or agreement or an employer policy,plan,or practice and includes rights and benefits under a pension plan,a health plan,an employee stock ownership plan,insurance coverage and awards,bonuses,severance pay,supplemental unemployment benefits,vacations,and the opportunity to select work hours or location of employment.
again,the defined substantive rights relate to compensation and working conditions,not to affording a particular forum for dispute resolution.an exclusive judicial forum is not a right protected by chapter of userra,nor is it within the scope of b.
an agreement to arbitrate under the faa is effectively a forum selection clause,see eeoc waffle house,d,not a waiver of substantive statutory protections and benefits thus,b does not conflict with the faa policy to encourage the procedural remedy of arbitration.as recognized by the united states supreme court 
b y agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim,a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than a judicial,forum we must assume that if congress intended the substantive protection afforded by a given statute to include protection against waiver of the right to a judicial forum,that intention would be deducible from text or legislative history.
mitsubishi,at.at.congress took no specific steps in userra,beyond creating and protecting substantive rights,that could preclude arbitration.
the district court overlooked this important distinction between procedural and substantive rights.compare williams cigna fin.advisors,cir holding,with regard to the older workers benefit protection act,that there is no indication that congress intended the owbpa to affect agreements to arbitrate employment disputes and that the owbpa protects against the waiver of a right or claim,not against the waiver of a judicial forum.
garrett also contends that having to arbitrate his claims results in a reduction in the total package of rights and benefits afforded by userra.the right or benefit that arbitration allegedly infringes upon is found in userra b,which the district court interpreted as a guarantee of a federal forum for aggrieved employees.garrett,d at.section b provides that the district courts of the united states shall have jurisdiction of the action against a private employer.this language,however,neither guarantees a right to a federal court trial nor forbids arbitration as an alternate forum.on the contrary,userra provides several means for the resolution of disputes,and there is no guarantee of a federal forum for aggrieved employees.
in yellow freight,donnelly,d,the court construed similar language in title vii to confer concurrent jurisdiction on federal and state courts rather than exclusive federal jurisdiction.id.at.at.concurrent jurisdiction suggests a broad right of the parties to select a forum,including the arbitral forum.gilmer,at.at.because b of userra,like the language in donnelly,confers concurrent jurisdiction,arbitration is a permissible forum choice.see bird,at broad and in some instances exclusive access to federal forum for erisa claims is not evidence of congressional intent to preclude arbitration.
next,while outlines userra enforcement provisions for private or state employees,affords different procedures for federal government employees,which include adjudicating claims in an administrative tribunal,the merit systems protection board mspb.this is significant,because in gilmer,the court phrased the relevant inquiry as whether congress had precluded arbitration or other nonjudicial resolution of claims.gilmer,at.at.the mspb option evidences an intent to allow alternative means of dispute resolution for employees protected by userra.thus,a federal judicial forum is not guaranteed to all employees under userra rather,a federal judicial forum is available to some employees and can be claimed or waived,just as in other antidiscrimination statutes.
legislative history of userra 
garrett emphasizes,as did the district court,that a portion of the legislative history of confirms congressional intent to forbid resort to binding arbitration.the house committee report states 
section b would reaffirm a general preemption as to state and local laws and ordinances,as well as to employer practices and agreements,which provide fewer rights or otherwise limit rights provided under amended chapter or put additional conditions on those rights.see peel florida department of transportation,cir cronin police of city of new york.and fishgold,supra,at,which provide that no employer practice or agreement can reduce,limit or eliminate any right under chapter.moreover,this section would reaffirm that additional resort to mechanisms such as grievance procedures or arbitration or similar administrative appeals is not required.see mckinney,d beckley.it is the committee intent that,even if a person protected under the act resorts to arbitration,any arbitration decision shall not be binding as a matter of law.see kidder eastern air lines.
as reprinted in.
we disagree that this snippet of legislative history should affect our interpretation of section b.first,a powerful line of supreme court authority suggests that legislative history should rarely be used in statutory interpretation,because only the text of the law has been passed by congress,not the history.see,exxon mobil allapattah servs,d.even if legislative history may be consulted to resolve statutory ambiguity,we have found no ambiguity in this provision.second,laying aside these controlling preliminary objections,the house committee report appears to be the only pertinent legislative history concerning b no comparable senate report has been identified.such a scant record,unless explicit and on point,hardly proves congress intention toward all cases involving arbitration.moreover,what was left out of the legislative history is noteworthy.there is no recognition in the report of gilmer endorsement of individual agreements to arbitrate.in any event,the totality of the quoted language,along with its imbedded citations,strongly suggests that congress intended b only to prohibit the limiting of userra substantive rights by union contracts and collective bargaining agreements,and that congress did not refer to arbitration agreements between an employer and individual employee 
finally,this court has rejected reliance on cases involving collective bargaining arbitration as a basis for avoiding arbitration of statutory claims under the faa.carter countrywide credit,cir.this is because,as noted supra,the supreme court explicitly distinguished between cases involving collective bargaining arbitration agreements and individually executed predispute arbitration agreements.gilmer,at.at.the supreme court ultimately conclud ed that the former may not be subject to arbitration while the latter are.carter,at.while earlier arbitration cases arose during a time of judicial skepticism regarding arbitration,gilmer,at.at,the mistrust of the arbitral process expressed in such cases had been undermined by the supreme court recent arbitration decisions.id.at.at see also mitsubishi,at.at.
accordingly,we do not conclude from this one piece of legislative history concerning b that congress intended to exclude all arbitration under userra.
inherent conflict 
garrett asserts that there is an inherent conflict between arbitration and userra underlying structure and purposes.
garrett contends that the administrative and enforcement authority granted by userra to the department of labor and to the attorney general conflict with arbitration.in gilmer,however,the plaintiff unsuccessfully urged that the eeoc authority and role in the enforcement of
