sadeq ahmed was indicted on two counts of making false statements in violation of a,based on written answers he gave about his employment history as part of his background investigation for a baggage screener position with the transportation security administration tsa.after a jury trial resulted in guilty verdicts on both counts,the district court sentenced him to months of imprisonment.ahmed now appeals his conviction,alleging insufficiency of the indictment and evidentiary errors and his sentence,alleging that the district court imposition of a sentence above the guidelines range was unreasonable.we affirm.
in december,sadeq ahmed enlisted in the united states air force,and was stationed at elgin air force base in florida,where he was assigned to the operations support squadron of the fighter wing.his responsibilities included analyzing performance and capability information relating to fighters and pilots,and required security clearance.
in march,ahmed authored and circulated a document defending usama bin laden as a victim of religious persecution,and accusing the united states of acts of terrorism,for,among other things,the use of atomic weapons at hiroshima and nagasaki,bombing of iraqi civilians,imposing sanctions on iraq,and supporting the terrorist state of israel.he further indicated,in statements to other servicemen,that he believed all aircraft flying over iraq should crash,a statement understood to apply to the united states aircraft then enforcing zone restrictions.in a discussion of his document and statements with his supervisor,ahmed indicated that,if the united states went to war with iraq,he would have to fight on the iraqi side.on other occasions,he verbally contemplated the possibility of fighting against,and killing,united states soldiers should the united states become involved in a conflict that violated his religious beliefs,and that he would like the opportunity to fight in the noble cause of his hero,bin laden.
as the events of september,unfolded,ahmed,watching the destruction on television in the company of his colleagues,remarked that the attacks were a beautiful sight,and later commented that the united states deserved the attacks because of its support for israel,and that he was very happy about what had happened.by this time,the operations support squadron commander,steven seroka,had been aware for several months that ahmed statements were causing concern to his superiors.after being informed of ahmed comments on september,seroka asked ahmed superiors to speak with him to determine his loyalties.his superiors met with ahmed to discuss the matter on september,and reported back to seroka that ahmed had specified his loyalty to his family and religion,but had not included the united states or its military among his loyalties,and had stated that he was neither for or against the september attacks.
on september,ahmed was ordered to report in,a formal meeting with his full chain of command that is governed by an established protocol.at the meeting,seroka informed ahmed that he was suspending his access to classified information,and prohibited him from entering the area of the fighter wing.seroka read ahmed a notification of suspension of access,which indicated that a determination had been made to suspend his access to classified information and unescorted entry into restricted areas.ahmed signed and retained a copy of this notification.ahmed also signed a security termination statement,which indicated his termination of access to all classified information,and a document entitled restriction from fighter wing.ahmed was relieved of his duties with the operational support squadron,and assigned to another squadron in another part of the base,which involved no access to classified information.he was escorted from the meeting to his former worksite to gather his personal belongings,and escorted to his new station.at the time of the reporting in,ahmed had been scheduled for discharge on december.
after the meeting,seroka was concerned that stop loss would be implemented before that date,thus potentially deferring ahmed discharge,and asked ahmed new chain of command to discuss an earlier discharge date with him.seroka subsequently approved an advancement of ahmed discharge date to september.subsequent to his discharge on that date,ahmed was mailed his final performance evaluation,and returned a mailed acknowledgment of receipt.in this evaluation,ahmed immediate supervisor,sharpe,rated ahmed positively on a number of points relating to his duties,but categorized his conduct duty as unacceptable,and did not recommend his promotion at this time.the report also included extensive comments from seroka,indicating that the ratings did not fully capture or document the magnitude of sra ahmed disloyal,near seditionist behavior,providing considerable detail regarding ahmed history in this regard,and recommending a more critical evaluation in specific categories.seroka testified at trial that,on advice of military lawyers,he did not seek a dishonorable discharge.
after his discharge,ahmed worked for a private company providing baggage and passenger screening services at detroit metropolitan airport.in october,the tsa took over screening functions,and ahmed was transferred to tsa,conditional on his completion of a security background investigation.as part of that investigation,ahmed completed a questionnaire for public trust positions,developed by the office of personnel management.section of the form asked whether the applicant had,within the last seven years,been 
from job a job after being told you be fired a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory performance a job for others sic reasons under unfavorable circumstances 
ahmed checked no.section of the form asked 
to your knowledge,have you ever had a clearance or access authorization denied,suspended,or revoked,or have you ever been debarred from government employment if yes,give date of action and agency.note an administrative downgrade or termination of security clearance is not a revocation.
ahmed checked no.
on july,ahmed was indicted on two counts of making false statements,in violation of a,based on these responses.on may,the jury returned a guilty verdict on both counts.the district court calculated a guidelines range of zero to six months of imprisonment,and imposed a sentence of months.ahmed filed a timely notice of appeal.
ahmed argues that his indictment failed to allege an offense under because his answers to the questions were literally true or,alternatively,that the vagueness of the questions precludes a finding his responses constituted false statements ahmed raised an objection to count of the indictment,relating to his answer in section,in his motion to dismiss,but raises his objection to count,relating to his answer in section,for the first time on appeal.we review the sufficiency of an indictment de novo,but as to the second count,because it was unchallenged below,we construe the indictment liberally in favor of its sufficiency.united states perry,cir.
ahmed argument rests on the contention that,because he was honorably discharged,his denial of unfavorable circumstances surrounding his departure from the air force was literally true and that because his security clearance had not been revoked an action outside of seroka authority,his answer to the second question was literally true in light of its instruction that an administrative downgrade or termination is not a revocation.ahmed is correct as a legal matter that a indictment premised on a statement which on its face is not false is fatally defective,insofar as a false statement is an element of the crime.united states gatewood,cir quoting united states gahagan,cir.
however,ahmed has in no way demonstrated that his statements were facially true.his contention amounts only to an assertion that under some conceivable interpretation of the questions,his answers would not have been false.he argues,in effect,that because unfavorable circumstances could be construed to exclude an honorable discharge,and because the restricti
