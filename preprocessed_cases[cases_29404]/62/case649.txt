background 
we begin with the regulatory scheme that frames this case.under the veterans preference act of,pub.il,stat.codified at,a preference eligible who has been separated or furloughed without delinquency or misconduct,on request,is entitled to have his name placed on appropriate registers and employment lists for every position for which his qualifications have been established.a.opm has adopted regulations to implement the requirements of section.the regulations are codified at.
sections require that each agency maintain an rpl and establish guidelines for the operation of its rpl.under section a,employees entered on an rpl enjoy,at a minimum,priority consideration over certain outside job applicants.the regulations provide that an agency may not make a final commitment to an individual not on the rpl to fill a permanent or temporary competitive service position when a qualified individual is available on the agency rpl,unless the first individual is on the agency rolls.b,c.
section b requires that each agency establish and maintain a reemployment priority list for each commuting area in which it separates eligible competitive service employees by rif,except as provided by paragraph c of this section.the section c exception states 
an agency need not maintain a distinct rpl for employees separated by reduction in force if the agency operates a placement program for its employees and obtains opm concurrence that the program satisfies the basic requirements of this subpart.the intent of this provision is to allow agencies to adopt different placement strategies that are effective for their particular programs yet satisfy legal entitlements to priority consideration in reemployment.
thus,the regulations require that an agency maintain either an rpl or an alternate program that has obtained opm concurrence or,put another way,approval,as discussed in part iii of the discussion infra.
although agencies must maintain an rpl under sections a and b or an equivalent program under section c,the regulations do not mandate that employees participate in available agency reemployment programs.section clarifies that placement on an agency rpl is not automatic.in order to be entered on an rpl,an employee must first complete an application within the time frame set forth in section a.section a provides 
to be entered on the rpl,an eligible employee under must complete an application registration may take place as soon as a specific notice of separation under part of this chapter,or a certification of expected separation as provided in of this chapter,has been issued.the employee must submit the application within calendar days after the rif separation date.an employee who fails to submit a timely application is not entitled to be placed on the rpl.
even though an employee is not entitled to automatic entry on the rpl,he or she is entitled to receive information from the agency that may aid the employee in applying for the rpl.pursuant to b,at the time employees receive notices of separation or certifications of expected separation ces s,the agency must give each eligible employee information about the rpl,including appeal rights.
employee appeal rights are established by,which provides 
an individual who believes that his or her reemployment priority rights under this subpart have been violated because of the employment of another person who otherwise could not have been appointed properly may appeal to the merit systems protection board under the provisions of the board regulations.
turning to the facts of this case,roberto worked at the navy public works center pwc in guam between and april of.initial decision,slip op.at.as of,roberto held the position of air conditioning equipment mechanic,slip op.at.on april,he was separated from his position due to an rif in guam,slip op.at.at the time of the rif,dod operated both an rpl and a ppp.see,slip op.at.it is undisputed that the ppp was not 
the pwc began issuing notices and holding briefings concerning the impending rif in august of,slip op.at.specifically,joni,the supervisory human resources staff specialist and ppp program manager for the guam human resources office conducted three rif briefings between august and october of.id.briefings focused on explaining rif rules and forthcoming rif notices,slip op.at.very minimal references were made to the agency rpl,which was described as optional.id.appeal rights were also mentioned,but only very generally.id.on november,roberto was issued a ces.the ces contained a list of reemployment programs,including the rpl and the ppp,with brief descriptions of each,slip.roberto was issued a rif notice of separation on december.along with the notice of separation,he received the department of defense displaced employee guide,slip op.at.the guide included a description of dod rpl.id.it also included a description of the separate ppp maintained by dod,slip op.at.among other things,the guide specified that an employee must apply for the rpl within thirty days of separation by an rif.the department of defense displaced employee guide also described employees appeal rights.the guide stated,if you believe that your reemployment priority rights under this program have been violated,you may appeal to the board under the regulations provided 
roberto did not attend any of the three briefings conducted by at during august and october,slip op.at.nor did he read any of the information provided to him about the rpl,slip op.at.however,he did attend a couple of briefings given by persons other than,slip op.at.
in late october of,roberto moved to hawaii because his son required medical treatment there,slip op.at.due to his relocation,roberto was granted leave from guam without pay beginning in january of,slip op.at.while in hawaii,roberto met with claire hashimoto,personnel staffing and classification specialist at the human resource service center for the pacific in honolulu,slip op.at.hashimoto assisted roberto in filling out his forms for registration on dod ppp,slip op.at.however,she testified that she did not actually register roberto for the ppp because that was the responsibility of.id.rather,she stated,she merely aided roberto in filling out his ppp registration forms as a courtesy to.id.although hashimoto typically mentioned the rpl to employees she registered on the ppp,she made no mention of the rpl to roberto,slip op.at.
based on the forms he completed with hashimoto assistance,roberto was successfully registered on the dod ppp,as a result of which he received a temporary position as an air conditioning equipment mechanic at the navy pwc in pearl harbor,slip op.at.while working at his temporary position,roberto also applied for a permanent position as an air conditioning equipment mechanic through the ppp.id.denied roberto application for the permanent position because it determined that he was unqualified.id.one of roberto at the navy pwc in pearl harbor was hired instead for the permanent position.id.
roberto was separated by the rif effective april,slip op.at.
roberto appealed to the board on april.in his appeal,he claimed that his priority rights under were violated because the navy hired a person for the permanent air conditioning equipment mechanic position who otherwise would not have been hired had roberto been properly considered for the position.
as noted above,following a hearing,the aj dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.initial decision,slip op.at.the aj did so on the ground that the board only has jurisdiction over a reemployment priority rights claim under if the appellant was registered under an agency rpl or an ppp.as seen,roberto was not registered on the dod rpl.rather,he was registered on the dod ppp,which was not approved by opm,slip op.at.
the aj rendered his ruling in roberto appeal against a backdrop of conflicting jurisprudence.in stuck department of the navy,the board considered an appeal by an individual who was enrolled in both the dod rpl and ppp and who claimed violations of her rights under both programs.id.at.in stuck,the board held that it had jurisdiction to enforce the employee claims under the ppp.id.at.following stuck,the board was faced with sturdy department of the army,another case involving reemployment priority rights.james sturdy worked as a resource management specialist for the department of the army at fort chaffee,arkansas.after he received notice that he was to be rifed,he registered for dod ppp,the same priority placement program that is at issue in this case.he did not apply for the dod rpl.after being registered on the ppp,sturdy applied for one of three open environmentalist positions at fort chaffee.after the army found that he was not well qualified for the position,it declined to hire him.sturdy was never separated by the rif.eventually,he accepted an offer of reassignment through the ppp to the position of conservation specialist at fort worth,texas,with no reduction in grade or pay.
even though he had not been rifed,sturdy lodged an appeal with the board,claiming that the army had violated his reemployment priority rights when it did not select him for one of the three environmentalist positions at fort chaffee.in an initial decision,the aj to whom the case was assigned dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because sturdy had not registered for the dod rpl.sturdy dep t of the army,no,slip op.on petition for review,the board affirmed the aj dismissal of the appeal,but on another ground.sturdy dep t of the army,sturdy i.citing stuck,the board stated a n agency may maintain both an rpl and a ppp,and the board has held that,pursuant to,it has jurisdiction to review an alleged violation of reemployment priority rights under a ppp.id.at.the board thus agreed with sturdy that his failure to register for the rpl did not necessarily deprive the board of jurisdiction over his appeal.id.nevertheless,the board affirmed the administrative judge dismissal of sturdy appeal for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that an employee could only appeal an alleged violation of reemployment priority rights if the employee was separated from his or her position by an rif,which was not the case with sturdy.id.
the board decision in sturdy i was appealed to this court.while the appeal was pending,however,the government moved for a remand to the board so that the board could address the extent to which changes in a affected the board jurisdiction over an employee who,like sturdy,was notified of an impending rif but was never actually separated from his position.see eligibility due to reduction in force.may.the government remand request was granted.sturdy dep t of the army,table.
on remand,the board deferred to the view of opm that actual separation by an rif was not a necessary predicate for board jurisdiction over an appeal under.sturdy dep t of the army,sturdy ii.the board then ruled that it had jurisdiction in the case even though sturdy had not registered for the rpl because it determined that the army had misinformed sturdy about the rpl and that the misinformation had caused him not to register.id.at.based upon its ruling,the board remanded the case to the aj for adjudication of the merits of sturdy reemployment priority rights claim 
we now return to the aj decision in this case.noting the board decisions in stuck and sturdy,as well as in two subsequent cases,russo department of the navy,and hudson department of the navy,the aj stated that the board statements that it had jurisdiction over a claim under an internal ppp had occurred in the factual context of cases where either the appellant had been on the rpl which is the board basis for jurisdiction and the entrée to enforcement of the ppp or where the appellant ha d claimed that the agency improperly prevented or interfered with registration for the rpl.initial decision,slip op.at.the aj added that it was unclear to him under what basis the board may take jurisdiction over an agency internal ppp.it appears the basis may be the provision of c,or a fact determination that the ppp has in effect replaced the rpl,or both.id.slip op.at.
turning to the jurisdictional issues in the case before him,the aj rejected roberto argument that the dod ppp was operated in lieu of an rpl,thus giving the board jurisdiction based on stuck and c,slip op.at.according to the aj,the most important evidence demonstrating the inapplicability of section c was the fact that dod neither sought nor obtained opm concurrence for its ppp.id.the aj concluded that the dod ppp involved in roberto appeal was not in lieu of of an rpl because the dod ppp is a concurrent,in program.id.
the aj also rejected roberto argument that jurisdiction existed because the dod ppp had in effect replaced the rpl.although the aj found the evidence indicates clearly that the ppp has in effect replaced the rpl,as a practical matter,he concluded that it is unclear how this development gives the board jurisdiction under part,slip op.at.the aj stated that he was unaware of any in effect theory of board jurisdiction,slip op.at.
as far as the dod rpl was concerned,the aj noted that roberto had failed to establish that he applied for the rpl or was registered on it,slip op.at.at the same time,the aj ruled that the board holding in sturdy ii did not provide a basis for jurisdiction because roberto had not shown that the navy had interfered with roberto right to register for the rpl,slip op.at.as seen above,b requires that an agency provide employees with information about the rpl,including appeal rights,at the time the employee receives an rif notice of separation or a ces.id.considering together the very minimal references to the rpl in briefings,the description of the rpl on roberto ces,and the summary in the department of defense displaced employee guide,the aj concluded that the navy had provided roberto with sufficient information to apprise him of the rpl and his appeal rights under section b.
roberto petitioned the board for review of the initial decision.in an order issued september,the two sitting members of the board failed to agree on the disposition of the petition.final decision,under b the initial decision therefore became the final decision of the board.
roberto timely appealed the final decision of the board to this court.we have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to a.
discussion 
we will overturn a board decision only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence.c.we review the board findings regarding questions of law,including jurisdiction,without deference.carley dep t of the army,citing diefenderfer merit.prot.
as seen,the aj determined that the board lacked jurisdiction because roberto failed to register for the rpl and because the dod ppp,for which he did register,was not approved by opm.initial decision,slip op.at.on appeal,roberto acknowledges that he did not register for the rpl within thirty days after the rif,as required by a.he contends,however,that stuck and its progeny establish that the board had jurisdiction over the dod ppp because it was operated in lieu of an rpl under c.roberto also argues that the navy in effect replaced the rpl with the ppp,so that his failure to register for the rpl did not result in the board lacking jurisdiction over his appeal.in any event,he argues,he was not told that he needed to register for the rpl in order to secure his reemployment rights and that,under these circumstances and the reasoning of chairman mcphie in sturdy iii,at,the board has jurisdiction because the navy failed to inform him about the rpl and his appeal rights,in violation of b.
the government argues that because roberto did not register for the rpl and the dod ppp was not,the board did not have jurisdiction over his appeal.the government discounts roberto contention that the board had jurisdiction because the ppp in effect replaced the rpl by arguing that the applicable regulations provide no basis for jurisdiction in a situation where there has been an in effect replacement.with regard to roberto contentions that the board had jurisdiction under section b as a result of the insufficiency of the information provided to him about the rpl,the government argues that the aj decision finding that the information was sufficient should be affirmed because it is supported by substantial evidence.
it is well settled that the board jurisdiction is strictly limited to any action which is appealable to the board under any law,rule,or regulation.a carley,at cowan united states,the board has no plenary jurisdiction rather,its jurisdiction is limited to those areas specifically granted by statute or regulation.the provision that gives the board jurisdiction over reemployment priority rights claims is.
the rules of statutory construction apply when interpreting an agency regulation.wronke marsh,citing united states.when construing a regulation or statute,it is appropriate first to examine the regulatory language itself to determine its plain meaning.meeks west.we may also consider the language of related regulations.see reflectone,dalton,en banc.if the regulatory language is clear and unambiguous,the inquiry ends with the plain meaning.meeks,at.however,if the regulation is silent or ambiguous,the court then gives deference to the agency own interpretations.id.citing nationsbank variable annuity life ins,d.
as noted above,section states,in relevant part,that an appeal may be taken to the board by a n individual who believes that his or her reemployment priority rights under this subpart have been violated t his subpart refers to subpart b of pt.subpart b is titled reemployment priority list rpl.it contains section,which,as already seen,requires that an agency maintain either an rpl or an ppp to provide reemployment priority rights.see a stating that an rpl is the mechanism agencies use in order to give priority reemployment consideration to their former employees separated by reduction in force id.c stating that an program adopted under subsection c must satisfy legal entitlements to priority consideration in reemployment.in short,reemployment priority rights under subpart b are defined by either an rpl or an ppp.from that,we think it logically flows that when section,the jurisdictional regulation,refers to reemployment priority rights under this subpart,it is referring to rights conferred by either an rpl or an ppp.it is not referring to rights conferred by a ppp that have not been approved by opm.accordingly,we hold that unless a ppp receives opm concurrence,jurisdiction over appeals of alleged violations of ppp rights does not lie with the board.because the plain meaning of the regulation is clear,no further inquiry is required into agency interpretations or the regulatory history to determine its meaning.see meeks,at.
an agency may establish a ppp in addition to its rpl without seeking opm concurrence.an employee faced with an impending rif may register on both the rpl and the ppp.when an employee has such,as was the case in stuck,the board has jurisdiction to hear appeals of adverse decisions concerning the rpl under section,ensuring that the employee rights under sections,including the right to appeal,are preserved.thus,it is appropriate to interpret section c in accordance with its plain language so as to give the board jurisdiction over ppps only when they have obtained opm concurrence.
the parties are in agreement that c,when properly construed,requires opm concurrence in order to bring appeals pursuant to an agency ppp under the jurisdiction of the board.they dispute,however,the meaning of the term opm concurrence,as used in section c.at oral argument,counsel for roberto contended that opm concurrence exists when a program is implemented by an agency and allowed to exist without opm objection.on this basis,he urges that the dod ppp in this case was.we do not agree.
we think that opm concurrence under section c means that opm has expressly given documented approval for an agency ppp.section c states that an agency must obtain opm concurrence when replacing its rpl with a ppp.c.in our view,the act of obtaining concurrence requires more than waiting for tacit consent from opm.when subsection c was added to section in,opm expressly noted that the new provision would permit an agency to operate an alternative placement program as an exception to the rpl requirement.in the final regulation,we have clarified that opm prior approval is necessary for such an exception.recruitment,selection,and placement general reduction in force,emphasis added.to us,this statement compels the conclusion that opm concurrence means express approval rather than some kind of tacit assent,as suggested by counsel for roberto.therefore,an agency ppp only falls under the scope of section c when opm has expressly approved the ppp.
as noted,roberto also argues that the board has jurisdiction over his appeal because the dod ppp was operated in lieu of an rpl under c.according to roberto,the navy in effect replaced the dod rpl with the ppp,so that his failure to register for the rpl did not result in the board lacking jurisdiction over his appeal.we are not persuaded by roberto arguments.first,there is simply no factual basis for the assertion that dod ppp was operated in lieu of its rpl.it is clear that dod has an rpl and that,in addition,it operates a separate ppp.turning to roberto second argument,it is true that the aj the government does not dispute the,as a practical matter,the navy in effect replaced dod rpl with the ppp.initial decision,slip op.at.the aj concluded,however,that this finding did not lead to the conclusion that the board had jurisdiction in this case,slip op.at.we agree.
merely replacing a rpl with a ppp in effect does not provide a basis for jurisdiction before the board.the board jurisdiction is strictly limited to areas that are governed by statute or regulation.see carley,at.by its plain language,c only encompasses situations where an agency discontinues its rpl and replaces it with an ppp.nothing in sections governs an agency ppp that in effect replaces a rpl when the rpl has not in fact been discontinued.roberto argues that the board decision in stuck provides grounds for jurisdiction based on an in effect replacement of the rpl.the board in stuck noted that the employee in that case 
has shown that to deny her review of her claims under the ppp in effect denies her review by the board of her claims under.in this regard,the board has found that it will enforce an agency own policy even if that policy or regulation grants the employee greater rights than she would have had under the general regulations.
stuck,at.if this language from stuck is read to give the board jurisdiction over an agency ppp that in effect replaces an rpl even though there is no law,rule or regulation governing such an in effect replacement of the rpl,it would greatly expand the board jurisdiction in contravention of well settled law requiring a rule,regulation or statute for board jurisdiction.see a carley,at.we do not read stuck to broadly expand the board jurisdiction.because the employee in stuck was registered on both the rpl and the ppp,stuck,at,the board had jurisdiction based on the employee registration on the rpl.stuck does not expand the jurisdiction of the board to encompass the in effect replacement of a rpl by a ppp.
roberto also argues that,in any event,the board had jurisdiction over his appeal because the navy failed to advise him of his rights under the dod rpl.in making this argument he points to the regulation at b.as seen above,section b provides that a t the time it gives a specific rif notice of separation or a certification of expected separation,the agency must give each eligible employee information about the rpl,including appeal rights.
we have not addressed whether a violation of section b would give the board jurisdiction.we have,however,addressed the government obligations under similar statutes and regulations.brush office of personnel management,involved similar provisions of the civil service retirement act of,which require that the government inform annuitants of their rights under j and k.id.at citing,stat,as amended by,reorganization plan of,stat.codified at note the director of the office of personnel management shall,on an annual basis,inform each annuitant of such annuitant rights of election under sections j and k of title,united states code.in brush,the government had failed to comply with the notice requirement of section.id.at.we held that a spousal annuity was not precluded by the failure of the annuitant to make a timely election because of the government violation of its duty to inform the annuitant.id.similarly,in johnston office of personnel management,a statute and related regulations required that the agency provide employees with notice of separation from employment and the employee eligibility for disability retirement.id.at.we held that an employee who did not receive notice as required by the statute and regulations was not barred from receiving disability retirement benefits even though the employee had applied after the filing deadline.id.at.we think that in view of the similarity of the mandate to provide information in section b and the notice provisions before the court in brush and johnston,it follows that when an agency fails to provide information about its rpl to an eligible employee as required by section b,the employee should not be barred from enjoying the benefits of registration on the rpl including the right to appeal to the board,even if the employee failed to apply for the rpl within the time limit set forth in section a.
the board addressed the exact issue before us in sturdy ii.in sturdy ii,the board held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to b and because the army provided insufficient information about rpl registration to an eligible employee,thereby denying him his appeal rights.at see also sturdy iii,at separate opinion of chairman mcphie noting that the board has jurisdiction when,in violation of section,an agency fails to provide adequate information about its rpl.
based on the foregoing,we hold that an agency failure to correctly inform an eligible employee of his or her rpl rights in a timely fashion,as required by section b,constitutes a violation of the employee reemployment priority rights.such a violation of reemployment priority rights is appealable to the board under 
although a violation of b would give the board jurisdiction under,roberto has not demonstrated such a violation.section b requires that an agency provide eligible employees with information about the rpl,including appeal rights.the aj found that the navy provided roberto with sufficient information about the rpl to comply with the regulation.initial decision,slip op.at.this factual finding of the board will only be overturned if it is not supported by substantial evidence.bolton merit.prot.
in finding that the navy provided roberto with information about the rpl as required by section b,the aj noted that the navy held several briefings in which references to the rpl were made.the aj also noted that there was a description of the rpl on roberto ces and that the navy provided roberto with the department of defense displaced employee guide when he received his rif notice of separation.initial decision,slip op.at.the department of defense displaced employee guide contained a description of the rpl and roberto right to appeal to the board.id.roberto disputes neither that the navy held briefings wherein the rpl was mentioned nor that the navy sent him at least these two documents containing descriptions of the rpl.instead,roberto claims that some of the documents provided to him by the navy described the ppp without mentioning the rpl and that hashimoto did not disclose to him the importance of registering for the rpl when she assisted him with his ppp forms.the navy failure to mention the rpl at every opportunity does not undermine the fact that the navy did provide roberto with information about the rpl at several briefings,with his ces,and with his rif notice of separation.we hold that these briefings and documents provide substantial evidence supporting the aj conclusion that the navy fulfilled its obligation under section b to inform roberto about the rpl and his appeal rights.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the decision of the board dismissing roberto appeal for lack of jurisdiction is affirmed.
each party shall bear its own costs.
the relevant provisions of the code of federal regulations have not been amended since,when roberto was separated by the rif.thus,unless otherwise indicated,all references are to the version of the code of federal regulations.
the agency rpl and ppp remain in effect today.the ppp still has not been approved by opm.

the two sitting members of the board agreed that the board lacked jurisdiction over roberto appeal,but wrote separately to express their different rationales.in chairman mcphie view,the board lacked jurisdiction over roberto appeal because roberto failure to register on an rpl or an ppp was not due to agency misinformation.final decision,at.member marshall wrote that agency misinformation is irrelevant to the jurisdictional inquiry.id.she based her conclusion that the board lacked jurisdiction solely on the fact that roberto was not registered on an rpl or an ppp.id.
indeed,the government does not challenge the proposition that a violation of section b would confer jurisdiction on the board.at oral argument,counsel for the navy was asked to comment on the following in the sturdy iii case,chairman mcphie expressed the view that there can also be jurisdiction if,in fact,the agency fails to inform its employees about the available programs or misinforms the employees.counsel for the navy replied,our view is that would be sort of a constructive denial of rpl rights and that would give the mspb jurisdiction over the allegations of constructive denial of rpl rights,but not jurisdiction over allegations o
