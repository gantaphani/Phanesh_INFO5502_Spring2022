background 
in early christine lozowski,then a chief petty officer stationed in washington,applied and was selected to be promoted to chief warrant officer cwo.she was not immediately assigned to a cwo position,however.instead she was placed on the warrant officer selection list,from which individuals were promoted sequentially as positions came open.in late summer,the coast guard sought to fill two cwo vacancies that would arise in early.the first vacancy was aboard the seneca,a cutter based out of boston.for this slot,the coast guard preferred a finance and supply cwo with a storekeeper background.the second vacancy was in ketchikan,alaska.lozowski,who had a storekeeper background,was second on the warrant officer selection list at the time the assignments were to be made.she preferred to be assigned to coast guard headquarters in or to yorktown or portsmouth,virginia,whereas her least desired locations were alaska and california.the first person on the selection list was mark cornejo,who was serving in alaska his most desired service area and had a food service background.the situation can be summarized as follows 
the assignment officer in charge of filling these openings was cwo gray.at first gray wanted to assign lozowski to the seneca and cornejo to ketchikan where he would for several months be,that is,would overlap with the officer he was replacing.the arrangement would keep cornejo in alaska,prevent lozowski from having to go to alaska in accord with the wishes of each and assign a cwo with a storekeeper background to the seneca.gray soon found out,however,that the seneca did not have berthing space for a woman.gray knew that cwo rich,a male cwo with a storekeeper background assigned to the thetis out of key west,wanted to transfer to new england to be near his family and was willing to pay his own moving expenses.gray called the executive officer of the thetis and learned that the ship had berthing space for a woman.there is also evidence that gray thought the thetis needed a woman officer.the information relevant at this point can be summarized as follows 
facing this situation,gray proposed that the coast guard assign cornejo to alaska,rich to the seneca,and lozowski to the thetis.the plan was approved by gray superiors and the parties were notified.cornejo said he would accept the alaska assignment but lozowski asked to be assigned to somewhere in the area.she expressed concern that if she moved from she would be forced to sell her home at a loss.gray said he could not give her an assignment in the area because it would require.lozowski then declined the assignment to the thetis and therefore lost her chance at a promotion to cwo.rich was notified that he would not be transferred to the seneca and the seneca position was filled by cwo smith,who was the next in line behind lozowski and had a background in food service.
in lozowski applied to the department of transportation board for correction of military records for a retroactive promotion pursuant to a.that statute authorizes the secretary of transportation,acting through boards of civilians,to correct any military record of the secretary department when the secretary considers it necessary to correct an error or remove an injustice.pursuant to b,the decision of the board serves as the decision of the secretary only if the board is unanimous.if the board is divided,then the secretary or his delegate has the final word.
lozowski claimed that the coast guard both assigned her out of sequence and disregarded article.of the coast guard personnel manual,which provides that women will not arbitrarily be denied an assignment solely because of lack of a second woman.the latter claim was based upon lozowski belief that she was assigned to the thetis because the coast guard planned to assign a female ensign to that ship and wanted to avoid having only one woman on board.the board unanimously denied lozowski application.application for correction of coast guard record of christine lozowski,doc.at april,first bd.
lozowski then petitioned for review in the district court,which remanded the matter to the board on the grounds that it had erred procedurally and had failed to address two arguments the court thought lozowski had raised.lozowski slater,at lozowski i.on remand two members of the board would have upheld lozowski claim they concluded that although the coast guard had not discriminated against her on the basis of her gender,it had been unfair in treating cornejo and rich more favorably than it had treated her.application for correction of coast guard record of christine lozowski,doc.at,second bd.because the board decision was not unanimous,however,the matter was forwarded to the secretary for approval,disapproval,or return for further consideration.b.the secretary delegate,the deputy general counsel dgc of the coast guard,ruled against lozowski.

the basis for any difference in treatment was not gender,but the fact that the perceived preferences expressed by the two male officers generally paralleled coast guard needs,while the preferences lozowski expressed did not

after the dgc decision,upon renewed the district court granted summary judgment for lozowski and,instead of remanding the matter to the secretary,purported to appoint her a cwo retroactive to january.lozowski slater,at lozowski ii.the court held that the dgc decision was arbitrary and capricious because it failed adequately to address two arguments the majority of the board had accepted that the coast guard had not shown the relevant assignments best satisfied the needs of the service and the coast guard committed an injustice because it was willing to cornejo in alaska but unwilling to lozowski in id.at.the secretary of transportation now appeals.
ii.analysis 
because the district court entered a summary judgment,we review its decision de novo and therefore,in effect,review directly the decision of the secretary.see frizelle slater.under the apa we must uphold the secretary decision unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,otherwise not in accordance with law,or unsupported by substantial evidence.this test requires that the secretary decision contain a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm,d.
a.the decision of the district court 
although we review the decision of the secretary directly,as though the district court had not weighed in,a due regard for the opinion of that court leads us to point out where and why we disagree with its analysis.according to the district court the dgc failed to explain why the needs of the coast guard were best satisfied by the assignment of lozowski to the thetis,cornejo to alaska,and rich to the seneca and the coast guard was willing to cornejo in alaska but unwilli
