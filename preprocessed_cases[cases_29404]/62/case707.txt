daniel lindsay appeals the decision of the court of federal claims dismissing his challenge to actions by the united states air force that led to his involuntary separation from service namely,particular officer evaluation reports prepared in,his subsequent nonselections for promotion to major and lieutenant colonel,and the refusal of the air force board for correction of military records to void either the contested reports or his nonselections.the court of federal claims held that lindsay complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted in that it presented a nonjusticiable challenge to discretionary military functions,or,in the alternative,that lindsay had failed to set forth a sufficient connection between the alleged errors in his records and his nonselection for promotion.we hold that lindsay presents a justiciable challenge grounded on the alleged failure of the air force to follow its own procedural regulations.we further hold that lindsay allegations,if proven,would set forth enough material to impel a further inquiry into the relationship between the alleged errors and his nonselection,and therefore vacate the dismissal of his complaint.
background 
appellant daniel lindsay served in the united states air force from to,after having been honorably discharged and transferred from the army,where he served from to.he served in the air force reserve from to,earning the rank of captain and the aeronautical rating of navigator,and was integrated into the regular air force in.
in,lindsay was a navigation instructor with the technical assistance field team taft,airborne warning and control awac training squadron,based at tinker air force base in oklahoma.under an arrangement approved in,the united states had agreed to sell billion worth of awacs radar surveillance aircraft and refueling aircraft to saudi arabia.lindsay duties with the taft included instructing royal saudi air force rsaf personnel to operate the awacs aircraft before the first planes were delivered to saudi arabia in june.
during this assignment,lindsay experienced difficulties with a particular rsaf trainee,a flyer of considerable family political influence but allegedly lesser navigational skills.according to lindsay superior,major mcmaster,this particular rsaf trainee resented being assigned an instructor he outranked,and proved uncooperative during training,frequently arriving late or not at all for flight briefings.after the taft team deployed to saudi arabia to complete the training,this rsaf officer reportedly threatened to have various taft personnel,contractors,and nationals expelled from saudi arabia,and eventually left the awacs program.
lindsay,however,did not deploy to saudi arabia with the rest of the taft.allegedly due to the political influence exerted by the rsaf trainee family,the saudi chief of the awacs program requested that lindsay be replaced with another instructor before the team came to saudi arabia,because dan lindsay is too young in his experience to be able to do full justice to his appointment in the kingdom.as a result of this request,lindsay was removed from his assignment and remained at tinker air force base in oklahoma,while the rest of the the two officers above him in the chain of command,major mcmaster and mcmaster superior,major deployed to saudi arabia.
lindsay received an officer effectiveness report oer for the period of september to may,during which these events took place.at this time,the preparation of oers was governed by air force regulation afr,as amended in.afr specified that three officers were to sign a ratee oer a rater,an additional rater,and an indorser.these three officers occupied successively higher positions in the rating chain,which was usually the same as the chain of supervision.thus,the rater who prepared most of the evaluation was usually the officer immediate supervisor,while the role of additional rater was to be filled by the rater rater,the officer two levels above the ratee in the rating chain.thus,in may of,the persons designated by afr to be lindsay rater and additional rater were,respectively,major mcmaster and major morris.
the third officer to sign an oer was the indorser,by default the additional rater rater three levels above the ratee in the chain.however,the indorser was permitted to defer to a person higher in the rating chain if desired,in which case the person deferred to became the indorser.according to lindsay,the level at which an oer was indorsed was a critical marker of an oer favorability,and an oer indorsed at a low level was a clear do not promote signal to subsequent selection boards.
because the rest of the taft deployed to saudi arabia in may of,lindsay immediate superior and rater,major mcmaster,submitted his comments in draft and signed the oer form in blank.mcmaster later stated that certain portions of his comments were not transcribed correctly onto lindsay final oer,although those errors were subsequently corrected.
mcmaster rater was major morris also deployed to saudi arabia,and above morris in the reporting chain were three officers who remained stationed in oklahoma major slagle operations officer of the awac training squadron,colonel commander of the squadron,and colonel sterk commander,awac wing.lindsay may oer was signed by major slagle as additional rater,and by colonel sterk as indorser.lindsay complaint alleged that the presence of major was three steps higher in the rating chain than his additional rater violated afr.afr required that the additional rater be the rater rater,two steps higher than lindsay in the rating chain or someone lower in the rating chain when deemed appropriate.thus,major morris,the officer who recommended that lindsay be removed from the taft,would ordinarily have been the additional rater.at least for purposes of this appeal,the government does not contest that lindsay oer was written in violation of regulation.
although slagle made positive comments on lindsay oer,he,and his superior,colonel,later stated that they did not recommend lindsay oer for a high level of indorsement.allegedly on account of these recommendations,colonel sterk,an grade officer,signed lindsay may oer rather than passing it to a higher level officer for indorsement.according to lindsay,this low level of indorsement,a steep decline from the officers who had indorsed his two previous oers and the and officers who indorsed subsequent oers,had extraordinarily damaging consequences for his promotion prospects.further damaging in lindsay view was sterk final recommendation promote which,along with other language only moderately praising lindsay abilities,was allegedly an unambiguous do not promote recommendation.
although lindsay also alleged that his october oer was closed out without all facts available to the indorser an,lindsay alleges that his may oer was primarily responsible for his being passed over for promotion to major in december,when percent of his peer navigators were selected for promotion.according to lindsay,the consequences of such a though lindsay was promoted to major by his next selection board in devastating.although lindsay next board selected him above zone for promotion to major,lindsay was not selected for promotion to lieutenant colonel by his next board in november.lindsay claims that his previous promotion,as well as the continued presence of the oers in his records,handicapped him in comparison to other candidates who had been promoted to major the first time,from within the zone.major lindsay was considered for above zone promotion to lieutenant colonel in october by a second board,which selected only one percent of the above zone navigators for promotion.major lindsay was not one of these one percent,and his second failure of selection for promotion compelled him to retire from the air force in.
immediately after his retirement,lindsay petitioned the air force board for correction of military records afbcmr to void his may and october oers,and for retroactive promotion to major in.the afbcmr denied his petition as untimely.upon to the which lindsay now represented by counsel also sought promotion to lieutenant colonel and board found that it would be in the interest of justice to excuse the failure to timely file.however,the board found no error,injustice,or violation of regulations in lindsay oers.the afbcmr further found that lindsay selection boards had sufficient records of lindsay performance before them in order to make their promotion decisions.lindsay appealed the afbcmr decision to the court of federal claims,which upon the government motion dismissed his complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.the court of federal claims held that lindsay claim was not justiciable,or,in the alternative,that he had failed to allege sufficient facts to demonstrate a nexus between the alleged errors in his oers and his nonselection for promotion.a vests this court with exclusive jurisdiction over lindsay appeal from the dismissal of his claim.
when the court of federal claims dismisses a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,we review the propriety of that dismissal de novo.boyle united states.a motion to dismiss under court of federal claims rule b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is appropriate when the facts asserted by the claimant do not entitle him to a legal remedy.in reviewing the dismissal,the court accepts all factual allegations as true and draws all reasonable inferences in the claimant favor.id.we decide de novo whether a claim challenging a military decision presents a nonjusticiable question.adkins united states.
the fundamental question of justiciability we confront here is whether tests and standards exist against which a court can measure the challenged action.voge united states.because decisions as to the composition,training,equipping,and control of a military force are essentially professional military judgments,gilligan morgan,d,the substance of such decisions,like many other judgments committed to the discretion of government officials,is frequently beyond the institutional competence of courts to review.voge,at.judgments made by military officials or administrative bodies that a particular officer does not merit promotion or retention fall into this category,and courts will refuse on jurisprudential grounds to review such decisions,even if the court has jurisdiction to do so.based on this principle,neither the court of federal claims nor this court will review those specific conclusions of military review boards that speak to the question of whether an officer deserved to be promoted or retained in service.such unreviewable determinations include a conclusion that removal of a defective oer would not have made any difference to an officer prospects for retention on active duty in the reserves,sargisson united states,or prospects for promotion,fluellen united states.
where,however,review is sought not of the substance of a military decision,but instead its compliance with an applicable statute or regulation,we have not abstained from review.the military no less than any other organ of the government is bound by statute,and even when granted unfettered discretion by congress the military must abide by its own procedural regulations should it choose to promulgate them.see murphy united states.a claim of procedural violations may present a justiciable controversy because the test or standards against which this court measures the military action are inherent they are the applicable statutes and regulations.adkins,at.a claim for relief based on an allegedly defective oer therefore states a justiciable controversy if the claim is premised on procedural defects in the process that are clear violations of a statute or regulation that governs the process by which oers are compiled and considered.see,id.at engels united states,hary united states,cunningham united states,fed.cl,womack united states,fed.cl,
in the case before us,lindsay complaint alleged at least one prejudicial violation of a specific objective requirement of a regulation namely,afr,which designates the additional rater as the rater rater or someone lower in the rating chain.lindsay contends that whether his may oer complied with afr is a determination within the scope of judicial competence,and therefore the afbcmr failure to correct that oer is a decision that may be reviewed by the court of federal claims in connection with the relief lindsay seeks.the court of federal claims,however,concluded that lindsay had presented a nonjusticiable claim,relying primarily on the authority of fluellen united states.in fluellen,an air force officer challenged the decision of a selection board that had relied upon a senior rater promotion recommendation form,which in turn relied upon an oer that was later voided by the afbcmr.fluellen,at.the afbcmr concluded that,even if the oer had been improperly considered,the removal of this one oer from the record would not have made any difference to fluellen prospects for promotion.because the afbcmr decision required an evaluation of fluellen promotability,we held that the lack of an applicable statutory or regulatory standard to gauge the afbcmr promotability decision precluded judicial review of that decision.id.at.thus,the board decision in fluellen,like that in sargisson and murphy,could not be reviewed because a court lacks the special expertise needed to review officers records and rank them on the basis of relative merit.sargisson,at.
here,contrary to the court of federal claims impression,the afbcmr did not conclude that the challenged oers would not have affected lindsay passovers.although lindsay requested the board to void the may and october oers,the board refused to do so,finding no violation of regulations in colonel sterk indorsement and no evidence the contested reports were in error or unjust.but rather than concluding that removal of the challenged oers would not have affected lindsay prospects for promotion,the board simply concluded that lindsay selection boards had sufficient records in order to make reasonable determinations concerning his promotability.because the afbcmr rejected lindsay allegations of error or injustice in his oers,we can only interpret the afbcmr conclusion to state that lindsay record,with the challenged oers included,provided a sufficient evidentiary basis on which the selection board could determine lindsay promotability.thus,in contrast to fluellen and sargisson,the afbcmr here made no discretionary judgments regarding lindsay fitness for promotion.had the afbcmr concluded that removal of the challenged oers would not have affected lindsay passovers,its determination would not be reviewable its determination that the challenged oers were free of error or injustice is reviewable.
the government,relying on lindsay allegations that the low indorsement level of his oers crippled his air force career,seeks to frame this case as a challenge to the indorsement of the oers,primarily the indorsement by colonel sterk of lindsay may oer.the government argues that because the decision by an indorser to pass the oer higher up in the rating chain is a discretionary one,and because colonel sterk failure to do so violated no regulation,colonel sterk indorsement was an unreviewable exercise of military discretion.the government premises are sound but its ultimate conclusion is not.lindsay alleged regulatory violation in this case is not that colonel sterk improperly failed to defer the oer to a indorser,but that the wrong person served as the additional rater.whether lindsay can establish a nexus between that irregularity and his nonselection remains to be seen,but the identity of the additional rater is fixed by regulation and the question of whether or not his oer is legally defective for having been written in violation of a published air force regulation is one that lies within the competence of courts to assess.
although the court of federal claims dismissed lindsay claim as nonjusticiable,the court of federal claims concluded in the alternative that the alleged errors in lindsay records did not rise to the level of legal or procedural error warranting review of the board recommendation.as the court of federal claims recognized,ev
