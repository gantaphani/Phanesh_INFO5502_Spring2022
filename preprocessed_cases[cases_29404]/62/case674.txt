background 
this case presents significant questions concerning the appointment process for military officers.the constitution provides that the president has the authority to nominate and,by and with the advice and consent of the senate,to appoint officers of the united states.const.art.ii,cl.three separate actions are ordinarily required for a person to be appointed to office pursuant to this provision the president nomination,confirmation by the senate,and the president appointment after senate confirmation.see marbury madison,cranch.in accordance with this process,the president first selects a nominee and sends the nomination to the senate.the senate acts on the nomination and determines whether or not to confirm the nominee.if the nominee is confirmed,the president appoints the officer and signs a commission or performs some other public act as evidence of the officer appointment.see id.at.the constitution also provides that congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers,as they think proper,in the president alone,in the courts of law,or in the heads of departments.const.art.ii,cl.
a naval officer is an officer of the united states in accordance with article ii.see united states mouat.holding that a naval officer who holds his place by virtue of an appointment by the president is an officer of the united states.the permanent promotion of a military officer to a higher grade,as well as his initial appointment,is subject to this constitutional process.see weiss united states,d holding that the appointments clause can not be circumvented by unilaterally appointing an incumbent to a new and distinct office,aff g,all regular officers of the military services are appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate active duty military officers are appointed and confirmed again upon each promotion to a grade above pay grade.shoemaker united states.
beginning in,congress attempted to regularize the promotion process for military officers,including naval officers.in particular,congress directed the navy to use a process involving selection boards for promoting naval officers to fill vacancies in the grades of commander,captain,and rear admiral.see act of,ch,stat.pursuant to the statute,a selection board selected officers in a particular grade to fill vacancies in the next higher grade and submitted a report with its recommendations to the president for approval or disapproval,stat.at.the selection board process was expanded in to encompass the promotions of all naval officers to grades above lieutenant junior grade.see officer personnel act of,a,stat.
in,the defense officer personnel management act dopma,stat,was enacted.dopma provides for selection boards,which recommend officers between the grades of lieutenant junior grade and rear admiral lower half in the navy and first lieutenant and brigadier general in the army,air force,and marine corps for promotion to the next higher permanent grade.see a supp.i.the board submits its recommendations in a written report to the secretary of the appropriate military branch.see.after reviewing the report,the secretary submits the report to the secretary of defense for transmittal to the president for his approval or disapproval.id.c.the statute also requires the secretary concerned to place the names of the approved officers within particular categories called competitive categories on a promotion list in order of their seniority once the president has approved the selection board report.see id.a.the statute provides 
o fficers on a promotion list for a competitive category shall be promoted to the next higher grade when additional officers in that grade and competitive category are needed.promotions shall be made in the order in which the names of officers appear on the promotion list and after officers previously selected for promotion in that competitive category have been promoted.

the statute also provides that the secretary may prescribe regulations that provide for the delay of an officer appointment if there is cause to believe that the officer is mentally,physically,morally,or professionally unqualified to perform the duties of the grade for which he was selected for promotion.id.d.pursuant to this authority,the secretary has promulgated regulations in paragraph of secretary of the navy instruction secretary instruction a.the statute and regulations impose two limitations on the secretary authority to delay an officer appointment in accordance with subsection d.first,the officer whose appointment has been delayed must be given written notice of the grounds for the delay,unless it is impracticable to give such written notice before the effective date of the appointment,in which case such written notice shall be given as soon as practicable.id.d.second,the officer appointment may not be delayed under this subsection for more than six months after the date on which the officer would otherwise have been appointed unless the secretary concerned specifies a further period of delay.id.d.the regulations include similar provisions.see secretary instruction a.
the current statute,like its predecessor,states that appointments are made by the president,by and with the advice and consent of the senate,id.c repealed the navy follows a formal process of nomination,confirmation,and appointment for its officers,apparently designed to take account of the constitutional requirements.in accordance with the statute,the secretary of the navy convenes selection boards and approves their selections.see a,a.the selections are forwarded to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff,if required the secretary of defense and the president,who may remove names from the recommended list.see id.b d.the president then nominates officers from the recommended list and forwards the nominations to the senate.see generally department of defense instruction providing regulations governing the nomination processes of the military branches.if an officer is not confirmed by the senate,his name must be removed from the promotion list.b.once the officer has been confirmed by the senate,he must next be appointed.for example,when an officer is appointed to the grade of rear admiral,the special assistant for flag officer management and distribution prepares a letter of appointment,which can only be signed with the express approval of the secretary of the navy,acting for the president.this letter is issued to the appointee,along with a certificate of appointment.the appointee need not formally accept the appointment,as a n officer who is appointed to a higher grade under section of this title is considered to have accepted such appointment on the date on which the appointment is made unless he expressly declines the appointment.a.the secretary concerned determines the date of the appointment,pursuant to d see id.b.
in this case,a selection board selected the appellant for promotion to rear admiral in the fall of.the president approved the selection board recommendation,and the appellant was nominated by the president to be rear admiral on march.see cong.rec.the appellant was confirmed by the senate on june,see cong.rec,and he was placed on the staff corps flag officer promotion list with a projected promotion date of september.on january,the office of the chief of naval operations informed the appellant that the secretary of the navy was considering recommending that the appellant name be removed from the promotion list.the officer who was next in line behind the appellant for promotion to rear admiral was promoted on september.on september,chief of naval personnel notified the appellant that his promotion to the grade of rear admiral was delayed.two additional officers were promoted to rear admiral on march,and june,respectively.
on september,the secretary of the navy recommended that the appellant name be removed from the promotion list,and the president removed the appellant name from the promotion list on june,more than six months after the september,date on which the officer to the appellant was promoted the reasons for the president removal of the appellant name from the promotion list need not detain us.in essence,the secretary of the navy recommended to the president that the appellant name be removed because the appellant had received an adverse fitness report from his commanding officer,vice admiral koenig,concerning the conduct of the appellant relationship with a woman during the period after he had become separated from his wife.as discussed in greater detail below,one question is whether the appellant had automatically been promoted in accordance with subsection a before the president removed his name from the promotion list.another is whether the president was obligated to appoint him.because the navy viewed him as not promoted,the appellant was required to retire from active duty on february,when he reached the maximum permissible tenure in the grade of rear admiral lower half.
the appellant also submitted a request for masp to the chief of the bureau of medicine and surgery on december.masp is a n entitlement for medical corps officers who agree to remain on active duty for a period of not less than year as computed from the effective date of the masp agreement,provided as additional pay to enhance the retention rate of such officers.secretary instruction c.the appellant sought masp in the amount of for the period from january,to december.an officer seeking masp must d emonstrate an adequate level of military and professional performance as determined and documented by the commanding officer.id.the appellant request for masp was denied,based at least in part on vice admiral koenig adverse fitness report,on january.the appellant argues that the fitness report was improper and that he is entitled to masp if the fitness report is held invalid.
on march,the appellant applied to the board for correction of naval records board,seeking removal of vice admiral koenig fitness report from his records.the appellant also sought the restoration of his name to the promotion list,promotion to rear admiral effective september,and payment of masp,arguing that the removal of his name from the promotion list and the denial of masp were based on the allegedly improper fitness report.on january,the board recommended that the secretary of the navy provide all of the relief sought by the appellant.however,the assistant secretary of the navy for manpower and reserve affairs rejected the board recommendation and denied the appellant requested relief.
on april,the appellant brought suit in the court of federal claims,alleging that he had been automatically promoted to rear admiral as of september.he sought the corresponding pay and benefits of that grade along with the masp of that he had been denied.in addition,because the appellant was required to retire from active duty on february,he sought reinstatement to the navy.the court of federal claims granted the government motion for summary judgment on the administrative record.the court held that the president removal of the appellant name from the promotion list was proper and,therefore,that he had not been promoted by operation of law.dysart,slip op.at.the court also held that the appellant claim for masp was because there was no procedural error in the navy denial of masp.id.at citing voge united states.the appellant timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we review legal determinations such as the court of federal claims decision to award summary judgment on the administrative record without deference,applying the same standard of review as the court of federal claims.haselrig united states.accordingly,we must uphold the secretary decision denying the appellant relief unless the secretary acted in a manner that is arbitrary,capricious,contrary to law,or unsupported by substantial evidence.id.
the appellant argues that he was promoted by operation of law on september,when the officer to him was promoted,and before the president removed his name from the promotion list on june.the appellant recognizes that the statute and regulations provide a mechanism for delaying an appointment,see d secretary instruction a,but he alleges that the attempt to delay his appointment was improper and ineffective under the statute and regulations.first,the appellant argues that the january,letter did not constitute written notice of the grounds for the delay.d secretary instruction a.second,he argues that the september,letter informing him that his promotion was delayed came after he had already been automatically promoted.third,he argues that,even if his promotion were properly delayed,it could not have been delayed for more than six months after september,when the officer to the appellant was promoted,because the secretary did not specify any further period of delay,d.the government responds with three arguments.first,the government argues that the statute can not provide for automatic appointments because the appointment power is entirely within the president discretion.second,the government argues that the promotion was properly delayed.finally,the government argues that any violation of section d was harmless.we need not reach the government second two arguments because we agree with the first.the constitutional process allows the president complete discretion in choosing whether or not to appoint an officer.the statute does not and can not alter that process by providing for automatic appointment.
the constitutional appointment process for officers of the united states is most famously described in marbury madison.under the constitution,the president is given the authority to appoint officers by and with the advice and consent of the senate.const.art.ii,cl.as noted above,marbury set forth three separate actions that are ordinarily required for a person,subject to senate confirmation,to be appointed to office the president nomination confirmation by the senate and the president appointment.see cranch at.each discrete,confirmation,and be made for a promotion to be effective.as an early opinion of the attorney general correctly noted 
to constitute an appointment under article ii,it is,that the president should nominate the person proposed to be appointed,that the senate should advise and consent that the nominee should be appointed and,that,in pursuance of such nomination and such advice and consent,the appointment should be actually made.
the nomination is not an appointment nor is that nomination followed by the signification of the advice and consent of the senate,that it should be made sufficient of themselves to confer upon a citizen an office under the constitution.they serve but to indicate the purpose of the president to appoint,and the consent of the senate that it should be effectuated but they do not divest the executive authority of the discretion to withhold the actual appointment from the nominee.to give a public officer the power to act as such,an appointment must be made in pursuance of the previous nomination and advice and consent of the senate,the commission issued being the evidence that the purpose of appointment signified by the nomination has not been changed.
op.for judicial officers,such as those involved in marbury itself,the appointment is manifested by the president signing of a commission.see also united states le baron,how.however,the granting of a commission is not always required for a presidential appointment.the court noted that,i n order to determine whether an officer is entitled to a commission,it becomes necessary to enquire whether he has been appointed to the office.marbury,cranch at.the court ruled 
the appointment being the sole act of the president,must be completely evidenced,when it is shown that he has done every thing to be performed by him.
some point of time must be taken when the power of the executive over an officer must cease.that point of time must be when the constitutional power of appointment has been exercised.and this power has been exercised when the last act,required from the person possessing the power,has been performed.
id.at.in marbury,the last act to be done by the president to show that marbury had in fact been appointed was the signature of the commission.id.however,the court noted that,if an appointment was to be evidenced by any public act,other than the commission,the performance of such public act would create the officer.id.at.
the actual process followed with respect to senior military officers follows the constitutional design.the president nominates officers from the promotion list provided to him by the military department,and those officers are confirmed by the senate in accordance with the constitution,the president must then make a public act of appointment for an officer to be promoted.
in the case of a promotion to the grade of rear admiral,the final public act of appointment is the signing and issuance of the letter of appointment by the special assistant for flag officer management and distribution on behalf of the president.although the letter of appointment is typically accompanied by a certificate of appointment,which is the formal document most like a commission for promoted naval officers,the certificate is not required.
t he special assistant must have specific authority from the secretary of the navy to sign and issue a letter of appointment.supp.br.for at.although there is apparently no express delegation from the president to the secretary of the navy pursuant to of the authority to appoint naval officers on behalf of the president,such an express delegation is not required for the letter to serve as the public act of appointment required by the constitution.the statute provides 
this chapter et shall not be deemed to limit or derogate from any existing or inherent right of the president to delegate the performance of functions vested in him by law,and nothing herein shall be deemed to require express authorization in any case in which such an official would be presumed in law to have acted by authority or direction of the president.
we have previously held that,in view of section,the president need not expressly delegate authority.see law united states,holding that the secretary of transportation had properly removed a coast guard officer name from a promotion list,even though such authority had not been expressly delegated by the president.
the supreme court has assumed that the authority to appoint military officers can be delegated.see,orloff willoughby.it is obvious that the commissioning of officers in the army is a matter of discretion within the province of the president as commander in chief petitioner,like every conscript,was inducted as a private.to obtain a change of that status requires appointment by or under authority of the president.emphasis added united states moore.the place of passed is an office,and the notification by the secretary of the navy was a valid appointment to it.emphasis added.
our predecessor court addressed the issue more directly in united states.in,the secretary of war informed on november,that the president of the united states has appointed you post chaplain in the service of the united states.id.at.nevertheless,another person was nominated for the position and appointed to fill the vacancy on march.see id.at.claimed that he had been appointed to the position by the secretary of war letter,and sought pay for the position from november,to march.see id.the court of claims held that the secretary of war letter served as appointment 
appointment is in the form then used for recess appointments to the army the president had the power to make the appointment,and the act of the secretary of war which expressly declares that the president had made the appointment is conclusive evidence of the fact that it was made.
id.at.as in,the letter from the special assistant for flag officer management and distribution expressly states that the appointment is made by the president the president of the united states has appointed you to the grade of rear admiral upper half.supp.br.for at.thus,the signing and issuance of a letter of appointment is the final public act for a naval officer to be promoted to rear admiral.the complaint in this case does not allege that a letter of appointment promoting the appellant to rear admiral was signed and issued,and there is no evidence that any such appointment letter was in fact signed and issued.
however,the appellant contends that he was automatically appointed to the grade of rear admiral by virtue of a.the statute provides 
o fficers on a promotion list for a competitive category shall be promoted to the next higher grade when additional officers in that grade and competitive category are needed.promotions shall be made in the order in which the names of officers appear on the promotion list and after officers previously selected for promotion in that competitive category have been promoted.
a emphases added.although section a refers to the promotion of an officer,section b provides that a regular officer who is promoted under this section is appointed in the regular grade to which promoted.id.b emphasis added.in addition,section d prescribes the procedure for delaying the appointment of an officer under this section.id.d.the appellant argues that,pursuant to section,his appointment was automatic once he was confirmed by the senate and a rear admiral position became vacant while his name was at the top of the promotion list.however,the language of the statute does not provide for automatic appointment without action by the president.rather,the statute provides that appointments are made by the president,by and with the advice and consent of the senate.id.c see also const.art.ii,cl.
nor does the legislative history provide any reason here to believe that congress intended the statute to provide for automatic appointments.both the house and senate reports focus on providing uniform promotion procedures for all branches of the armed forces.see,at,reprinted in,stating that the bill was meant to p rovide uniform laws for promotion procedures for officers in the separate services,at stating that the bill was meant to p rovide uniform laws governing officer promotions in each military service.neither report discusses an attempt to ensure that those officers placed on promotion lists would automatically be appointed as part of such a uniform statutory scheme.in addition,the house report states that the bill was intended to provide common general authority for the permanent appointment of officers by the president with the advice and consent of the senate,at,reprinted in at emphasis added.therefore,the legislative history does not show that congress intended to provide for automatic appointments.
in any event,congress could not have permissibly altered the appointment process set forth in the constitution by providing for automatic appointments.the limited role for congress in the appointment process is specified in the constitution itself,which provides only that congress may vary the process for inferior officers.const.art.ii,cl.t he congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers,as they think proper,in the president alone,in the courts of law,or in the heads of departments.protecting the role of the president in the appointment process from legislative encroachment was in fact one of the goals of the constitutional convention.see buckley valeo,d see also weiss,at.souter,concurring freytag comm r of internal revenue,d.
in buckley,the court considered the constitutionality of the federal election campaign act amendments of,pub,a,stat,which provided for a federal election commission composed of six voting members,two of whom were to be appointed by the president pro tempore of the senate,and two of whom were to be appointed by
