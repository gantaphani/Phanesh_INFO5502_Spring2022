petitioner robert bieber appeals from the final decision of the merit systems protection board board denying review of a decision of the administrative judge sustaining bieber removal from service from the department of the army army for insubordination,disrupting the workplace,and making a false statement concerning his supervisor.the primary question in this case is whether the administrative judge conduct during a hearing deprived bieber of due process.because we conclude that the administrative judge actions did not rise to the level of a due process violation and that the board findings are supported by substantial evidence,we affirm.
bieber was a management analyst for the army in fort leavenworth,kansas,until his removal effective july.before his removal,bieber had several confrontations with and supervisors,stemming from bieber concerns that his wore inappropriate casual clothing and that his supervisors failed to provide adequate guidance as to what clothing was appropriate.
on april,bieber immediate supervisor,thomas rezentes,orally instructed bieber that it was not bieber responsibility to determine what other personnel should wear,and that he should stop confronting his regarding their attire.on august,bieber sent an email to his supervisor,ray lowery,seeking definitive guidance as to the appropriate standard of dress in the office.he wrote that t wo official documents in the last months have said that appropriate dress information would be available from my supervisor,and stated that if he did not receive a response from lowery within say working days,he would,among other things,be sure to advise each of his of the no.
on august,lowery responded to the email by informing bieber that he would respond to his concerns regarding the dress code issue as time permitted,and explicitly instructed bieber in the meanwhile do do not expend any more resources,your time,email,the time of your fellow employees,and the time of your supervisors on this subject.
on september,bieber sent another email to lowery regarding the dress code issue,which he copied to at least other employees,stating that he had enough of waiting for lowery response.bieber further stated that if he did not receive a creditable,definitive,unambiguous and usable answer by september,regarding the dress code issue,he would file a union grievance against lowery for abrogating his identified responsibility to provide direction on the appropriateness of wearing certain specific items of clothing bieber filed a union grievance shortly thereafter.
on september,lowery and rezentes met with bieber to discuss the union grievance.bieber was again told that it was not his job to monitor other employees manner of dress,and that,although lowery personally agreed with bieber that jeans and sneakers were inappropriate office attire,lowery would not forbid employees from wearing them.
on september,lowery suspended bieber for five days for discourtesy,insubordination,and refusal to obey management directives based on bieber circulation of the september,email.
bieber challenged the suspension,and an arbitration hearing was held on april.at the arbitration hearing,bieber learned for the first time that rezentes had drafted a memorandum for record mfr dated april,stating that the types of clothing bieber inquired about were acceptable.bieber construed this statement of policy as inconsistent with guidance he received september,that such clothing was inappropriate but permitted.tr.at,ll.
on may,bieber sent an email to rezentes entitled guidance on appropriate dress for management analysts in the workplace.in this email bieber accused rezentes of being a liar,and repeated his demand for guidance as to whether employees in the office were permitted to wear hats,jeans,sneakers tee shirts open toed sandals without socks he demanded that rezentes respond within nine days,in writing,to head off any possibility of future capriciousness or whimsey playing into his guidance.the email was copied to seventeen.
on may,and may,several of bieber wrote to rezentes complaining of bieber confrontational behavior and expressing concern that he might turn violent,and asked if it was safe to come to work on may,the deadline set in bieber email.tr.at.on june,rezentes issued to bieber a notice of proposed removal for insubordination failure to obey a management directive disrupting the workplace and making a false statement against your supervisor.on july,lowery issued a written notice of his decision to remove bieber from federal service.
bieber filed an appeal with the board on july.the case was assigned to an administrative judge,and the administrative judge conducted a hearing on november.
in the course of the hearing,the administrative judge denigrated bieber concerns for example,stating that i really think what people wear to work is no concern of their fellow employees,tr.at,ll,and asking b ut why did bieber just shut up tr.at,ll,and repeatedly stated that he could not understand why bieber continued to be obsessed with the dress code issue.tr.at,ll.the administrative judge went so far as to state that bieber frequent berating of his coworkers regarding their clothing defies civility to me.tr.at,ll.bieber did not file a motion to recuse the administrative judge,and complains of bias for the first time on appeal to this court from the board decision.
on february,the administrative judge issued an initial decision sustaining the removal,finding that bieber willfully disobeyed his supervisors instructions to stop confronting his and supervisors regarding their clothing that bieber actions disrupted the workplace that bieber falsely accused his supervisor of lying and that removal was an appropriate penalty.bieber dep t of army,no,initial decision.
on september,the board declined to review the initial decision,making it the final decision of the board.bieber timely petition for review followed.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to a.
we must sustain the board decision unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence.c.
bieber argues that this court decision in grubka department of the treasury,per curiam,requires that we reverse because the administrative judge conduct violated bieber right to due process and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.the requirements of due process,of course,apply to administrative proceedings.utica packing block,cir.in grubka,we reversed the board decision sustaining the internal revenue service demotion of petitioner grubka as not supported by substantial evidence.we found that the administrative judge demonstrated undeniable bias against grubka by commenting that a fter going too far,grubka was caught,meaning apparently caught engaging in misconduct.grubka,at.we noted that this statement shows undeniable bias on the part of the administrative judge against grubka,and makes the administrative judge partisan against grubka when he should have been neutral and nonpartisan,and that t his statement tainted the administrative judge decision on credibility in this misconduct charge,as well as in all of the other charges in this case,thereby depriving grubka of due process.id.at.rather than remanding for a new trial,however,the court simply reversed the board and remanded with instructions to restore grubka to his former position,because it found that there was no record evidence of impropriety to sustain the demotion.id.at.
here some of the administrative judge comments during the november,hearing might well fall within the grubka standard.we do not condone the remarks of the administrative judge.while the majority of the administrative judge actions of which appellant complains constituted routine trial management,some of the administrative judge remarks were plainly inappropriate.nonetheless,we conclude that the due process aspect of grubka,which was dictum in any event,is no longer good law in light of the supreme court subsequent decision in liteky united states,d,decided six years after grubka.
