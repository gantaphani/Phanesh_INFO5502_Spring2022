michael new,formerly a medical specialist in the united states army,was convicted by a of violating a lawful order to add united nations shoulder patch and a field his basic uniform.the army court of criminal appeals court of criminal appeals and the court of appeals for the armed forces court of appeals affirmed.new collateral attack charges several errors in the military courts analysis of the lawfulness of the uniform order.because new fails to identify fundamental defects in the military courts resolution of his claims,we affirm the district court denial of relief.
shortly after he learned during the summer of that his unit would be deployed to the republic of macedonia as part of the united nations preventive deployment force,new voiced concerns about the lawfulness of the army participation in the mission.in particular,he was troubled that wearing insignia as part of his uniform would manifest an involuntary or fictional shift in his allegiance from the government of the united states to the united nations.although his superiors discussed these concerns with him,they failed to alleviate them.
eventually new battalion commander his company commander order to begin wearing a special mission uniform at a battalion formation on october.the uniform consisted of the ordinary united states army battle dress uniform plus a blue patch sewn on one shoulder and a blue cap.new reported for the formation on the scheduled date wearing a uniform that lacked these features,and his superiors immediately removed him from the formation.although his battalion commander offered him a second chance to comply with the uniform order,new declined.
new was and charged with violating article of the uniform code of military justice codified at,which provides that any person who,having knowledge of any lawful order issued by a member of the armed forces,which it is his duty to obey,fails to obey the order shall be punished as a may direct.new defense focused on the lawfulness of the its consistency with army regulation ar,which permits commanders to require uniform modifications to be worn within a maneuver area,par,or when safety considerations make it appropriate,par,and with article i,section of the constitution,which prohibits any person acceptance of,inter alia,any emolument from a foreign state without congressional consent.new also argued that the uniform order could be lawful because the army participation in the mission was itself unlawful,asserting various statutory and constitutional grounds discussed below.
the military law officer presiding over the panel but not serving as one of its both sets of arguments he concluded that the order was consistent with ar and that the legality of the deployment was a nonjusticiable political question.the sentenced new to a discharge.
on appeal to the court of criminal appeals,new argued that the military judge erred in ruling that the lawfulness of the order was a legal question for him to decide rather than an element of the offense to be decided by the military jury the term that we use,following the court of appeals,as shorthand for the panel.united states new,caaf op.see also id.at sullivan,concurring.and he argued that the military judge conclusion on the merits was erroneous.the court of criminal appeals rejected these claims and affirmed new conviction and sentence.united states new,acca op.the court of appeals then granted review and also affirmed.caaf,at.
new had filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court shortly before his.the district court dismissed that petition on the ground that new had failed to exhaust his remedies in the pending action,united states ex rel.new perry,and we affirmed,new cohen.after the court of criminal appeals and the court of appeals both affirmed his conviction,new returned to the district court.the district court dismissed the petition,finding that each of new challenges fell outside the scope of collateral review,raised a nonjusticiable political question,or lacked merit as a matter of law.united states ex rel.new rumsfeld,d,district.op.new appeals.
we begin with jurisdiction and the related issue of the scope and standard of review.new,the government,and the district court have all assumed that jurisdiction rests on,which authorizes federal courts to grant writs of habeas corpus.see district,d at,brief for appellants at brief for appellees at.but c precludes granting the writ unless the petitioner is in custody.upon conviction by new received a discharge as he is not in custody,ca supply subject matter jurisdiction.this is not fatal,however,because the supreme court has held that congress did intend to confine collateral attacks on proceedings to.schlesinger councilman,d.thus the district court had jurisdiction to hear new collateral attack under which new second amended complaint invoked.
the standard of our review is more tangled.in councilman the supreme court not only confirmed jurisdiction in the absence of custody,but also said that collateral relief was barred unless the judgments were void.id.at.and that question may turn on the nature of the alleged defect,and the gravity of the harm from which relief is sought,id.at.specifically,the defect must be fundamental,for a judgment is not rendered void merely by error.id.at.moreover,both factors must be assessed in light of the deference that should be accorded the judgments of the carefully designed military justice system established by congress.id.at.because councilman ultimately denied review pending the,this standard was not part of the holding,but our circuit later adopted it for review of judgments priest secretary of the navy.
the supreme court pitched the councilman standard as more deferential than habeas review of military judgments,which it has in turn described as no less deferential than habeas review of state court judgments.this first point was explicit in councilman itself,where the court said g rounds of impeachment cognizable in habeas proceedings may not be sufficient to warrant other forms of collateral relief.at.the second point is part of the court analysis in burns wilson.there,reviewing death sentences allegedly based on coerced confessions and an atmosphere of terror and vengeance,id.at,the court through a plurality described military habeas as follows it is the limited function of the civil courts to determine whether the military have given fair consideration to each claim raised by petitioners.id.at.as to factfinding,the plurality said that article iii courts should not be in the business of reexamin ing and reweigh ing each item of evidence of the occurrence of events which tend to prove or disprove one of the allegations in the applications for habeas corpus.id.the plurality concluded that the petitioners failed to show that the military review process was legally inadequate to resolve their constitutional claims and affirmed.id.at.two additional justices concurred in the result,one of them writing that the supreme court role was limited to assessing the military courts jurisdiction.id.at.in setting out this standard,the plurality explained that the court must be at least as deferential as it is in the civilian habeas context,for in military habeas corpus cases themselves,even more than in state habeas corpus cases,it would be in disregard of the statutory scheme if the federal civil courts failed to take account of the prior the fair determinations of the military tribunals after all military remedies have been exhausted.id.at.emphasis added.
the uncertainty implied in these rankings of deference level is compounded by the evolution of habeas review over time.until the supreme court decision in johnson zerbst,the scope of habeas corpus review was equally narrow in both military and civilian to verifying personal and jurisdiction.in johnson,a civilian federal habeas corpus case,the supreme court expanded the scope of jurisdictional challenges by holding that the trial court could lose jurisdiction by failing to provide counsel to the defendant,id.at,and this developed into explicit review for constitutional violations.see calley callaway,cir en banc citing waley
