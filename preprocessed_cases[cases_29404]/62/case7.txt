vandenberg air force base has been designated a closed base,meaning that civilians may not enter without express permission.the air force has granted an easement over two areas of the base,with the result that two public highways traverse the base.adjacent to one of those highways is an area that the government has designated for peaceful protests.the base commander has enacted several restrictions to control the protest area and has issued an advisory stating that anyone who fails to adhere to the protest area policies may be barred from entering the base.
petitioner apel was barred from the base for trespassing and vandalism,but continued to enter the protest area.a magistrate judge convicted him of violating,which makes it a crime to reenter a military installation after having been ordered not to do so by any officer or person in command.on appeal,the federal district court rejected apel defense that does not apply to the designated protest area.the ninth circuit reversed.it held that because the easement through vandenberg deprived the government of exclusive possession,did not cover the portion of the base where apel protest occurred.
held a military installation for purposes of encompasses the commanding officer area of responsibility,and it includes vandenberg highways and protest area.
a contrary to apel argument,does not require exclusive possession and control.the statute is written broadly to apply to many different kinds of military places,and nothing in its text defines those places in terms of the access granted to the public or the nature of the government possessory interest.see united states albertini.nor have military places been defined historically as land withdrawn from public use.the common feature of the places described in is that they have defined boundaries and are subject to the command authority of a military officer.this conclusion is confirmed by united states phisterer,which defined the term military station as a place where military duty is performed or military protection afforded.and while some executive branch documents have said that requires exclusive possession,those opinions are nonbinding,and this court has never held that the government reading of a criminal statute is entitled to any deference.
b section applies to any place with a defined boundary that is under the command of a military officer.apel contends that the highways and protest area are outside the base because they lie outside fenced areas on the base,but this argument assumes the conclusion.the united states has placed the entire vandenberg property under the administration of the air force.the air force choice to secure a portion of the base more closely does not alter its boundaries or diminish its commander jurisdiction.apel further contention that the highways and protest area are uncontrolled spaces where military operations are not performed is contrary to the record the base commander has enacted rules to restrict the manner of protests in the designated area and has publicly stated that persons barred from vandenberg may not enter the base to protest the district court found that the government exercises substantial control over the protest area the easement itself reserves to the base commander the authority to restrict access to the entire base when necessary and reserves to the united states rights of way for all purposes and the base commander has occasionally closed the highways to the public for security purposes or when conducting a military launch.in any event,does not require base commanders to make continuous,uninterrupted use of a place within their jurisdiction,lest they lose authority to exclude certain individuals.such a rule would frustrate the administration of military facilities,raise difficult questions for judges,and discourage commanders from opening portions of their bases for public convenience.
c apel argument that the statute was unconstitutional as applied was not reached by the ninth circuit and,thus,is not addressed here.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
federal law makes it a crime to reenter a military installation after having been ordered not to do so by any officer or person in command.the question presented is whether a portion of an air force base that contains a designated protest area and an easement for a public road qualifies as part of a military installation.
vandenberg air force base is located in central california,near the coast,approximately miles northwest of los angeles.the base sits on land owned by the united states and administered by the department of the air force.it is the site of sensitive missile and space launch facilities.the commander of vandenberg has designated it a closed base,meaning that civilians may not enter without express permission.memorandum for the general public re closed base,from david buck,commander,app.see also cfr b each air force commander is authorized to grant or deny access to their installations,and to exclude or remove persons whose presence is unauthorized 
although the base is closed,the air force has granted to the county of santa barbara an easement for a for a road or street over two areas within vandenberg.department of the air force,easement for road or street no,app.pursuant to that easement,two state roads traverse the base.highway the pacific coast highway runs through the eastern part of the base and provides a route between the towns of santa maria and lompoc.highway runs through the southern part of the base and allows access to a beach and a train station on vandenberg western edge.the state of california maintains and polices these highways as it does other state roads,except that its jurisdiction is merely concurrent with that of the federal government.letter from governor edmund brown,to joseph zengerle,assistant secretary of the air force july,app.the easement instrument states that use of the roads shall be subject to such rules and regulations as the base commander may prescribe from time to time in order to properly protect the interests of the united states.easement,app.the united states also reserves to itself for all purposes that would not create unnecessary interference with highway purposes.at.
as relevant to this case,highway runs northwest several miles inside vandenberg until it turns northeast at a degree angle.there highway intersects with lompoc casmalia road,which continues running northwest,and with california boulevard,which runs southwest.in the east corner of this intersection there is a middle school.in the west corner there is a visitors center and a public bus stop.a short way down california boulevard is the main entrance to the operational areas of the base where military personnel live and work.those areas are surrounded by a fence and entered by a security checkpoint.see appendix,infra maps from record.
in the south corner of the intersection is an area that has been designated by the federal government for peaceful protests.a painted green line on the pavement,a temporary fence,highway,and lompoc casmalia road mark the boundaries of the protest area.memorandum for the general public re limited permission for peaceful protest activity policy,from david buck,commander,app.the base commander has enacted several restrictions to control the protest area,including reserving the authority for any reason to withdraw permission to protest and retain ing authority and control over who may access the installation,including access to roadway easements for purposes other than traversing by vehicle through the installation.ibid.a public advisory explains other rules for the protest area demonstrations must be coordinated and scheduled with b ase public affairs and base security forces at least two weeks in advance a nyone failing to vacate installation property upon advisement from security forces will be cited for trespass pursuant to and a ctivities other than peaceful protests in this area are not permitted and are specifically prohibited.air force fact sheet,protest advisory,app.
the advisory states,consistent with federal regulations,that anyone who fails to adhere to these policies may receive an official letter barring you from entering vandenberg.at see also cfr under the authority of,installation commanders may deny access to the installation through the use of a barment order and for any person who is currently barred from vandenberg afb,there is no exception to the barment permitting you to attend peaceful protest activity on vandenberg afb property.if you are barred and attend a protest or are otherwise found on base,you will be cited and detained for a trespass violation due to the of the barment order.protest advisory,app.
john dennis apel is an antiwar activist who demonstrates at vandenberg.in march,apel trespassed beyond the designated protest area and threw blood on a sign for the base.he was convicted for these actions,was sentenced to two months imprisonment,and was barred from the base for three years.in may,apel returned to vandenberg to protest.when he trespassed again and was convicted,he received another order barring him from vandenberg,this time permanently,unless he followed specified procedures to modify or revoke the order.memorandum for john apel re barment order,app.the only exception to the barment was limited permission from the base commander for apel to traverse,meaning to travel on highway and on highway.you are not authorized to deviate from these paved roadways onto vandenberg property.at.the order informed apel that if he reentered vandenberg in violation of the order,he would be subject to detention by security forces personnel and prosecution by civilian authorities for a violation of.ibid.
apel ignored the commander order and reentered vandenberg several times during and.that led the base commander to serve apel with an updated order,which informed him 
you continue to refuse to adhere to the rules and guidelines that have been put in place by me to protect and preserve order and to safeguard the persons and property under my jurisdiction by failing to remain in the area approved by me for peaceful demonstrations pursuant to and.you can not be expected or trusted to abide by the protest guidance rules based upon this behavior.i consider your presence on this installation to be a risk and detrimental to my responsibility to protect and preserve order and to safeguard the persons and property under my jurisdiction.you are again ordered not to enter onto vandenberg property,as provided in the october,order.the content and basis of that order is hereby incorporated by reference herein,except that your barment will be for a period of three years from the date of this supplemental letter.memorandum for john apel re barment order dated,served,app.
apel ignored this barment order too,and on three occasions in he reentered vandenberg to protest in the designated area.each time vandenberg security personnel reminded him of the barment order and instructed him to leave.each time apel refused.he was cited for violating and escorted off base property.
a magistrate judge convicted apel and ordered him to pay a total of in fines and fees.apel appealed to the federal district court for the central district of california.the district court rejected apel defense that does not apply to the designated protest area,holding that the military has a sufficient possessory interest and exercises sufficient control over the area.app.to pet.for cert.the court also concluded that apel conviction would not violate the first amendment,at.
the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed,holding that the statute does not apply.based on circuit precedent,the ninth circuit interpreted to require the government to prove that it has the exclusive right of possession of the area on which the trespass allegedly occurred.citing united states parker.the court found that the easement through vandenberg deprived the government of exclusive possession of the roadway,so it concluded that does not cover the portion of the base where apel protest occurred.
we granted certiorari,and now vacate the judgment.
section provides in full 
whoever,within the jurisdiction of the united states,goes upon any military,naval,or coast guard reservation,post,fort,arsenal,yard,station,or installation,for any purpose prohibited by law or lawful regulation or 
whoever reenters or is found within any such reservation,post,fort,arsenal,yard,station,or installation,after having been removed therefrom or ordered not to reenter by any officer or person in command or charge thereof 
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months,or both.
apel does not dispute that he was found within the lawful boundaries of vandenberg,within the jurisdiction of the united states,after having been ordered not to reenter by the base commander.and certainly vandenberg would naturally be described as a military installation it is an air force base,which a military commander has closed to the public with limited exceptions,located on land owned by the united states and under the jurisdiction of the air force,where military personnel conduct sensitive missile operations.
against this straightforward interpretation,apel insists that applies only where the military exercises exclusive possession and control,which,he contends,does not include land subject to a roadway easement.apel further argues that the fence enclosing vandenberg operational facilities marks the real boundary of the base and that vandenberg commander lacks authority to control the rest,or at least the designated protest area.we take his arguments in turn.
apel asserts that the ninth circuit exclusive possession and control requirement derives directly from the text of.brief for respondent.it does not.section is written broadly to apply to many different kinds of military places a reservation,post,fort,arsenal,yard,station,or installation.nothing in the text defines those places in terms of the access granted to the public or the nature of the government possessory interest.see united states albertini,the language of the statute does not limit to military bases where access is restricted 
apel contends that the listed military places have historically been defined as land withdrawn from public use.not so.historical sources are replete with references to military forts and posts that provided services to civilians,and were open for access by them.see,wooster,soldiers,sutlers,and settlers the frontier forts of texas were not simply army bases occupied solely by military personnel.they were often bustling communities that attracted merchants,laborers,settlers,and dependents davis,the sutler at fort bridger,western hist,describing a post in southwestern present wyoming which included a sutler,a civilian merchant who set up shop inside the fort and sold wares both to soldiers and to civilians from outside the base.
the common feature of the places described in is not that they are used exclusively by the military,but that they have defined boundaries and are subject to the command authority of a military officer.that makes sense,because the solicitor general has informed us that a military commander authority is frequently defined by the boundaries of a particular place when the department of defense establishes a base,military commanders assign a military unit to the base,and the commanding officer of the unit becomes the commander of the base.tr.of oral arg.
apel responds by invoking our decision in united states phisterer,which held that the term military station in a different statute did not include a s
