this case is more than merely the latest installment in a series of guantanamo habeas appeals.the united states seeks to detain mohammedou ould salahi on the grounds that he was part of not because he fought with or its allies against the united states,but rather because he swore an oath of allegiance to the organization,associated with its members,and helped it in various ways,including hosting its leaders and referring aspiring jihadists to a known operative.after an evidentiary hearing at which salahi testified,the district court found that although salahi was an sympathizer who was in touch with members and provided them with sporadic support,the government had failed to show that he was in fact part of at the time of his capture.the district court thus granted the writ and ordered salahi released.since then,however,this court has issued three obama,bensayah obama,and awad obama,that cast serious doubt on the district court approach to determining whether an individual is part of.we agree with the government that we must therefore vacate the district court judgment,but because that court,lacking the benefit of these recent cases,left unresolved key factual questions necessary for us to determine as a matter of law whether salahi was part of when captured,we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
enacted just seven days after the september terrorist attacks,the authorization for use of military force aumf empowers the president of the united states to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations,organizations,or persons he determines planned,authorized,committed,or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september,or harbored such organizations or persons,in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the united states by such nations,organizations or persons,a,stat,reprinted at note.we have held that the necessary and appropriate force authorized by the aumf includes the power to detain individuals who are part of,the organization that perpetrated the september attacks.see bensayah,at.although the government previously claimed authority to detain salahi on other grounds as he allegedly aided the september attacks and because he purposefully and materially support ed forces associated with in hostilities against coalition partners,obama,it has since dropped those claims and now relies solely on the allegation that salahi was part of at the time of his capture.
in the district court,the government relied heavily on statements salahi made to interrogators.salahi obama,d.conceding,however,that those interrogators had mistreat ed salahi from to september,the government declined to rely on any statements salahi made during that period.appellants opening br.see also staff of comm.on armed services,inquiry into the treatment of detainees in custody xxii,comm.print church,iii,review of department of defense detention operations and detainee interrogation techniques dep t of justice office of the inspector,a review of the fbi involvement in and observations of detainee interrogations in guantanamo bay,afghanistan,and iraq xxvii,jess bravin,the conscience of the colonel,wall,at.although the district court formally received all evidence offered by the government,the taint of the extensive and severe mistreatment that salahi suffered led the court to accord little weight to any of salahi statements that lacked independent corroboration.salahi,d at see also hr g tr.at.the government complains that the district court improperly failed to credit certain of salahi statements,but because this issue is largely irrelevant to the legal questions we address in this opinion,we present the facts as found by the district court,supplementing with citations to the record only as necessary to provide context for the parties arguments.
mohammedou ould salahi was born in in mauritania.in december,he traveled from germany,where he was attending college,to afghanistan to support the mujahideen islamic rebels seeking to overthrow afghanistan communist government.salahi am.decl.while in afghanistan,salahi attended a training camp run by,which organized and funded efforts by foreign volunteers to assist the resistance movement.see john rollins,cong.research,al qaeda and affiliates historical perspective,global presence,and implications for policy.although the united states denies having supported directly,it acknowledges that it provided significant economic and military support to the afghan mujahideen from approximately to.id.at.
in march,shortly after finishing his training,salahi swore bayat,an oath of loyalty,to.he left afghanistan soon after taking this oath but returned in january.having heard rumors that the mujahideen had invaded kabul and started fighting among themselves,salahi decided to travel back to germany in march.salahi am.decl.at this point,he alleges,he severed all ties with al qaida.id.
according to the government,however,the record contains significant evidence that salahi recruited for and provided it with other support after his alleged withdrawal in.for example,the district court found that salahi sent a fax to operative christopher paul in january,asking for his help in finding a true group and place for some brothers interested in fighting jihad.salahi,d at quoting salahi fax to paul.salahi admitted to interrogators that he knew paul to be a man of great respect in and that he sent the fax to facilitate getting the aspiring jihadists to fight.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
as the district court recognized,t he most damaging allegation against salahi is that,in october,he encouraged ramzi bin,marwan,and ziad jarrah to join.id.at.bin helped coordinate the september attacks,and and jarrah were two of the september pilots.comm on terrorist attacks upon the,the commission report,hereinafter commission report.the government contends that while bin,and jarrah had originally intended to travel to chechnya to wage jihad against russian forces,salahi convinced them to travel instead to afghanistan to receive military training.according to the government,the three men followed salahi advice and with his assistance traveled to afghanistan,where they were recruited by into the september plot.but the district court,having discounted portions of the government evidence as unreliable and inconsistent,found only that salahi provided lodging for three men for one night at his home in germany,that one of them was ramzi bin,and that there was discussion of jihad and afghanistan.salahi,d at.
in addition to salahi connection to bin,the district court found that salahi had an ongoing and relatively close relationship with abu hafs,who is believed to be one of usama bin laden spiritual advisors and a leader of.id.at.abu hafs is salahi cousin and is married to the sister of salahi.id.at.in august,salahi accompanied abu hafs to an safe house in mauritania.id.at.several years later,abu hafs asked salahi to meet with abu hajar,allegedly telecommunications chief,when visited germany in late and early to explore purchasing telecommunications equipment for operations in sudan.id.at.at the evidentiary hearing in the district court,salahi testified that his involvement with was limited to discussing the telecommunications equipment planned to purchase and to driving him to various locations.hr g tr.at.
the record contains evidence of additional contacts with abu hafs.for example,in december,and then again in december,salahi transferred to mauritania for abu hafs,but the district court noted that the government relie d on nothing but salahi uncorroborated,coerced statements to tie these money transfers to.salahi,d at.also,around november,abu hafs encouraged salahi to return to afghanistan,sending him money and two passports.id.at.although salahi declined his cousin invitation,he retained the passports for over a year.salahi eventually gave one of the passports to his,presumably to return to her sister,the passport owner.he gave the other passport directly to its purported owner,ahmed mazid,who was introduced to salahi by saleh,an member from libya.id.at,hr g tr.at.around the time abu hafs sent salahi
