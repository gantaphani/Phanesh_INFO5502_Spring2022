the appellant,mary louise cummings,seeks reversal of the district court september,dismissal of her privacy act lawsuit against the department of the navy navy.the district court held that the doctrine of feres united states,bars a servicewoman privacy act lawsuit if her injury arose out of or occurred in the course of activity incident to service.cummings dep t of the navy,d.the court further determined on the facts that cummings injury did,indeed,arise in the course of activity incident to her service.see id.at.on appeal,cummings challenges the district court decision on two grounds.first,she argues that the feres doctrine does not apply to service personnel privacy act claims against the military.second,she contends that even if the doctrine does attach to such suits generally,the unauthorized release of her training record to a civilian author was not incident to service under feres inquiry and that her suit against the navy,therefore,is not barred.
whether members of the armed forces may sue the military for damages under the privacy act is a question of first impression.we answer in the affirmative and hold that the feres doctrine does not extend to suits under the privacy act.accordingly,we reverse the district court dismissal of cummings action and remand for further proceedings addressing her specific privacy act allegations.
cummings attended the united states naval academy,completed flight training and became a naval aviator she was assigned to a flight squadron at the naval air station,cecil field,in jacksonville,florida and began training on the strike fighter attack hornet aircraft in november.approximately seven months after cummings hornet training began,the navy convened a field naval aviator evaluation board evaluation board to assess her flying skills and potential.after hearing testimony and reviewing the records of cummings four training flights,the evaluation board recommended that the navy terminate her flying status.notwithstanding the evaluation board conclusion,vice admiral richard of the navy atlantic cummings to retain her flight status and resume hornet training under the same administrative command.
during cummings time at cecil field,the navy permitted an author,robert gandt,to observe hornet training so that he could research a book he was writing about the training of fighter pilots.cummings alleges in her complaint that vice admiral allen allowed gandt to follow specific squadron personnel without their knowledge as they proceeded throughout the hornet training program.cummings,d at quoting compl.
in gandt published his book,bogeys and bandits making of a fighter pilot.the book was based primarily upon gandt observations of the hornet training program and upon information.cummings asserts that a character in gandt book named sally hopkins portrays cummings,that the book includes specific details and direct quotes from her negative evaluation board report,that as a result of the book publication her military and civilian career prospects have been severely damaged and that she has suffered severe mental distress,embarrassment,and humiliation,both personally and professionally.id.quoting compl.
cummings sued the navy for violating the privacy act of.see b no agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person except pursuant to a written request by,or with the prior written consent of,the individual to whom the record pertains.the navy moved to dismiss cummings claim on feres grounds.the district court held that feres applies to privacy act lawsuits and that the navy release of cummings evaluation board report was incident to service and,therefore,not it was related to the policy of openness the navy had established toward gandt.cummings,d at.
reviewing the district court grant of the navy motion to dismiss,we accept as true the facts that cummings alleges in her complaint.see united arab emirates,citing saudi arabia nelson,d.our review of the issues raised by cummings appeal is de novo.see artis greenspan,w e apply the de novo standard of review to the district court application of law to undisputed fact s.
in feres,the united states supreme court held that the government is not liable under the federal tort claims act for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.feres,at.at.cummings argues that this doctrine should not be extended to suits against government agencies under the privacy act.for the reasons discussed infra,we agree.
in determining whether members of the armed forces may sue the military for damages under the privacy act,we start with the cardinal canon of statutory construction c ourts must presume that the congress says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.bank germain,d citations omitted.when the words of a statute are unambiguous,then,this first canon is also the last judicial inquiry is complete.id.at.at quoting rubin united states,d.with these precepts in mind,we turn to the text of the privacy act.
as the district court recognized,the privacy act applies to agencies,defined as any executive department,military department,government corporation,government controlled corporation,or other establishment in the executive branch of the government or any independent regulatory agency.cummings,d at quoting f emphasis added.and,as the trial court further observed,certain provisions of the act manifest congressional intent to protect uniformed personnel like cummings.see id.at,citing f,g,k and k.one provision permits agencies,in certain circumstances,to exempt from the act purview investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability,eligibility,or qualifications for military service k.another allows,in limited evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion in the armed services k.the district court rightly noted that such exemptions would be unnecessary if military servicepersons were excluded from the privacy act altogether.cummings,d at.
we conclude that the aforementioned provisions,taken together,demonstrate that the congress unambiguously intended to establish a duty that runs from a military department like the navy to military personnel like cummings not to disclose any record which is contained in a system of records like cummings evaluation board report.b.the navy does not contest this.instead,it contends that without necessarily waiving immunity with respect to money damages,the congress intended to apply the act to military departments by permitting a servicemember to seek equitable remedies only.br.of appellee at.its contention finds no support in the text of the statute without regard to the identity of the plaintiff or the agency she is suing,the act plainly authorizes injunctive relief,g a,a,and monetary relief,g and it permits a court to assess against the united states reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs,g b,b.moreover,that the act as seen supra allows a military department to exempt from the act reach certain records based upon their content see,k,demonstrates that the congress did not intend the courts to craft additional exemptions from coverage based upon the type of relief a servicewoman requests,by limiting suits to equitable relief only.see fawn mining hudson,neither lawyers nor judges serve as lawmakers who may extend statutes beyond their bounds or change the rules that congress has set.
the district court correctly reminded us that waivers of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed and narrowly construed,cummings,d at quoting dorsey dep t of labor.erroneously,however,it denied effect to the unequivocally expressed waiver contained in the privacy act,g.construing a waiver of sovereign immunity narrowly,even strictly in favor of the sovereign,means only that a court may not enlarge the waiver beyond what the language requires.tomasello rubin,quoting united states nordic village,d.we need not enlarge by any stretch the privacy act purview in order for the statute to avoid the effects of the feres doctrine.as the district court acknowledged,o n its face,the privacy act would appear to permit actions brought by military personnel cummings,d at.and statutory text remains the best evidence of congressional intent.see tataranowicz sullivan.the act not only appears to,but does,permit actions brought by military personnel.
the fact that the privacy act was enacted once the feres doctrine was in place,yet does not specifically insulate the causes of action it creates from the effects of feres,cummings,d at,does not alter our conclusion.congressional enactments are better evidence of legislative intent than is congressional silence.see burns united states,d a n inference drawn from congressional silence certainly can not be credited when it is contrary to all other textual and contextual evidence of congressional intent.but arthur conan doyle,silver blaze,in sherlock holmes the complete novels and stories,i had grasped the significance of the silence of the dog,for one true inference invariably suggests others obviously the midnight visitor was someone whom the dog knew well.true,the congress familiarity with feres can be presumed,see.legal found.united states sentencing comm n,citation omitted,but the feres doctrine was not extended beyond the federal tort claims act ftca context until.see generally chappell wallace,d applying feres to constitutional tort claims under bivens six unknown named agents of fed.bureau of narcotics,d.when the congress enacted the privacy act in,therefore,it had no reason to insulate the act from the effects of a doctrine that,at the time,applied exclusively to the ftca.
that the congress did not bark about feres in enacting the privacy act is especially unenlightening in view of the fact that a privacy act lawsuit does not implicate any of the concerns that caused the supreme court to enunciate the feres doctrine in the first place.lockhart fretwell,d applying maxim c essante ratione legis,cessat et ipsa lex when reason for law ceases,so does law itself.in formulating the feres doctrine,the supreme court first observed that because the ftca provides that t he united states shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,feres,at.at quoting,an obvious shortcoming in the plaintiffs claims was that they pointed to no liability of a private individual even remotely analogous to that which they were asserting against the united states.id.second,the court found that because of the distinctively federal relationship between the united states and its military forces,the congress could not have intended the armed forces to be subject to local tort law pursuant to the ftca provisions.id.at.at quoting united states standard oil.third,the court found that because servicemen were already entitled to veterans benefits,the congress could not have meant for them to recover double compensation for their injuries by allowing them to sue under the ftca as well.id.at.at.four years after feres,in united states brown,the court offered a fourth justification for military immunity from the peculiar and special relationship of the soldier to his superiors,the effects of the maintenance of tort suits on discipline,and the extreme results that might obtain if suits under the ftca were allowed for negligent orders given or negligent acts committed in the course of military duty brown,at.at.
cummings convinces us that none of these rationales supports extension of the feres doctrine to the privacy act.the supreme court first concern is inapplicable to a privacy act lawsuit because the act,unlike the ftca,nowhere establishes the private liability parallel as a prerequisite for the united states to be liable in the same manner and to the same extent under like circumstances feres,at.at quoting.feres second and third rationales are likewise inapposite because the privacy act is federal not state law and because the congress has provided no other compensation or benefits for those injured by a violation of the act.
the navy makes a superficially compelling argument that feres fourth concern as expounded in brown mandates the doctrine extension to privacy act suits.the portion of the district court order addressing the matter strengthens the navy case the possibility that every time a serviceman were demoted or saddled with a less than perfect performance rating he could resort to the courthouse could be a very real one if privacy act suits were not subject to the feres doctrine.cummings,d at quotations omitted.although judicial reluctance to impinge on military matters is understandable in many contexts it is unjustified in this setting as we have discussed,the congress clearly enlisted the federal courts to inquire into potential military violations of the privacy act.united states johnson,d scalia,dissenting i do not think the effect upon military discipline is so certain,or so certainly substantial,that we are justified in holding if we are ever justified in holding that congress did not mean what it plainly said in the statute before us.what is more,subjecting the navy to suit under the act does not permit a servicewoman like cummings to resort to the courthouse simply because she does not agree with her performance ratings.instead,the act provides a remedy only if the military department has unlawfully released the performance rating and if the claimant establishes that she was injured as a result.see b prohibiting disclosure in certain circumstances g d requiring claimant to show adverse effect because of disclosure.
the navy claims that because feres has been extended beyond the ftca context to suits under civil rights statutes and to and constitutional tort actions,we must extend it as well to suits under the privacy act.see br.of appellee at citing,inter alia,united states stanley,d chappell,at.at.it is true that we,like other circuits,have extended feres to bar claims brought under both for deprivation of civil rights and under tort theories.bois marsh,at see supra note see also,mackey united states,cir joining,second,third,fourth,seventh,eighth and ninth circuits in hold ing that the feres doctrine applies to intentional torts alvarez wilson,extending feres to claims brought under.but that fact in itself means nothing we have also concluded that the feres doctrine and its rationale have no application to claims brought by members of the armed forces under the swine flu act because we can not imagine how that type of litigation could impinge on any legitimate interest in maintaining discipline within our fighting forces.hunt united states.that is,even d espite the absence of a clear legislative intent in the swine flu act to insulate the legislation from the effects of feres,we have nonetheless found it insulated.id.at.because the duty remains ours to determine the meaning of a particular statute,and to determine whether the congress in a particular statute intended to provide service personnel with a cause of action against the military departments,the bare fact that the feres doctrine has been extended beyond the ftca to other statutory contexts is not particularly probative.the congress may provide a cause of action in some laws and leave other statutes subject to feres it is our job to sort out which it has done here.as the district court correctly noted,n o court has yet provided an analysis of whether or not feres should apply to actions under the privacy act specifically.cummings,d at.it would appear,then,that we have a clean slate to implement the congress will and to permit cummings to seek monetary relief from the navy for the allegedly unauthorized release of her training record to a civilian author.
because we conclude that the feres doctrine is inapplicable to cummings action against the navy,we need not address whether the release of her record was incident to service under feres test.that test is irrelevant and the issue is moot.
given a clear congressional mandate,we hold that the doctrine of feres united states does not extend to privacy act lawsuits brought by military personnel against the military departments.accordingly,we reverse the district court dismissal of cummings action against the navy
