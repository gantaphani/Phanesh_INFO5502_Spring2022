federal tort claims act 
the panel vacated the district court judgment in favor of plaintiffs who brought a federal tort claims act ftca action against the united states held that the plaintiffs claims arose in spain and therefore were barred by the ftca foreign country exception and remanded with instructions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
plaintiff was born prematurely while her family was stationed at a united states air force base in spain,and as a consequence of her premature birth,suffered a permanent brain injury that led to a diagnosis of cerebral palsy after she returned to the united states.
the ftca generally waives the united states sovereign immunity from suits in torts,but the waiver is subject to certain exceptions.under the foreign country exception,the ftca waiver of immunity does not apply to any claim arising in a foreign country.
the panel held that an injury is suffered where the harm first impinges upon the body,even if it is later diagnosed elsewhere.the panel concluded that the brain injury suffered at or near the time of her birth impinged upon her body in spain thus,that was where the plaintiffs claims arose.the panel further held that cerebral palsy was derivative of the harm she sustained at birth.
judge graber concurred in the result.she wrote separately because,in her view,the timing and content of the administrative claim filed by plaintiffs,while they were still in spain,foreclosed their claims under the ftca.

in sosa,the supreme court held that the foreign country exception to the federal tort claims act ftca bars all claims based on any injury suffered in a foreign country.id.at.the court left unanswered,however,the issue currently before us how to determine where an injury is suffered.we hold that an injury is suffered where the harm first impinge s upon the body,even if it is later diagnosed elsewhere.see restatement first conflict of laws.
applying that test to the facts of this case,we conclude that the foreign country exception bars plaintiffs claims,the daughter of william and chantal holt,was born prematurely while the family was stationed at a united states air force usaf base in spain.as a consequence of her premature birth,sustained a permanent injury to the white matter of her brain she was diagnosed as suffering from cerebral palsy after the family returned to the united states.the holts filed suit against the united states,contending that officials at a usaf base in california negligently approved the family request for travel to a base in spain to deal with holt medical needs.they further argue that injury the cerebral palsy diagnosis first occurred upon their return to the united states.at trial,the district court agreed that the injury occurred in south carolina and awarded damages of.although we are sympathetic to the plaintiffs situation,we agree with the united states that the injury at issue was suffered in spain.we exercise jurisdiction under and reverse.
holt is a master sergeant in the usaf.he and his wife have four children.in,when the family was stationed at edwards air force base in california,holt was informed that he was being transferred to the usaf air base at rota naval station in spain.shortly thereafter,a pregnancy test at the edwards air force base medical clinic confirmed that holt was pregnant with their third child.
after learning he was to be transferred overseas,holt requested travel for his family.to obtain approval for this program,family members must be screened to ensure that the overseas base is capable of addressing their medical needs.richard stahlman,chief of the medical staff at edwards air force base,approved the holt family travel to spain.the district court found that stahlman knew holt was pregnant and had experienced two prior preterm deliveries and a miscarriage at the time he cleared her for overseas travel.
in march,when holt was approximately twenty weeks pregnant,the family relocated to spain.there,holt was treated by dennis szurkus,a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology at naval hospital rota.during an ultrasound appointment on may,szurkus determined that holt was exhibiting signs of preterm labor and had her transferred by ambulance to an hospital puerto real hospital where she underwent an emergency cesarean section.was born on may,at approximately weeks gestation.she had difficulty eating and breathing and was kept in the neonatal intensive care unit for seventeen days.
in the months following birth,the holts saw several doctors in spain regarding her medical issues and expressed concern that was not developing like her two older siblings,both of whom were also born preterm.doctors told the holts that had strabismus,poor head control,low tone in her abdominal muscles,and significant motor and developmental delays.also experienced symptoms,for which she was prescribed phenobarbital.when she was approximately five months old,underwent an mri,which showed periventricular leukomalacia,an injury to the white matter of her brain.
at around nine months of age,was evaluated by a neurologist,lisa smith,who found that had abnormally brisk reflexes and a mild increase in dynamic tone in her lower extremities.smith did not rule out cerebral palsy at that time but declined to render a diagnosis.two other doctors in spain did conclude that had cerebral palsy 
the family returned to the united states in.late that year,was diagnosed with tetraplegia of all four extremities.at the age of two,while living in south carolina,was definitively diagnosed with cerebral palsy.it is undisputed that premature birth was the cause of her cerebral palsy.
in june,while the holts were still in spain,they filed an administrative claim seeking damages from the government for catastrophic neurological injuries,seizures,learning deficits,physical limitations,and cerebral palsy.they alleged that these injuries resulted from the negligent approval of holt travel overseas.the administrative claim was denied.
having exhausted administrative remedies,the holts filed the instant action in district court.the government unsuccessfully moved for summary judgment,contending that the ftca foreign country exception barred the holts medical malpractice claims.following a bench trial,the court awarded the holts in damages.the government filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment under fed.civ.e.the court granted the motion in part but ultimately declined to alter the damages award.the government timely appealed the amended judgment and all related interlocutory orders.

in sosa,the supreme court held that the foreign country exception bars all claims based on any injury suffered in a foreign country,regardless of where the tortious act or omission occurred.at.the court noted that the foreign country exception codified congress unwilling ness to subject the united states to liabilities depending upon the laws of a foreign power.id.at alteration in original quoting united states spelar.at the time the ftca was passed,the dominant principle in analysis for tort cases was lex loci delicti courts generally applied the law of the place where the injury occurred.id.at.accordingly,the court concluded that congress likely intended the phrase arising in to have the same meaning in k as it did in state statutes that is,to express the position that a claim arises where the harm occurs.id.at 
the question at the center of this appeal is where injury was suffered for the purposes of the foreign country exception.id.at.the sosa opinion offers various formulations of lex loci delicti,but provides little guidance on this specific issue.see,id.at claim arises where the last act necessary to establish liability occurred,the jurisdiction in which injury was received quoting john ester,borrowing statutes of limitation conflict of laws,id.at the place where the harmful force takes effect upon the body quoting restatement first of conflict of laws,emphasis omitted.in the ordinary case,an injury will be experienced in the same place it is inflicted,thereby obviating the need for further analysis.see,id.at seeking damages for false arrest in mexico.however,the inquiry becomes more complicated when,as in this case,plaintiffs allege injuries manifesting after the initial infliction of harm.
the district court concluded that state accrual law should determine where an injury is suffered.relying on california law,it held that cerebral palsy occurred in the united states because it was not until the holts arrived in south carolina that doctors could identify symptoms as cerebral palsy.but as we have previously noted,q uestions of interpretation under the ftca exclusion provisions are controlled by federal law.ramirez united states,cir.accord united states neustadt,w hether a claim is outside the intended scope of the federal tort claims act depends solely upon what congress meant by the language it used.the district court acknowledged this principle as a general matter but concluded that because california law governed the united states liability under b,it also determined where the holts claims arose.however,k states that b shall not apply to any claim falling within the foreign country exception.
the district court also failed to recognize that the question of when a claim accrues for statute of limitations purposes is analytically distinct from the question of where a claim arises under the foreign country exception.see manemann united states,cir.i n the case at bar we are not concerned with either the time or place of an accrued cause of action for the purpose of applying a statute of limitations or a principle of conflict of law.we are concerned only as to whether appellant claim arose in a foreign country within the contemplation of section k in re joint dist.asbestos,supp,stating that the last event required to establish liability is not necessarily plaintiff discovery of his illness so to hold would be to confuse the beginning of plaintiff cause of action with the beginning of its end,with the starting of the statute of limitations internal quotation marks omitted.there may be some overlap in the standards applied to these questions.see united states kubrick,recognizing that the general rule under the ftca has been that a tort claim accrues at the time of the plaintiff injury.but the statute of limitations inquiry is concerned with a plaintiff knowledge,see id.at,to ensure that a limitations period does not lapse before a reasonably diligent plaintiff is aware of her injury,see in re joint dist.asbestos,supp.at equating plaintiff discovery of his illness with the starting of the statute of limitations.in deciding where a claim arises under the foreign country exception,however,we are not concerned with the possibility of a blameless plaintiff losing a claim through delay.thus,we ask only where the last act necessary to establish liability occurred,sosa,at internal quotation marks omitted,without taking into account what the plaintiff knew or did not know 
to determine where the holts claims arose for the purposes of the foreign country exception,we must therefore look to governing principles at the time congress enacted the ftca.and,as the supreme court held in sosa,we must apply lex loci delicti.id.the restatement first of conflict of laws,upon which the supreme court relied in sosa,provides that t he place of wrong is where the last event necessary to make an actor liable for an alleged tort takes place.the restatement illustrates application of this rule when an individual sustains bodily harm as follows 
such a force is first set in motion by some human being.it is quite immaterial in what state he set the force in motion.it must alone or in cooperation with other forces harm the body of another.the person harmed may thereafter go into another state and die from the injury or suffer other loss therefrom.the place where this last event happens is also immaterial.the question is only where did the force impinge upon his body.
id.thus,an injury occurs where it is first suffered,even if a negligent act later results in further or more serious harm.accord williams gyrus acmi,supp,holding that plaintiff injury occurred for purposes of lex loci delicti at the time shim was left in her body,even if she did not begin to experience pain or other symptoms from the shim presence until she relocated to another state.
it is undisputed that cerebral palsy resulted from the brain injury she sustained in spain as a consequence of her premature birth.the district court held that the holts claims arose in the united states because that is where cerebral palsy definitively manifested itself.in reaching that determination,the court distinguished between brain injury and her cerebral palsy diagnosis,reasoning that because plaintiffs were suing to recover for the latter harm,and cerebral palsy is not a disease but rather a collection of symptoms,plaintiffs claims could not have arisen prior to those symptoms being present and diagnosable.but premature birth caused appreciable injury while the holts were in spain,even if cerebral palsy was not definitively diagnosed in that country.under lex loci delicti,as it was interpreted at the time of the ftca passage,the fact that a plaintiff suffers some other loss in a different jurisdiction is immaterial.restatement first conflict of laws.the question is only where did the force impinge upon her body.id.the undisputed facts of this case indicate that the force the brain injury suffered at or near the time of her birth impinged upon her body in spain thus,that is where the holts claims arose.see sosa,at 
our conclusion is consistent with the application of the foreign country exception by other federal courts.in thompson peace corps,supp,the court held that the foreign country exception barred the plaintiff ftca claims,which were based on injuries she sustained as a result of taking an drug in burkina faso.id.at.the court reasoned that although the plaintiff complain ed of continuing side effects after her return home,as well as a permanent brain injury,the court lacked jurisdiction because the claims based on those injuries arose out of the administration of mefloquine in burkinafaso.id.at.similarly,the district of columbia circuit has twice held that a district court lacked jurisdiction over a plaintiff claims for emotional or economic injuries occurring in the united states because those injuries were derivative of harm suffered abroad by the plaintiffs spouses.see gross united states,cir.holding that foreign country exception applied because wife economic injuries in the united states were derivative of injuries husband suffered as a result of imprisonment in cuba harbury hayden,cir.holding that foreign country exception applied to claims for emotional injuries that wife suffered in united states but that resulted from physical abuse and death of husband in guatemala.in both cases,the court expressed concern that plaintiffs would be able to plead around the ftca exception simply by claiming injuries that are derivative of the injuries at the root of the complaint.harbury,at.
like the injuries alleged in these cases,cerebral palsy is derivative of the harm she sustained at birth.as the holts recognize,cerebral palsy is not itself a disease,but rather a group of motor conditions.it is therefore a description of symptoms manifesting from brain injury,rather than a separate,compensable harm.moreover,to hold that the holts claims did not arise until cerebral palsy could be definitively diagnosed would enable plaintiffs in similar circumstances to avoid application of the foreign country exception,eith
