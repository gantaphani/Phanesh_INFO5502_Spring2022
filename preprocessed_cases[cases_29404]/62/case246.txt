this case concerns whether the government violated the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the constitution by prosecuting and convicting robert reveles for a crime after the navy punished him for the same offense.the government argues that the double jeopardy clause is not implicated because the punishment njp administered by the navy under is not criminal in nature.the court agrees,and holds that the government prosecution of reveles was not barred by the double jeopardy clause.reveles conviction is affirmed.
the facts of this case are straightforward and undisputed.reveles was accused of drunk driving in october on kitsap naval base in bremerton,washington.reveles was then charged by the navy in an article uniform code of military justice ucmj proceeding,which is considered an njp proceeding.the maximum punishment that the presiding officer could impose in the proceeding was a diminished rations b correctional custody c forfeiture of pay d reduction in pay grade e extra duties f restriction to limits g detention h an admonition and i a reprimand.see ucmj b.as discussed later,limitations on the severity of these punishments include a maximum of days of correctional custody.
in the njp proceeding,reveles was found guilty of drunken operation of a motor vehicle,in violation of article of the ucmj,and was sentenced to a forfeiture of of one month pay b a pay reduction a total loss of per month c extra duty for days and d restriction to ship for days.
based on the same conduct,reveles was later charged in federal court with drunk driving in violation of and and revised code of washington.reveles pled not guilty and filed a motion to dismiss for alleged violations of the double jeopardy clause motion to dismiss,which was denied by a magistrate judge.while preserving his right to appeal the magistrate judge denial,reveles entered a conditional guilty plea and was sentenced to hours in a detention center and a fine.reveles then appealed the magistrate judge denial of his motion to dismiss to the district court.the district court denied his appeal in october.
the fifth amendment double jeopardy clause states that no person shall be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.const.amend.the clause protects only against the imposition of multiple criminal punishments for the same offense rivera pugh,cir quoting hudson united states,emphasis in original.in rivera,the supreme court set forth the test we must apply 
whether a particular punishment is criminal or civil is,at least initially,a matter of statutory construction.a court must first ask whether the legislature,in establishing the penalizing mechanism,indicated either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or the other.even in those cases where the legislature has indicated an intention to establish a civil penalty,we have inquired further whether the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect as to transform what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.
id.quoting hudson,at.
thus,we must first determine whether congress intended njp to be criminal or noncriminal.and if njp was intended to be noncriminal,we must then examine whether njp is so punitive that it has been transformed into a criminal penalty.
whether congress intended njp to be criminal 
reveles argues that congress intended njp to be criminal in nature.this argument fails.
the ucmj provides four methods for disposing of cases involving offenses committed by servicemen the general,special,and summary,and disciplinary punishment administered by the commanding officer pursuant to ucmj.middendorf henry.unlike,which resemble judicial proceedings,njp is an administrative method of dealing with the most minor offenses.id.at internal citations omitted.
when interpreting a statute,we look first to the plain language of the statute,construing the provisions of the entire law,including its object and policy,to ascertain the intent of congress.zuress donley,cir quoting northwest forest res.council glickman,cir.a review of the njp statute plain language reveals that congress intended it to be noncriminal in nature.
the text of the statute shows an intent to distinguish minor njp disciplinary proceedings from criminal proceedings.see.according to the statute,njps are disciplinary punishments for minor offenses without the intervention of a id.at b.the title of the statute,commanding officer punishment,confirms congress intent to distinguish njp from traditional criminal proceedings.id.emphasis added but see state ivie,state court holding that the statute title indicated njp was criminal,rather than civil,in nature.thus,the language of the njp statute indicates that congress intended njp to be noncriminal in nature.
legislative history confirms congress intent to make njp noncriminal.the senate armed services committee commented that njps deal with minor infractions of discipline without resorting to criminal law processes,at emphasis added.it further stated that these punishments are and are not considered as a conviction of a crime and in this sense ha ve no connection with the military system.id.emphasis added.
the manual for courts martial mcm and the manual of the judge advocate general,department of the navy jagman,are also helpful in determining the intended nature of njp.although neither of these documents is technically legislative history,each of them confirms an intent to make njp a noncriminal sanction.specifically,the mcm states that njp purpose is to promote positive behavior changes in servicemembers without the stigma of a conviction.mcm,pt.v.and the jagman description of captain mast proceedings an alternate name for njp proceedings corroborates this purpose 
captain hours that results in nonjudicial punishment is not a criminal trial it is a disciplinary proceeding.such punishment is designed for minor misconduct in a nonjudicial forum,without the permanent stigma of a record of federal conviction.as such,the standard of proof by which facts must be established at mast or office hours is a preponderance of the evidence,rather than beyond a reasonable doubt,as it is at.
jagman b emphasis added.
to support his argument that the mcm indicates that njp is criminal in nature,reveles notes that the mcm defines a criminal proceeding to include nonjudicial punishment proceedings.mcm,pt.iv.reveles also cites a case from the court of appeals for the armed forces,united states arriaga,that refers to this definition.
but the mcm section and case reveles cites both concern obstruction of justice charges.the mcm section states that f or purposes of this paragraph concerning obstruction of justice,criminal proceedings includes nonjudicial punishment proceedings mcm,pt.iv,emphasis added.thus,while the mcm appears to extend obstruction of justice charges to conduct concerning njp proceedings,it never indicates that njp is criminal in nature.reveles argument that this narrow provision has greater applicability is unpersuasive.
numerous courts have also recognized that congress intended njp to be noncriminal.for example,the armed forces court of appeals has stated that the title of the njp legislation commanding officer punishment underscores the legislative intent to separate njp from the judicial procedures of the military criminal law forum,the.united states gammons.similarly,the united states court of claims has held that nonjudicial punishment,unlike the general and special,is not a formal adversary criminal proceeding,but is regarded as noncriminal in nature.wales united states,citing fairchild lehman,see also cochran united states,dumas united states,united states trogden,d,state myers,haw but see united states volpe.arriaga,at ivie,at.
reveles argues that volpe and arriaga expose a split among federal courts concerning the categorization of njp.but volpe is distinguishable because the magistrate judge in that case did not conduct a analysis when considering defendant double jeopardy arguments.volpe.at.and arriaga does not support reveles argument because that case involved njp in an obstruction of justice context.although ivie is largely on
