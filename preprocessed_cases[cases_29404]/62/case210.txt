this wrongful death lawsuit arises out of the fatal electrocution of united states army private van ryan marcum.his estate sued the shaw group,a private contractor in charge of maintenance and repairs at fort benning,georgia.the estate alleges that shaw negligently performed its duties under the contract with the united states army.a jury returned a verdict against shaw.shaw appeals,seeking judgment as a matter of law,or alternatively a new trial.having jurisdiction under,this court affirms.
on june,private marcum leaned his head and back against an abandoned,metal latrine,following an exercise on firing range malone at fort benning.the outer walls of the latrine carried a live current of electricity.private marcum was fatally electrocuted.
an investigation showed that the building was insufficiently grounded and improperly bonded,and had a faulty circuit breaker and a short in the wiring to a fan.the short energized the shell of the metal building.when private marcum sat down and leaned against the building,he completed the circuit and became the ground.
before private marcum death,shaw was to demolish several abandoned,metal latrines,including the malone latrine,pursuant to an approved individual job order ijo from the army.the approved ijo had an original suspense date,a completion date,of march.suspense dates are used to evaluate the timeliness of shaw work.on june,two days before private marcum death,representatives from the army and shaw attended a budget meeting.among other things,they discussed this ijo.the army and shaw agreed to postpone,or slow play,the demolition of metal latrines,including the malone latrine.
before trial,shaw moved for summary judgment,asserting it had no duty under the contract to demolish the abandoned,metal latrines.the district court ruled that shaw had a duty to inspect,repair and maintain the malone latrine.the court also ruled that justiciable questions of fact existed regarding the demolition of the malone latrine and that foreseeability was a question for the jury because reasonable persons could differ about it.during trial,the court denied shaw motion for judgment as a matter of law and after trial,the court denied shaw renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and motion for new trial.
the jury returned a verdict against shaw.it awarded million for mental anguish to private marcum father,million for mental anguish to his mother,million in damages for loss of life,and for conscious pain and suffering,for a total verdict of million.on special interrogatories,the jury apportioned percent of the fault to the army and percent to shaw.

shaw claims the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law.shaw premises its arguments on the concepts that its duties to private marcum are defined exclusively by the contract and that the extent of these duties is a matter of law to be determined by the court.
under arkansas law,the issue of whether a duty exists is always a question of law.lacy flake kelley.if no duty of care is owed,summary judgment is appropriate.id.to determine what duty,if any,shaw owed private marcum,this court must first determine what duty shaw owed the army under the contract.see perry baptist health,in arkansas,a party may recover for damages from breach of contract when that party is a beneficiary to the contract.wilson rebsamen.
it is a settled rule in the construction of contracts that the interpretation must be upon the entire instrument,and not merely on disjointed or particular parts of it.byme,ivy,quoting first bank of crossett griffin.in seeking to harmonize different clauses of a contract,we should not give effect to one to the exclusion of another even though they seem conflicting or contradictory,nor adopt an interpretation which neutralizes a provision if the various clauses can be reconciled.the object is to ascertain the intention of the parties,not from particular words or phrases,but from the entire context of the agreement.byme,at,quoting sturgis skokos.
as the contractor,shaw had several duties that are relevant here.under section critical systems,shaw had a duty to keep the electrical systems and the structural integrity and safety of buildings operational hours a day,every day.under section ijo work approval,after the army approved the ijo to demolish abandoned,metal latrines including malone latrine,shaw had a duty to demolish them in accordance with work scheduling practices.shaw even had a duty to maintain and repair the malone latrine,pending demolition

shaw asserts the contract unequivocally provides that no work can be performed in any functional area without the issuance of a work order.work orders are separated into three categories 
standing operating orders soos 
soos represent work that is performed on a recurring basis soo work is described under scheduled tasks in functional areas through,and.
service orders sos 
sos represent work that is generally corrective in nature,repairs and replacements or those related services that are not generally considered to be maintenance activities examples include minor electrical,so work is described under unscheduled tasks in functional areas through,and an so may be initiated by the contractor upon identification of a need for corrective action.
individual job orders ijos 
ijos represent work such as repairs,modifications,replacements,or installations that exceed the thresholds defined above for a so ijo work is described under unscheduled tasks in functional areas through,and.an ijo may be initiated by the contractor upon identification of a need for a corrective action.
shaw may sos and ijos upon identification of a need for corrective action.this also can be done under section sources of work.additionally,shaw may soos and sos under sections soo work approval and so work approval.shaw may not commence work on an ijo without the approval of the army contracting officer under section ijo work approval.because shaw may initiate work orders and soos and sos,then the issue,as the district court correctly noted,is whether shaw had notice of a need to provide corrective action at the malone latrine.
