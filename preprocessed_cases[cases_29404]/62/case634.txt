background 
harding was appointed as a staff physician by the department of veterans affairs dva pursuant to.on november,the dva removed harding from his position on charges of persistent failure to maintain certain patient records.the dva discharge notice indicated that harding removal involve d a question of professional conduct or competence,entitling him to appeal the decision to a disciplinary appeals board under a.harding then pursued two simultaneous avenues to challenge his removal.he filed an appeal with the disciplinary appeals board,which ultimately led to the removal penalty being mitigated to a suspension.he also pursued a claim,initially filed prior to his discharge,with the united states office of special counsel,in which he alleged that he was improperly discharged in retaliation for whistleblower activities.the office of special counsel,after conducting a preliminary investigation,advised harding that it was unable to make a determination in his favor and terminated its investigation.it then notified him,in writing,that because he had alleged that he was a victim of reprisal for whistleblowing,he had a right to seek corrective action from the merit systems protection board pursuant to an individual right of action.see a.
harding then appealed to the board.in his initial decision,the administrative law judge dismissed harding petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,concluding that harding had failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that he made a disclosure protected under the whistleblower statute.harding dep t of veterans affairs,no.july,initial decision.

discussion 
on appeal,harding argues that the board decision was not in accordance with law because it failed to properly consider an amendment to the wpa that,he asserts,expressly provides for board review of whistleblower claims by dva medical personnel.like board member sapin in her dissenting opinion below,he argues that f represents express authorization by congress for the inclusion of dva medical personnel in the class of employees protected by 
the board considered this argument and rejected it,relying primarily on the notwithstanding clause of b,which states 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,no provision of title which is inconsistent with this chapter et shall be considered to supersede,override,or otherwise modify such provision of that section or this chapter except to the extent that such provision of title or of such other law specifically provides,by specific reference to a provision of this chapter,f or such provision to be superseded,overridden,or otherwise modified.
emphasis added.
the critical question is whether the language of f is sufficient to constitute it as a provision of title that specifically provides,by specific reference to a provision of chapter of title,f or such provision to be superseded,overridden,or otherwise modified.the board concluded that it was not,stating that t he sweeping language of section b signals the drafter intention that the provisions of the notwithstanding clause trump all other laws,and that the relevant portion of f did not set out a specific reference to any provision of title that was to be superseded,overridden,or otherwise modified.final decision,at.
we disagree.section f of title expresses congress intent to supersede,not a specific provision of chapter,but all the provisions of chapters and that might operate to preclude employees appointed under those chapters from pursuing remedies under enumerated provisions of title.the only question is whether this command should be defeated by its very breadth.we conclude that it should not.section f,by stating congress intent to supersede all relevant provisions of chapters and for particular purposes,effectively overrides the specificity requirements of b and,consequently,the exclusivity provision of.to conclude that congress decision to supersede all relevant provisions of chapter is somehow ineffective to supersede one particular provision of that chapter is to elevate form over substance and vitiate congress clear intent.
the cases relied upon by the dissent are entirely consistent with the result we reach today.the only federal circuit decision to address the application of f to veterans health administration personnel concluded that congress has expressly provided dva medical personnel with coverage by title provisions relating to whistleblower protection.james von zemenszky,citing f.the board has drawn the same conclusion.see,yunus dep t of veterans affairs,stating that as a department of veterans affairs physician appointed under,the appellant can not appeal his removal directly to the board but can bring this appeal,in which the only issue is whether the removal was retaliatory because in congress extended the wpa coverage to dva physicians,aff.the united states office of special counsel sent a letter specifically advising harding of his right to appeal his removal to the board,stating that he could seek corrective action from the mspb under the provisions of a and,even instructing him to include the letter in his board appeal.
although it is true,as the dissent states,that several other circuits have held that under the predecessor of b,title yields to title in the case of a conflict,unless the conflicting provision of title expressly supersedes the title provision,those cases address the simpler circumstance in which an arguably inconsistent title provision makes no reference to any congressional intent to supersede any part of title.see,am.fed.of gov t employees,fed.labor relations,am.fed.of gov t employees,local fed.labor relations,cir american federation ii veterans admin.med.ctr.fed.labor relations,cir.the most recent of the regional circuit cases cited by the dissent noted that under b,provisions of title can not implicitly modify title.american federation ii,at emphasis added.we agree with the dissent that,in the absence of any evidence of congressional intent to override or modify a provision of title,section b must preclude any such modification.where,however,congress has expressly stated its intention to override multiple provisions of title for a particular purpose,sound principles of s
