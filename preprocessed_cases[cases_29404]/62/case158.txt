bwxt,llc is the managing and operating contractor for the national nuclear security administration nnsa at the national security complex in oak ridge,tennessee.the nnsa is a agency within the department of energy.bwxt terminated rudolph escher on september.escher contends that he was terminated in retaliation for complaints he made about bwxt designation and accounting of his military leave time,which he believed violated the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act userra.bwxt claims that it fired escher for doing work for his job in the naval reserves during company time and with company resources.the district court granted summary judgment to bwxt,and we affirm.
background 
in,bwxt changed its military leave policy,and no longer allowed employees to enter a partial week of unpaid military leave once they had exhausted their hours of military leave pay.escher complained about this change twice after he returned from military leave with the naval reserves.first,in,he complained to linda,an administrative employee in payroll.second,in the summer of,escher complained to and carol johnson,a senior human resources specialist in compensation.
work for the naval reserves 
two complaints were filed against escher regarding his naval reserve work.the first complaint was filed in january and led to an investigation of escher internet use,which was not irregular.a second anonymous complaint was filed on august,and it triggered an investigation that showed irregular use,and indicated that escher was doing personal,naval reserve business while at bwxt.thereafter,escher was placed on administrative leave with pay 
on september,steven weaver,the labor and employee relations manager,long,and nancy johnson johnson,the division manager supervising escher,met with escher.the decision to terminate escher was johnson alone to make.escher explained that he had permission from william mckeethan,his immediate supervisor,to be copied on that he would to his home computer.after talking to escher,they called mckeethan,who testified that he only specifically recalled giving escher permission to make some phone calls and to send and forward to his home computer after,and that he told him to keep it at a minimum.mckeethan did not recall escher making up time for his naval reserve work before or after work.
johnson reviewed the and made a rough estimate of the time escher had put into the,and she concluded that escher use was not incidental and that he was doing naval reserve work at the expense of bwxt.she did not find any evidence to support escher assertion that he was making up the time.johnson also considered other employees who had been disciplined for internet abuse,including an african american woman who was terminated after sending and receiving approximately in connection with her business.however,johnson,a former military officer,hesitated to fire escher for his naval reserve work.
around september,johnson met with dennis ruddy,bwxt president and general manager,who asked her,between the african american woman and escher,who had derived more personal gain from misuse of the computer.johnson concluded that escher had and,at that point,she decided to terminate his employment.on september,johnson told weaver and long of her decision regarding escher.on september,johnson,weaver,and long met with escher and informed him that he was terminated.johnson,weaver,and long all affirmatively testified that they had no knowledge about escher complaints concerning how his military leave was being charged to the payroll system,that this issue was never discussed during their investigation of escher use,and that these complaints had nothing to do with long or weaver recommendation to terminate,or with johnson final decision to terminate.
escher then brought this suit alleging violations of userra,the tennessee public protection act,and common law retaliation.
ii.analysis 
the district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.leadbetter gilley,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed civ.c.when reviewing a motion for summary judgment,this court views all evidence in the light most favorable to the party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,u.however,t he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the party position will be insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the party.moldowan city of warren,cir quoting anderson liberty lobby,alterations in moldowan.
userra claim 
the retaliation provision of userra,b,states that 
b an employer may not discriminate in employment against or take any adverse employment action against any person because such person has taken an action to enforce a protection afforded any person under this chapter,has testified or otherwise made a statement in or in connection with any proceeding under this chapter,has assisted or otherwise participated in an investigation under this chapter,or has exercised a right provided for in this chapter.the prohibition in this subsection shall apply with respect to a person regardless of whether that person has performed service in the uniformed services.
c an employer shall be considered to have engaged in actions prohibited 
under subsection b,if the person a action to enforce a protection afforded any person under this chapter,b testimony or making of a statement in or in connection with any proceeding under this chapter,c assistance or other participation in an investigation under this chapter,or d exercise of a right provided for in this chapter,is a motivating factor in the employer action,unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such person enforcement action,testimony,statement,assistance,participation,or exercise of a right.
in order to make out a userra retaliation claim,an employee bears the initial burden of showing,by a preponderance of the evidence,that his protected status was a motivating factor in the adverse employment action.hance norfolk so.ry,cir per curiam sheehan dep t of the navy.protected status is a motivating factor if a truthful employer would list it,if asked,as one of the reasons for its decision.coffman,f d,cir see also hance,at.discriminatory motivation can be inferred from a variety of considerations,including 
proximity in time between the employee military activity and the adverse employment action,inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer,an employer expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the employee military activity,and disparate treatment of certain employees compared to other employees with similar work records or offenses.
hance,at quoting sheehan,at coffman,at.furthermore,to establish actionable retaliation,the relevant decision maker,not merely some agent of the defendant,must possess knowledge of the plaintiff protected activity.mulhall ashcroft,cir fenton hisan,cir.
if the plaintiff meets this burden,the employer then has the opportunity to come forward with evidence to show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the employer would have taken the adverse action anyway,for a valid reason.hance,at quoting sheehan,at noting that the burden of production and the burden of persuasion shift to the employer.
escher protected activities were not a motivating factor 
temporal proximity 
escher argues that the district court overlooked that the investigation into his computer use was launched on august,less than days after he filed his second complaint concerning bwxt modified military leave policy ken brown,bwxt legal counsel,recommended escher termination on september,and several knew of escher activities.however,these facts,and the remaining evidence,do not form a basis for an inference of discriminatory motive.
the investigation of escher use was started by an anonymous complaint.there is nothing in the record questioning the validity or anonymity of the complaint,nor is there anything questioning whether the ethics officer properly pursued the complaint.furthermore,johnson,weaver,and long all testified that they had no knowledge of escher complaints about military leave.indeed,the decision to fire escher was entirely johnson consequently,it is a to imply that there were numerous.while johnson agrees that she counseled with brown and human resources,and that they noted that escher behavior hit a threshold that bwxt had already terminated at least one employee for,there is no evidence that she relied on brown or anyone in legal or human resources for making her decision,nor is there evidence that they informed her of escher prior complaints about military leave.johnson dep.since the sole was responding to an anonymous complaint,and since she had no knowledge of escher military leave complaints,the temporal proximity between the investigation of escher email use and his complaints about military leave does not show discriminatory motivation.
ii.inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer 
escher also several inconsistencies create a genuine issue of material fact as to bwxt motivation for firing him.in particular,he points to the following facts that bwxt took no action on his first complaint the lack of credible reliance on company policy and management approval of his actions.
a.earlier complaint 
the different treatment of the earlier complaint does not create a genuine issue of material fact.mckeethan told weaver,whom he asked to investigate,that the first complaint alleged that escher spent many hours using the computer for non company business.weaver thought that mckeethan was referring to internet,not,misuse and accordingly asked diane williams,the head of bwxt cyber security,to generate an internet usage report for escher.weaver,ex.the results showed no problems with escher internet use.
in contrast,the anonymous complaint sent on august,stated,in much more detailed language,that 
i feel a supervisor in our group badge is committing time card fraud and is blatantly abusing time.this supervisor is a employee high level in pay and is a member of the naval reserves high level pay.the majority of his time while at is being spent performing military work,phone,fax.should the military job be considered a second job since he makes a huge salary because he is very high level in the military maybe someone needs to look at his time to see what he is charging his time to because is being spent on military work.bet his phone records would be interesting as well.
taylor,ex.this different language,which specifically refers to,phone,fax,resulted in a different investigation,which included examining escher use.furthermore,the second complaint was sent through bwxt no more surprises program and it resulted in a direct investigation by an ethics investigator.therefore,the record does not support escher contention that these two complaints were improperly treated differently.
company policy 
escher also argues that the record creates a genuine issue of material facts as to whether his naval reserve work constituted official government use or whether it was incidental use.employment at bwxt is subject to the employee handbook standards of business conduct and business ethics.the standards of conduct describe prohibited acts,any one of which is grounds for disciplinary action,including termination.escher dep.ex.at pro.concerning the use of technology systems,the standards of conduct state that 
bwxt and supplies and equipment are not intended for personal use.bwxt and facilities,equipment,and supplies must be used only for bwxt business or associated purposes specifically authorized by management.this applies to personal computers,software,and associated support items 
internal information systems,communications facilities and system s including,interoffice mail,and voice mail networks,and databases are to be used for business purposes.unauthorized use is considered a misappropriation of bwxt assets.
id.at.the u se of the bwxt system and internet connection for personal advertisement or gain on behalf of outside business ventures is prohibited.id.at.however,the policy also notes that it resources are to be used for the conduct of official government or business with the exception of occasional personal matters requiring attention during work hours.ex.at pro.
the district court found escher argument that his naval reserve work constituted official government business within the meaning of the policy to be disingenuous.opinion at.we agree.in light of the rest of the policy,and common sense,the phrase official government business does not permit escher to work on separate naval reserve business while at work 
similarly,we agree that escher use of the bwxt system was not incidental by any definition of bwxt policies by any dictionary definition or by any common sense understanding of the term.opinion at.while prohibiting the use of bwxt computers for purposes,the standards of conduct also provide for incidental use that does not interfere with bwxt operations,create additional costs,or interfere with an employee duties.escher dep.ex.at pro.from,escher organized thousands of relating to his naval reserve work into hundreds folders and subfolders.there were also numerous documents saved outside the system.long determined that escher was sending and receiving during work hours,and using his bwxt address as an automatic signature,which invited recipients to respond to it.indeed,the evidence shows that escher received and sent out correspondence throughout the business day and that frequently it was both extensive and amounting to multiple emails per day.
management approval 
escher also argues that there is a dispute concerning whether he had management approval to use the system for his work for the naval reserves.however,as the district court correctly noted,the proof does not show that bwxt management knew the extent of escher use and condoned that use.opinion at.even if,as jerry harris a peer of escher at bwxt claimed,it was common knowledge within the group that escher had revived and sent some communications for the naval reserves while working for bwxt,and even if mckeethan understood that escher occasionally worked on and made phone calls for the naval reserves at work,this does not show approval of escher activities,or that management was aware of or approved of the extent of these activities indeed,the evidence shows that any management approval was based on an incorrect understanding of the amount of naval reserve work that escher was in fact doing.
iii.employer expressed hostility 
escher acknowledges that he is not in a position to contradict bwxt treatment of military personnel but points out that bwxt ignored his complaints in and failed to communicate with or so much as acknowledge his esgr representative in.appellant br.at.indeed,bwxt has a long record showing that it maintains a generous military leave policy,and in and esgr gave bwxt awards as an outstanding employer.furthermore,the evidence does not show that bwxt ignored his complaint in instead,discussed the matter with escher and referred him to cottrell or brown,and brown ultimately responded to escher concerns in in a way that was satisfactory to him.
iv.disparate treatment of certain employees 
finally,there is no evidence of disparate treatment between escher and similarly situated employees.it is escher burden to show that the other employees acts were of comparable seriousness to his own infraction.see clayton meijer,cir.the only other employee found to have used bwxt computer system for personal gain was an african american female who was terminated after sending or receiving regarding her business.escher,whose conduct was clearly more egregious,was also terminated.see also wright murray guard,cir noting that,when considering whether two employees are similarly situated,it is proper for an employer to consider its legal obligations,especially to a class of people protected by federal and state law.escher also refers to other employees who were disciplined short of terminat
