the uniformed services former spouses protection act act gives states the option to classify a united states armed forces member disposable military retirement pay as property divisible upon divorce,stat.codified as amended at.in addition,the act establishes a payments mechanism allowing an eligible former spouse to receive the share of the retired pay directly from the military pursuant to a state court order in divorce proceedings.id.in this case current and retired members of the armed forces whose retirement pay has been divided in state divorce proceedings,and an association representing such members,sued the secretary of defense.the plaintiffs allege that the act and the regulations implementing it violate their constitutional rights to due process and equal protection of law.they also allege that the act fails to respect the principle,purportedly rooted in the constitution armed forces and full faith and credit clauses,that legislation concerning military pay must have nationally uniform effect without variations among the states.the district court dismissed the individual plaintiffs claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,reasoning that these plaintiffs impermissibly sought appellate review of their underlying state court divorce decrees.the court later dismissed or granted summary judgment to the secretary on all of the association claims.we conclude that the district court correctly rejected the association constitutional challenges,and we also conclude that the individual claims can not succeed,even though the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over them.we therefore affirm.
to be eligible for retirement pay,members of the uniformed services must generally serve for a specified length of time,usually at least years.see et army et navy and marine corps et air force.members also face a mandatory retirement age of regardless of how long they have served,subject to certain exceptions.the amount of retirement pay is usually a product of two factors the number of years of creditable service and a fixed percentage of the member pay level achieved at retirement.barker kansas,d see,setting forth rules for computation of retirement pay.federal law may impose obligations on members even after retirement.many retirees remain members of the armed forces.see,a army a air force.they may in some circumstances be recalled into active duty,see,and they may not violate the provisions of the uniform code of military justice,see a.these obligations,though significant,do not imply that military retirement pay is to be regarded for all legal purposes as compensation for reduced job activities during retirement.in some contexts this pay may instead be viewed as deferred compensation for past services,barker,at,just like ordinary public sector employee pensions.divorce is one example.id.
the division of spousal property upon divorce is usually a question of state law.the whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and wife belongs to the laws of the states and not to the laws of the united states.in re burrus.but application of state family law under some narrow circumstances cuts into substantial federal interests and must yield to federal law under the supremacy clause.see hisquierdo hisquierdo,d.the supreme court identified one of these circumstances in mccarty mccarty,d.there the court found an irreconcilable conflict between the federal statutes governing military retirement the court construed as making retirement pay the property of the state law that treated pay earned during marriage as divisible spousal property.the court went on to hold that state law could not be allowed to divide a military retiree retirement pay in divorce proceedings.id.at.that is,the retiree former spouse could not receive a share of the retiree retirement pay.remarking that the plight of an of a retired service member is often a serious one,the court emphasized that its determination was subject to legislative correction congress may well decide that more protection should be afforded such a former spouse this decision is for congress alone.id.at.
congress made exactly that decision in passing the uniformed services former spouses protection act.the statute provides that subject to specified limitations a court may treat disposable retired pay payable to a member for pay periods beginning after june,either as property solely of the member or as property of the member and his spouse in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction of such court.c emphasis added.disposable retired pay is the total monthly retired pay less certain deductions,a,and no more than half of the retiree disposable retired pay may be awarded to the former spouse as divisible property,e.retirement pay waived to receive disability benefits is excluded.a b mansell mansell,d.although it was signed into law on september,and became effective february,the statute expressly covered payments to retirees after june,the day the court handed down mccarty.congress later clarified that former spouses could not seek a share of retired pay if their divorce or separation became final before june,and the state court did not treat or reserve jurisdiction to treat any amount of the retired pay of the member as divisible property.c.
by referring to the law of the jurisdiction of a court issuing a divorce order,c unambiguously leaves to the states the choice of whether to treat disposable retired pay earned for service during marriage as divisible property.see also barker,at.describing the act as giving the states the option of dividing such pay.it appears that nearly every state has elected to treat military retired pay as divisible marital property.see generally analysis of divisibility of military retired pay,army law.nevertheless,a division under c can only be made by a state court that has jurisdiction over the member based on residence,domicile,or the member consent.c.
another provision of the act created a payments mechanism,mansell,at,under which the military directly transmits to former spouses the share of retired pay to which they are entitled under state court divorce decrees.see d.to be eligible for the direct payments,the former spouse must have been married to the member for at least years,and during the marriage the member must have completed at least years of creditable military service.d.a former spouse initiates the direct payment process by serving upon the secretary concerned a state court order specifically providing for the payment of an amount of the disposable retired pay.d.the court order must be regular on its face,b b,which means that it is issued by a court of competent jurisdiction,b a,and contains no indication that it was issued without legal authority,b b c.
a department of defense dod regulation issued pursuant to congressional authorization,j,sets forth further details of the payments mechanism.see dod financial management regulation,volume,ch,dod july,available at www.dod.mil comptroller fmr b b.pdf.after a former spouse submits a certified copy of the state court order,the dod defense finance and accounting service dfas must verify that the order satisfies the statutory requirements.id.if the order adjudicated the right of a member who was on active duty and not represented in court,the order must certify that the court afforded the member the procedural protections due under the servicemembers civil relief act scra,app.et.id.if,however,the court order is regular on its face,dfas does not further review the case to determine whether the rendering court had personal jurisdiction over the retiree.id.within days of effective service of the order,dfas must notify the affected retiree in writing.id.the retiree is entitled to respond,and dfas will not honor the court order if it is defective or is modified,superseded,or set aside.id.the retiree or the former spouse may later file a request that dfas reconsider its decision regarding the court order based on specified reasons.dfas must respond to the request for reconsideration,giving an explanation of the determination reached.id.
the individual plaintiffs in this case are either retired armed service members drawing retirement pay or active duty members who will be eligible for this pay on retirement.on various dates between and,these individuals were all divorced.they are subject to state court divorce orders granting their former spouses a portion of their retirement pay.dfas makes direct payments to the former spouses of at least some of the plaintiffs.the plaintiff association is the uniformed services former spouses protection act litigation support group,or ulsg,a limited liability corporation.it has nearly members,about half of whom have donated money to the association.
the plaintiffs sued the secretary of defense in april in the district court for the eastern district of virginia.they sought a judgment declaring that the act violates the members rights under the equal protection clause and the substantive and procedural components of the due process clause and that the act is unconstitutional because it allows state courts to apply it.the district court granted the secretary motion to dismiss.adkins rumsfeld,d.the court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because it understood the plaintiffs to be seeking federal appellate review of the state court orders in their divorce proceedings.id.at see court of appeals feldman,d rooker fid.trust.in the alternative,the district court concluded,among other things,that the individual plaintiffs lacked standing to proceed in federal court.d at.the court also concluded that the ulsg lacked associational standing because none of its individual members had standing.id.at.
on the plaintiffs motion to alter the judgment,see.e,the district court granted ulsg leave to amend the complaint to allege associational standing.once the amended complaint was filed,the secretary moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.in march the district court concluded that an affidavit submitted by a ulsg member was sufficient to show that ulsg had standing to bring the equal protection,procedural due process,and uniformity claims.the court held,however,that ulsg could not proceed with its claim that the act violated the substantive component of the due process clause by retroactively reaching the retirement pay of service members who joined before the act passage.the court based this determination on the date the affiant joined the military,which was long after the act effective date.reaching the merits,the district court went on to dismiss ulsg equal protection claim and the uniformity claim,but allowed the procedural due process claim to go forward.both sides moved for summary judgment on that surviving claim,and in october the district court granted summary judgment to the secretary.this appeal challenging the district court dismissal and summary judgment orders followed.our review is de novo.
we must examine at the outset whether the district court erred in holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the individual member claims.congress has vested only the supreme court with jurisdiction to review state court decisions.the doctrine,a corollary to this rule,prohibits lower federal courts from exercising appellate jurisdiction over final judgments.lance dennis,d per curiam.the supreme court has recently underscored that is a narrow doctrine.id.it deprives district courts of subject matter jurisdiction over cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d.formulated in this way,the doctrine forbids claims that seek redress for an injury caused by the decision itself because they ask the federal district court to conduct an appellate review of the decision.davani.dep t of,cir.in other words,the doctrine applies where a party in effect seeks to take an appeal of an unfavorable decision to a lower federal court.lance.at.the district court in this case ruled before the supreme court decided exxon mobil.it therefore applied our decisions,which had given the doctrine an expansive interpretation,an interpretation now reined in by the supreme court.davani,at.
the secretary argues that the individual claims fall within even the narrowed doctrine because the plaintiffs lost in state divorce court proceedings before bringing their federal suit,and because their injury was ultimately caused by the adverse state court judgments.we need not decide whether we agree with that description of the claims because at least some of the individual ones whose pay dfas not attempting to appeal unfavorable state court decisions.that is,even if these plaintiffs were losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced,as the concurring opinion takes them to be,post at,they were not inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.exxon mobil,at.these plaintiffs seek a declaration that the act is unconstitutional as applied to them.the act applies to these plaintiffs by requiring the armed forces to transmit payments to qualifying former spouses pursuant to state court divorce decrees.supra,part.a federal court declaration that the act is unconstitutional would invalidate the statutory basis for the federal payments mechanism and effectively prevent dfas from continuing to transmit payments based on a state court decree.such a declaration would not,however,amount to appellate reversal or modification of a valid state court decree entered in an individual plaintiff divorce case.at bottom,an examination of the federal constitutional challenge presented here against the act does not require scrutinizing and invalidating any individual state court judgment.contrary to the view expressed in the concurring opinion,the test is not whether the relief sought in the federal suit would certainly upset the enforcement of a state court decree,post at,but rather whether the relief would reverse or modify the state court decree.see exxon mobil,at.among federal courts,the rooker court clarified,congress had empowered only the supreme court to exercise appellate authority to reverse or modify a judgment.quoting rooker fidelity trust.or,to put it another way,when the plaintiffs asked the district court here to declare the act unconstitutional,they did not thereby call upon the c ourt to overturn an injurious judgment.exxon mobil,at.as a result,the individual plaintiffs whose retirement pay is currently redistributed by dfas are not in effect appeal ing their state court divorce decision s to a lower federal court.lance.at.the doctrine,contracted as it has been by the supreme court recent decisions,therefore did not deprive the district court of subject matter jurisdiction in this case.
our reading of the claims also shows why the case presents a justiciable controversy in that the individual plaintiffs and ulsg have matter we must be assured of,even if it is uncontested on appeal.friends of earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d.to satisfy the standing requirement,a plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.allen wright,d.the plaintiffs contend that when dfas transmits a portion of a service member retirement pay to a former spouse pursuant to the act,dfas effects a transfer of the member property.that transfer allegedly inflicts a direct economic harm upon the member that is concrete and not hypothetical.see.soc y for human life,fec,cir quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d.the money transfer follows directly from,and hence is traceable to,dfas obedience to the act moreover,the injury could be redressed because if a federal court were to declare the act unconstitutional,dfas would have to cease making the transfers.the individual plaintiffs whose apportioned retirement pay is dispensed through the act payments mechanism therefore have standing to proceed in federal court.see,alleging that automatic deduction payments are made to plaintiff richard becker from his retired pay by dfas raising identical allegation for plaintiff william conroy,iii.further,because the ulsg members whose retirement pay is dispensed to former spouses under that mechanism have standing,ulsg satisfies the requirements of associational standing.see hunt.state apple adver.comm n,d.
because we conclude that federal subject matter jurisdiction is present,we may proceed to the merits of the constitutional claims.
the plaintiffs challenge the district court dismissal of their claims invoking substantive due process,the alleged need for uniformity in rules governing military affairs,and equal protection.
the act does not exempt service members who joined the armed forces prior to its enactment from state court divorce decrees dividing their military retirement pay upon divorce,nor does it exempt these members from the federal payments mechanism that dfas administers.the service members who joined the military before the statute enactment allege that the lack of these exemptions retroactively alters the compensation they expected when hired.they contend that this retroactivity amounts to a violation of the substantive component of the due process clause of the fifth amendment.the district court did not resolve this claim because it erroneously concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.the error has no practical consequence for the claim,however,because the claim fails on the merits.
t he retroactive aspects of economic legislation,as well as the prospective aspects,must meet the test of due process,motors romein,d punctuation omitted,because e lementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted.landgraf usi film,d.the plaintiffs draw an analogy to united states larionoff,d,where the issue was the risk of retroactive government action that would be detrimental to military service members.in that case congress authorized but subsequently repealed a program that paid variable bonuses to armed forces members whose skills the military critically needed.id.at.one member in larionoff agreed to extend his enlistment while the program was in effect,but did not begin serving his term until after the program repeal.id.at.the military denied this member a bonus because the program was abolished before his period began.in holding that the member was entitled to the bonus originally promised to him,the court observed that congress gave no indication in repealing the program that it also intended to divest the member of the rights he had already earned.id.at.
the plaintiffs cite larionoff in urging us to hold that they are entitled to their undivided military retirement pay.larionoff is a very different case from this one,however.first,the supreme court search in that case for a clear expression of congressional intent to alter the rights of members who had extended their enlistments,was simply an application of a familiar general rule a statute shall not be given retroactive effect unless such construction is required by explicit language or by necessary implication.gonzales,june,quoting united states louis.this explicit language requirement is a demanding one that requires statutory language at a high level of clarity.ins cyr,d.the requirement was not satisfied in larionoff,at,but it is satisfied here.congress decided that the act would allow state courts to divide military retirement pay earned after june,again,the day the supreme court handed down mccarty in divorce proceedings.congress made this decision about the temporal reach of the statute clear in the words of the statute itself.c.where congress has spoken so clearly about the statute intended reach,the presumption against retroactivity simply does not come into play.
next,the settled expectations,landgraf,at,resulting from the bonus program congress established and then dismantled in larionoff are not easily compared to those we examine here.as we have emphasized,the act does not deprive members of their retirement pay.it simply gives state courts the option to divide that pay,and requires the secretary to enforce state court decisions through direct payments to qualifying spouses.congress may have promised to pay bonuses of a certain amount to members in the position described in larionoff.the individual plaintiffs here,however,can not plausibly allege that at the time they joined the military congress promised to permanently shield their retirement pay from former spouses presenting valid state court orders.only the supreme court decision in any promise by arguably have supported the expectations of some service members that their retirement pay would be shielded in this manner.
yet even that argument fails.the complaint reveals that none of the individual plaintiffs is entitled to argue that,in the slim window between the mccarty decision and the act passage,they had a legitimate expectation that their retirement pay would be shielded upon divorce from division and garnishment.only two plaintiffs in this case allege that they were divorced before the act was signed into law in september.indeed,they were divorced before mccarty was decided.they are lloyd stanton,divorced in arizona in march,and carroll zimmerman,divorced in california in august.yet the courts of the states in which these plaintiffs were divorced treated military retirement pay as divisible on divorce at the time,see van loan van loan,in re fithian,cal d,and the supreme court had not yet interpreted federal law as requiring a contrary rule.so even stanton and zimmerman can not claim that the act deprived them of any expectation based on the mccarty holding.
the individual plaintiffs did not state a substantive due process claim upon which relief could be granted.thus,the district court error in not reaching that claim does not affect the outcome of the case.
in giving state courts the option to divide military retirement pay upon divorce,the act tolerates variation among the states in how that pay is actually divided between spouses in individual cases.for example,although congress provided that the former spouse share of the member retirement pay pursuant to an order dividing property may not exceed percent,e,state courts are free to award a lesser share as appropriate in an individual case.the plaintiffs argue that the act give s rise to disparate treatment to service members and that it produces results when implemented in state law.this alleged lack of uniformity,they contend,is impermissible under the constitution armed forces clauses,art.i,cls,and the full faith and credit clause,art.iv.
we disagree.the portion of the full faith and credit clause the plaintiffs rely on provides that congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which state public acts,records and proceedings shall be proved,and the effect thereof.id.there is no indication that congress invoked this clause when passing the act into law,but even if it had,the clause does not impose on congress any requirement of substantive uniformity in any area of the law.the word uniform is nowhere found in this provision,though it can be found elsewhere in the constitution.see,art.i,cl.empowering congress to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the united states.as for the armed forces clauses,judicial deference is at its apogee when congress legislates under its authority to raise and support armies,rumsfeld forum for academic institutional rights,d quoting rostker goldberg,d,and congress decision to allow military retiree pay no special exemption from ordinary state divorce law principles is entitled to precisely this sort of deference.dismissal of the claim was correct.
the plaintiffs next argue that the act violates their constitutional right to equal protection by distinguishing between persons based on three classifications.they first allege that the act scheme has a disproportionately harmful impact on female service members.this argument attempts to present a sex discrimination claim.the female plaintiffs contend that when congress enacted the statute it aimed to protect former spouses not employed outside the home whom congress allegedly assumed were women at the expense of the service members whom congress allegedly assumed were men.the plaintiffs further argue that although the number of women in the armed forces has increased,the statute has not been changed.they allege that allowing the former husbands of female service members to receive a share of their retirement pay is manifestly unfair,as these former husbands in many cases have their own income.appellants br.at.in other words,the plaintiffs contend that the act discriminates against women in the armed forces and in favor of men because former husbands are more likely than former wives to have sources of income other than the divided military retirement pay.
this argument does not state a claim for sex discrimination in violation of equal protection.a statute that explicitly classifies people based on sex is subject to intermediate scrutiny,which means it must be established at least that the challenged classification serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.nguyen ins,d punctuation omitted.in contrast,a statute that does not explicitly classify people based on sex and is thus on its face,pers.adm r of feeney,d,must be assessed under a test before it is reviewed under intermediate scrutiny.first,we ask whether the statutory classification is indeed neutral in the sense that it is not,and if so,second,whether the adverse effect reflects invidious discrimination.id.
the act vocabulary is not sex specific.it refers to service members and former spouses,defining the term spouse as the husband or wife of a member who,on or before the date of a court order,was married to that member.a.so we must apply the feeney test.to satisfy the first element of the test,it is not enough that the statute be facially neutral rather,there must also be no covert discrimination.feeney,at.there are,to be sure,isolated statements in the legislative history describing the act as concerned about service members wives.see,at,reprinted in,additional statement of denton i t is virtually impossible to compensate the military wife for her efforts caring for husband,family,and home,and in preserving a sense of family stability.emphasis added.as the district court recognized,however,these isolated excerpts are inconclusive because the bulk of the congressional materials used terms,speaking of spouses and not wives.see,at,at t he committee believes that the unique status of the military spouse and that spouse great contribution to our defense require that the status of the military spouse be acknowledged,supported and protected.
the second feeney element requires a showing that a discriminatory purpose has,at least in some measure,shaped the legislation.feeney,at.the plaintiffs,however,do not and can not plausibly allege that congress passed the act at least in part because of,not merely in spite of,its adverse effects upon female service members,id.at.indeed,the plaintiffs complain that congress did not consider the plight of female service members,which means that congress can not have possessed the invidious intent to discriminate against them that would allow us to apply intermediate scrutiny.
the statute therefore does not distinguish between men and women,but between retired service members and their former spouses.we apply rational basis review to this classification.a classification neither involving fundamental rights nor proceeding along suspect lines is accorded a strong presumption of validity.such a classification can not run afoul of the equal protection clause if there is a rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.heller doe,d citations omitted.under the rational basis test a court must determine whether the purpose that animates the challenged laws and regulations is legitimate,smith setzer sons,procurement review panel,cir,and whether it was reasonable for the lawmakers to believe that use of the challenged classification would promote that purpose,id.quoting life ins.state bd.of equalization,d.
the act survives this rational basis review.first,congress exhibited special concern for the personal and economic sacrifices that the spouse of a military service member makes to sustain the marriage.see,at,at child care and management of the family household are many times solely the spouse responsibility.the military spouse lends a cohesiveness to the family facing the rigors of military life,including protracted and stressful separations.to be sure,congress also demonstrated respect for the rights of service members.see mansell,at.t he legislative history,read as a whole,indicates that congress intended both to create new benefits for former spouses and to place limits on state courts designed to protect military retirees.in any event,congress could have properly concluded that those sacrifices were even more intense than the ordinary sacrifices associated with marriage to civilian employees,and that former spouses of service members thus deserved additional protection not afforded to former spouses of civilian employees.while not the sole purpose,former spouse protection was a legitimate purpose animating the act.
second,the act was indeed rationally related to this legitimate government interest.as we have explained,the act has a limited function.it simply freed state courts to divide upon divorce military retirement pay based on service completed during the marriage,which allowed the state courts to increase the property available to the former spouse.the act additionally established the payments mechanism that makes it easier for some former spouses to receive their share of retirement pay pursuant to state court orders.for this scheme to work,of course,the act must distinguish former spouses who are entitled to take advantage of the payments mechanism from the retired members whose retirement pay is subject to distribution.the plaintiffs argue that the act unconstitutionally favors the former spouses over service members by allowing the former spouses access to retirement pay even though they,unlike the members,are not obligated to continue to perform duties for the government if called upon and are not subject to the military justice provisions.supra,part.this argument presupposes that the retirement pay can only be characterized as compensation for services rendered during retirement.the presupposition is false.although military retirement pay has some unique features,it also resembles an ordinary civilian pension in many respects,and congress grasped that resemblance in passing the act.in particular,the supreme court has explained that the act premise behind permitting the states to apply their community property laws to military retirement pay is that such pay is deferred compensation for past services,not compensation for reduced current services that the service member performs after retirement.barker,at.thus,congress could reasonably permit states to divide military retirement pay in favor of former spouses without making those spouses work for this pay,because the pay compensates the member for past services that the member rendered with the former spouse familial,emotional,and other support.
the plaintiffs also contend that the act creates a second classification by treating retired service members less favorably than other former federal employees.one of their concerns is that the act does not contain a remarriage cutoff,so a former spouse who remarries does not thereby forfeit the right to receive the determined portion of the service member retired pay.in contrast,certain payments to former spouses of employees in the civil service,foreign service,and intelligence agency are terminated if those spouses remarry before reaching a specified age.see,civil service foreign service central intelligence agency.after reviewing the act for congress,the dod concluded that the absence of a remarriage cutoff provision requires no legislative correction because the question is best answered in individual cases by state courts.see dod,a report to congress concerning federa
