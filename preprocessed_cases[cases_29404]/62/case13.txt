appellant ruth rosario brought this suit against the department of the army and several individuals alleging that a campaign of sexual harassment by her at an army medical clinic subjected her to a hostile work environment in violation of title vii of the civil rights act.see a.in granting summary judgment for the defendants,the district court concluded that the alleged conduct amounted only to a lack of courtesy and professionalism rather than harassment sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment.see harris forklift.
on de novo review,the record does not permit that conclusion.we therefore vacate the summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
we recount the facts in the light most favorable to appellant and likewise draw all inferences in her favor.see lockridge of me,cir.rosario,a civilian employee with the department of the army,was transferred to the rodríguez army health clinic at fort buchanan,puerto rico,in february.in her position as a medical records technician,she worked at the clinic front desk,and her duties included checking patients in upon their arrival and maintaining computerized health records.defendant arroyo,another civilian clinic employee who worked in close proximity to rosario and performed similar duties,trained her.beginning in march,when arroyo believed that rosario planned to apply for an open supervisor position,he began criticizing her to other employees and expressing doubts about her abilities.
in april,after saldine strassner was appointed to fill the vacancy,arroyo treatment of rosario and others at the clinic became abusive on a daily basis.he would throw medical records around,throw personal belongings into the trash,and disparage his with derogatory names and racial comments.according to rosario,an woman identified as private carter broke down in tears at one point and ultimately left the section due to the continue d daily hostile environment cause d by arroyo.in late april,according to rosario,arroyo started to make her life miserable by,inter alia,constantly complaining about the way she dressed,always watching the clock when she conversed with patients,and telling doctors who worked at the clinic about his personal opinion about my person.she claimed he would complain about her spending time talking with patients,but made no comments when other employees talked or joked with them.
in may,arroyo started bringing people to the section to look at rosario clothes,which he criticized as overly revealing,and he pointed out to the others that her underwear was visible.another clinic employee,miguel hernández,testified that arroyo repeatedly told him that rosario clothing made him uncomfortable.hernández reported that arroyo would talk about her underwear and especially her panties within five feet of where rosario sat,right behind her back,and she could listen to that,when she was talking to the patients.between july and january,arroyo continued to closely observe rosario whenever she conversed with patients,at times walking behind her and making faces as he looked at the person with whom she was speaking.these criticisms and behaviors occurred on a daily basis 
throughout the first half of,arroyo regularly complained to rosario about various issues the family pictures and other personal items,including food,on her desk t he way i walk,move,talk.he threw away rosario food and removed the other items from her desk.he continued to voice concerns about the way she dressed and have everybody come to my area and check me out.a patient stopped her one day at the post store and advised her to watch out for arroyo because he was talking about her negatively to others.an employee who worked in another section of the clinic,olga cournier,testified that arroyo would call the other guys,guys not necessarily that work there to rosario area,where they would meet and talk,and then point at her and then laugh.
a supervisor,staff sergeant pedro maldonado,brought rosario and arroyo together in march to discuss the difficulties between them.although they shook hands and,according to rosario,agree d to put a stop there,the conduct continued.maldonado stated that rosario was not the only female whom arroyo treated badly he would do it to other females that used to work there.he just intimidate them.cournier testified that arroyo would talk to other employees in a pleasant manner,but,when he directed to her rosario he would be,like,in a nasty way.
arroyo became the supervisor of the medical records section in july.he continued to criticize rosario and respond to her in ways she found humiliating,including making exaggerated mocking she spoke to him.cournier testified that,unlike arroyo behavior with other employees who worked the front desk,when rosario was there arroyo was always behind her,looking,and always he be watching on whatever she was doing or whatever she was saying.maldonado stated that arroyo made it difficult for rosario to perform her job,challenging every decision,saying d o do this,do do that,why did you do this,why did you do that.although rosario reported his behavior to higher level supervisors,no action was taken against him 
later in,arroyo initiated formal counseling of rosario concerning the dress code but evidence presented at the eeo hearing supports her contention that her clothing was always appropriate.maldonado,hernández and cournier all testified that they did not consider her attire inappropriate,and rosario asserted that her nearly twenty years of experience in the private and government sectors provided her with the knowledge of what to wear or not.indeed,arroyo acknowledged at the eeo hearing that,after march,her clothing had improved percent and he considered her attire proper.in april,however,arroyo complained to campbell about plaintiff dress,and the record contains a may,memorandum listing arroyo expectations for rosario that includes the following paragraph on her manner of dress 
sound judgment very important with the pursue sic of excellence.the way we dress for the work place should be business like.on occasion the way you have dress has made me and very uncomfortable and clearly seen by the rating officials.in the workplace you are required to stand,ben d,reach above for documents and you need to be fully aware that clothing that reveals underwear,clothing that attracts the attention of others,again the standard is business like 
rosario also alleged as evidence of arroyo discriminatory treatment the performance evaluation he gave her in april overall rating of successful which was lower than the excellent ratings she had previously received from other supervisors.she presented evidence as well that he obtained sexually oriented jokes from the computer and commented on them in her presence,said that she was fat and had delinquent children,and told her that she was dressing like a woman of the streets.
as a result of arroyo behavior toward her,rosario felt uncomfortable every day and did not want to go to work.she became depressed,started losing her hair,experienced panic attacks,and eventually was hospitalized.she needed psychiatric treatment and medication,and attributed the breakup of her marriage to her situation at work.
in september,rosario filed a formal discrimination complaint with the army equal employment opportunity office and submitted a statement detailing many of the circumstances described above.following the evidentiary hearing,the agency found for the defendants.rosario then filed this lawsuit alleging that she was subjected to gender and national origin discrimination in violation of title vii.she subsequently dropped the national origin claim,and the district court addressed only the hostile work environment claim in its decision.the court held that the record showed arroyo to be a rude man that lacked courtesy and professionalism,but that the evidence was inadequate to prove a violation of title vii.concluding that rosario failed to prove that she was subjected to conduct sufficiently severe or abusive so as to constitute hostile work environment based on sex,the court granted summary judgment for defendants.this appeal followed.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo and may reverse the district court ruling if,after considering the facts and drawing all inferences in favor of the party,the evidence on record is sufficiently to permit a rational fact finder to resolve the issue in favor of either side.napier deesie,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we review the law relating to hostile work environment claims before considering its applicability to the evidence presented by rosario.
legal background 
title vii prohibition of discriminatory employment practices extends to sexual harassment in the form of a hostile or abusive work environment.lockridge,at.to prove a hostile work environment claim,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of the plaintiff employment and create an abusive work environment.id.quoting forrest brinker int l payroll,lp,cir see also harris,at.that environment must be both objectively and subjectively offensive,one that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive,and one that the victim in fact did perceive to be so.faragher city of boca raton,there is no precise formula for establishing sufficiently egregious conditions.pomales celulares telefónica,cir.
we examine all the attendant circumstances including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it was physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interfered with an employee work performance.
see also harris,at.subject to some policing at the outer bounds,it is for the jury to weigh those factors and decide whether the harassment was of a kind or to a degree that a reasonable person would have felt that it affected the conditions of her employment.marrero goya of,cir quoting gorski dep t of,cir.

rosario claim 
in defending the district court ruling in their favor,the defendants point to the supreme court assertion that simple teasing,offhand comments,and isolated incidents unless extremely serious do not amount to a hostile work environment.faragher,at quoting oncale,at.they contend that most of the comments and actions highlighted by rosario were intended to address the issue of appropriate office attire,and they emphasize that no witness stated that arroyo ever made any sexual advances toward rosario or said he was sexually interested in her.
even if arroyo alleged behaviors could reasonably be viewed as offhand comments or isolated episodes,some of which were motivated by legitimate workplace concerns,that view is certainly not the only one that could reasonably be drawn from the record.as described above,rosario allegation that she was subjected to constant harassment from arroyo over an extended period of time was substantiated by the testimony of multiple witnesses at the eeo hearing,including arroyo immediate supervisor,maldonado.the record contains evidence that,throughout a period,arroyo complained about rosario appearance on a daily basis,regularly drew the attention of her to her body and undergarments,shadowed her closely when she interacted with patients,challenged her decisions,mocked her when she spoke to him and,on occasion,described her as a street woman to other employees and criticized her to doctors and patients.
the validity of the primary justification offered for arroyo frequent interactions with undermined by maldonado,hernández and cournier testimony that they considered rosario clothing to be appropriate and by arroyo own testimony that he found no problem with her clothing after march.moreover,the conduct began when arroyo was rosario,rather than her he presumably had no authority to challenge her manner of dress.later,when he became her supervisor,he admitted that no dress code existed for civilian employees at the clinic,yet he continued to make an issue of her clothing.he initiated a counseling report in the fall of and was still questioning her attire the following spring.
although the sexually oriented jokes reported by cournier may not have amounted to much on their own and were of uncertain,rosario did not cite them in the report attached to her administrative nonetheless suggest a lack of respect by arroyo for his female colleagues,lending weight to the inference that his behavior toward rosario was inappropriately motivated by gender.that was not,however,the only evidence that his conduct was because of sex.a.maldonado testified that arroyo treated other females who worked at the clinic similarly,observing that h e just intimidate them.maldonado named private carter in particular and stated that arroyo drove her nuts.arroyo repeated conversations with others about rosario underwear and especially her panties as reported by hernández,as well as his references to her as a woman of the streets in conversations with maldonado and other guys,provides additional support for a finding that his behavior toward rosario was.
the defendants focus on the absence of evidence showing that arroyo was attracted to rosario is,as an initial matter,misdirected.h arrassing conduct need not be motivated by sexual desire to support an inference of discrimination on the basis of sex.oncale,at see also,at.moreover,while there is no direct evidence that arroyo was sexually interested in rosario,hernández testified that arroyo treatment of rosario prompted him to ask if arroyo had a crush on her.hernández said he explained to arroyo that that what it looks like.that it so personal that you just having a frustration about that woman.although other cases may present more explicit evidence of motivation,see,marrero,at noting humiliating sexual remarks and innuendos,such as the redhead is really hot and the redhead is on fire universidad metropolitana,cir noting that the head of the academic committee considering plaintiff promotion repeatedly asked her for dates and used suggestive language toward her,the record here contains ample circumstantial evidence for a jury to conclude that arroyo behavior was triggered by rosario gender.see eeoc nea,alaska,cir t here is no legal requirement that hostile acts be overtly sex or in content,whether marked by language,by sex or gender stereotypes,or by sexual overtures.
the fact that certain of the conduct appeared to have no connotation at example,throwing her food away and removing items from her not diminish the force of the evidence indicating animus.indeed,as we have noted,such acts may be added to the mix in assessing a hostile work environment claim,at noting the reality that incidents of conduct can in context contribute to a hostile work environment see also marrero,at.nor is rosario claim defeated by evidence that male employees experienced some of the same mistreatment by arroyo.the evidence does not show any male employee enduring arroyo criticism and offensive behaviors on virtually a daily basis for an extended period of time,as did rosario.the record as a whole would thus permit a reasonable jury to conclude that rosario was exposed to harassment that differed in both kind and degree from that imposed on male employees.see oncale,at the critical issue,title vii text indicates,is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which mem
