navy chaplains,like other navy officers,are recommended for promotion by selection boards consisting of superior officers who meet and discuss the relative merits of candidates for promotion.the federal statute establishing the procedures for such selection boards,which applies to all the armed services,provides that board proceedings may not be disclosed to any person not a member of the board,f,and board members take an oath of confidentiality to implement this requirement.certain current and former navy chaplains and their particular endorsing agency,the chaplaincy of full gospel churches cfgc,sued the navy,alleging that it discriminates against chaplains affiliated with the cfgc in,among other things,promotion decisions.the chaplains and the cfgc sought to compel the secretary of the navy to release selection board members from their oath of confidentiality,to allow them to testify about selection board proceedings leading to the challenged decisions.
the district court ruled that section f did not preclude disclosure of selection board proceedings through civil discovery,because congress had not expressly addressed the question of such discovery in providing that board proceedings may not be disclosed.the court accordingly ordered the secretary to release selection board members from their oath.we reverse and hold that section f bars the disclosure through civil discovery of promotion selection board proceedings.
background 
a.the history and organization of navy chaplains 
in november,the continental congress adopted the first regulations to govern the fledgling continental navy.see rules for the regulation of the navy of the united colonies of north america,reprinted in relevant part in clifford drury,the history of the chaplain corps,united states navy bureau of naval personnel.although those regulations did not expressly create a chaplain position,article provided that t he commanders of the ships of the thirteen united colonies,are to take care that divine service be performed twice a day on board,and a sermon preached on sundays,unless bad weather or other extraordinary accidents prevent.id.these duties often fell to the captain himself or a designee only two chaplains were known to have served in the continental navy during the revolutionary war,and the navy limited the number of chaplains on active duty to nine until and to from then until.drury,supra,at.
early chaplains were responsible for educating midshipmen and sailors in addition to their religious duties.the navy placed great emphasis on the chaplains role as teacher,selecting them more for their teaching ability than for their experience or training as ministers.id.at.indeed,the first naval academy was established years ago at the washington navy yard by chaplain robert thompson,who taught midshipmen mathematics and navigation.id.at.the success of that academy led to the establishment of the united states naval academy at annapolis,maryland in.
from those beginnings,the navy chaplain corps has grown with the service to over strong.it is the responsibility of navy chaplains to provide for the free exercise of religion for all members of the navy and marine corps,their dependents,and other authorized persons.directive,appointment of chaplains for the military services dep t of def,directive.the navy chaplain mission is to accommodate the religious needs of sailors and marines by providing religious services,counseling,and support.see marine corps warfighting publication,religious ministry support in the united states marine corps.in addition to this religious ministry,navy chaplains also provide ethics instruction and critical incident debriefings,and advise commanders on religious,moral,and ethical issues.id.at.
a navy chaplain role within the service is unique,involving simultaneous service as clergy or a professional representative of a particular religious denomination and as a commissioned naval officer.opnavinst,chaplains manual dep t of the navy.a chaplain must satisfy not only the normal physical and educational requirements to become a commissioned officer,but also must have a graduate level theology degree or equivalent and an ecclesiastical endorsement official notice from a faith group endorsing agency that a candidate is professionally qualified to represent that faith group within the military chaplaincy.chaplain candidate program officer handbook glossary see directive.ecclesiastical endorsement must be maintained throughout a chaplain career withdrawal of ecclesiastical endorsement at any point in a chaplain career could result in separation from the navy.directive.
the navy categorizes chaplains into four general religious categories or faith groups according to similarities in religious denominations roman catholic,liturgical protestant,protestant,and special worship.liturgical protestant primarily includes those protestant denominations that trace their origins to the protestant reformation and whose religious services are characterized by a set liturgy or order of worship,including the lutheran,episcopal,methodist,and presbyterian denominations.cfgc second am.compl.a cfgc compl.protestant refers to protestant denominations without a formal liturgy or order in their worship service whose clergy do not wear religious dress during services,comprising the baptist,evangelical,pentecostal,bible,and charismatic churches.id.b.the special worship category includes the christian orthodox,jewish,muslim,and mormon faiths.appellants br.at.
b.the personnel system 
the navy uses the same personnel system for all officers,including chaplains.that system seeks to manage officers careers to provide the navy with the best qualified personnel through three critical personnel decisions promotion continuation on active duty and selective early retirement.a naval officer must be recommended by a promotion selection board to advance in rank from lieutenant junior grade through rear admiral lower half.see a.continuation on active duty decisions occur when the needs of the navy require the selection of certain officers otherwise subject to discharge or retirement for failing to be promoted to the next rank to continue on active duty for an established period of time.see id.a,d.conversely,selective early retirement decisions generally involve the selection of officers in the grade of captain who were passed over for promotion two or more times for involuntary,early retirement.id.a.
each of these personnel decisions involves a selection board comprised of naval officers who deliberate,make selections,and then submit their recommendations to the secretary of the navy.promotion selection boards are convened under a continuation on active duty and selective early retirement boards are convened under b.selection boards must consist of five or more naval officers who must be serving in a grade higher than the grade of the officers under consideration by the board,except that no member of a board may be serving in a grade below lieutenant commander.a.at least one member of the board must be from the category being considered thus,if a selection board is considering chaplains,at least one board member must be a chaplain.see id.a a.
promotion selection boards may only consider an eligible officer official military personnel file and the selection board precept issued to the board by the secretary of the navy.see a,b.a precept is the secretary official guidance to the board,consisting of the maximum number of officers that the board may recommend for promotion,information or guidelines relating to the needs of the navy for officers having particular skills,and applicable guidelines from the secretary of defense.id.b.a promotion selection board considers these items and recommends those officers whom the board considers best qualified for promotion.id.a.
the promotion board reports its recommendations to the secretary,a,who takes action on the report in accordance with section.if the secretary determines that the board acted contrary to law or regulation or to guidelines furnished the board under section b,the secretary must return the board recommendations with a written explanation for further proceedings.id.a.the secretary otherwise reviews the board recommendations and adopts or modifies the list,and then forwards it to the president through the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the secretary of defense.see id.b,c.the president ultimately appoints recommended officers for promotion to the next rank,subject to confirmation by the senate for promotions above the rank of lieutenant junior grade.see id.
the other statutory selection boards continuation on active duty and selective early retirement are convened under section b and have somewhat different procedures.the secretary has final authority over these boards,and no presidential or senatorial action is involved.in addition,unlike the situation with promotion boards,there are no statutory guidelines that dictate what information other statutory selection boards may consider.
by statute,each member of a selection board must take an oath to perform his duties without prejudice or partiality and having in view both the special fitness of officers and the efficiency of the navy.as noted,members of promotion selection boards may not disclose the proceedings of the board to anyone not a member of the board,e xcept as authorized or required by section.id.f.navy regulations also require all selection board members to take an oath to not divulge the proceedings of this board except as authorized or required by the secretary of the navy or higher authority.mem.in support of mot.for an order requiring def.secretary of the navy to release personnel associated with chaplain promotion boards from their oath not to disclose promotion board proceedings,pls.mot,ex,oaths see also secnav instruction a,promotion and selective early retirement of commissioned officers on the active duty lists of the navy and marine corps f dep t of the navy,each member shall swear or affirm that he or she will not disclose the proceedings or recommendations of the board except as authorized or required by secnav or higher authority.
section f was enacted as part of the defense officer personnel management act dopma,stat.codified in scattered sections of.through dopma,congress sought to update the existing statutory framework for military promotions established by the officer personnel act of,stat,by eliminating the services individual promotion systems in favor of a single,permanent promotion system under a single,applicable statutory grade table and under laws that would be the same for each service,at.section f codified in a uniform manner the established practice in the individual services of barring the disclosure of selection board proceedings.see,brenner united states,the proceedings of selection boards are secret.navy sanders united states,en banc selection board proceedings are secret air force army regulation,promotion of officers on active duty.
procedural history 
plaintiffs current and former protestant chaplains and their endorsing agency,the chaplaincy of full gospel churches cfgc collectively chaplains filed two separate suits against the secretary of the navy,other navy officials,and the navy collectively navy,alleging that the navy has established,promoted,and maintained religious quotas and other discriminatory practices in the navy chaplain corps in violation of the first and fifth amendments.chaplaincy of full gospel churches johnson,cfgc see also adair england,d.the district court subsequently consolidated the cases for purposes of all pretrial motions.adair,d at.the chaplains allege that the navy discriminatory practices favor catholic and liturgical protestant chaplains to the detriment of protestant chaplains.see cfgc compl.
as pertinent here,the chaplains allege that the navy discriminates against chaplains endorsed by the cfgc through promotions and retention.see cfgc,at.the chaplains claim that this discrimination is manifested in the policies for and operation of promotion and other statutory selection boards,permitting religious bias and denominational issues criteria not related to career performance to interfere with the proper selection of the chaplains for advancement.adair class action first am.compl.adair compl.see cfgc,at.the chaplains allege that the navy provided promotion boards with each candidate religious denomination,cfgc compl.used religious quotas and denominational criteria for promotion and forced retirement selections,adair compl.denied promotions based upon ideological criteria,see and stacked promotion and other statutory selection boards with catholic and liturgical protestant chaplains,id.
the chaplains requested that the secretary release board members from their oath of confidentiality to allow them to testify the secretary declined to do so.the chaplains thereupon filed a motion to compel discovery of selection board proceedings,seeking to depose board members.see pls.mot.the navy argued that f barred disclosure of selection board deliberations.the district court disagreed and granted the chaplains motion,holding that b ecause section f does not contain specific language barring discovery,and because of the circuit emphasis on providing litigants full access to relevant information,the court concludes that section f does not create an absolute or qualified privilege barring discovery of proceedings.at.the navy filed an interlocutory appeal and a petition for mandamus,which we consolidated.
ii.appellate jurisdiction 
this court has appellate jurisdiction over final decisions of the district court.dsmc,convera.discovery orders are accordingly generally appealable only upon a final decision in the case,not on an interlocutory basis.mckesson islamic republic of iran.the navy nonetheless argues that we have interlocutory jurisdiction to hear its appeal under the collateral order doctrine.see cohen beneficial indus.loan.
the collateral order doctrine is best understood not as an exception to the final decision rule laid down by congress in,but as a practical construction of it.digital equip.desktop direct,d quoting cohen,at.at.the collateral order doctrine allows appeals from the small category of decisions that are conclusive,that resolve important questions separate from the merits,and that are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action.swint chambers county comm n,d see united states philip morris.
it is undisputed that the district court conclusively ordered the navy to release board members from their oaths not to disclose board proceedings.the district court considered and rejected all the navy arguments opposing the motion to compel,and,with respect to the question on appeal,concluded that section f does not create an absolute or qualified privilege barring discovery of proceedings.cfgc,at.the first requirement is satisfied.
to satisfy the second requirement under the collateral order doctrine,the navy must show that appellate review will resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action.philip morris,at emphases added.determining whether section f bars discovery in this case does not require this court to consider the merits of the chaplains constitutional claims the separability prong of the second requirement is clearly satisfied.
importance is a more subjective inquiry.the supreme court has explained that this inquiry requires a judgment about the value of the interests that would be lost through rigorous application of the final judgment requirement,and that important in cohen sense means being weightier than the societal interests advanced by ordinary operation of final judgment principles.digital,at.at.this court has explained that an issue is important under cohen if the interests that would potentially go unprotected without immediate appellate review of that issue are significant relative to the efficiency interests sought to be advanced by adherence to the final judgment rule.philip morris,at quoting in re ford motor,cir.
in philip morris,we analyzed whether the collateral order doctrine provided appellate jurisdiction to hear an interlocutory appeal challenging denial of an privilege claim.the court held that the privilege was important under cohen,concluding that the institutional benefits of allowing interlocutory review of privilege claims outweigh the costs of delay and piecemeal review that may result.philip morris,at.the court explained that the privilege encourage s full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and promotes broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice.id.quoting upjohn united states,d alteration in philip morris.those important institutional interests would be eviscerate d by an erroneous privilege ruling,underscoring the importance of interlocutory review.id.
the navy argues that section f similarly creates a privilege that protects the deliberations of military promotion boards from disclosure.according to the secretary of the navy,f ree,uninhibited,and candid deliberations by selection boards are vital to the effective functioning of the selection board process,and disclosure of board proceedings would severely undermine the ability of the navy to effectively operate its promotion and selective early retirement system.decl.of gordon england,england decl.the proper application of section f therefore implicates institutional interests in the proper administration of the armed forces.
the statutory nature of the claimed privilege also supports a finding of importance under cohen.in digital equipment,the supreme court suggested that w here statutory and constitutional rights are concerned,it is easier to conclude that they are weightier than the societal interests advanced by the ordinary operation of final judgment principles.at.at.we can not say that the importance of the interests assertedly protected by congress through section f should be subordinated to the general interest in avoiding litigation delay and piecemeal review.if it is correct about the critical nature of the protection from disclosure provided by section f,the navy should not lose the benefit of that protection prior to appellate review.
to satisfy the final requirement for invoking the collateral order doctrine,the appellant must show that the district court order will be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.philip morris,at.in philip morris,this court determined that a party claim of privilege would be effectively unreviewable because disclosure of privileged material would mak e the issue of privilege effectively moot on appeal.at.disclosure followed by appeal after final judgment is obviously not adequate in privilege cases the cat is out of the bag.in re papandreou.
so too here.the right at issue the navy claim of statutory privilege would be destroyed if board members were compelled to testify there would be no privilege to protect on appeal from final judgment.it would be impossible for this court to sort out and redress the harm caused by the incorrect disclosure.philip morris,at.
having found that this interlocutory appeal satisfies the cohen requirements,we hold that the collateral order doctrine provides appellate jurisdiction to review the district court order we now turn to the merits of the navy claim of statutory privilege.
iii.merits 
the federal rules of civil procedure encourage the exchange of information through broad discovery.federal rule of civil procedure b authorizes discovery regarding any matter,not privileged,that is relevant to the claim or defense of any party.the district court concluded that the selection board proceedings at issue in this case are relevant to the chaplains claims,and thus are discoverable under rule b.the navy argues,however,that section f creates a statutory privilege barring the disclosure of selection board proceedings.although the terms of a statute should be strictly construed to avoid a construction that would suppress otherwise competent evidence,regis paper united states,d,if there is a valid statutory privilege,then information may be withheld,even if relevant to the lawsuit and essential to the establishment of plaintiff claim.baldrige shapiro,d.
we begin with the plain language of the statute in question.it is well established that when the statute language is plain,the sole function of the courts at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd is to enforce it according to its terms.lamie united states,d quoting hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,d.section f provides,in full 
except as authorized or required by this section,proceedings of a selection board convened under section a of this title may not be disclosed to any person not a member of the board.
this is the language of command may not be disclosed in a context in which commands are expected to be obeyed.there is no inherent ambiguity in the phrase may not be disclosed that would justify departing from those plain terms pursuant to a exception.
that conclusion is fortified by the fact that congress provided an express exception to the otherwise categorical ban on disclosure.the opening clause of section f provides an exception for disclosures authorized or required by section itself.in other words,the drafters of section f wrote the ban on disclosure in such broad and absolute terms that they felt the need to specify that board proceedings could be disclosed in connection with the very reason you have them to submit recommendations to the secretary of a military department,the secretary of defense,and ultimately the president for action under section.
section also directs the secretary of a military department to review the board reports to determine whether the board has acted contrary to law or regulation or to guidelines furnished the board.a.a department of defense instruction accordingly permits the secretary of a military department to release board members from the confidentiality requirements if the integrity of the board proceedings has been affected by improper influence of senior military or civilian authority,misconduct by the board president or a member,or any other reason.instruction,commissioned officer promotion program procedures dep t of def,accord id.contrary to the chaplains contention,the fact that the secretary of the navy exercised this authority in connection with inspector general inquiries in and does not support implying an additional exception for civil discovery.the statute makes no provision for disclosure pursuant to the federal rules of civil procedure,even as it does for disclosure pursuant to section itself,and we are reluctant to imply an additional exception for that purpose.see consumer prod.safety comm gte sylvania,d declining to imply an exception to consumer product safety act restrictions on disclosure of accident reports for disclosures under foia i f congress had intended to exclude foia disclosures from the statutory restrictions it could easily have done so explicitly as it did with respect to the other listed exceptions we are consequently reluctant to conclude that congress failure to include foia requests within the exceptions was unintentional.when congress provides exceptions in a statute,it does not follow that courts have authority to create others.united states johnson,d see also detweiler pena,where a statute contains explicit exceptions,the courts are reluctant to find other implicit exceptions.
w here the terms of a statute are unambiguous,judicial inquiry is complete,adams fruit barrett,d,and resort to the more controversial realm of legislative history is unnecessary.lamie.at.we find it instructive,however,id.at,to note that such history as there is fully comports with our plain language reading,and that nothing in that history remotely suggests that congress intended an unexpressed exception to the ban on disclosure for civil discovery.
disclosure of selection board proceedings in civil discovery would certainly undermine,if not totally frustrate,the purpose of section f.as the secretary of the navy explained in his declaration,s election board members will be less likely to engage in frank and open discussion if such discussions will be open to public scrutiny.england.if board members knew that candidates passed over for promotion could gain access to board proceedings,that would clearly inhibit frank assessment of ca
