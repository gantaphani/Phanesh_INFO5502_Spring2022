background 
in,palmer and,ronald comer,filed an action against the city alleging that they were subjected to discrimination while they were employed by the city and suffered retaliation based on their complaints of discrimination.at that time,palmer and comer were both represented by attorneys mark tietig and lisa tietig.a case management and scheduling order was filed in december which set forth a discovery deadline of january and a trial date of may,and which set forth the dates and requirements regarding motions for summary judgment.
on january,tietig and tietig moved to withdraw as counsel for palmer following a hearing,the magistrate judge granted the motion to withdraw and ordered that palmer proceed pro se expeditiously,and shall be bound by the scheduling order.
on july,craig rappel filed a notice of appearance as palmer attorney.mark tietig,as counsel for comer,deposed several city employees on july,and the city deposed palmer on july.palmer,however,took no depositions.
in september,palmer,as a member of the florida army national guard,was ordered to report for active duty on october at fort gordon,georgia.in november,palmer attorney moved to sever his case from comer and to stay further proceedings for twelve months based on his active duty status.he amended the motion in december.at a motion hearing,palmer attorney argued that palmer was unable to assist in discovery or attend the trial due to his training commitments until june,at.the magistrate judge expressed his concerns as to whether palmer,as a member of the national guard,was covered by the act.he then denied the motions to sever and to stay proceedings without prejudice to refile if palmer attorney f ou nd some justification for him coming within that soldiers and sailors act.at.
the city moved for summary judgment on march.palmer response to the summary judgment motion and separate statement of facts as to any disputed facts were due on april.on march,palmer filed a second motion to stay because he had been unable to assist his counsel in discovery or able to appear at deposition of important and material witnesses and wa s unable to attend the scheduled trial on this matter unless he s ought a request to remove himself from active military duty.he attached documents showing that his request for leave to attend all proceedings related to this case was denied by the army.id.at exs.
on april,palmer filed a memorandum of law in opposition to the summary judgment motion.palmer attorney did not file a separate statement of facts,but explained that the majority of the facts on which he was relying were taken from palmer deposition.he said that palmer was unable to afford the transcription costs for the deposition and had instructed his attorney to refrain from holding depositions until he was present.id.at.
at a motions hearing,the magistrate judge said that he would consider small adjustments in the trial date if it were a problem with being in the military and i would consider a one month extension,but denied the request to extend discovery,reasoning that palmer had entered the military after filing the lawsuit,and had been provided a huge amount of time to conduct discovery.at.after finding that palmer active duty status had not materially affected his ability to prosecute the case,the magistrate judge denied the motion to stay proceedings for twelve months id.at.the magistrate judge advised that he would get an order out on the city motion for summary judgment as promptly as possible but that the parties should not wait for the order to file their pretrial stipulation and should prepare for the pretrial conference.at.
the pretrial conference was held on may.the magistrate judge commended the parties for the best set of stipulated facts that he had ever seen and apologized that he had not yet ruled on the city motion for summary judgment.at.the magistrate judge stated that he had found that a material issue of fact existed as to comer and had not reached a final decision yet as to palmer but hoped to have a written ruling tomorrow for everybody.id.at.palmer attorney advised that,as a result of the court denials of his motions to stay,palmer had been granted leave to be off base for the trial by his commander.id.at.
on may,the magistrate judge granted summary judgment against palmer and dismissed his federal claims with prejudice.he found that palmer had failed to adduce any record evidence to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact,even drawing all inferences from the verified complaint in palmer favor.it noted that,although palmer had relied on disputed facts from his deposition,the deposition was not filed and he offered no other evidence.summary judgment was thus granted in light of palmer complete failure to develop any discovery record despite a discovery period of almost two years and the court repeated invitation to propose alternatives to accommodate the demands of palmer military service.id.at.palmer appealed.his motions for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and for transcripts at government expense were granted.
on appeal,palmer argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his unopposed motion to stay proceedings under the act,and erred in granting the city motion for summary judgment based on his failure to file a statement of disputed facts.
ii.discussion 
motion to stay 
palmer maintains that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to stay proceedings because he submitted evidence showing that he would be materially affected because he was unable to personally attend the depositions of the law enforcement officers who he alleged had discriminated against him 
we review the grant or denial of a motion to stay under the soldiers and sailors civil relief act for abuse of discretion.boone lightner.the soldiers and sailors civil relief act of.provides 
at any stage thereof any action or proceeding in any court in which a person in military service is involved,either as plaintiff or defendant,during the period of such service or within sixty days thereafter shall,on application to it by such person or some person on his behalf,be stayed as provided in this act,unless,in the opinion of the court,the ability of plaintiff to prosecute the action is not materially affected by reason of his military service.
id.a district court must,therefore,determine whether the ability of the party in military service to prosecute his case is materially affected by his service and may properly deny the stay if the party will not be materially prejudiced.boone,at.at.the court is to consider all the circumstances of the case in making this determination.tabor miller,cir.the court may consider evidence of whether the party seeking the stay and his counsel have acted with diligence.boone,at.at.where the record shows that the military party is represented by competent counsel,and fully advised as to the facts involved in the litigation long before the date of court proceedings,a court does not abuse its discretion in denying a motion to stay under the act.gross williams,cir.
based on the record in this case,we find that the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion by denying the motion to stay under the act.after the case management order was entered,palmer had thirteen months to conduct discovery.at the time when his initial attorney was permitted to withdraw,palmer had twelve months to conduct discovery and was reminded that he was bound by the scheduling order.palmer retained counsel six months later.although palmer deposition was taken by the city and several city employees depositions were taken by his,palmer made no attempt at discovery.palmer did not enter active duty for another two months in his second motion for a stay,palmer failed to address whether alternative means of conducting discovery,such as telephone depositions or written interrogatories,were avai
