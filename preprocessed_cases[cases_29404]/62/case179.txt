one would guess that the chances are pretty slim that the work of a century french poet would find its way into a chicago courtroom in.but that the situation in this case as we try to make sense out of what has been dubbed the cat paw theory.the term derives from the fable the monkey and the cat penned by jean de la fontaine.in the tale,a rather persuades an unsuspecting feline to snatch chestnuts from a fire.the cat burns her paw in the process while the monkey profits,gulping down the chestnuts one by one.as understood today,a cat paw is a tool or one used by another to accomplish his purposes.webster third new international dictionary.more on this a little later.
vincent staub sued the proctor hospital of peoria,illinois,under the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act userra,et,after he was discharged from his position as an angiography technologist.an army reservist,staub alleged that the reasons,shirking,and attitude just a pretext for discrimination based on his association with the military.a jury sided with staub,and the district court denied proctor renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial.on appeal,proctor argues that the court gave a faulty instruction regarding the cat paw theory and,in connection with that error,improperly admitted evidence of animus by nondecisionmakers.the cat paw theory,which we will discuss later in more detail,is a way of proving discrimination when the decisionmaker herself is admittedly unbiased under the theory,the discriminatory animus of a nondecisionmaker is imputed to the decisionmaker where the former has singular influence over the latter and uses that influence to cause the adverse employment action.brewer board of trustees of university of illinois,cir.in addition to attacking the way the district court handled this theory,proctor says the evidence was insufficient to support a verdict under it.staub contests these arguments,but he also says the premise is flawed.we need not analyze this as a cat paw case,staub claims,because there was evidence that there were two decisionmakers,one of whom was clearly prejudiced.we start with the facts viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict.
staub was a veteran member of the united states army reserve.like all reservists,he was a soldier,spending the bulk of his hours in the civilian world.for staub,that meant employment as an angio tech for proctor.balancing work and military duties can be a complicated task,but staub apparently managed.for a while,at least.in late,some years after he was hired,things began to grow a little tense 
it was around that time that janice mulally,second in command of the diagnostic imaging department,began to prepare the department work schedules.staub would notify mulally of his drill and training obligations,which occupied one weekend per month and two weeks during the summer.before mulally took over scheduling,staub had weekends off.but mulally placed staub back in the weekend rotation,creating conflicts with his drill schedule.mulally did this even though she had advance notice of staub military obligations,and when staub approached her about the issue she became agitated.beginning in,the scheduling conflicts were only occasional,but mulally attitude reflected a deeper problem.mulally responded to staub questions by throwing him out of her office and saying she did want to deal with it.staub found some relief by going to department head michael korenchuk,yet it was far from complete.sometimes mulally would change staub schedule after korenchuk spoke with her,but other times she would post a notice on the bulletin board stating that volunteers were needed to cover the drill weekends,portraying staub as irresponsible.and occasionally mulally made staub use his vacation time for drill days or scheduled him for additional shifts without notice.mulally made her reasons plain she called staub military duties bullshit and said the extra shifts were his way of paying back the department for everyone else having to bend over backwards to cover his schedule for the reserves.and it came as no surprise that korenchuk did little to remedy the situation.although korenchuk only commented about staub reserve duties on a couple different occasions,these comments were none too subtle.korenchuk characterized drill weekends as army reserve bullshit and a b u nch of smoking and joking and a waste of taxpayers money.
bad as that was,things became worse in.in february of that year,staub was called to active duty for a period of up to one year.though unforeseen circumstances cut the tour short at the mark,staub return home was less than pleasant.korenchuk told one of staub coworkers,amy knoerle,that mulally was out to get staub.knoerle was at a loss because she saw nothing in staub but a hard worker and team player.however,she noticed that whenever staub approached mulally about drill obligations,mulally would roll her eyes and make sighing noises.
knoerle left her post in july of,to be replaced by leslie sweborg.two weeks into the job,sweborg met mulally and another coworker,angie day,for drinks after work.expecting nothing more than casual,sweborg was shocked when the conversation turned to staub.mulally was blunt she said that staub military duty had been a strain on the department and she did not like him as an employee.so mulally asked sweborg to help her get rid of him.sweborg refused.in her opinion,staub was always competent and professional,and there was no reason for such animosity.
day,on the other hand,shared mulally dislike of staub.in a departmental meeting on december,day said staub failed to train her properly and always seemed to disappear when help was needed.sweborg defended he was a solid trainer and just as available as any other tech in the department but mulally shot her down.mulally told sweborg she did know what she was talking about.
in any case,the tide was turning against staub,and his military obligations were at least peripherally involved.on january,staub received an order to report for soldier readiness processing,a precursor to another round of active deployment.staub gave a copy of the order to both korenchuk and mulally,and korenchuk became apprehensive.he asked staub several times per week when he would have to ship out.day had resigned by this point,leaving sweborg and staub as the only two angio techs.if staub went on active duty,korenchuk would have to use,placing strain on the department budget.
one might think this enhanced staub job security,but not so.on january,mulally gave staub a written warning accusing him of shirking his duties.a bit of background information is necessary to understand what staub allegedly failed to do,because it bore no connection to angiography.the diagnostic imaging department headed by korenchuk was divided into two units one unit for angiography,and a far larger unit for traditional diagnostic imaging services like radiology,mammography,ultra sounds,cat scans,and mris.though they normally stuck to their speciality,angio techs were trained to work in both units and therefore had the ability to help out with radiology and the like when the need arose and the circumstances permitted.according to mulally,however,staub did respect that arrangement.
on the morning of january,a worker from general diagnostics called mulally to see if any of the angio techs were free to help out.mulally in turn called sweborg and asked if she and staub had any patients.sweborg said they did and,according to mulally,later admitted they were completely free from to nevertheless,sweborg and staub failed to lend a hand.mulally therefore issued staub a written received one the next that he had already been warned about this behavior several times.but staub and sweborg dispute all that.they say they had an angio patient at,and although that case was ultimately cancelled by the doctor,they learned of the cancellation only minutes prior to the call for help in general diagnostics,to which they immediately responded.further,according to sweborg and staub,they had never before been instructed to report automatically to general diagnostics if they did not have angio cases.staub thus refused to sign the warning,and he asked korenchuk who approved the action why he was being targeted.korenchuk said mulally had all of the pertinent facts,and he just signed the warning to get her off of his back.so the warning stood,and so did its instructions for the future.going forward,staub was to report to mike korenchuk or jan mulally when he ha d no patients and the angio cases we re complete d.he would also remain in the general diagnostic area unless he specified to mike or jan where and why he would go elsewhere.
this discipline of staub emboldened mulally.shortly afterwards she called staub reserve unit administrator,joseph abbidini,in bartonville,illinois.mulally had called abbidini on a prior occasion to confirm that staub was actually a member of the reserves,but now she wanted to know if staub could be excused from some of his military duties.mulally asked abbidini if staub really had to attend training in the summer because he was needed at work.abbidini stated that the training was mandatory.most reserve members have outside employment,he explained,so excusing staub would set an ugly precedent.mulally response she called abbadini an asshole and hung up.again,we add that we are,as we are required to do at this stage of the proceedings,taking all facts in the light most favorable to staub.
after all this,there can be little dispute that mulally did like staub,and that part of this animus flowed from his membership in the military.but it was day beef with mulally that would ultimately get the ball rolling towards termination.on april,day had a meeting with korenchuk,linda buck of human resources,and garrett mcgowan chief operating officer.day was upset with korenchuk because she complained to him about staub and he did nothing in response.day said she had difficulty working with staub,he would absent himself from the department,and he tended to be abrupt.after day left the room,korenchuk,buck,and mcgowan discussed what they should do.this was the first time mcgowan had heard about availability problems involving staub,so he told korenchuk to work with buck to create a plan that would solve the issue.they never found time to do ran into trouble again and was fired three weeks later on april 
the day of reckoning started out normally enough.staub and sweborg worked together in the angio department all morning,finishing up around lunchtime.hungry,yet mindful of the prior warning,staub walked to korenchuk office to tell him that he and sweborg were going to lunch.but korenchuk was there.so staub walked back to the angio suite,placed a call to korenchuk office,and left a voice mail informing him they were off to the cafeteria.staub and sweborg returned minutes later and went to work on some leftover filming.korenchuk showed up a few moments afterwards,demanding to know where they had been.he said he was looking all over for staub,and staub they were only at lunch and left a voice him little.korenchuk escorted staub down to buck office in human resources,picking up a security guard along the way.korenchuk had met with buck earlier in the her that staub failed to report in as instructed and could be the decision to terminate was already made.as staub walked into the room,buck handed him his pink slip.the guard then escorted him off the grounds.sweborg was not disciplined,though she resigned a few days later out of disgust.
according to the written notice,staub was discharged for failing to heed the earlier warning instructing him to report to korenchuk whenever he had no more work in the angio department and otherwise to remain in the general diagnostics area.without the january,day april complaint,and the event on april of which involved unavailability or disappearances buck said she would not have fired staub.buck testimony makes it clear that although she relied on korenchuk input,the ultimate decision was hers.korenchuk reluctantly agreed with her decision,but it was her call to make.
beyond consulting korenchuk and reviewing the more recent incidents,buck relied on past issues with staub in making her decision.she said she heard frequent complaints about staub during her first year with proctor.and she knew of two workers who resigned because of staub in an angio tech quit because staub made her feel like gum on the bottom of his shoe,and a registered nurse gave up for similar reasons.what more,a recruiter told buck she had difficulty attracting workers to angio because staub had a reputation.among other things,he was known for flirting with medical students.
admittedly,however,buck failed to speak with other angio techs who worked with staub,including sweborg,and she had no idea that mulally and day wanted staub fired.but buck did review staub employee file,including the good like his most recent annual evaluation and the bad like the january.
staub filed a grievance following the termination.staub insisted that the january the command he allegedly fabricated by mulally to get him in trouble.buck did not follow up with mulally about this she did discuss it with another human resources she did not investigate staub contention that mulally was out to get him because he was in the reserves.instead,buck stuck with her initial assessment staub,despite technical competency,did work well with others and deserved to be fired for insubordination.staub involvement with the military played no role in her analysis.
against this backdrop,staub faced an uphill battle in his userra discrimination suit.like other employment discrimination legislation,userra prohibits adverse action based on a prohibited criterion,in this case military status.a,c.but also as with other discrimination legislation,a plaintiff suing under userra does not win by showing prohibited animus by just anyone.he must show that the decisionmaker harbored animus and relied on that animus in choosing to take action.since buck was the decisionmaker and there was no evidence she had a problem with staub on account of his membership in the reserves,staub was out of luck under the traditional rubric.but that does mean he had no case at all.
deploying the cat paw theory,staub sought to attribute mulally animus to buck,and therefore to proctor.he posited that mulally fed false information to buck,that he dodged work on january,that mulally was motivated to do this because he was a member of the army reserves and that buck relied on this false information without vetting it any meaningful way in deciding to fire him.the case made it to trial on this theory,where the jury apparently found it convincing,returning a verdict in staub favor.pursuant to the parties stipulation,staub was awarded in damages.the court then denied proctor renewed motion for a new trial or judgment as a matter of law.
proctor argues on appeal that the district court mishandled the cat paw theory both in terms of instructing the jury and admitting certain evidence,and also that the evidence was insufficient.before reaching those arguments,however,we must address staub invitation to review this not as a cat paw case,but as a traditional discrimination suit.staub attempts to skirt the cat paw analysis by arguing that buck was not the only.staub says buck shared that responsibility with korenchuk,who admittedly made some remarks.if that were the case,it would not matter whether buck acted as the cat paw,because the jury could find that a decisionmaker himself was biased.see c lewis city of chicago,cir maxfield cintas,cir.the problem with this theory is neither its logic nor even its lack of record support though that doubtful as well.rather,the problem is that staub failed to present this theory below,so it is waived on appeal.see mote aetna life ins,cir.even if the evidence did support this new theory,we would be disinclined to assume the jury entertained it because staub presented his case only as a cat paw matter.see united states ienco,cir w hen there is reason to doubt that the jury even considered the only proper theory under which the defendant can be convicted,the verdict can not be upheld merely because we are confident that the jury would have convicted had it considered tha
