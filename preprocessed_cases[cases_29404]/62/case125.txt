in this case,the united kingdom secretary of state for defence,as represented by united kingdom ministry of defence,defence procurement agency uk mod filed this action in federal district court against trimble navigation limited trimble.uk mod alleged that it was a beneficiary of certain procurement contracts between trimble and the united states government and that trimble breached those contracts.the district court dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction,concluding that although uk mod was not a party to the procurement contracts,its claims nonetheless fell within the scope of the cda.uk mod appeals.
as we explain below,we conclude that while the cda applies to disputes involving procurement contracts,its reach is limited to claims by the government against a contractor,or by a contractor against the government.therefore,although uk mod claims relate to a procurement contract,this particular action does not fall within the scope of the cda.accordingly,we reverse the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings 
sales of certain military goods and services to foreign governments are authorized by the arms export control act aeca,west.one of the ways that such a sale can be consummated is through a procurement for cash sale the foreign government pays the united states government in advance,the united states government enters into a contract with the supplier,and the supplier provides the goods to the foreign government.this case involves a dispute arising from just such a transaction.
the navstar gps is a,satellite system designed and deployed by the united states department of defense dod that provides users with worldwide,positioning,velocity,and precise time data.see united states navy,navstar gps,available at last visited may.the united kingdom and fourteen other north atlantic treaty organization nations entered into a memorandum of understanding that permits them to use the gps system.the memorandum of understanding requires foreign governments to buy certain equipment,including the auxiliary output chips at issue here,through the foreign military sales program and a letter of offer and acceptance.the memorandum of understanding informs participating nations that t he general conditions of the letter of offer and acceptance will not be negotiable.
in a july letter of offer and acceptance,dod agreed to procure and furnish on a basis for uk mod more than auxiliary output chips manufactured by trimble,an approved company,and dod entered into four contracts with trimble the contracts.the contracts were subject to the cda,which by operation of law applies to every federal procurement contract.see a t his chapter applies to any contract entered into by an executive agency for the procurement of property.
the first chips were delivered to uk mod in early.according to uk mod,approximately percent of the auxiliary output chips initially delivered by trimble did not conform to the applicable military specifications or standards and were returned for repair or replacement.trimble repaired or replaced the chips,but uk mod found that twenty percent of the repaired or replaced chips were still defective.problems with the chips persisted throughout and.the problems caused delays in a uk mod cruise missile program and led to significantly increased costs on the part of uk mod.
uk mod looked to the united states for assistance in recovering its costs from trimble.the united states air force investigated uk mod claim,including a review of the chronology of events and the burden of proof required to hold trimble liable on various causes of action.in january,dod released the air force legal opinion concurred in by the air force general counsel explaining that it could not recommend any action against trimble.the air force opinion stated that w hile this may not be the answer that uk mod wanted,please be assured of the united states continued commitment that the defense security cooperation agency will fully monitor this issue to ensure quality gondola auxiliary output chips are delivered.
uk mod then brought this breach of contract action against trimble in federal district court,asserting diversity jurisdiction under a.uk mod alleged that trimble breached the contracts by manufacturing defective auxiliary output chips and that trimble breach harmed uk mod,a beneficiary of the contracts.trimble moved to dismiss uk mod complaint.the district court granted trimble motion,finding that the contract disputes act divested the court of jurisdiction over the dispute 
uk mod appeals from the district court order,arguing that,as a matter of law,the cda does not apply to its claims against trimble.uk mod contends the cda applies only to disputes between the government and its contractors and not to beneficiary suits brought by a foreign government against a contractor such as trimble.
district courts have jurisdiction over controversies between a foreign state,defined in section a of this title,as plaintiff and citizens of a state or of different states,so long as the amount in controversy exceeds a west.thus,the district court clearly has jurisdiction over this case,unless the cda applies so as to oust the court jurisdiction.this jurisdictional question presents a legal issue that we review de novo.see tillman resolution trust,cir.
subject to certain exceptions not relevant here,the cda applies to any express or implied contract entered into by an executive agency for the procurement of property.a.because the contracts were entered into by an executive agency and involve the procurement of property,the contracts are subject to the cda,a conclusion that no party disputes.there is likewise no dispute that uk mod claims against trimble relate to the mod claims that trimble breached the procurement contracts that the united states government entered into to provide uk mod with the auxiliary output chips it needed and that,as a beneficiary of those contracts,uk mod is entitled to bring this action against trimble.the question presented by this case,however,is whether a claim made by a beneficiary that is related to a procurement contract must be resolved under the procedures established by the cda.in our view,the language and framework of the cda require us to answer that question in the negative.see united states bank of or.indep.ins.agents of,d explaining that traditional principles of statutory construction require us to account for a statute full text gracey int l of workers,local union,cir a court must endeavor to see a statute whole,not to construe statutory sections or phrases in isolation.
although the cda applies to all procurement contracts,it is clear from the structure of the act that its comprehensive scheme for resolving disputes applies only to claims by the government against a contractor or by a contractor against the government.j e salvage,at.section sets forth the steps to initiate a claim and provides only for the processing of claims by a contractor against the government relating to a contract,and for the processing of claims by the government against a contractor relating to a contract.a west supp emphasis added there is no language in section explaining how claims by someone other than the government or a contractor can be processed under the cda.indeed,the cda specifically limits the definition of a contractor to a party to a government contract other than the
