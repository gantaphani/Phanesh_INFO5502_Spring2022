brian petty appeals the district court summary judgment and judgment on partial findings in favor of metropolitan government of county metro on claims that metro violated his rights under the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act of userra.because the district court erred in its application of and,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment for metro on two claims asserted under these provisions,and order that summary judgment be entered in favor of petty on those claims.further,because the district court made errors of both fact and law in its judgment on partial findings under,we vacate that judgment.
background 
the central dispute in this case is whether metro violated userra in its treatment of petty,a former police officer who left the department for active duty with the united states army and who sought reemployment with the department after completion of his military service.there are few,if any,disputes regarding the factual background as described by the district court in its order granting summary judgment for metro 
the parties agree to the following facts plaintiff joined the army national guard in and opted into the army reserve with the army national guard as his reserve component in.the defendant hired the plaintiff as a police officer on february.in,metro assigned the plaintiff to patrol the west sector of nashville,where plaintiff focused on crime prevention in housing projects.metro promoted the plaintiff to the rank of sergeant in january,whereupon he started supervising other officers in the south sector.after various reassignments,plaintiff returned to patrolling the west sector in the fall of,where he continued supervising other officers.
all metro police officers must get approval for work,and the plaintiff sought and received metro approval to work as a security guard at the south street and bound ry restaurants prior to his deployment.
plaintiff remained in the army reserve through.in october of,the army called plaintiff at work to tell him that he was being transferred to another unit to take command as they were being mobilized for service in operation iraqi freedom.plaintiff told his lieutenant at metro,kim dillingham,of his upcoming military leave the same day that the army informed him.the week after the army contacted him,the plaintiff took his first trip to chattanooga to begin preparations for deployment,and he stopped working at metro altogether on november.
on january,the unit plaintiff commanded had its official mobilization ceremony.the next day the unit left for fort stewart,georgia.the unit was in fort stewart until roughly february,when it was transferred to camp sky oasis in kuwait.
the army assigned the plaintiff to run the mayor cell at camp navistar.plaintiff unit ran the camp on a supplies setting out bottled water for soldiers handling any problems with housing.the job also required plaintiff to empty and store contraband from amnesty boxes.
in june or july,command sergeant thomas seuberling conducted a health and welfare inspection of plaintiff quarters.during the initial inspection,csm seuberling found a jerry can which looks like a gas can that plaintiff was using to manufacture homemade wine 
plaintiff claims that he had alcohol in his tent because csm seuberling asked him to obtain alcohol.specifically,plaintiff claims that csm seuberling told him that he was negotiating with a kuwaiti farmer to get him to cut down some trees that were blocking the camp guard towers,and that the farmer would cut down the trees if he could get him some alcohol.
based upon csm seuberling health and welfare inspection,and the resulting investigation,plaintiff was charged with a violation of the military code of justice.specifically,plaintiff was charged with violation of a lawful order and conduct unbecoming an officer.with regard to the first charge,plaintiff was accused of violating central command general order,in that he was in possession of,and manufactured,alcohol.by plaintiff own admission,he was in possession of,and was manufacturing,alcohol.plaintiff testified in his deposition that his intent in manufacturing wine in his tent was mainly to use it as an incentive for the farmer to clear trees,but he acknowledged that he may have used the wine for his own consumption eventually.plaintiff also admits receiving bottles of alcohol while in kuwait,and using them for personal consumption.
with respect to the conduct unbecoming an officer charge,plaintiff was accused of offering alcohol to enlisted soldiers.by plaintiff own admission,he gave alcohol to a female enlisted soldier,sergeant melanie barnhart.furthermore,by plaintiff own admission,he and sergeant barnhart drank together.plaintiff knew that giving alcohol to a soldier was a violation of general order.nevertheless,plaintiff gave alcohol to sergeant barnhart anyway,and he drank with her.
in late,plaintiff appeared in front of a military judge,where he was arraigned.in lieu of going forward with court martial proceedings,plaintiff submitted a request to resign his commission for the good of the service.when plaintiff submitted his request to resign for the good of the service,the army relieved him of his command,meaning that he was relieved of his supervisory responsibilities.plaintiff was notified on january,that his resignation for the good of the service had been approved.the army formally dismissed all charges against him in january.
when he left active duty,plaintiff received two versions of his department of defense form.one focuses on awards,commendations,and service dates,but does not include the character of service.the other includes the character of service.
plaintiff discharge was characterized as under honorable conditions general.the army returned plaintiff to fort stewart,georgia on or about february.
plaintiff visited metro to request reinstatement on february.the police department has a process for officers who have been away from the police department for an extended period of time.this process applies to all officers who have been away from the police department for an extended period of time,regardless of the reason for their separation.the police department process includes a personal history update questionnaire,a medical examination,a computer voice stress analysis,a drug screening,and a debriefing with a police department psychologist.in addition,the police department requests that returning officers execute a medical records authorization,and for individuals returning from military duty,an authorization to obtain military records.the purpose of the police department process is to ensure that every individual entrusted with the responsibility of being a metropolitan police officer is still physically,emotionally,and temperamentally qualified to be a police officer after having being absent from the department.
one of the questions on the personal history questionnaire plaintiff filled out during the process asked during your absence were you arrested,charged,detained,or a suspect in any criminal action or military disciplinary action for any reason or do you have any action pending if yes,explain in detail use back if necessary.plaintiff answered yes.he also attached a narrative explanation of his response in which he admitted facing military charges in kuwait.the narrative description did not disclose that plaintiff was accused of giving alcohol to an enlisted soldier and that plaintiff was accused of manufacturing alcohol.
plaintiff did not receive any salary or benefits for the period of examination between february,and march.
on march,defendant returned the plaintiff to work.defendant did not,however,return the plaintiff to his original position of patrol sergeant,or a substantially similar position.plaintiff contends that he was assigned to an office job in which he primarily answered telephone calls from the public.defendant states that plaintiff has also taken police reports,which is a duty that must be performed by a sworn police officer.
the metropolitan police department office of professional accountability opa serves the internal affairs function of the metropolitan police department.opa initiated an investigation focused on whether plaintiff was honest and truthful when he completed paperwork after returning from military service the police department action grid indicates that the department has a zero tolerance for dishonesty.
on april,metro issued a notice of complaint to plaintiff outlining these charges.on may,lieutenant gordon howey met with plaintiff to discuss the charges against him.based upon the results of this meeting,lieutenant howey prepared a report concluding that the allegation that plaintiff was not truthful when he completed paperwork was unfounded.lieutenant howey signed this report on may.on may,kennetha sawyers,the director of opa,signed lieutenant howey report.chief of police ronal serpas accepted howey conclusions,and the director of opa,kennetha sawyers,closed the investigation into plaintiff on july.additionally,on july,sawyers sent plaintiff a letter stating that opa had completed its investigation and determined that the charges against him were unfounded.
also,on july,metro informed plaintiff that the peace officer standards training post commission,which certifies metro police officers,did not accept his discharge.at that time,a police department employee named calvin hullett served as the post commission chairman.metro specifically did not request a waiver for plaintiff from the post commission.
after sending plaintiff the july,letter,sawyers states that she continued to be troubled by the disconnect between plaintiff description of the events leading to his discharge,and the severity of his punishment.accordingly,in sawyers contacted a representative from the army to request additional documents and information from plaintiff file.during this conversation,sawyers discovered that the plaintiff submitted to the metropolitan government appeared to have been altered.plaintiff contends that the difference between the official copy and the one he submitted to metro does not constitute an alteration.based upon this new information,sawyers requested a copy of plaintiff from the tennessee department of veteran affairs.
on september,georgia norman,chief of war records,sent opa a copy of plaintiff via facsimile.the form submitted by the plaintiff to metro omitted a few boxes at the bottom,including box,which listed plaintiff narrative reason for separation as in lieu of trial by court martial.the form also omitted blocks and.
during his deposition testimony and in response to defendant requests for admission,plaintiff admitted that he did not provide a complete copy of his to metro.each contains the following language in the top right hand corner any alterations in shaded areas render form void.box of the is a shaded area.during his deposition,plaintiff testified that when he copied his,the copy was enlarged,which cut off boxes,and.he testified that he did not intentionally enlarge the form.later in the deposition,plaintiff said he could not remember if he intentionally removed boxes,and.in his response to a request for admission,however,plaintiff stated that he caused the form to be enlarged on a copying machine thinking that the relevant portion of that document would be more readable to the defendant.
metro contends that this new information received by sawyers led to opa second investigation into plaintiff conduct,which focuses on whether plaintiff intentionally altered the he provided to the metropolitan government.plaintiff contends that the actual reason for the second investigation was to retaliate against the plaintiff for filing this lawsuit.when sawyers conducted the research that lead to opa second investigation of plaintiff conduct,plaintiff had not filed a lawsuit,and sawyers was not aware that he was contemplating filing a lawsuit.plaintiff points out that sawyers research ended five days before he filed suit,on september,and that sawyers knew about the lawsuit before metro filed its second notice of complaint against the plaintiff on october.plaintiff told superiors that he was contemplating a lawsuit months before he filed it.
since approximately october,defendant has assigned plaintiff to the central station bubble,where he has continued answering telephone calls from the public.traditionally,metro staffs the bubble with officers facing discipline or who are otherwise disempowered.
on december,plaintiff requested metro permission to return to his security jobs at south street and bound ry.metro denied plaintiff request for employment.
petty metro.gov t of,wl at,dist.lexis at,internal citations omitted footnotes in original.pertinent to this appeal,petty complaint alleged that metro violated his rights under userra in that metro delayed rehiring him for the purpose of subjecting him to the department process metro did not properly rehire him because he was not placed in the position to which he was entitled and metro impermissibly denied him the ability to work security jobs.these claims were asserted as violations of the reemployment provisions of userra,and the antidiscrimination provision of the act.both parties moved for summary judgment.petty motion was denied,and the district court granted metro motion on all claims except those arising from the denial of petty request for work.the work claims proceeded to a bench trial,at the conclusion of which the district court entered a judgment on partial findings in favor of metro.petty now appeals.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,using the same standard applied by the district court.williams mehra,cir en banc.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we must review all the evidence,facts,and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.to withstand summary judgment,the nonmoving party must present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact.daniels woodside,cir.a mere scintilla of evidence is insufficient there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the.id.at quoting anderson liberty lobby,d.summary judgment is appropriately entered against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case,and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.celotex catrett,d.where the law and record makes it appropriate,we may not only reverse the district court entry of summary judgment,but we may instruct the district court to enter summary judgment against the previously victorious party.see,daniels,at.
a different standard is applied to the entry of a judgment on partial findings.the district court is not required to draw any special inferences,and it is permitted to weigh the evidence and resolve any conflicts therein.int l union of operating eng rs,local union indiana constr,cir.on appeal,we review legal determinations de novo and the relevant findings of fact for clear error.sharp ex rel.estate of sharp united states,cir.
iii.structure of userra 
statutory protection of job security for armed services members has a long history,dating back to the selective training and service act of.userra is the latest iteration of these protections,and was enacted in part as a result of congress finding that existing veteran right statutes were overly complex and ambiguous,leaving veterans and employers confused as to their rights and responsibilities.francis booz,allen hamilton,cir quoting lapine town of wellesley.congress thus sought to clarify,simplify,and where necessary,strengthen the existing veterans employment and reemployment rights provisions.id.courts have recognized that b ecause userra was enacted to protect the rights of veterans and members of the uniformed services,it must be broadly construed in favor of its military beneficiaries.francis,at alteration in original.relevant case law is properly considered as a guide to interpreting userra.id.
for the purposes of this case,userra performs four key functions.first,it guarantees returning veterans a right of reemployment after military service.second,it prescribes the position to which such veterans are entitled upon their return.third,it prevents employers from discriminating against returning veterans on account of their military service.fourth,it prevents employers from firing without cause any returning veterans within one year of reemployment.
at times,the interplay among these provisions has caused some confusion.compare curby archon,cir stating that to recover for a reemployment violation under,a plaintiff also must show discrimination under with wrigglesworth brumbaugh,d,concluding that recovery under is separate from and not in any way dependent upon.we find helpful the eighth circuit description of the relationship among the provisions at issue in this case 
section protects service members at the instant of seeking reemployment,entitling the service member to reemployment in either the position she would have been in had she not left for military service or a position of like seniority,status and pay,the duties of which the person is qualified to perform.a a defining rights set forth in,which entitles a person to be rehired upon return from military service.section applies after reemployment has occurred and prohibits discrimination with respect to any benefit of employment against persons who serve in the armed services after they return from a deployment and are reemployed.francis booz,allen hamilton,cir noting that protects military members up to the instant of reemployment while other sections of userra,such as and,protect the member after reemployment occurs.
clegg.dep t of,cir.we will use this understanding of userra to examine petty claims.
iv.reemployment claims 
as it pertains to this case,userra right to reemployment encompasses two guarantees that are embodied in and.section sets forth the basic right of a returning veteran to be rehired by his past employer and the basic prerequisites that the veteran must meet in order to enjoy that right.section sets forth the position of employment to which the returning veteran must be rehired and requires that the veteran be promptly reemployed in that position.as briefly discussed above,petty alleges that metro violated his reemployment rights by impermissibly delaying his rehiring due to the department process failing to rehire him in the position to which he was entitled and impermissibly denying him permission to work security jobs.we find that petty is entitled to summary judgment with respect to his first two claims the third,which we will analyze separately,is not properly asserted as a reemployment claim under and.
petty first two in rehiring and failure to hire at proper position 
congress has clearly prescribed the prerequisites petty was required to satisfy to qualify for userra reemployment protection.first,he was required to notify his employer in advance of his departure that he would be leaving for military service.a.second,the cumulative length of such military service must be less than years.a.third,upon his return,he was required to request reemployment from metro within the time frame outlined in e and with the documentation specified by f.fourth,his separation from service must have been under honorable conditions.metro contends only that petty failed to provide the documentation requirements of f,which provides that upon the request of the employer,the returning veteran shall provide documentation establishing that he has satisfied these four prerequisites.
in,the department of labor lists documents that satisfy the documentation requirements of.among those listed is a form,which metro concedes petty provided.but metro argues that petty is not sufficient,because the copy of the form that petty sent metro did not include three fields at the bottom of the notably one including the statement narrative reason for separation in lieu of trial by.furthermore,metro argues,the was void because the failure to include all fields constituted an alteration voiding the form.petty counters that his included all the information necessary under the documentation requirements of f.
we conclude that it would be inconsistent with the goals of userra to prevent petty from exercising his right to reemployment because he failed to provide forthrightly information that is statutorily unnecessary to his establishing the right in the first place.first,a expressly recognizes that the types of documentation necessary to establish eligibility for reemployment may vary from case to case.the focus of userra is on securing rights to returning veterans,not on ensuring that any particular documentation is produced.second,in compliance with metro process,petty signed an authorization granting metro unfettered access to all of his medical and military records,including a complete accordingly,we find that petty satisfied userra documentation requirement,and,inasmuch as metro does not dispute his having satisfied the other statutory prerequisites,it is apparent that he established his right to reemployment as guaranteed by and.
metro,therefore,was not permitted to delay or otherwise limit petty reemployment rights in any way in particular,metro was not permitted to limit or delay petty reemployment by requiring him to comply with its process.section b expressly states that userra supersedes any contract,agreement,policy,plan,practice,or other matter that reduces,limits,or eliminates in any manner any right or benefit provided by this chapter,including the establishment of additional prerequisites to the exercise of any such right or the receipt of any such benefit.by applying its process to petty,metro not only delayed his reemployment,but as we shall explain,it also limited and withheld benefits to which petty was entitled under userra.
it is of no consequence here that metro believes it is obligated to ensure that each and every individual entrusted with the responsibility of being a metropolitan police officer is still physically,emotionally,and temperamentally qualified to be a police officer after having been absent from the department.in userra,congress clearly expressed its view that a returning veteran reemployment rights take precedence over such concerns.metro does not question petty physical qualifications instead,it questions only whether his conduct during his military service would disqualify him from returning to service in the police department.but petty separation from military service is classified as under honorable conditions,which congress has made clear suffices to qualify him for userra benefits.to the extent that his military service may have in fact left petty unfit to carry out his duties as a police officer but is not reflected in the classification of his separation from service,userra would allow,after his reemployment,a for cause termination of that employment.furthermore,congress recognized userra would limit the ability of employers to rescreen returning veterans,but still chose to make this the general rule under userra.this is evident because,in certain circumstances,congress altered this general rule to allow vetting of returning veterans before full rehiring.section allows the heads of agencies listed under a c ii,fbi,cia,prescribe procedures for ensuring that the rights under userra apply to employees of such agency.a.congress did not grant similar discretion to local police departments therefore,metro process as applied to petty was in violation of userra reemployment provisions.
the district court determined that metro procedures could be applied to petty,finding that because they are applicable to all individuals regardless of military service,these procedures did not constitute additional prerequisites.in this,the district court erred.first,b does not limit its superseding effect only to additional prerequisites.it supersedes any policy,plan,or practice that reduces,limits,or eliminates in any manner any right or benefit provided by userra,including,but not necessarily limited to,the establishment of additional prerequisites.second,metro procedures do constitute additional prerequisites for returning veterans,because the procedures are in addition to the requirements congress specified for the exercise of userra reemployment rights.the district court apparently viewed the term additional prerequisites as meaning additional to the employer existing prerequisites,and concluded that metro procedures are not discriminatory because they apply to all individuals returning to the department.but this analysis is not appropriate for a claim brought under,and the superseding effect of b is not so limited metro procedures are indeed superseded by userra reemployment provisions.
it is important to note that petty was not required to make any showing of discrimination in order to sustain either of his reemployment claims.the district court incorrectly characterized part of petty reemployment part dealing with the position to which he was being part of his discrimination claims and therefore held that it required a showing of discrimination.the district court did not state its authority for this,but metro finds support for the court view in the following language from this circuit decision in curby archon a person seeking relief under must also meet the discrimination requirement contained in.at.however,this language from curby was merely dicta and is therefore not binding precedent.see wrigglesworth,d at characterizing this part of curby as dicta jordan air prods,d,same.furthermore,subsequent to curby,the department of labor specified that t he employee is not required to prove that the employer discriminated against him or her because of the employee uniformed service in order to be eligible for reemployment.accord francis,at t he procedural requirements of the two provisions differ.an employee proceeding under has the burden of proving that the employer discriminated against him or her based on a status or activity protected by userra.section imposes no such burden.finally,the imposition of discrimination requirement on a reemployment claim is not consistent with the plain language of and.section states that any person entitled to reemployment under section which we have found petty to be shall be promptly reemployed in a position of employment in accordance with the order of priority outlined in a.thus,the express terms of make its application contingent only on the prerequisites of,none of which include a showing of discrimination.
because we have found that petty met prerequisites,and that is applicable here notwithstanding any discrimination considerations,we must now determine whether metro violated in failing to rehire petty at the appropriate level of employment.section provides the order of priority for the placement of returning veterans 
except as provided in paragraphs and,in the case of a person whose period of service in the uniformed services was for more than days 
a in the position of employment in which the person would have been employed if the continuous employment of such person with the employer had not been interrupted by such service,or a position of like seniority,status and pay,the duties of which the person is qualified to perform or 
b in the position of employment in which the person was employed on the date of the commencement of the service in the uniformed services,or a position of like seniority,status and pay,the duties of which the person is qualified to perform,only if the person is not qualified to perform the duties of a position referred to in subparagraph a after reasonable efforts by the employer to qualify the person.
in the case of a person who a is not qualified to be employed in i the position of employment in which the person would have been employed if the continuous employment of such person with the employer had not been interrupted by such service,or ii in the position of employment in which such person was employed on the date of the commencement of the service in the uniformed services for any reason other than disability incurred in,or aggravated during,service in the uniformed services,and b can not become qualified with reasonable efforts by the employer,in any other position which is the nearest approximation to a position referred to first in clause a i and then in clause a ii which such person is qualified to perform,with full seniority.
a.metro does not dispute that petty was not placed in any of the positions apparently mandated by,his former position as patrol sergeant.rather,metro argues only that it did not violate because,having perhaps been dishonest in the process,petty may not be qualified to hold these positions.this argument is without merit.
at the point at which petty was entitled to reemployment under and,metro had no basis on which to question his qualifications.petty had satisfied the only prerequisites to specified in metro attempt to impose additional prerequisites through its process was,as we have already explained,wholly impermissible.see b userra supersedes local policies.the process,then,including petty alleged dishonesty therein,can not serve as a basis for delaying or otherwise limiting petty right to reemployment 
furthermore,metro can not avoid this conclusion by arguing that its second investigation into petty conduct during the process had not been completed at the time of petty filing of this action,and metro therefore had not been able to determine whether petty was qualified for reemployment in his original position with the police department.first,investigations spawned by the improper application to petty of the process can not serve to delay petty statutory right to reemployment if the prerequisites for reemployment have been met.second,includes a promptness requirement that metro clearly violated notwithstanding any concerns that it may have harbored regarding petty truthfulness.prompt reemployment required by a means reemployment 
as soon as practicable under the circumstances of each case.absent unusual circumstances,reemployment must occur within two weeks of the employee application for reemployment.for example,prompt reinstatement after a weekend national guard duty generally means the next regularly scheduled working day.on the other hand,prompt reinstatement following several years of active duty may require more time,because the employer may have to reassign or give notice to another employee who occupied the returning employee position.
emphasis added.because of its process,metro took three weeks to rehire petty,and even then it did not place petty in the correct position as outlined in.metro can not justify these delays neither a process that has been superseded by statute nor any investigations resulting from that process constitute the unusual circumstances that the department of labor has specified may justify a less timely reinstatement.third,in any event,the burden of proving that a returning veteran is not qualified under falls on the employer,not on the employee.mccoy olin mathieson chem.metro can not defeat the prompt reemployment guarantee of by engaging in investigations into petty qualifications.indeed,courts have recognized that 
it is presumed under the law that a veteran,who was qualified for his employment status upon its termination by his entry into the active military service of the united states,remains qualified to claim reemployment upon his discharge from such active military service an employer who refuses to reemploy a discharged veteran who has timely applied for reemployment has the burden of proving the veteran disqualification for reemployment.
id.metro has never proved petty disqualification for reemployment.indeed,even today,approximately three years after petty originally sought reemployment,metro simply argues that,pending the outcome of its second investigation,it believes that petty may be unqualified.metro has wholly failed to carry its burden of proving petty disqualification and has therefore clearly violated 
petty third of his request for work 
on appeal,petty also argues that metro denied him reemployment rights when it refused to approve his request for security work.although it is not clear whether petty made this argument to the district court,we will briefly explain why this claim is not
