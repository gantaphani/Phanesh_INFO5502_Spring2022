teresita dotson,warren fisher,and annie jones collectively,defendants appeal their convictions for furnishing liquor to minors,in violation of,assimilated into federal law under the assimilative crimes act aca.a.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.because assimilation of washington state law was proper,we affirm.
background 
defendants were employed at mcchord air force base,washington,by establishments that sold alcohol.each was caught serving alcohol to underage servicemen.defendants were charged separately by information with supplying liquor to persons under the age of in violation of and and.a gross misdemeanor.
defendants filed identical motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,arguing that is not properly assimilated under the aca.after a magistrate judge orally denied all three motions,defendants entered conditional guilty pleas,pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure a.each defendant was sentenced to pay a fine and special assessment.
on appeal,the district court affirmed the judgments of conviction,concluding that was assimilated under the aca,such that federal jurisdiction existed.defendants timely appealed,and we consolidated the appeals.
we review de novo whether the aca assimilates a state law crime.see united states souza,cir.
congress enacted the aca to borrow state law to fill in the gaps of federal criminal law applicable to federal enclaves that occur when congress has not passed specific criminal statutes with respect to the missing offenses.united states clark,cir citing lewis united states.the aca provides 
whoever within or upon any of the places now existing or hereafter reserved or acquired as provided in section of this title,or on,above,or below any portion of the territorial sea of the united states not within the jurisdiction of any state,commonwealth,territory,possession,or district is guilty of any act or omission which,although not made punishable by any enactment of congress,would be punishable if committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of the state,territory,possession,or district in which such place is situated,by the laws thereof in force at the time of such act or omission,shall be guilty of a like offense and subject to a like punishment.
a.thus,the aca subjects persons on federal lands to federal prosecution in federal court for violations of criminal statutes of the state in which the federal lands are located.clark,at quoting united states kiliz,cir.in so doing,the aca establishes uniformity in a state prohibitory laws where such conduct is not made penal by federal statutes.united states marcyes,cir.
under the aca,a state statute is properly assimilated if it is penal,it is prohibitory,and it is not precluded by generally applicable federal law that evinces an intent to punish the culpable conduct to the exclusion of state law.clark,at.thus,there are two primary reasons the aca may not assimilate a state law the act or omission at issue is already made punishable by an enactment of congress that precludes application of the state statute to be assimilated or the state statute to be assimilated is regulatory rather than prohibitory.see,id.at addressing whether unauthorized practice of law statute was properly assimilated based on the argument that it was regulatory rather than prohibitory and on the argument that defendant conduct was punishable under the uniform code of military justice marcyes,at addressing whether fireworks law was properly assimilated based on the argument that it was regulatory rather than prohibitory and on the argument that congress has provided other standards which are controlling and preempt the field.
in addition to these arguments,we also consider whether failure to assimilate the law would circumvent the state determination that the conduct is dangerous to the general welfare of its citizens,and whether assimilation would further the aca purpose of establishing uniformity.see marcyes,at.
we begin with the question whether furnishing alcohol to a minor is an act already made punishable by an enactment of congress a state statute may be assimilated only if no act of congress makes such conduct punishable.marcyes,at.this presents a species of preemption inquiry,for which we apply a test 
t he aca language and its purpose taken together indicate that a court must first ask the question that the aca language requires is the defendant act or omission made punishable by any enactment of congress.if the answer to this question is no,that will normally end the matter.the aca presumably would assimilate the statute.if the answer to the question is yes,however,the court must ask the further question whether the federal statutes that apply to the act or omission preclude application of the state law in question 
united states rocha,cir quoting lewis,at emphasis in lewis.
our inquiry ends at the first step,because we conclude that no enactment of congress makes punishable the conduct at issue.defendants direct our attention to app,which authorizes the secretary of defense 
to make such regulations as he may deem to be appropriate governing the sale,consumption,possession of or traffic in beer,wine,or any other intoxicating liquors to or by members of the armed forces or the national security training corps at or near any camp,station,post,or other place primarily occupied by members of the armed forces or the national security training corps.
id.defendants contend that this statute demonstrates that the aca purpose would not be furthered by assimilation of because the statute already makes the conduct in question punishable.
we note that is a statute that grants rulemaking authority to the secretary of defense,but that does not itself set forth any rules or regulations governing the sale,consumption,possession of or traffic in beer,wine,or any other intoxicating liquors even if did set forth specific prohibitions,it would not preclude assimilation unless those prohibitions were of general applicability.see clark,at a lthough only those laws governing conduct not made punishable by any enactment of congress may be assimilated,any enactment refers only to enactments of general applicability.citing united states debevoise,cir.in both clark and debevoise,we held that state statutes were properly assimilated even though the defendant was also subject to punishment under certain articles of the uniform code of military justice ucmj because those articles were not of general applicability.clark,at debevoise,at accord united states mariea,cir it stands to reason that the federal laws congress had in mind as barring assimilation of state laws were federal laws of a character similar to the state laws they,criminal laws of general application.the articles of the ucmj,however,pertain only to members of the armed forces.
defendants also rely on secretary of the air force instruction,afi.although they do so in support of the argument that is regulatory rather than prohibitory,a contention we address in the next section,we also briefly consider whether the instruction constitutes an enactment of congress that would preclude assimilation.afi applies to all personnel who sell,serve,purchase,or consume alcohol on air force installations or aircraft and air national guard units and members when on air force bases.id.failure to comply with the relevant portions of the instruction is a violation of article of the ucmj,and violations may also result in administrative disciplinary action without regard to otherwise applicable criminal or civil sanctions for violations of related laws.id.because the prohibitions in the instruction are limited to military personnel,as opposed to civilians,they can not be considered of general applicability.see clark,at citing debevoise,at 
because app.and afi contain no generally applicable prohibitions,they do not establish federal policy against which a state statute must be measured for conflict or inconsistency.see clark,at citing debevoise,at.accordingly,we conclude that no enactment of congress precludes assimilation of under the aca.
we turn now to the question whether is regulatory or prohibitory.to answer this question,we consider the
