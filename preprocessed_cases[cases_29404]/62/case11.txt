this case requires us to determine whether the escalator principle and reasonable certainty test governing reinstatement claims under the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act of userra apply to,discretionary promotions.the district court found that they do not,and used this conclusion to reject plaintiff luis rivera melndez userra reinstatement claim pursuant to and and award summary judgment to defendant,pfizer pharmaceuticals,llc pfizer.because we conclude that the escalator principle and reasonable certainty test apply regardless of whether the promotion at issue is automatic or,we vacate the district court judgment and remand.
background 
we summarize the relevant facts in the light most favorable to rivera,the party against whom summary judgment was granted.barclays bank plc poynter,cir.
luis rivera melndez rivera earned his associate degree in chemistry from the technological institute of manat in and a bachelor degree in liberal arts from the pontifical catholic university at arecibo in.he began working at pfizer pharmaceutical manufacturing facility in barceloneta,puerto rico in.initially employed as a chemical operator trainee,rivera received several promotions,including a promotion to active pharmaceutical ingredient api group leader.the api group leader position which has since been eliminated was an hourly,position under the supervision of the exempt api supervisor and api manager 
rivera also serves his country as a member of the united states naval reserve navy.during his career at pfizer,he has been called twice into active duty service.on october,rivera received notice that he was being called to active duty in iraq.he promptly notified pfizer senior human resources specialist that he needed to take military leave.after attending training,rivera commenced his active duty service on december.his tour of duty concluded on october.
in february,pfizer restructured its api department.as part of this restructuring,pfizer eliminated the api group leader position held by rivera and replaced it with two separate classifications api team leader and api service coordinator.pfizer management held a meeting with the api group leaders at the barceloneta facility and informed them that they could apply for the exempt api team leader position,for which seven job openings would be posted.the api group leaders were informed that if they were not among those selected for the api team leader position,they would have three alternatives to apply to the new,api service coordinator position to be demoted to the senior api operator position or to participate in a voluntary separation option.
the api team leader positions were posted in march,seven months before rivera returned to pfizer.the position originally required,inter alia,a bachelor degree in science or business administration,at least five years of experience in api manufacturing,and at least five years in a supervisory or interdisciplinary team environment handling multiple tasks.pfizer senior human resources specialist lissette guerra sierra testified in a deposition that an estimated sixteen to seventeen people applied for the seven api team leader vacancies.after a first round of interviews,pfizer modified the criteria so that api group leaders without bachelor degrees could qualify for the position,subject to their completing the degree requirement within a specified period of time.
the seven api team leader positions were filled by six of the former api group leaders and one senior api operator none of the six api group leaders who were promoted satisfied the original bachelor degree requirement.of the api group leaders not selected for the api team leader position,one,luis bravo,was appointed to special projects under the supervision of the api manager pending the approval of the new api service coordinator position,while two others were demoted to the api senior operator position.
upon being discharged from active military service,rivera contacted pfizer to request reinstatement.he returned to work on october.rivera met with the api manager,who told him that he was reinstated as an api group leader.however,because the api group leader position had been effectively eliminated by the time he returned to pfizer,rivera,like luis bravo,was assigned to special tasks under the supervision of the api manager.although rivera salary and benefits were not altered,he had reduced job responsibilities while assigned to the special tasks role.
on may,rivera was appointed to the api service coordinator position after the creation of the position had been officially approved by pfizer.three other former api group leaders were appointed to the api service coordinator position as well.rivera continued to receive the same compensation and benefits he had received as an api group leader,though he had fewer job responsibilities.specifically,rivera stated in his deposition that he no longer had the limited supervisory duties with which he was charged as an api group leader when supervisors were unavailable.rivera also testified that he would have liked the opportunity to apply for the api team leader position,and that he felt he was qualified for the position.
procedural history 
rivera and the conjugal partnership comprised of rivera and his wife filed suit against pfizer on january,asserting userra and pendent state law claims rivera userra claims alleged violations of the statute and reinstatement provisions.specifically,rivera argued that pfizer had violated his rights by,inter alia,delaying payment of his differential pay and pay raise,refusing to pay him a christmas bonus,failing to provide him with an opportunity to apply for the api team leader position,and subjecting him to a hostile work environment based on his military service.rivera also alleged that he was entitled to be rehired to a supervisory,the api team leader position upon his return from active duty.
pfizer moved for summary judgment on august,the district court granted pfizer motion as to nearly all of rivera userra claims among the claims the district court rejected were those rivera brought pursuant to and.specifically,the district court held that rivera could not establish that he was entitled to be employed as an api team leader upon his return from active duty because the api team leader position was not rivera escalator position that is,the position of employment in which rivera would have been employed if his continuous employment with the employer had not been interrupted by his service.a a.because the api team leader position was not an automatic promotion and instead involved employer discretion,the court found that rivera could assert no entitlement to it under userra.
rivera promptly filed a motion for reconsideration,arguing,inter alia,that the court had erred when it determined that the escalator position principle applied only to promotions.unpersuaded,the district court simply reiterated its insistence on the automatic promotion principle.
on appeal,rivera asks us to vacate the district court grant of summary judgment only as to his userra reinstatement claim.he mounts a attack on the district court analysis.first,he maintains that the district court erred in holding that userra escalator principle and its associated reasonable certainty test apply only to automatic promotions.second,he argues that,based on the evidence presented below,there are genuine issues of material fact relating to the question of whether it was reasonably certain that if not for the period of service,he would have attained the api team leader position.
the united states filed an amicus brief in this case,also arguing that the district court grant of summary judgment must be vacated.like rivera,the united states maintains that the escalator principle and reasonable certainty test apply to both automatic and promotions,and that the proper inquiry was therefore not whether the promotion was automatic or discretionary,but whether it was reasonably certain that rivera would have applied for and received the promotion had he not been in active duty status.the united states takes no position on whether rivera could ultimately prove that it was reasonably certain that he would have been promoted to the api team leader position 
enacted in,userra represents the latest in a series of laws protecting veterans employment and reemployment rights.in enacting the statute,congress made clear that,to the extent consistent with userra,the large body of case law that had developed under previously enacted federal laws protecting veterans employment and reemployment rights remained in full force and effect.the purpose of userra is to encourage noncareer military service by eliminating or minimizing the disadvantages to civilian careers,minimize the disruption of servicemembers and their employers by providing for the prompt reemployment of servicemembers,and prohibit discrimination against servicemembers.a.we have previously noted that userra provisions should be broadly construed in favor of military service members as its purpose is to protect such members.vega coln wyeth,cir see fishgold sullivan drydock repair,holding that the selective training and service act of is to be liberally construed for the benefit of those who left private life to serve their country in its hour of great need.
in the case of a servicemember whose period of service exceeded ninety days,section a of the statute provides the rules applicable to the employer determination of the servicemember proper reemployment position.pursuant to that section,the servicemember is to be reemployed in the position of employment in which he would have been employed if the continuous employment of such person with the employer had not been interrupted by such service,or a position of like seniority,status and pay,the duties of which the person is qualified to perform.a a emphasis added.this position is the aforementioned escalator position.if,and only if,the returning servicemember is not qualified to perform the position described in section a a after the employer has made reasonable efforts to qualify him,the employer may reemploy the servicemember in the position of employment in which he was employed on the date of the commencement of the service in the uniformed services,or a position of like seniority,status and pay,the duties of which the person is qualified to perform.id.a b emphasis added.
the department of labor department regulations provide further clarification on the escalator principle.as to the concept of the escalator principle generally,the regulations state 
as a general rule,the employee is entitled to reemployment in the job position that he or she would have attained with reasonable certainty if not for the absence due to uniformed service the principle behind the escalator position is that,if not for the period of uniformed service,the employee could have been promoted or,alternatively,demoted,transferred,or laid off due to intervening events.the escalator principle requires that the employee be reemployed in a position that reflects with reasonable certainty the pay,benefits,seniority,and other job perquisites,that he or she would have attained if not for the period of service.
emphases added.the regulations also provide guidance on the determination of the specific reemployment position 
in all cases,the starting point for determining the proper reemployment position is the escalator position,which is the job position that the employee would have attained if his or her continuous employment had not been interrupted due to uniformed service.once this position is determined,the employer may have to consider several factors before determining the appropriate reemployment position such factors may include the employee length of service,qualifications,and disability,if any.the reemployment position may be either the escalator position the position a position comparable to the escalator or position or,the nearest approximation to one of these positions.
id.emphasis added.
the escalator does not run in only one direction.depending on the particular employee and the employer circumstances,the escalator principle may cause an employee to be reemployed in a higher or lower position,laid off,or even terminated.id.in some cases,for example,the escalator principle could deliver an employee into layoff status if the employee seniority or job classification would have resulted in the employee being laid off during the period of service,and the layoff continued after the date of reemployment.id.
in designing its final rules implementing userra,the department of labor considered whether the escalator principle applies to promotions based on an employer discretion.during the comment period following the department issuance of the proposed regulations in,an employer association suggested that in cases involving promotion based on employer discretion,would require employers to speculate whether a returning employee would have sought the promotion in the first instance and have been chosen over the successful candidate,internal quotation marks omitted.similarly,the department received a comment from a human resources consulting firm arguing that b ecause most employees are promoted based on demonstrated ability and experience,rather than length of service,the escalator principle can not operate for all employees.the escalator principle is appropriate only in workforces where pay increases and promotions occur automatically rather than for achievement or merit.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the department unambiguously rejected these suggestions.it stated that sections and incorporate the reasonable certainty test as it applies to discretionary and promotions,and that these rules promote the application of a analysis rather than a rule that could result in the unwarranted denial or promotions to returning service members based on how the promotion was labeled rather than whether or not it was reasonably certain.id.the department therefore declined to alter the regulations to indicate that promotions would not be subject to the escalator principle and the reasonable certainty test.
finally,we note that userra affords broad remedies to a returning servicemember who is entitled to reemployment.for example,unequivocally states that t he employer may not refuse to reemploy the employee on the basis that another employee was hired to fill the reemployment position during the employee absence,even if reemployment might require the termination of that replacement employee.additionally,userra grants courts full equity powers to vindicate fully the rights or benefits of veterans seeking reemployment.e emphasis added see serricchio wachovia sec.llc,cir approving district court use of its equitable powers to craft an appropriate remedy.
b.the district court userra analysis 
the district court held that rivera attempt to invoke the escalator principle was improper because a n escalator position is a promotion that is based solely on employee seniority and does not include an appointment to a position that is not automatic,but instead depends on the employee fitness and ability and the employer exercise of discretion.dist.op.at citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.in concluding that the escalator principle and the reasonable certainty test do not apply to promotions,the district court relied primarily upon mckinney missouri kansas texas railroad,a case in which the supreme court interpreted the universal military training and service act of there the court held that a returning veteran seeking reemployment is not entitled to demand that he be assigned a position higher than that he formerly held when promotion to such a position depends,not simply on seniority or some other form of automatic progression,but on the exercise of discretion by the employer.id.at.accordingly,the district court found that the purpose of the escalator principle is to assure that those changes and advancements that would necessarily have occurred simply by virtue of continued employment will not be denied the veteran because of his absence in the military service,dist.op.at quoting mckinney,at emphasis added,and that the principle therefore had no applicability to the facts of rivera case.
