title of the united states code to,entitled the uniform code of military justice ucmj,the manual for mcm and the rules for,which are a part of the mcm,establish a military member rights and the procedures for military prosecutions.in proceedings,a charge is preferred when a charge sheet,dd form,containing both the charge and its specification s,is signed under oath before a commissioned officer by someone who states that he or she has personal knowledge of or has investigated the matter and that the charges are true to the best of his or her knowledge and belief.see ucmj b.after the formal charge is preferred,the accused is to be informed as soon as practicable,and the commander who receives the charges and who also has authority to dispose of them must promptly determine what disposition will be made of the charge.b.
the mcm provides guidance to commanders to help them determine which level of command should dispose of the charges.see.commanders are authorized to forward the charges to a superior authority for disposition in order to effect disposition at the lowest appropriate level.see b c.vary in their composition,in the presence or absence of a military judge,and in the severity of the punishment and penalties they may impose.the lowest is the single officer summary the next highest is the three member minimum panel of the special which may or may not have a military judge detailed to assist it and at the highest level,the general is composed of a military judge and a minimum of five other members.in cases in which the death penalty may be imposed,the general consists of a military judge and twelve panel members.at both the special and general levels an accused,after consulting with his defense counsel and knowing the identity of the military judge,may request orally on the record to be tried by the military judge alone,subject to the military judge approval.see ucmj.
if the general convening authority a very senior commanding officer usually of general officer or flag officer rank decides to proceed with a general,there must be a thorough and impartial investigation of all the matters set forth in the charge and specifications,by a commissioned officer who holds a hearing pursuant to article of the ucmj.unlike a civilian grand jury investigation,the accused may be present,represented by counsel,present evidence,and witnesses.the article investigating officer makes and files a report of the investigation and makes a recommendation with respect to whether the charge should be dismissed or tried,and if tried,by which specie of.the general convening authority then must again decide whether to dismiss the charge and specification s,or if prosecution is warranted,to refer the charge and specification s to a within the convening authority jurisdiction.if the convening authority refers the charge and specification s for a trial by a general,he or she convenes the by the issuance of another order that may refer the case for trial to an already existing general panel,or to a panel appointed specially to hear the case.at the,the charge and specification s are read,and the accused enters a plea.following the arraignment and the disposition by the military judge of any pretrial motions,the trial commences before the military judge and the panel,the military jury.if the accused is convicted and sentenced either to death,to a bad conduct or dishonorable discharge,or to confinement for a year or more,he or she receives an automatic appeal to that member service court of criminal appeals.see ucmj,b.otherwise,review of the proceedings of a general is a matter for the respective service judge advocate general tjag,unless such a review is waived.see ucmj.

following allegations that allen took indecent liberties with the minor child and wrongfully and willfully contributed to the delinquency of two minors,and,on or about june or,the air force office of special investigations investigated,and allen was informed of the charge and specifications after they were preferred against him on february.a hearing was held pursuant to article,at the conclusion of which the investigating officer recommended that the charge and specifications be referred for trial to a general.on april,the commander of the eighteenth air force,at scott air force base,illinois,who was the general convening authority,referred the case to a general for trial.chief circuit military judge colonel mary boone assigned major barbara shestko as the military judge and set a trial date for july.she also entered a written order excluding the time from june,to july,for speedy trial purposes but did not explain why.
on june,allen voluntarily released his two military defense counsel,and on july,his new military counsel filed a request for a delay until september.the request was granted,the trial date was reset for september,and the time from june,to september,was excluded for speedy trial purposes by chief judge boone.during this continuance,one of the alleged victims,ran away and could not be located.because would not be available to testify at the scheduled to take place on september,lieutenant general william welser iii,the commander of the eighteenth air force and the general convening authority,directed that the charge and its specifications be withdrawn and dismissed without prejudice in a written memorandum dated august.app.at.on that same date,lieutenant colonel scott bradshaw acting for the commander as the chief of the military justice section of the convening authority staff judge advocate office,lined through box of the charge sheet,which had referred the charge for trial by general,with the signed notation withdrawn without prejudice.app.at.the notation made no mention that the charge and specifications had been dismissed.
the rules for provide that the government may elect either to withdraw the charge and specifications under or to dismiss the charge and specifications under c.if the charge and specifications are withdrawn,they are merely suspended,and the speedy trial clock continues to run.if the charge and specifications are dismissed,they are extinguished,and the speedy trial clock stops.if the government wishes to renew the prosecution after the charges are dismissed,t he charges must be,investigated,and referred in accordance with the rules for,as though there were no previous charges or proceedings.united states britton.there is no provision for a joint withdrawal and dismissal of charges without prejudice.
on november,the air force was notified that the victim,had returned and was now available to testify.on november,the case was forwarded for action,and on december,the charge and specifications were to a general.allen was served with a copy of the charge and specifications and the new referral.
in a memorandum dated december,chief judge boone set a trial date of february,and excluded the time from december,to february,for speedy trial purposes.just before the was set to start,allen again fired his military counsel and was provided with two new military defense counsel.on march,chief judge boone reset the trial for may,and excluded the time from february,to may,for speedy trial purposes.on may,allen released one of his military counsel and hired civilian counsel.at a conference between the military judge and counsel on may,allen civilian counsel informed the court that he would not be available for trial until after labor day.at an arraignment hearing on may,the military court granted allen motion for a continuance,and the court rescheduled the for august,and excluded the time from february,until august,for speedy trial purposes based on the unavailability of allen civilian counsel.
on august,at a hearing held outside of the military jury presence,the military judge addressed the convening authority memorandum dated august,in which the charge and specifications were withdrawn and dismissed.at that hearing,the government argued that the charge and specifications had been withdrawn.after hearing argument and offering the parties the opportunity to present evidence,the military judge stated that based upon the evidence before this court at this time,the convening authority dismissed the case in august of.trial rec.at.the military judge declined to rule on allen pending motion to dismiss for violation of his speedy trial rights because the court did not have jurisdiction.trial rec.at.
on august,the charge and specifications were.after another series of delays,on march,allen filed a motion to dismiss based on violations of allen speedy trial or due process rights.the military judge newly assigned to the trial denied the motion.at an article hearing on march,allen counsel agreed that the time between the of the charges on august,until march,the date of trial,did not violate any of allen speedy trial rights.
the general was held march to march,and allen was found guilty of the charge and its specifications.allen was reprimanded,reduced from to reducing both his pay and his retirement benefits,required to forfeit pay per month for one year,ordered to perform hard labor without confinement for three months,and restricted to the air force base for two months.
following his conviction,allen requested that the findings and sentence be set aside and that the charge and specifications be dismissed because the military judge should have granted allen motion to dismiss for violation of his speedy trial or due process rights.in a memorandum,the director of the air force judiciary,colonel roberta moro,acting pursuant to article of the ucmj,reviewed the record of the,determined that no relief was warranted and declined to send the case to the air force court of criminal appeals because the findings and sentence were supported by law.on september,allen voluntarily retired from the air force and received an honorable discharge.
in january,allen filed a complaint in the district court for the district of north dakota seeking review of the proceedings.the district court held that the military court had given full and fair consideration to the question of whether the charge and specifications had been withdrawn or dismissed on august,and that the air force did not violate allen right to a speedy trial under either or the sixth amendment,and the district court granted the air force motion for summary judgment.allen appeals,arguing that the charge and specifications were withdrawn and not dismissed and that the delay violated his speedy trial rights.
after allen filed his appeal,he filed a motion to supplement the record with the air force response to allen motion to dismiss dated august,which he asserts confirmed that the charge was withdrawn on august.
first,we must review our own jurisdiction to review allen collateral challenge to the proceedings.military law,like state law,is a jurisprudence which exists separate and apart from the law which governs in our federal judicial establishment.burns wilson.plurality.the constitution gives congress the power to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces,const.art.i,cl.the supreme court is the only article iii court vested by congress with authority to directly review a military court judgment by a grant of certiorari pursuant to article of the ucmj.thus,our ability to review military court proceedings is similar to our ability to review state court proceedings.
nonetheless,while military courts exist separate and apart from the article iii courts,t he military courts have the same responsibilities as do the federal courts to protect a person from a violation of his constitutional rights.burns,at.although we do not have the authority to directly review proceedings,we do have jurisdiction over habeas petitions filed by military prisoners and collateral challenges to proceedings.see id.at explaining that federal civil courts have jurisdiction over military prisoners who have filed habeas corpus applications claiming the proceedings under which they were convicted denied them basic rights guaranteed by the constitution schlesinger councilman,d acknowledging jurisdiction over collateral attacks of judgments.as allen was not in custody at the time he filed his complaint,we do not review this case as a habeas challenge under.see c giving federal courts the power to grant writs of habeas corpus for prisoners in federal custody.nevertheless,we do have jurisdiction to review allen collateral challenge under.see giving federal courts original jurisdiction over all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states see also councilman,at explaining that congress did not intend for collateral attacks on proceedings to be limited to challenges under.therefore,we conclude that we have jurisdiction to review allen collateral constitutional challenge to the proceedings.
while it is clear that provides us with subject matter jurisdiction to review allen challenge to the proceedings,our standard of review is somewhat less clear.see,united states ex rel.new rumsfeld,describing the standard of review over a collateral attack on proceedings under as tangled,cert.denied,d.in councilman,the supreme court differentiated between a direct and a collateral attack on a judgment,explaining that grounds of impeachment cognizable in habeas proceedings may not be sufficient to warrant other forms of collateral relief and noted that without a clear statement of congressional intent one way or the other,the question of whether a judgment properly may be deemed void may turn on the nature of the alleged defect,and the gravity of the harm from which relief is sought and both factors must be assessed in light of the deference that should be accorded the judgments of the carefully designed military justice system established by congress.councilman,at emphasis added.according to the councilman court,implicit in the congressional creation of the military justice system is the view that the military court system generally is adequate to and responsibly will perform its assigned task.id.at.collateral relief was only possible if the judgments were void,and to be void the alleged defect must be fundamental.id.at.
prior to councilman,in evaluating a habeas petition in burns,the supreme court stated that civil courts had the limited function of determining whether the military courts gave fair consideration to the petitioners claims.burns,u.at.w hen a military decision has dealt fully and fairly with an allegation raised in that application,it is not open to a federal civil court to grant the writ simply to reevaluate the evidence.burns,at.
in rumsfeld,the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit noted the uncertainty in applying different levels of deference to state court habeas petitions,military habeas petitions,and petitions.rumsfeld,at.the rumsfeld court concluded that except for when the standard is quite specific,it had serious doubt whether the judicial mind i
