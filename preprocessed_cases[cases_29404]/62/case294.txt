marshall kenneth flowers and his wife anna flowers collectively the flowers brought suit pro se under the right to financial privacy act rfpa,against the defendant first hawaiian bank the bank.they alleged that the bank violated the rfpa by producing copies of their financial records to the united states army,pursuant to a subpoena,without first obtaining a certificate of compliance from the army as required by the rfpa.see id.b.
the primary issue in this case is whether such a certificate was required,or whether the bank production of the flowers financial records pursuant to the subpoena was exempt from the rfpa.the army had issued the subpoena during an article proceeding.an article proceeding,in general terms,is an investigative proceeding that is required under article of the uniform code of military justice ucmj before a general may be convened.the district court held that the bank did not violate the rfpa because its conduct in response to the army article subpoena was within the rfpa exemption for information disclosed in the course of litigation between the government and a private citizen.see id.e.the bank also contended that the rfpa exemption for information disclosed pursuant to a grand jury subpoena applied,see id i,but the district court did not reach that question.the court granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of the bank,and denied the flowers motions for reconsideration and leave to amend.
we have jurisdiction under,and we reverse.because subpoenas are not authorized in article proceedings,the subpoena was not lawfully issued.when the bank complied with the subpoena without obtaining a certificate of compliance from the army,it acted at its peril and it is not entitled to the protection of the rfpa exemptions on which it relies.accordingly,judgment on the pleadings was inappropriate.we also conclude that the district court should have granted the flowers motion for leave to amend.the flowers challenge to the denial of their motion for reconsideration is moot.
facts and proceedings 
a judgment on the pleadings is properly granted when,taking all the allegations in the pleadings as true,the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.nelson city of irvine,cir.all facts alleged in the flowers complaint are,therefore,taken as true.
this case arose while flowers was a sergeant major in the united states army stationed at the schofield barracks in hawaii.in april,the army charged sergeant major flowers with larceny under the ucmj.article of the ucmj provides that an investigative proceeding must be conducted before convening a general.the proceeding must include inquiry as to the truth of the matter set forth in the charges,consideration of the form of charges,and a recommendation as to the disposition which should be made of the case in the interest of justice and discipline.id.further,in the proceeding,an accused is entitled to counsel and some discovery,and has the right to witnesses.id.see generally united states samuels,united states bramel,commander edward byrne,military law ed charles shanor lynn hogue,military law ed.
a commanding officer initiates an article proceeding by appointing an investigating officer.the investigating officer need not be a lawyer.major larry gaydos,a comprehensive guide to the military pretrial investigation,mil.the investigating officer produces a written report recommending whether the charges should be referred to a general.rules for rcm j shanor hogue,supra,at.
the personnel present at an article proceeding are somewhat different from those present at a.only the investigating officer,defendant,and defense counsel need be present.government counsel may also be present to represent the government,but such presence is not required.gaydos,supra,at.in comparison,at a,the government is represented by a lawyer,the trial counsel,who serves as the military prosecutor.
the investigating officer for the article proceeding in the present case was major timothy ryan.the more significant figure,however,was the government counsel,captain john ohlweiler.
on june,while the article proceeding was pending,captain ohlweiler issued a subpoena to the bank schofield branch requesting all bank records for an account held jointly by the flowers.the subpoena stated on its face that it was a subpoena in an article proceeding.
approximately two weeks later,sergeant major flowers received a letter from the bank informing him of the subpoena and enclosing a copy.that notice did not inform the flowers of their rights under the rfpa.see b.the responsibility for providing such notice rests with the government authority that issues the subpoena.see id 
in late july or early august,the bank produced the flowers financial records in accordance with the subpoena.sometime thereafter,the charges against sergeant major flowers were dropped.
on may,the flowers filed a pro se complaint against the bank in the district court alleging that the bank production of their financial records violated the rfpa requirement that financial records be produced by a financial institution only after that institution has received from the governmental authority requesting the records a certificate of compliance with the rfpa.see.the bank filed an answer denying it had violated the rfpa,and moved for judgment on the pleadings.the flowers responded and the district court heard oral argument.
the central issue in contention was whether the bank response to the article subpoena fit within one of the rfpa exemptions provided by.the exemptions allow a financial institution to produce a customer financial records without obtaining a certificate of compliance from the requesting governmental authority when the records are sought in connection with litigation between a governmental authority and the customer,id.e,or are sought in connection with grand jury proceedings,id.i.in a published opinion,flowers first hawaiian bank,d,the district court held that the article proceeding was within the governmental litigation exemption provided by e,and entered judgment on the pleadings in favor of the bank.
the flowers moved for reconsideration.they also moved for leave to amend their complaint to add the united states army as a defendant and to clarify that captain ohlweiler was government counsel,not trial counsel,in the article proceeding.it is a little unclear,but the flowers may also have sought permission to amend the allegations of their complaint concerning damages.the district court denied these motions.it concluded that no grounds for reconsideration were presented and that further amendment would be futile.this appeal followed.
after argument,we asked the united states,including the army,to submit an amicus brief addressing the merits of this case,and in particular the legality of the article subpoena.we have received and considered that brief,as well as a responsive brief from the flowers.
the right to financial privacy act 
we review de novo the district court judgment on the pleadings.weeks bayer,cir.we also review de novo issues of statutory interpretation.silver sage partners,city of desert hot springs,cir.
it is not disputed that sergeant major flowers,as a member of the armed services when the circumstances in this case occurred,is protected by the rfpa.united states dowty,holding that the rfpa covers financial records of members of the armed services see also regulations applying the rfpa to military investigators.nor is there any dispute that ordinarily,if a government authority requests or subpoenas a bank customer financial records,then,to protect itself from liability,a bank is required to obtain a certificate of compliance with the rfpa from the governmental agency requesting the records before producing them.see also id.unless exempt under other provisions of the rfpa,a violation of this requirement entitles the customer to per violation,attorney fees and costs,and actual and punitive damages.id.
here,the bank did not obtain a certificate of compliance from the army.as a result,the issue is whether the subpoena issued by the army in the article proceeding triggered the exemption provided for litigation between the government and a bank customer,id.e,or the exemption for grand jury proceedings,id.i.we hold that neither of these exemptions applies.
litigation between the government and a customer 
e states nothing in the rfpa shall apply when financial records are sought by a government authority under the federal rules of civil or criminal procedure or comparable rules of other courts in connection with litigation to which the government authority and the customer are parties.this exemption has four requirements,all of which must be met for it to apply the applicable financial records must be sought by a governmental authority,under the federal rules of civil or criminal procedure or comparable rules of other courts,in connection with litigation,to which the governmental authority and the customer are parties.id.an article subpoena meets three,but not all four,of these requirements.
first,captain ohlweiler was acting as an officer in an article proceeding under united states law.rules for rcm.he was,therefore,acting for a government authority within the meaning of the rfpa.dowty,at.
skipping to the third requirement,an article proceeding bears sufficient indicia of litigation to meet the litigation requirement.see,united states mccarty,right to witnesses in an article proceeding is a substantial right entitled to judicial enforcement samuels,at statements can be admitted in an article proceeding only if made under oath or affirmation united states burrow,testimony of a witness at an article proceeding is admissible at later proceedings under certain circumstances united states payne,investigating officer in an article proceeding serves a judicial function.
the fourth the bank customer and the governmental authority be parties to the also met.sergeant major flowers was charged by the army with having committed the offense of larceny.as the accused,he had the right to be present at the article proceeding,to offer contrary evidence,and to witnesses.b.the government authority the army was also a party.while some cases have referred to an article proceeding as an ex parte proceeding because the government need not be present,see,samuels,at,the government has the right to be present as a party by appointing,at its discretion,government counsel.see gaydos,supra,at.
the second requirement of e,however,is not met.a subpoena issued in an article proceeding is not issued under the federal rules of civil or criminal procedure or comparable rules of other courts.
our conclusion might be otherwise if the subpoena were issued in connection with a pending proceeding.in roberts sabine state bank trust,cir,cert.denied,d,the fifth circuit held that a subpoena issued by the trial counsel prosecutor in the course of a derived from a court martial case and met all of the governmental litigation requirements of e.roberts,at.the ucmj,however,specifically authorizes the issuance of a subpoena in proceedings.no such authority exists for the issuance of a subpoena in an article proceeding.
the provision of the ucmj addressing subpoenas states 
the trial counsel,the defense counsel,and the court martial shall have equal opportunity to obtain witnesses and other evidence in accordance with such regulations as the president may prescribe.process issued in cases to compel witnesses to appear and testify and to compel the production of other evidence shall be similar to that which courts of the united states having criminal jurisdiction may lawfully issue and shall run to any part of the united states,or the territories,commonwealths,and possessions.
the ucmj makes no mention of subpoenas in article hearings.
similarly,the rules for rcm,which implement the ucmj,do not authorize article subpoenas.military subpoenas to obtain civilian records,such as the bank records at issue in this case,are governed by rcm e,which states in its relevant part 
a subpoena may be issued by the summary or trial counsel of a special or general to secure witnesses or evidence for that.a subpoena may also be issued by the president of a court of inquiry or by an officer detailed to take a deposition to secure witnesses or evidence for those proceedings respectively.
rcm e c see also rcm f b.again,no authorization is made for the issuance of a subpoena in an article proceeding.the provision authorizing subpoenas by courts of inquiry is unavailing because such courts are separate legal proceedings with separate procedures.see.also unavailing is the provision for deposition subpoenas because,although evidence obtained by a deposition may be used in an article proceeding,see discussion following rcm a,depositions under rcm are distinct legal proceedings.see rcm.
further,rcm,which regulates article proceedings,makes no mention of a subpoena power.instead,the discussion following rule g b explicitly notes c ivilian witnesses may not be compelled to attend a investigation.thus,from our review of the ucmj and rcm,we conclude that the article investigating officer and the government counsel both lack subpoena power.
a multitude of military cases,albeit mostly in dicta,have reached this same conclusion.see,united states johnson,reciting in a statement of fact a ruling,unchallenged on appeal,by a lower level military court judge that a subpoena issued in an article proceeding was illegal and stating,without analysis,that t he military judge was correct in ruling that an illegally ordered subpoena was issued.united states chuculate,in dicta,noting that e xamination of the uniform code and the manual for reveals no provision expressly authorizing compulsory process for an article hearing witness appearance id.at cook,concurring in the result tracing the history of the unavailability of compulsory process against civilian witnesses in article proceedings united states anderson,holding that evidence held by a civilian police department was not within the government possession because the government lacked subpoena power to obtain it for use in an article proceeding see also united states smelley,wl describing in a detailed statement of facts that a general who was the convening authority of an article proceeding assumed that an article investigating officer lacked subpoena power no part of the opinion challenged the general conclusion.
legal commentators also have reached the conclusion that no subpoena power exists in an article proceeding.see,lieutenant colonel john saunders,hunting for snarks recent developments in the pretrial arena,army,at,t he government has no power to subpoena witnesses to article,ucmj investigative hearings.gaydos,supra,at a civilian witness can not be compelled by subpoena to attend an article hearing.
the only somewhat contrary authority is united states roberts.there,the court,in dicta,stated since,military authorities have consistently held that there is no legal authority to compel a civilian witness to appear at a pretrial investigation we note however,that in federal civilian criminal practice a grand jury has subpoena power id.at citations omitted.after considering contrary authorities the court concluded,n evertheless,the legislative hearings on article provide some indication that the use of a subpoena at the investigation was contemplated in extraordinary situations.id.at.in a concurrence,judge cook strongly disagreed with the majority statements that subpoena power could possibly exist in an article proceeding.id.at.he observed that the majority authorities actually concluded that no such process was available.id.because roberts stands alone in suggesting that a subpoena power exists in article proceedings,and because it is contrary to our review of the ucmj and rcm,we find it unpersuasive.
in its amicus brief,the government concedes the issue,stating that the government counsel subpoena to compel the bank to produce the flowers bank records before the article proceeding was not authorized by the ucmj,the rcm,or any other provision of law.however,the government argues,t he fact that the subpoena was not specifically authorized by the ucmj or the rcm does not mean that the subpoenaed records were not sought under those rules within the meaning of e.we disagree.
the subpoena states on its
