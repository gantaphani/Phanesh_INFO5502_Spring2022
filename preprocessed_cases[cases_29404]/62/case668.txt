robert smith,a former officer in the united states army,filed this action in the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin,challenging the army decision not to promote him to the rank of colonel.the district court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction over smith claim under the administrative procedure act and that smith could have brought his action in the united states court of federal claims under the tucker act.accordingly,the district court transferred the case to the court of federal claims pursuant to the federal transfer statute.because we conclude that it is unclear from the record whether this action could have been brought in the court of federal claims under the tucker act,we remand this case to the district court for further factual development.
smith is an ophthalmologist who served for more than years in the united states army.in,he accepted a commission in the army medical corps and began attending graduate school,where he studied anatomy.he earned a masters degree in anatomy in.in,two years after beginning his graduate program in anatomy,he entered medical school.following graduation from medical school in,he was awarded the rank of captain in the army reserve based on the four years of constructive credit he received for medical school.he continued to be a member of the army reserve until when he became an officer in the regular army.
smith was promoted to the rank of major in and to the rank of lieutenant colonel in.beginning in he was considered for promotion to colonel.the colonel selection board declined to promote him at that time,and he failed selection before each succeeding board until his retirement in.
in,smith concluded that the army had failed to award him constructive service credit for his studies.as a result,he petitioned the total army personnel command to grant him additional constructive credit.subsequently,in,smith record was amended to adjust the date of his promotion to captain from to.a constructive board then considered whether to constructively promote him to major as of,but the board declined to do so.as a result,smith date of promotion to lieutenant colonel was also not adjusted.smith sought review of that decision through the army board for the correction of military records abcmr.the abcmr denied his request for relief.in addition,the abcmr determined that he had improperly been granted constructive credit for his studies and revised his captain date of rank to the original date in.
smith retired from the army in.in april,he filed an action in the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin,in which he named the abcmr and the secretary of the army as defendants.in his complaint,smith alleged that the army and the abcmr had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in refusing to correct his military records.if he had been given timely and proper credit for his masters degree studies,he claimed,he would have been promoted to major and lieutenant colonel in and,respectively.in that event,smith alleged,he would have been considered for promotion to colonel in,three years before his first actual consideration.he argued that the delay prejudiced his chances for promotion to colonel because in the selection rate for colonel was much higher than it was in.
as a remedy,smith asked the court to order that he be promoted to the rank of colonel,that the date of rank for his promotions to major and lieutenant colonel be corrected,that he be granted back pay and allowances as appropriate,and that he be transferred to the retired list at the rank of colonel.in the alternative,he asked the court to order that he be retroactively considered for promotion to colonel by a remedial selection board,that upon selection he be given back pay and allowances as appropriate,and that his transfer to the retired list be at the rank of colonel.
the government moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that,in light of smith request for monetary damages,the court of federal claims had exclusive jurisdiction over the case.the government also contended that the administrative procedure act apa did not waive sovereign immunity because smith was seeking back pay,for which the court of federal claims could provide an adequate remedy.
the district court agreed with the government that it lacked jurisdiction over the case,but instead of dismissing,the court transferred the case to the court of federal claims pursuant to.smith sec y of the army.the court ruled that monetary relief is smith sole object,because in his retired status,the only benefit a retroactive promotion offers him is an opportunity to claim back pay.because the district court concluded that the amount of back pay at issue was approximately,the court held that the case could be brought only in the court of federal claims under the tucker act,and not in the district court under the apa.
the federal transfer statute,permits a court to transfer an action to another court if the transferor court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case and the transferee court would have jurisdiction over the action.smith contends that neither requirement of the transfer statute is met in this case.he argues that the relief he was seeking was primarily equitable in nature,and that for that reason the district court had jurisdiction over his action and the court of federal claims did not.we have jurisdiction to review a district court decision to transfer a case to the court of federal claims pursuant to d a.
section a of the apa,provides that a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action,or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute is entitled to judicial review of such a claim.the statute also waives sovereign immunity for an action seeking relief other than money damages.in the absence of special statutory review proceedings,see,the general federal question statute,gives district courts jurisdiction to conduct the judicial review described in section a of the apa.see califano sanders,d.the apa waiver of sovereign immunity is limited,however,by section c of the apa,which provides that judicial review is available only in the case of a gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.see mitchell united states.
the tucker act,grants the court of federal claims jurisdiction to render judgment against the united states for damages on various types of claims,including any claim founded on the constitution,a statute,or an executive department regulation.id.a.that portion of the tucker act has been construed to require that the source of substantive law on which the plaintiff relies be,it must fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the federal government for the damage sustained.united states white mountain apache tribe,d,quoting united states testan,d.the tucker act further states that in order to provide an entire remedy and to complete the relief afforded by the judgment,the court may,as incident of and collateral to any such judgment,issue orders directing restoration to office or position,placement in appropriate duty or retirement status,and correction of applicable records.a.the act gives the district courts and the court of federal claims concurrent jurisdiction over any action falling within its terms in which the claim does not exceed in amount claims in excess of may be brought only in the court of federal claims.a.
smith contends that the apa entitles him to judicial review in the district court because his action arises under the laws of the united states because he is seeking relief other than money damages,namely,a promotion or consideration for a promotion and because no other court can provide an adequate remedy for the claims set forth in his complaint.the government responds that the apa does not entitle smith to judicial review in the district court because his complaint seeks money damages and ancillary equitable relief,and that an action in the court of federal claims under the tucker act would provide an adequate remedy for his claims.
if an action under the tucker act in the court of federal claims would provide an adequate remedy for smith claims,the district court would be barred by from entertaining his action under the apa,and the transfer order would be proper.we therefore turn to the question whether the court of federal claims would be able to supply the relief that smith seeks if he could establish his entitlement to it.
because the tucker act authorizes the court of federal claims to grant ancillary equitable relief,including placement in appropriate duty or retirement status,and correction of applicable records,the court of federal claims can provide smith all the equitable relief he requests in the event he has a right to money damages under a statute or regulation.that point is illustrated by this court decision in mitchell united states.in mitchell,a serviceman sought an extension of his term of active duty so that he could qualify for retirement with years of service.following his discharge,the serviceman sought correction of his records by the air force board for the correction of military records.after his request was denied,he filed suit in a federal district court seeking active duty credit,back pay,and reinstatement to active duty status until he was eligible for retirement.
on appeal,this court addressed the question whether section c of the apa barred the case from being brought as an apa nonstatutory review action in district court.drawing on the supreme court decision in bowen massachusetts,d,this court held that because a tucker act action in the claims court would provide the serviceman with an adequate judicial remedy,his apa action in the district court was barred.mitchell,at.in bowen,the supreme court reasoned that the back pay act,b,was a statute and that the tucker act provided an adequate judicial remedy for claimants seeking back pay under that act.bowen,at.by analogy,the mitchell court held that the tucker act provides an adequate remedy to claimants such as mitchell who were seeking back pay under the military pay act.the court explained that the availability of ancillary equitable remedies under the tucker act meant that the court of federal claims could provide mitchell with the adjustment in military status that he sought ancillary to his pay claim and that therefore deprived the district court of jurisdiction.mitchell,at.mitchell thus stands for the proposition that the court of federal claims can offer a service member such as smith an adequate remedy for a claim relating to military status and thus deprive the district court of jurisdiction over the claim if the service member claim constitutes a request for money together with a request for ancillary equitable relief and if the request is based on a statute,such as the military pay act.we therefore turn to the question whether smith claim satisfies those two requirements.
request for money.
in his initial complaint,smith sought to have the date of his promotions to major and lieutenant colonel corrected and the decision not to consider him for promotion to colonel in set aside.in addition,he requested that he be granted back pay and allowances as appropriate to include restoration of the corrected date of rank for promotion to major and to lieutenant colonel,and that his transfer to the retired list be at the rank of colonel,plus such other and further relief this court deems just and proper.in the alternative,smith requested that the court order that he be retroactively considered for promotion to colonel by a remedial selection board,that upon selection he be granted back pay and allowances as appropriate,and that his transfer to the retired list be at the rank of colonel.
after the government filed its motion to dismiss smith complaint on jurisdictional grounds,smith filed his first amended complaint.the only difference between the original complaint and the first amended complaint was the omission of the words plus such other and further relief this court deems just and proper in the final two paragraphs of the complaint.thus,contrary to smith contention in his brief on appeal,both his original complaint and his first amended complaint plainly requested money damages in the form of back pay and allowances as relief for the denial of constructive service credit of which he complains.
smith contends that his complaint does not include a request for monetary damages because he is not exclusively,or even principally,concerned with monetary relief.instead,he contends,his interest is in the pride and satisfaction associated with promotion to the rank of colonel.the subjective motivations underlying his action,however,do not govern the issue of jurisdiction.in holley united states,this court rejected the argument that the court of federal claims lacked jurisdiction over a military discipline case because the plaintiff primary motivation was to clear his name.the court explained that regardless of the plaintiff motivation for filing the action,the plaintiff had pleaded a monetary claim that satisfied the jurisdictional requirements of the tucker act,and the court of federal claims therefore had jurisdiction over his claim.at.similarly,in this case despite smith assertion that he is not motivated by the prospect of reaping financial benefits from a retroactive promotion,both his initial complaint and his first amended complaint include a request for monetary damages 
the next question is whether smith monetary claim is supported by a statute.the government argues that smith request for back pay based on a failure to promote him suffices to provide tucker act jurisdiction.in its brief before the district court,the government specifically pointed to the military pay act,as the applicable statute.it is well established that the military pay act is a statute.see dysart united states.the question remains,however,whether the military pay act could provide a monetary remedy under the circumstances of this case.
as a general matter,a service member is entitled only to the salary of the rank to which he is appointed and in which he serves.see james caldera,dodson united states,skinner united states.for that reason,in a challenge to a decision not to promote,the military pay act ordinarily does not give rise to a right to the pay of the higher rank for which the plaintiff was not selected.see law united states,howell united states,knightly united states,we do not have jurisdiction of a back pay claim predicated on a promotion not received.
there are two recognized exceptions to that general rule.under the first exception,an action for money arises under the military pay act in the unusual case in which,on the plaintiff legal theory,there is a legal entitlement to the promotion in question,skinner,at,he has satisfied all the legal requirements for promotion,but the military has refused to recognize his status.see dysart,at james,at law,at law is not asking the claims court to order his promotion but to recognize that it had occurred.under the second exception,an action for money arises under the military pay act when the decision not to promote the service member leads to the service member compelled discharge.if,in such a case,the effect of an order voiding the nonpromotion decision would be to give the service member a right to continue in the service at his previous rank,he would have a claim for the pay lost because of his improper separation.in that instance,the military pay act would give the service member a right to back pay,because the act confers on an officer the right to pay of the rank he was appointed to up until he is properly separated from the service.sanders united states,see also roth united states,martinez united states,en banc.
the first exception does not apply in this case,because there is no suggestion that smith enjoyed a legal right to promotion to the rank of colonel rather,his claim is that if he had been given the constructive credit to which he was entitled he would have been considered for promotion to colonel earlier,when his chance for promotion would have been greater therefore,in order to determine whether the tucker act would provide an adequate remedy for smith claims,it is
