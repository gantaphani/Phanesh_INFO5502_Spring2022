this defamation case centers on the notorious abu ghraib prison in iraq.abu ghraib prison is the place where iraqi detainees were subjected to horrific abuse.it is also the place where plaintiffs,caci premier technology,and caci international together,caci,interrogated iraqi detainees for the military.defendant randi rhodes,a host,blamed caci in part for the abu ghraib abuses on her show,which was broadcast by defendant piquant,llc,air america radio air america.in her scalding accusations against military contractor with public figure relied on a number of reputable sources,including two army reports and the statements of an army brigadier general who was once the head of detention facilities in iraq.rhodes and air america moved for summary judgment after caci sued them for defamation.the district court granted the motion,concluding that rhodes statements were protected by the first amendment,either because they were not made with actual malice or because they did not state actual facts about caci.we affirm.
caci is a government contractor that provides intelligence services to the military.caci principal place of business is in virginia.in the phase of the war in iraq,caci beginning in september provided civilian interrogators for the army military intelligence brigade assigned to the abu ghraib prison,near baghdad.
air america is a liberal talk radio network.air america broadcasts reach the commonwealth of virginia through satellite radio and at least one commercial station.rhodes began hosting the randi rhodes show on air america in march.her show aired for four hours daily during the week.rhodes,a former member of the air force,views the war in iraq as a disastrous mistake.she laced her show with fierce and colorful criticism of the president,the civilian leadership at the pentagon,and military contractors for their role in the initiation and continuation of the war.id.rhodes accepts new york magazine characterization of her style as shrill,screeching,and hectoring,cocksure.id.she also admits to making frequent use of hyperbole,a common tool of the talk radio host,in criticizing everything having to do with the war in iraq.
during the saddam hussein regime the abu ghraib prison was one of the world most notorious prisons,with torture,weekly executions,and vile living conditions.just before the invasion,the regime,aiming to create havoc for coalition forces,released the detainees held at abu ghraib prison and other facilities.after the invasion the abu ghraib was taken over by the military for use as a detention facility for three detainee or prisoner categories common criminals,security detainees accused or suspected of committing offenses against the coalition provisional authority,and high value detainees who might possess useful intelligence insurgency leaders,for example.the detainees at abu ghraib included women and juveniles.a army military police brigade and a military intelligence brigade were assigned to the prison.the intelligence operation at the prison suffered from a severe shortage of military personnel,prompting the government to contract with caci to provide civilian interrogators and with titan corporation titan to provide civilian interpreters.
abu ghraib prison returned to public awareness with searing intensity in late april when cbs on minutes ii broadcast an extended report,with sickening photographic evidence,about soldiers abusing and humiliating iraqi detainees at abu ghraib.the broadcast showed photographs of naked detainees stacked in a pyramid a photograph of two naked and hooded detainees,positioned as though one was performing oral sex on the other and a photograph of a naked male detainee with a female soldier pointing to his genitalia and giving a sign.another photograph showed a hooded detainee standing on a narrow box with electrical wires attached to his hands.a final photograph showed a dead detainee who had been badly beaten.soldiers were in several of the photographs,laughing,posing,or gesturing.the abuses stunned the military,public officials in general,and the public at large.
civilian interrogators and interpreters,operating under military contracts,were also responsible for detainee abuse at abu ghraib,according to media reports that were essentially contemporaneous with the minutes ii broadcast.rhodes closely followed the abu ghraib story after the shocking pictures were first broadcast on minutes ii in april.by the time rhodes made the statements on her show in august that caci challenges as defamatory,rhodes had read a number of published reports that caci interrogators at abu ghraib had abused detainees and directed or encouraged the abuse of detainees.these sources included two official military reports,a published interview of the brigadier general formerly in charge of prisons in iraq including abu ghraib,news articles,and a journalist speech.in addition to dealing with caci role at the abu ghraib prison,some of these sources also discussed the pentagon extensive use of military contractors in iraq,a regular topic on rhodes show.we highlight some of the relevant information revealed in rhodes sources that are included in the record.
concerns about abuse to detainees at the abu ghraib prison prompted major general antonio taguba investigation and report taguba report on the military police brigade assigned to the prison.the taguba report,made public in may,found that both military and civilian contractor caci and titan personnel were responsible for numerous incidents of sadistic,blatant,and wanton criminal abuses inflicted on abu ghraib detainees.words like horrific and extremely disturbing were also used to describe the abuses.major general taguba investigation led him to suspect that an army colonel and lieutenant colonel and two civilians,steven stephanowicz a caci employee and john israel a titan employee,were either directly or indirectly responsible for the abuses at abu ghraib.
major general taguba documented the following acts of abuse,among others punching,slapping,and kicking detainees using unmuzzled military dogs to frighten,and in one case to bite,detainees breaking chemical lights and pouring the phosphoric liquid on the detainees positioning a naked detainee on a box with a sandbag on his head and attaching wires to his fingers,toes,and penis to simulate electrical torture sodomizing a detainee with a chemical light and perhaps a broomstick having sex with a female detainee and threatening male detainees with rape stacking naked male detainees,handcuffed and shackled,in piles so that each one penis touched the buttocks of another videotaping and photographing naked male and female detainees forcibly arranging detainees in sexually explicit positions for photographing forcing groups of male detainees to masturbate while being photographed and videotaped and taking photographs of dead iraqi detainees.
major general taguba concluded that stephanowicz of caci shared responsibility for the abuse because he a llowed instructed mps military police to facilitate interrogations by setting conditions which were neither authorized nor in accordance with applicable.setting conditions was a euphemism for using abuse to break the will of a detainee being interrogated.major general taguba found specifically that stephanowicz clearly knew his instructions to mps to set conditions equated to physical abuse.
as information about the taguba report began to emerge,the guardian,a british newspaper,reported on april,that some of the soldiers accused of abuse at abu ghraib claimed to be acting in part under the instruction of mercenary interrogators caci employees hired by the pentagon.in a may,article in the new yorker,torture at abu ghraib,investigative journalist seymour hersh wrote that the taguba report described an abu ghraib where much of the management of the prisoners was abdicated by military police to army units and civilian contract employees,who relied on intimidation and torture to gather intelligence.two months later,on july,hersh spoke at an american civil liberties union conference.there,hersh said that acts that were even more yet to be disclosed by the committed at abu ghraib 
some of the worst things that happened you do know about w omen prisoners at abu ghraib were passing messages out to their families saying please come and kill me because of what happened.and basically what happened is that those women who were arrested with young boys,children,in cases that have been video recorded,the boys were sodomized,with the cameras rolling,and the worst above all of them is the soundtrack of the boys shrieking.
fourth alteration in original.
in august a second army report provided further details of the abuses at abu ghraib.this report the report,issued by major general george fay and lieutenant general anthony jones,focused on the military intelligence brigade assigned to the prison.the report confirmed caci employee involvement in detainee abuse.to begin with,the report revealed that several soldiers at abu ghraib said that they were supervised by caci employees.another soldier indicated that caci employees were in positions of authority,and appeared to be supervising government personnel.the statements were confirmed by a prison organizational chart that showed a caci employee as head of the dab detainee assessment branch,with soldiers as his subordinates.moreover,as the earlier taguba report indicated,the fact that caci and titan employees wore desert camouflage uniforms caused confusion in the chain of command.
the report expanded on the taguba report in describing shameful events of abuse to detainees at abu ghraib that violated criminal law or that w ere inhumane or coercive without lawful justification.according to the report,the abuse,ranging from inhumane to sadistic,was inflicted by a small group of morally corrupt soldiers and civilians,with caci and titan employees making up the latter category.caci or titan employees were responsible in over of the incidents.
the report detailed incidents of abuse inflicted by both military and civilian contractor caci and titan personnel.caci employees bore responsibility in fully,or nine,of these incidents,including the following.one,a caci interrogator,during the questioning of a detainee an iraqi policeman threatened to,and did,call upon an mp to soften up the subject.once enlisted,the mp covered the subject nose and prevented him from breathing for a short time.at another point,the mp used a collapsible nightstick to push or twist the subject arm,causing pain.two,a caci interrogator grab bed a handcuffed detainee from the back of a high vehicle,dropped him on the ground,and dragged him to an interrogation booth.each time the detainee tried to get up,the caci employee would yank him very hard and make him fall again.three,a photograph shows a caci employee and a titan linguist interrogating a detainee who is being forced to squat on a chair,an unauthorized and unsafe stress position.four,at least one caci employee used unmuzzled dogs to facilitate detainee interrogation.in one instance,i t appeared that a caci employee was encouraging and even directing the mp abuse with dogs likely a softening up technique for future interrogations.five,a caci interrogator bragged about shaving the hair and beard of a detainee and forcing him to wear red women underwear.
the report detailed the account of an allegation that a contract interpreter raped a young minor male detainee while a female soldier took pictures.the alleged rapist,who was wearing military clothing,partially matched the description of a titan interpreter.these allegations prompted the army criminal investigation command to open an investigation.
the report pointed out that the international committee of the red cross,which visited abu ghraib,found that many detainees suspected of security offenses or deemed to have intelligence value were subjected to both physical and psychological coercion which in some cases was tantamount to torture in order to force cooperation with their interrogators.internal quotation marks omitted.one detainee death is discussed in the report.the detainee,who was initially under cia control and believed to be an insurgent,had been struck in the head with a rifle butt while resisting arrest.the detainee was brought to abu ghraib and shortly thereafter was found in a shower stall,handcuffed and dead,with a sandbag covering his head.
finally,the report concluded that many of the abu ghraib abuses cited could be criminal,and it recommended that its findings with respect to three caci employees and two titan employees be forwarded to the army general counsel for determination of whether the employees should be referred to the department of justice for prosecution.in commenting on the potential referral for prosecution,the washington post,in an august,article,commented that the report provided the clearest view yet of the role contractors caci and titan played in the prison abuses at abu ghraib.
in late july editor publisher reported that secretary of defense donald rumsfeld had allowed certain members of congress to view photographs and four videos from abu ghraib that the pentagon had blocked from release to the public.secretary rumsfeld described the photographs and videos as show ing acts against detainees that can only be described as blatantly sadistic,cruel and inhumane,and senator lindsey graham indicated that they contained scenes of rape and murder.id.
on august,published an interview with brigadier general janis karpinski,who was at the relevant time in charge of detention facilities in iraq.in the interview karpinski charged that the military intelligence people used torture practices at abu ghraib that were developed and implemented down in guantanamo bay.karpinski had no doubt in her mind that the civilian,caci ordered these things the abuses to be done.the civilian contractors simply ha d a playground at abu ghraib,and they g o t out of control,according to karpinski.id.
the pentagon widespread use of military contractors in iraq attracted scholarly and media attention prior to and while rhodes was airing her shows that are the subject of this case.rhodes read articles on this topic as well,including the following two.in a law review article,peter warren singer,a national security fellow at the brookings institution,wrote about military contractors who sell everything from small teams of commandos to massive military supply operations.singer surveyed current national and international laws and concluded that privatized military services are not effectively regulated.singer found that 
s ome privatized military firms have committed severe abuses in the course of their operations and have been employed by dictatorships,rebel armies,terrorist groups,and drug cartels given the ultimate importance of the field in which they operate and the potential for serious abuses,a particularly worrying aspect is that the industry position in the legal sphere remains ambiguous the result is that privatized military firms comprise one remaining industry whose behavior is dictated not by the rule of law,but by simple economics.
in the new york times magazine published a lengthy article about the use of military or security contractors in iraq.the article discussed the history of mercenary forces,including their involvement on the side of forces in south africa.some contractors,the article reported,draw personnel from south african veterans of the wars to save apartheid,and one contractor once considered providing help to mobutu sese seko,the tyrannical dictator of zaire.
armed with the foregoing information and additional accounts from the media,rhodes,in the period august,through august,devoted parts of her show to the abuses at abu ghraib,the issue of military contractor responsibility for those abuses,and the issue of the pentagon use of military contractors.caci defamation action is based on the following statements that rhodes made on her show 
statement,august,torture and rape at abu ghraib 
t here are rape rooms and we are doing that and it is grotesque and there was no reason to go and the people that are torturing and raping are using our soldiers to film it and that the ones that are being paid to do this are not our troops but it caci and titan and the people who relieved general karpinski of her command in iraq in abu ghraib and the other prison she was in charge of were caci and titan.they were independent contractors and the same independent contractors are doing the same grotesque things to little boys and girls now that we said saddam know 
statement,august,torture and rape of children and misrepresentation of authority 
how about the defense contractors or the oil conglomerates or caci or titan international what their relationship with the president and why are they allowed to torture and rape little children using clerks,who then go to jail for or years and how come you do have a responsibility to report on those trials of those specialists who went to jail for or years,who testified that they believed they were working for their government,and really they were working for caci and titan,as tools.
statement,august,mercenaries fought on side of apartheid and oppressive african regimes 
y ou got to read this new york times magazine article about privatized military companies i t was the cover story,it was the most intensely thing i have ever read.no one dared talk about the mercenaries.no one dared talk about all these companies,blackwater,and caci,and titan,and now this new one,three canopies,that really did even exist until this was started.and then they got this idea,hey let get a department of defense contract and we send killers over there.that exactly what they did.and these no command and control.they do report to anybody.they not loyal to you,they not loyal to me.they not loyal to america.they loyal to the corporation.and they have fought on the side of apartheid,just like cheney used to vote against abolishing apartheid.he loves these guys.these guys literally fought on the side of mobutu who used to chop peop,little children hands off.why did he do that well the purpose of chopping little children hands off was so that they would grow up as walking billboards for a testament to mobutu power to anybody that might even have a thought about deposing the brutal dictator.and these same guys,same people,that are making up these mercenary companies,same ones,are now over in iraq doing whatever.and we have no way,there no law,there no criminal law that applies to them in iraq.there no civil law that applies to them in iraq.
statement,august,unregulated contractors and contractor employees 
but what sickening is if you a mercenary,if you go to work for triple canopy or you go to work for blackwater,first of all,there no laws.you never,ever,ever be.you can do any damn thing you want to,including torture people our soldiers will pay the price,but if you work for a contractor and you a mercenary,a hired killer,it does matter.you can switch sides.you can do whatever you want so for those people that just want to kill for the sake of killing call triple canopy or call blackwater or call caci and titan,especially if you want to torture people,and never have to come under the long arm of the law.i mean,that how you get away with murder y ou got these fricken mercenaries out there just going crazy.and there like of them.and there about of them,but to of them are armed to the teeth and will kill you.
statements to are part of the same discussion on august,but we present them separately,as did the district court.
statement,august,rape and murder at abu ghraib 
so there are more photos of abu ghraib t here are congress people who have seen them and they are disgusted by them.there are videos.and,yes,they clearly show rape and murder and,yes,they show they show the rapes of children and,yes,they show the murder of people who have been caught in these dragnets in iraq.and nobody knows what they done.and a year later some of them who survive it get released,but if you are in when we decide to murder and rape,then that your lot in life,according to what some of these people have said.so here are some of the most disgusting images 
statement,august,contractors misrepresenting authority 
and now we have this documentary,photographic,evidence of some of the really sick,twisted stuff that was ordered by our president and his civilian cabinet that was done and carried out,not by generals and not by military people but were ordered by people who work for private contractors,mercenaries if you will.who then were able to access our kids soldiers and tell our from special forces,from the cia,but you do need to know who we are but we know who you are and you going to do this because this is what we want you to do.
statement,august,contractors misrepresenting authority 
and of course it was the military that was taking control of these kids soldiers.janis karpinski gave an interview,i post the interview.it the most amazing thing how she was shunted aside,told not to go in there anymore,they had control of the prisons and it was obviously the contractors who then misrepresented to our kids who they were and what they were ordered to do.
statement,august,call for official assignment of responsibility for abu ghraib abuses 
unless we actually apologize for these acts,unless we actually have a president of the united states who what been done here and i know who did it and this is who did it and it was caci and it was titan and it was blackwater and it was halliburton and it was bechtel and it was dyncorp.and it was this one and it was it was,and he actually says these people are going to be put on trial and they will be charged with murder,and they will be charged with rape,and they will be charged with molesting children.and they will be charged with crimes against humanity.until and when and if that happens,the recruitment for al qaeda is going to surpass our recruitment capabilities here in the united states.
statements to were part of the same discussion on august.
statement,august,contractors misrepresenting authority 
i was looking at an interview that janis karpinski did with a woman named marjorie cohn.it posted on my website,the,and it right next to the pictures of abu ghraib prison and is the choice we made by the way,abu ghraib.we chose that,and how did we choose it the president let those contractors go in there,and he let those contractors lie to our kids,and those kids believed that those contractors were military intelligence units,that they were cia.but they were.they were.they were employees of caci and titan.
statement,august,unregulated contractors misrepresenting authority 
a ll karpinski kept hearing from the people in iraq is this deteriorated into contractor heaven.mercenaries all over the country,killing people.she said they had no previous training.the ones from caci and titan that were sent to the prison,to abu ghraib,she said.they were supposed to be interrogators sic but that caci and titan had offered them a chance to upgrade their employment to interrogators,and she said it was a deadly mix because they had no training in being interrogators.they were translators.but caci and titan was going to pay them more if they would interrogate the prisoners.so they kicked her out of the compound at night,told her she could travel at night to the cell blocks,could come to abu ghraib at night,and at night,the little mice would play,and they would play rape the boys,and rape the girls,and pile them high,and they use the military people,and they wore military uniforms,too,these contractors.they literally impersonated officers.and no one knows what to do about it because there no freaking law for them w hat you saw were contractors getting their hands dirty.contractors getting their hands bloodied.contractors were the ones that were actually doing the bad stuff,but what you did have in iraq was an executive order,that said there was no law in iraq.so the only law that anybody that wants to prosecute caci and titan,the only believe me,people the only law that they can find to prosecute caci and titan is this obscure department of defense law and they do know what the definition of torture is because of alberto gonzales,and so they do know what to charge them with.
statement,august,rape of children and contractor inexperience 
they the iraqi people say that the raping of their children and the raping of their children in front of them is no different than saddam t hese contractors were supposed to help and be translators,and they became the interrogators and they had no experience doing it,and it became this 
statement,august,contractor employees fought on side of apartheid 
i for getting the mercenaries who are not loyal to your a caller son,are not loyal to this country,do care a thing about democracy,they care about the of triple canopy or blackwater or caci or titan or dyncorp,and they are some of the most notoriously evil people,and they are getting paid with our tax dollars.these are guys that were would find on the side of the government in south africa that wanted to keep apartheid.they fought on the side of the government that was literally chopping off young boys hands because they did want to kill them.they wanted them to be handless as little reminders to everybody,that if you stood up to this government,that what going to happen to you,and they were like walking billboards for tyranny,for treachery,for murder 
statement,august,characterizing contractors as hired killers in a discussion with a caller named david

rhodes they from everywhere,they from dyncorp and caci and titan in the prisons,and then you got triple canopy and blackwater.
in a diversity action filed in district court in virginia,caci sued rhodes and air america for defamation under virginia law.caci alleges that rhodes statements on her show reprinted above accuse the company of,among other things,torture,rape,murder,and misrepresenting its authority with its employees impersonating military personnel at the abu ghraib prison.according to caci,rhodes made the statements with reckless disregard as to whether they were false.
rhodes and air america made a motion for summary judgment,which the district court granted for the following reasons.first,the court concluded that rhodes statements statements,and that caci tortured detainees at abu ghraib are not demonstrably false and hence not defamatory.in the alternative,the district court held that these statements were not made with actual malice.second,the district court concluded that rhodes statements statements,and that caci employees misrepresented their authority at abu ghraib are not demonstrably false.again,the court held in the alternative that these statements were not made with actual malice.third,the district court concluded that rhodes statements statements and that likened caci and other independent contractors operating in iraq,generally,to those that operated in apartheid south africa were hyperbole.fourth,the district court concluded that rhodes statements statements,and regarding caci role in the rape and murder of iraqi detainees at abu ghraib,were hyperbole,failed to assert actual facts about caci,or were not made with actual malice.caci appeals the award of summary judgment to rhodes and air america,and our review is de novo,jennings of,cir en banc.
caci sued rhodes and air america for defamation under virginia law.in virginia a statement is defamatory per se if it,among other circumstances,impute s to a person the commission of some criminal offense involving moral turpitude impute s to a person unfitness to perform the duties of an office or employment of profit,or want of integrity in the discharge of the duties of such an office or employment or prejudice s a person in his or her profession or trade.carwile richmond newspapers.a defamatory charge may be made expressly or by inference,implication or insinuation.id.at.
the application of the state law of defamation is limited,of course,by the first amendment to the constitution of the united states.milkovich lorain journal,d.this appeal turns on the application of two of these limitations the actual malice standard that attaches to media coverage of public officials or public figures and the protection for statements that can not reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts about an individual.the actual malice standard,announced in new york times sullivan,d,is rooted in the first amendment vital guarantee of free and uninhibited discussion of public issues.milkovich,at.the standard ensures that defamation cases involving issues of public concern are considered against the background of a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited,robust,and,and that it may well include vehement,caustic,and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government,public officials,and public figures.new york times,at.see gertz robert welch,d curtis pub.butts,d.accordingly,a public official or public figure can not recover damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with actual malice that is,with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.new york times,at.as we have said,e stablishing actual malice is no easy task,because the defamation plaintiff bears the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence.carr forbes,cir.in reviewing an order granting summary judgment,an appellate court must independently examine the record to determine whether the plaintiff has proffered sufficient evidence to prove actual malice by clear and convincing evidence.see also commc ns,connaughton,d the question whether the evidence in the record in a defamation case is sufficient to support a finding of actual malice is a question of law.
the first amendment also provides protection for statements that can not reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts about an individual.milkovich,at.alteration in original quoting hustler magazine falwell,d.this safeguard includes protection for rhetorical hyperbole,a vigorous epithet and loose,figurative,or hyperbolic language.milkovich,at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the safeguard is necessary to provide assurance that public debate will not suffer for lack of imaginative expression which has traditionally added much to the discourse of our nation.id.at.whether a statement can reasonably be interpreted as stating facts about an it is rhetorical hyperbole,for a question of law.see hatfill new york times,cir the question whether a statement is capable of having a defamatory meaning is a question of law to be decided by the court.
several of rhodes statements that caci claims are about misrepresentation of authority,torture,and rape at abu be analyzed under the new york times actual malice standard we begin with a comment about the importance of the actual malice standard to a and vigorous discussion of critical public issues.rhodes joined in just such a discussion in this instance.the general topic was the initiation and conduct of the war in iraq it included the united states government use of contractors,including caci,to perform certain military functions in the war effort it also included the shocking abuses at abu ghraib and caci role there.rhodes criticism of caci role and conduct was unbridled,caustic,and indignant.
the actual malice rule was prompted by a concern that,with respect to the criticism of public officials in their conduct of governmental affairs,a rule compelling the critic of official conduct to guarantee the truth of all his factual assertions would deter protected speech.milkovich,at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the conduct of the military and its designated civilian surrogates during wartime is a matter of the highest public concern,and speech critical of those responsible for military operations is well within the constitutionally protected area of free discussion.rosenblatt baer,d see also id.criticism of those responsible for government operations must be free,lest criticism of government itself be penalized.new york times united states,d stewart,concurring i t is perhaps here,in the areas of national defense and international affairs,that a press that is alert,aware,and free most vitally serves the basic purpose of the first amendment.for without an informed and free press there can not be an enlightened people.united states morison,cir wilkinson,concurring national security is public security,not government security from informed criticism.no decisions are more serious than those touching on peace and war none are more certain to affect every member of society.the actual malice standard thus offers broad protection for the media commentator who is critical of public officials or public figures responsible for activities.such a commentator must simply maintain a standard of care such as to avoid knowing falsehood or reckless disregard of the truth.time,pape,d.
the district court determined that caci is a public figure because of its prominent role in the circumstances surrounding the events that occurred at abu issue of grave public concern.caci does not contest its status as a public figure.caci became a public figure because the army military intelligence branch was woefully short of interrogators and engaged caci to provide civilian interrogators at abu ghraib.caci surely knew when it accepted the interrogation work that it was potentially exposing itself to the inhospitable climate of media that could be emboldened by the actual malice standard.see gertz,at.stating that the communications media are entitled to act on the assumption that public officials and public figures have voluntarily exposed themselves to increased risk of injury from defamatory falsehood hatfill new york times,cir same.after the shocking pictures of the abu ghraib abuses were broadcast on minutes ii in april,and even more shocking revelations followed,caci became a prime target of media criticism and comment.as the district court aptly noted,h eads of states,public officials,media sources,academics,and individuals throughout the world took note of,and commented on,the events at the abu ghraib prison,where caci played a prominent role.
we first turn to caci claim that rhodes defamed it by making statements on her show that its employees misrepresented their authority to soldiers at abu ghraib.in statement on august,rhodes said l ow level specialists testified that they believed they were working for their government,and really they were working for caci and titan,as tools.in statement on august rhodes indicated that contractor employees misrepresented their authority to our kids soldiers and ordered some of the really sick,twisted stuff at abu ghraib.in statement on august rhodes said i t was obviously the contractors who misrepresented to our kids who they were and what they were ordered to do.in statement on august rhodes said the president let those contractors go in there at abu ghraib,and he let those contractors lie to our kids,and those kids believed that those contractors were military intelligence units,that they were cia.but they were.they were.they were employees of caci and titan.moments later in statement,while discussing the role of caci and titan employees at abu ghraib,rhodes continued t hey wore military uniforms,too,these contractors.they literally impersonated officers.
the district court concluded that the and taguba reports gave rhodes reasonable grounds to make claims that caci employees either directed united states military personnel or acted in the capacity of united states personnel when directing military personnel.therefore,the district court concluded that rhodes statements about caci employees misrepresenting their authority and inappropriately assuming positions of authority were not made with actual malice.we conclude that the two military reports,together with other sources,support the district court determination.
brigadier general karpinski,in her interview,insisted that volumes of documents and information confirmed that the soldiers implicated in the abu ghraib abuses were acting on the orders of both military intelligence personnel and contract interrogators.the guardian newspaper reported that some of the soldiers accused of abuse at abu ghraib claimed to be acting in part under the instruction of contract interrogators.the report found that contractors were supervising soldiers and vice versa and that the contractors presence was a complicating factor with respect to command and control at abu ghraib.this finding was supported by a prison organizational chart showing a caci employee as head of the detainee assessment branch at abu ghraib,with soldiers as his subordinates.similarly,seymour hersh,the investigative journalist,reported that military police had abdicated the management of detainees to military intelligence and contractor personnel.the taguba report found that contractors wore military desert camouflage uniforms,which cause d confusion and may have contributed to the difficulties in the accountability process.further,the taguba report accused caci employee stephanowicz of allowing or instructing soldiers to use interrogation techniques that were neither authorized nor in accordance with applicable,and of bearing responsibility for the abuses.in sum,as the district court concluded,rhodes sources revealed that caci employees inappropriately assumed positions of authority over,and gave orders to,soldiers.
caci contends that the fact that its employees issued instructions to soldiers is irrelevant.rather,caci argues that rhodes sources gave her no basis whatsoever for accusing caci employees of misrepresenting their authority to soldiers or impersonating officers in the sense that they wore military uniforms while they supervised soldiers.appellants br.caci is simply wrong.rhodes sources are susceptible to at least two rational interpretations with respect to the misrepresentation of authority issue and a speaker or publisher may adopt one of a number of possible rational interpretations of sources that contain ambiguities without creating a jury issue of actual malice.pape,at.it would be rational to interpret rhodes sources to suggest simply that soldiers took orders from caci employees knowing they were contractors.on the other hand,it would be equally,if not more,rational to read the sources to suggest that caci employees were misrepresenting their authority to soldiers.for example,the two army reports indicated that caci employees had inserted themselves into the chain of command by giving orders to soldiers and,by wearing military uniforms,had caused confusion that led to difficulties in accountability.it was rational for rhodes to interpret these reports to be saying that the contractors had no legitimate authority in the chain of command and that the contractor employees who gave orders to soldiers both overstepped and misrepresented their authority.accordingly,rhodes did not speak with reckless disregard for the truth when she accused caci employees of misrepresenting their authority to soldiers.
on august,while speaking on her show about the treatment of iraqi detainees at abu ghraib,rhodes said in statement t he people that are torturing are not our troops but it caci and titan.the district court,in considering this statement,held that there was sufficient information in rhodes sources to prevent caci from establishing that she spoke with actual malice.according to the court,caci could not establish that rhodes recklessly disregarded the truth when alleging that caci employees had tortured iraqi detainees.we agree.
rhodes maintains that she used the word torture in statement to describe the severe abuse that caci bore responsibility for at abu ghraib,according to her sources.caci argues that abuse is not a synonym for torture and that rhodes must be held to have accused caci of torture in the sense that word is used in the criminal code.the code defines torture as an act specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions.however,the dictionary definitions of torture range from any severe physical or mental pain,webster new world college dictionary ed,to torment or an extreme annoyance or severe irritation,webster third new international dictionary.we conclude that a reasonable listener would have understood that rhodes was not using the word torture in any narrow,legalistic sense,but in a broader sense that encompassed the range of severe abuses at abu ghraib that had been reported in the media and other sources through photographs and narrative descriptions.see masson new yorker magazine,d noting that a court considers the meaning a statement conveys to a reasonable reader.
rhodes relied on several reliable sources in accusing caci of torture at the abu ghraib prison.the author of the taguba report,commissioned by the army,strongly suspected that caci employee stephanowicz was one of four individuals who were either directly or indirectly responsible for the abuses at abu ghraib.the taguba report went beyond suspicion to find that stephanowicz was responsible for abuse when he a llowed instructed mps to facilitate interrogations by setting conditions which were neither authorized nor in accordance with applicable.the report found specifically that stephanowicz clearly knew his instructions to mps to set conditions equated to physical abuse.emphasis added.the physical abuse documented by the taguba report included punching and kicking detainees pouring phosphoric liquid on detainees sodomizing a detainee with a chemical light and perhaps a broomstick allowing a military dog to bite a detainee stacking naked male detainees,handcuffed and shackled,in piles and forcibly requiring male detainees to participate in group masturbation.in sum,the taguba report found that numerous incidents of sadistic,blatant,and wanton criminal abuses were inflicted on several detainees.
rhodes also relied on the report,another report commissioned by the army.the report found abuse at abu ghraib that was inhumane,sadistic,coercive without lawful justification,or a violat ion of criminal law.the abuse was inflicted by a small group of morally corrupt soldiers and civilians employed by caci and titan,according to the report.the report detailed incidents of abuse at abu ghraib,finding that caci employees were involved in nine.among the nine incidents,a caci interrogator attempted to coerce information from a detainee by enlisting an mp who prevented the detainee from breathing for a short time and twisted the detainee arm into a painful position,using a nightstick a caci employee interrogated a detainee who was forced into an unauthorized stress position squatting on a chair and a caci employee used unmuzzled military dogs to facilitate interrogations.the report recommended that its findings with respect to three caci employees be forwarded to the army general counsel for potential referral to the department of justice for prosecution.finally,reported that the international committee of the red cross,which visited abu ghraib,noted that many detainees suspected of security offenses or deemed to have intelligence value were subjected to both physical and psychological coercion which in some cases was tantamount to torture in order to force cooperation with their interrogators.emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.
rhodes also relied on another organization published interview with brigadier general janis karpinski who was in charge of abu ghraib when the abuses occurred.karpinski had no doubt in her mind that the civilian contractors,caci and titan,ordered the abuses at abu ghraib.according to karpinski,the civilian contractors were irresponsible and people who used abu ghraib as a playground,and they g o t out of control.id.in addition to the official army reports and the karpinski interview,reputable press reports,which rhodes followed,indicated that civilian contractors bore significant responsibility for the abuses at abu ghraib.
many of the abuses described above could reasonably be characterized as causing severe physical or mental pain.webster new world college dictionary.and,in light of the extensive information that rhodes relied on with respect to caci role and conduct at abu ghraib,we conclude that caci has not proffered clear and convincing evidence that rhodes spoke with actual malice when she accused caci of torturing detainees at the prison.see carr forbes,at.in sum,the record establishes that rhodes did not make any statement that caci committed torture with reckless disregard as to whether the statement was false or not.see new york times,at.
in statement rhodes also referred to rape at abu ghraib,saying,the people that are raping,that is,the ones that are being paid to do this are not our troops but it caci and titan.the district court determined that rhodes sources provided sufficient support for this statement to preclude a finding that rhodes spoke with reckless disregard for the truth.we agree.
the taguba and reports and brigadier general karpinski concluded that caci employees bore a substantial measure of responsibility for the abuses at abu ghraib.both the taguba and reports listed rape and forced sodomy as among the atrocities committed against detainees.a senator who viewed the photographs and videos of abu ghraib abuses said that they contained scenes of rape and murder.the guardian reported that a civilian contractor had been accused of raping a young male detainee.the rape of a teenage male detainee by a civilian contractor is also discussed in the report,which mentions a titan employee as a likely suspect.the taguba report found that a male detainee was sodomized with a chemical light and perhaps a broomstick.the sources did not connect any caci employee to any specific incident of rape or sodomy.nevertheless,the taguba report found that caci employee stephanowicz was responsible for encouraging abuse at abu ghraib and was likely responsible,along with three others,for the entire pattern of abuse at the that included rape and sodomy.moreover,several sources reported that caci employees assumed a supervisory role at the prison,and at least some caci employees had a propensity to abuse or encourage soldiers to abuse detainees.in light of the information available to rhodes,we conclude that caci can not prove that her statement that caci was responsible for rape was made with reckless disregard for the truth.
in certain statements rhodes accused caci of responsibility for the rape or torture of children at abu ghraib.in statement on august,during a discussion of the abu ghraib abuses,rhodes said and the same independent contractors are doing the same grotesque things to little boys and girls now that we said was.in statement on august,rhodes asked how about the defense contractors or the oil conglomerates or caci or titan international w hy are they allowed to torture and rape little children using military clerks,who then go to jail for or years.in statement on august,after discussing the karpinski interview and the role of caci and titan at abu ghraib,rhodes said they the iraqi people say that the raping of their children and the raping of their children in front of them is no different than saddam.it incredible s he karpinski explains how this went and how they did it and that they were paid in cash,these contractors.
rhodes accusation about child rape has two components that children were raped at abu ghraib and that caci bore responsibility for the rape.rhodes sources provide support for each component of the accusation.with respect to child rape at abu ghraib,an article in the guardian discussed a civilian contractor rape of a male detainee who was in his,and the report included allegations of the rape of a male detainee aged fifteen to eighteen by a civilian,who partially matched the description of a titan interpreter.these reports may involve the same incident.in addition,during a speech to the aclu,investigative journalist seymour hersh,in discussing theretofore undisclosed atrocities at abu ghraib,said 
some of the worst things that happened that you do know about and basically what happened is that those women detained at abu ghraib who were arrested with young boys,children,in cases that have been video recorded,the boys were sodomized,with the cameras rolling,and the worst above all of them is the soundtrack of the boys shrieking.
final alteration in original.
rhodes assignment of blame to caci and titan for the rape of children at abu ghraib begins with her reliance on several sources,the taguba and reports and the karpinski interview,all of which indicate a collapse of order at abu ghraib.these sources suggest that caci contributed to this collapse when its employees improperly assumed supervisory roles and encouraged or instructed mps to abuse detainees major general taguba stated his belief that caci employee stephanowicz was directly or indirectly responsible for the horrific abuses suffered by the detainees at abu ghraib.these abuses would surely include the rape of children.
we are quite mindful that the accusation that a government contractor,or indeed any public figure,bears responsibility for child rape is a grave one.the first amendment,however,bars liability for such a defamatory accusation absent clear and convincing proof that the speaker made the accusation with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.new york times,at.the supreme court has made clear that reckless conduct is not measured by whether a reasonably prudent person would have published or spoken,or would have investigated before publishing or speaking.amant thompson,d.instead,there must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defamatory statement was made with a high degree of awareness of its probable falsity.garrison louisiana,d.again,rhodes relied on several sources for the child rape allegation.of course,simple reliance upon someone else statement does not absolve an author or publisher of liability.recklessness may be found where there are obvious reasons to doubt the veracity of the informant or the accuracy of his reports.fitzgerald penthouse int l,cir internal quotation marks omitted.rhodes relied on the hersh speech,the report,and the guardian article for her statement that the rape of children or juveniles occurred at abu ghraib.she relied on the taguba report and brigadier general karpinski interview for the point that caci bore general responsibility for the horrific abuses at abu ghraib,abuses that would include the rape of children.there is no evidence to suggest that these sources provided unreliable information or that rhodes had obvious reasons to doubt what they said.see fitzgerald,at.accordingly,we conclude that a reasonable jury could not find that rhodes spoke with reckless disregard for the truth when she accused caci of responsibility for the rape of children.
several of rhodes statements that caci challenges as defamatory are not actionable because they do not assert actual facts about caci.as we noted above,the first amendment protects statements that can not reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts about an individual or entity.milkovich,at.alteration in original citation and internal quotation marks omitted.this category of protection allows for rhetorical hyperbole and other types of imaginative or exaggerated expression.see id.
in several statements rhodes,with free use of hyperbole and exaggeration,criticized the extensive use of military contractors in iraq,saying that their employees could kill without being held to account.in statement on august,rhodes said 
no one dared talk about the mercenaries.no one dared talk about all these companies,blackwater,and caci,and titan,and now this new one,three canopies,that really did even exist until this was started.and then they got this idea,hey let get a department of defense contract and we send killers over there.
in statement on august,in the context of a conversation about military recruitment,rhodes said 
but what sickening is if you a mercenary,if you go to work for triple canopy or you go to work for blackwater,first of all,there no laws.you never,ever,ever be.you can do any damn thing you want to,including torture people.you can do a zone situation where you shoot at anybody you want to you can do whatever you want so for those people that just want to kill for the sake of killing call triple canopy or call blackwater or call caci and titan,especially if you want to torture people,and never have to come under the long arm of the law.i mean,that how you get away with murder y ou got these fricken mercenaries over there just going crazy.and there like of them.and there about of them,but to of them are armed to the teeth and will kill you.
in statement on august,while discussing the karpinski interview,rhodes said a ll she karpinski kept hearing from the people in iraq is this deteriorated into contractor heaven.mercenaries all over the country,killing people.according to rhodes,karpinski said it was a deadly mix at abu ghraib because caci and titan had no training in being interrogators.id.in statement on august,rhodes spoke with a caller named david 
rhodes you know you got guys over there making,what,three thousand dollars a week,three hundred dollars a day.
david yeah the contractors.
rhodes yeah,do call them contractors,call them what they are,they hired killers,they mercenaries.
david hired killers,yeah.
rhodes yeah,they hired killers.
david hired killers from halliburton.
rhodes they from everywhere,they from dyncorp and caci and titan in the prisons,and then you got triple canopy and blackwater.
in statement rhodes says that contractors such as caci,in contemplating work in iraq,expected to send killers over there.here,rhodes was offering a permissible hyperbolic characterization of the work contractors would perform in iraq,using tough,aggressive individuals who might be required to use lethal force.in statement rhodes in anyone wishing to torture,kill,or murder should go to work for one of the contractors such as triple canopy,blackwater,caci,or titan.t hese freakin mercenaries,she said,were armed to the teeth and will kill you,and can do whatever they want and never have to come under the long arm of the law.emphasis added.here,rhodes was using hyperbole and exaggeration to make the point,which was well supported by her sources including the singer law review article,that current laws are ineffective in regulating military contractors operating abroad.
the district court concluded that rhodes characterizations of iraq as having deteriorated into contractor heaven with m ercenaries all over the country,killing people statement,and characterizing a list of contractors,including caci,as hired killers statement,were quintessential examples of rhetorical hyperbole.these statements are protected,the court concluded,because they make clear to all reasonable listeners that they are offered not as fact s,but as exaggerated rhetoric intended to spark the debate about the wisdom of the use of contractors in iraq.
we agree with the district court and conclude that nothing highlighted above from statements,or supports a claim for defamation by caci.
caci contends that rhodes accused it of fighting on the side of apartheid and mobutu,the former dictator in zaire.on two occasions,in denouncing the use of contractors in iraq,rhodes mentioned that some individuals now working for contractors in iraq had fought on the side of the apartheid and mobutu regimes.in statement on august,while discussing the new york times magazine article on the use of military contractors in iraq and earlier conflicts,rhodes said 
no one dared talk about all these companies,blackwater,and caci,and titan,and now this new one,three canopies,that really did even exist until this was started and these people they not loyal to america.they loyal to the corporation.and they have fought on the side of apartheid these guys literally fought on the side of mobutu who used to chop peop,little children hands off and these same guys,same people,that are making up these mercenary companies,same ones,are now over in iraq doing whatever.
in statement on august,rhodes repeated her point 
i for getting the mercenaries who are making a week out of there,who
