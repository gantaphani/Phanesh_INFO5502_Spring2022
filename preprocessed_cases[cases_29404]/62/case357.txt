background 
frank wuterich is a staff sergeant in the marine corps,who in november led a squad stationed in iraq.on november,a roadside bomb detonated in the city of haditha,killing a member of wuterich squad.in the fighting that followed,two dozen iraqi civilians were killed.
on august,wuterich filed suit against john murtha,the congressman from pennsylvania twelfth congressional district and member of the house appropriations committee subcommittee on defense,for libel,invasion of light,and republication of defamatory statements by third parties.according to wuterich,congressman murtha gave a series of interviews to the media in the wake of the haditha incident,during which he made defamatory comments about the role of wuterich squad in the deaths of the iraqi civilians.wuterich specifically alleges that congressman murtha was one of several members of congress briefed on the ongoing investigation into the deaths at haditha in the spring of and that,based on inaccurate information learned during these briefings,congressman murtha made statements about the marines involved in the incident to national public radio and cnn,among other media outlets.wuterich further alleges that congressman murtha statements to the press provide the impression,implicitly or explicitly,that ssgt wuterich and others deliberately murdered innocent iraqi civilians in a massacre and inappropriately compared the tragic events of haditha with the infamous war crimes and deliberate massacre of civilians at my lai in vietnam.compl.in addition,wuterich claims that congressman murtha comments were made outside of the scope of his employment as a congressman and were intended to serve his own private purposes and interests.id.
on may,the attorney general designee invoked the westfall act and certified that united states congressman john murtha was acting within the scope of his employment as an employee of the united states at the time of the alleged incidents.westfall certification may,reprinted in joint appendix.upon filing the certification,the united states and congressman murtha moved to substitute the united states as the defendant and to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the united states had not waived sovereign immunity for wuterich tort claims.see mot.to substitute def.and dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction may,h excepting a ny claim arising out of libel or slander from the federal government waiver of sovereign immunity.along with this motion,the united states and congressman murtha submitted a declaration from congressman murtha former communications director cynthia abram,who stated that three of the media interviews were taped in pennsylvania when the congressman was in his congressional district during a district work period.abram decl.may.the abram declaration stated that the interviews were not campaign related and explained that they were conducted in congressman murtha campaign office because that office was easily accessible to the broadcasters.
at the september,hearing on the government motion,wuterich counsel asserted to the district court that he had alleged sufficient facts to rebut the government certification and to obtain discovery,including a deposition of congressman murtha and five or so document production requests.mot.hr g tr.in particular,wuterich counsel noted that he had learned just that morning from a potential witness that congressman murtha was personally offended that of defense donald rumsfeld had refused to meet with him and was using the haditha comments to embarrass rumsfeld.id.at.
at the close of the hearing,the following exchange took place 
the court i am unable at this stage to know exactly where the lines should be drawn i would be personally much more comfortable if i knew a few more of the facts so that i could write a decision that distinguished those facts to say okay,here this line and here this line and i think i need to let the plaintiff at least take limited discovery,totally limited to scope of employment.not anything else.not anything else.just scope of employment.that is a deposition from the congressman and some document requests.i think we can limit it to that.
government your honor,i understand that where you going.but i would say that in order to do that,your honor,the law requires you to find that he has alleged facts to create a material dispute.
the court well,i find that he has alleged,not in the complaint,but here he has alleged facts that congressman murtha was not acting in a,as he did in order to advance his legislative agenda or his desire to withdraw the troops but instead harping on haditha as a way to embarrass the secretary of defense.whether that within a congressman scope of employment is also arguable.
id.at,emphasis added.in a minute order entered the day of the hearing,the district court reiterated that plaintiff could conduct discovery limited to the issue of whether congressman murtha was acting in the scope of his employment at the time he made the alleged defamatory statements.minute entry order,wuterich murtha.
following the hearing,wuterich noticed congressman murtha deposition and served document production requests seeking each and every document relating or referring to the incident at haditha,as well as each and every document relating or referring to every conversation congressman murtha had with any person regarding the incident at haditha.order at,wuterich murtha,citation omitted.on november,congressman murtha and the united states appealed the district court denial of the attorney general certification and several days later moved to stay the order pending appeal.on december,the district court granted the stay,recognizing that once congressman murtha submits to the deposition ordered by this court,his appeal of that order may become moot.id.at.
ii.analysis 
a.the westfall act framework 
the federal employees liability reform and tort compensation act of,commonly known as the westfall act,accords federal employees absolute immunity from tort claims arising out of acts they undertake in the course of their official duties.osborn,at.citing b.the westfall act core purpose,as the supreme court has explained,is to relieve covered employees from the cost and effort of defending the lawsuit,and to place those burdens on the government shoulders.id.at.in pertinent part,the westfall act provides 
upon certification by the attorney general that the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose,any civil action or proceeding commenced upon such claim in a united states district court shall be deemed an action against the united states under the provisions of this title and all references thereto,and the united states shall be substituted as the party defendant.
d.thus,when a federal employee is named in a tort suit,the attorney general or his designee may certify that the employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose.see also.upon the attorney general certification,the federal employee is dismissed from the case and the united states is substituted as the defendant in place of the employee.d.thereafter,the suit is governed by the federal tort claims act ftca and is subject to all of the ftca exceptions for actions in which the government has not waived sovereign immunity.osborn,at.when one of these exceptions applies,the attorney general certification converts the tort suit into a ftca action over which the federal court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and has the effect of altogether barring plaintiff case.
a plaintiff may contest the attorney general certification before a district court.gutierrez de martinez lamagno,d holding that certification is subject to judicial review.once a plaintiff advances this argument,the certification constitute s prima facie evidence that the employee was acting within the scope of his employment.council on am.islamic relations ballenger,per curiam.to rebut the certification and obtain discovery,a plaintiff must alleg e sufficient facts that,taken as true,would establish that the defendant actions exceeded the scope of his employment.stokes,at.if a plaintiff meets this pleading burden,he may,if necessary,attain limited discovery to resolve any factual disputes over jurisdiction.id.at.
this court has made it clear that n ot every complaint will warrant further inquiry into the issue.id.at.consequently,where a plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts to rebut the certification,the united states must be substituted as the defendant because the federal employee is absolutely immune from suit.the parties agree that if the certification is not successfully rebutted in this case,wuterich action must be dismissed because his claims fall within the ftca exception for claims arising out of libel or slander.h.see appellee br.at noting that upon substitution t he case would then proceed under the ftca,which confers immunity to the government for claims of libel and slander appellants br.at same mem.of law in support of pl.opp to mot.to substitute def.and dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction at june,wuterich agrees that if the united states is properly substituted as the defendant in place of murtha,his lawsuit stops there.
b.the jurisdiction of this court 
wuterich contends that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal,because the district court denial of certification pending discovery is not a final decision under.we disagree.
in this case,appellate jurisdiction to review the district court denial of certification pending discovery arises pursuant to the collateral order doctrine of cohen beneficial industrial loan.under the collateral order doctrine,an interlocutory order qualifies as final under if it conclusively determine s the disputed question,resolve s an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.will hallock,d bracketed numbers in original quoting puerto rico aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d.
application of the collateral order doctrine to the district court denial of certification is controlled by the supreme court decision in osborn haley,d.in osborn,the court held that the denial of a westfall act certification by a district court,like the denials of various other immunity defenses,is an immediately appealable collateral order.at.see also puerto rico aqueduct sewer,at.denial of claim of eleventh amendment immunity immediately appealable mitchell forsyth,d same for qualified immunity nixon fitzgerald,d same for absolute presidential immunity kilburn socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,same for foreign sovereign immunity united states rostenkowski,same for speech or debate clause immunity.the osborn court explained that the denial of certification qualified for collateral order review because it 
effectively denied the defendant the protection afforded by the westfall act,a measure designed to immunize covered federal employees not simply from liability,but from suit conclusively decided a contested issue the issue decided is important and separate from the merits of the action and the district court disposition would be effectively unreviewable later in the litigation.
osborn,at.citing cohen,at.in other words,by erroneously permitting the plaintiff to proceed against an absolutely immune official,the district court order subjects the employee to the burden of defending a suit,a burden from which the westfall act spares him.id.at.citation,brackets,and ellipsis omitted.
the district court order denying certification pending discovery is not materially distinguishable from the order at issue in osborn.first,by authorizing discovery notwithstanding congressman murtha claim that he was acting within the scope of his employment,the order conclusively determined that the congressman was not entitled to invoke the protections of the westfall act to avoid discovery.in addition,by effectively den ying congressman murtha the absolute immunity from suit guaranteed by the westfall act,the order resolved an important issue separate from the merits of wuterich defamation case.id.at.finally,if wuterich is erroneously permitted to depose congressman murtha and conduct document discovery,the district court order will be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.see id.at.noting that the core purpose of the westfall act is to relieve covered employees from the cost and effort of defending the lawsuit,and to place those burdens on the government shoulders.as the court has recognized,a rejection of even a qualified immunity plea is immediately appealable because that defense entitles government officials not merely to avoid standing trial,but also to avoid the burdens of such pretrial matters as discovery,as i nquiries of this kind can be particularly disruptive of effective government.behrens pelletier,d alterations in original internal quotation marks and citations omitted.this principle has even stronger force in the present case,since the westfall act confers absolute,not merely qualified,immunity upon federal employees acting within the scope of their official duties.
moreover,the fact that the district court denied the government certification pending discovery in no way limits congressman murtha right to seek appellate review.as noted above,there is no right to even limited discovery in a westfall act case unless and until a plaintiff alleges sufficient facts to rebut the governmen
