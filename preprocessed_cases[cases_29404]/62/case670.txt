this case requires us to examine two sections of the veterans benefits act of vba,and to determine whether,under section of the act,we have jurisdiction to decide the case before us,and whether,under section,the court of appeals for veterans claims properly decided the case before it.
the veteran in this case,albert wilson,seeks review of the decision of the court of appeals for veterans claims on his application for fees and expenses pursuant to the equal access to justice act eaja.the court of appeals for veterans claims granted his application,but awarded less than the amount he requested for the practitioner who had worked on his case.on appeal to this court,wilson argues that the court of appeals for veterans claims wrongly failed to consider the effect of section of the vba on such awards.
the government contends that,because wilson did not argue below that section had any effect on his case,this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the matter,citing section of the vba.the government further argues that,even if we have jurisdiction over the appeal,prudential considerations suggest that we should decline to address the section issue.
we conclude that we have jurisdiction under section to decide whether the court of appeals for veterans claims wrongly failed to apply the correct law as announced in section.we further conclude that in the exercise of our discretion we should entertain wilson appeal even though he did not raise the section issue below.because the court of appeals for veterans claims erred in its understanding of the applicable law,we vacate the judgment of the court and remand for reconsideration of wilson eaja award.
background 
the dates on which various events occurred are key to understanding the issue in the case.in april wilson filed a claim with the board of veterans appeals board seeking an increase in his disability rating.the board denied the claim,and wilson appealed to the court of appeals for veterans claims.in september,in response to a joint motion filed by the parties pointing out administrative errors made by the board,the court of appeals for veterans claims vacated the board decision and remanded for further proceedings.
shortly thereafter wilson filed with the court of appeals for veterans claims an application for an award of reasonable fees and expenses under the equal access to justice act,d.he sought compensation for work by practitioner james stewart,who is admitted to practice before the court of appeals for veterans claims under that court rule b,and for work by supervising attorney barton stichman wilson requested fees for stewart work at an hourly rate of the eaja application included affidavits indicating that was the prevailing market rate for litigation work done by a senior litigation paralegal with stewart knowledge and experience.veterans in eight previous cases before the court of appeals for veterans claims had sought,and been awarded,per hour for stewart work.the secretary of veterans affairs secretary,the respondent in these claims cases,did not contest the eaja applications in any of those eight cases.see appellant br.at.
the secretary responded to wilson application by acknowledging that wilson satisfied the requirements for an eaja award,but contested the hourly rate requested for stewart work.the secretary asserted that the appropriate hourly rate was,the market rate for work performed by paralegals and law clerks according to the scale the department of justice uses to calculate fees for cases in washington,dc.
on december,sections and of the veterans benefits act of became law.on december,six days after enactment of the vba,a panel of the court of appeals for veterans claims granted wilson eaja application.wilson principi.the court awarded fees for the work performed by practitioner stewart at the rate of per hour.in explaining that per hour was a reasonable rate,the majority analogized the work of a supervised practitioner to that of a paralegal or law student supervised by an attorney,and refused to consider stewart extensive experience and expertise.id.at.in dissent,chief judge kramer stated that the appellant had presented significant evidence to demonstrate that the prevailing market rate for services provided by a practitioner with stewart experience exceeded per hour.id.at.in february,the court of appeals for veterans claims denied wilson motion for reconsideration.wilson principi.wilson timely filed a notice of appeal with this court in april.
while wilson eaja application was wending its way through the system,the court of appeals for veterans claims had stayed proceedings in another eaja application case in which the veteran,abbey,had also requested fees for stewart work at the rate of per hour.after issuing its initial decision in wilson case in december,the court lifted the stay in the abbey case and ordered the parties to submit briefing explaining why the prevailing market rate for stewart services should not be per hour.after the parties filed their briefs,the court in may requested additional briefing on the effect of section of the veterans benefits act of which as noted had been enacted on december,on the court authority to award eaja fees for the work of stewart in that case and the work of in general.abbey principi.
after receiving the parties submissions,the court of appeals for veterans claims in september granted abbey eaja application in full,including fees for work performed by stewart at the rate of per hour.abbey principi.the court simultaneously granted the eaja application of another veteran who had used stewart services,again at the hourly rate.pentecost principi.in both cases the court held that the enactment of section of the vba requires a different outcome from that in wilson.abbey.at pentecost.at.
in abbey and pentecost the court interpreted section,which grants the court of appeals for veterans claims the authority to award fees and expenses of practitioners in an amount determined appropriate by the court,as recognition of the unique role of practitioners appearing before the court the statute thus permits the court to consider a particular practitioner level of experience and expertise when determining a reasonable and appropriate fee.abbey.at pentecost.at.based on stewart experience representing over appellants before the court after a year career working for the disabled american veterans,the court of appeals for veterans claims readily approved fees for stewart at the hourly rate.
the secretary did not appeal the abbey and pentecost decisions to this court.relying on those decisions,the court of appeals for veterans claims has since awarded fees for stewart services at the hourly rate in other cases,as indicated in a number of nonprecedential opinions issued during the last year.see appellant reply br.addendum.in many of those cases,as in abbey and pentecost and also in the case before us,stewart work was performed prior to the december enactment of the vba.more recently,the court of appeals for veterans claims awarded fees for work performed by stewart after the enactment of the vba at the rate of per hour,an increase over the previously approved rate based on the change in the consumer price index during the relevant time period.evington principi.
because of the happenstance of the timing,the abbey and pentecost decisions had no effect on the eaja fees awarded to wilson,since by the time those cases were decided in september the court of appeals for veterans claims had already entered judgment in his case,and he had filed a notice of appeal with this court.after the appeal was filed,this court in june stayed the briefing schedule and directed wilson to show cause why his appeal should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.in august,after reviewing the parties submissions regarding jurisdiction,a judge of this court lifted the stay of the briefing schedule and deferred the issue of jurisdiction to the merits panel.
then,shortly after the abbey and pentecost decisions issued in september,counsel for wilson contacted government counsel,offering to file with this court a joint motion to vacate the judgment below and remand for reco
