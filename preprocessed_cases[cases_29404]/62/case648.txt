rothe development corporation rothe appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the western district of texas.the primary issue in this appeal is the district court grant of summary judgment to the united states department of defense and the united states department of the air force collectively,the government on rothe claim of facial unconstitutionality as to the presently applicable,reauthorization of section of the national defense authorization act of,stat,codified at,as amended by the bob stump national defense authorization act for fiscal year,stat.see rothe dev.united states dep t of,d rothe iv.the government urges that we lack jurisdiction over this constitutional issue because it is unripe for adjudication and for other reasons.also at issue are the district court holdings that rothe damages and claims are moot,as well as the district court denial of rothe motion for attorney fees related to other claims on which rothe prevailed.
this case was submitted for decision after oral argument on march.we hold that we do have jurisdiction to consider the facial constitutionality of the present reauthorization of section but that the record is inadequate to decide the issue because the district court declined to provide the necessary opportunity to expand the record despite explicit remand instructions.we,therefore,have no option but,once again,to vacate and remand to the district court for necessary development of the evidentiary record.we further hold that rothe damages claim is not moot but its equitable award of a contract claim is moot.finally,we hold that because rothe did not preserve for appeal its contention that the district court erred in denying its request for attorney fees,the denial stands.

because we extensively discussed the factual and legal background of this case in rothe iii,we need not repeat the details here.see rothe iii,at.in short,rothe alleges that it was denied equal protection under the fifth amendment due process clause by the enactment and application of section,which provides certain benefits to businesses controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals sdbs.section sets a goal that five percent of the total dollar amount of defense contracts per year be awarded to sdbs.regulations enacted pursuant to section provide mechanisms for achieving that goal.the mechanism most important in this case is the adjustment,which authorized a contracting agency of the department of defense to raise the bid of bidders by as much as ten percent.
section was originally enacted for a time period to end in.prior to the most recent reauthorization,section was reauthorized in for the period from to,in for the period from to,and in for the period from to.see rothe iii,at collecting citations to prior reauthorizations.most recently,in december,section was reauthorized through september.bob stump national defense authorization act for fiscal year,stat.
rothe alleges that it was harmed by the application of section to the bidding process for a contract for services with an oklahoma air force base in.although rothe submitted the lowest bid,it lost the contract to international computer and telecommunications,ict when rothe bid was increased by ten percent because ict qualified as an sdb and rothe did not.rothe brought suit in federal district court alleging,inter alia,that section is unconstitutional as enacted and applied.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the government.rothe i,d at.
in rothe iii,we reversed the district court judgment,holding that the district court did not properly apply strict scrutiny in analyzing the constitutionality of section and that it erred in relying on evidence that the various reauthorizations of section under consideration.at.on remand,the district court held that rothe claim to damages and to an equitable award of the contract were moot.on the merits,the district court held that the reauthorization of section in was facially unconstitutional but the present,reauthorization was not.rothe iv,d at.because the government did not appeal the district court decision as to the invalidity of the reauthorization,only the present reauthorization is before us on appeal.the district court also denied rothe request for attorney fees.
rothe filed a timely notice of appeal from the final judgment of the district court and we have jurisdiction under a.
rothe has made claims for a damages,b an equitable award of the contract,and c a declaration that section is facially unconstitutional.the government argues that jurisdiction is lacking for each of these claims for one or more of the following reasons the claim is moot,rothe lacks standing to assert the claim,and the claim is unripe.
considering first rothe claim to damages,the district court held,and the government argues on appeal,that jurisdiction over rothe damages claim is lacking on mootness grounds because the government has already tendered the maximum amount to which rothe could be entitled in general,a claim must be dismissed as moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.city of erie pap,d internal quotation omitted.the tender of the entire amount of damages claimed by a plaintiff moots the damages claim.allen revivals,campbell,cir per curiam holstein city of chicago,cir once the defendant offers to satisfy the plaintiff entire demand,there is no dispute over which to litigate internal quotation omitted.
in this case,the district court held that rothe damages claim is moot because the government tendered,which is the maximum amount available to rothe for a little tucker act claim,see a,and the maximum amount claimed in the first amended complaint.rothe disagrees,contending that was never paid by the government or accepted by rothe.rothe thus disputes both whether a tender was made and whether a tender,if made,was accepted.addressing the latter contention first,rothe claimed of a tender is irrelevant because a plaintiff may not prolong a case merely by refusing to accept a valid tender.holstein,at holding that a plaintiff may not spurn this offer of all the damages he is owed and proceed to trial.
the questions remains,however,whether a valid tender was made by the government.the essential characteristics of a tender are an unconditional offer to tender,coupled with a manifested ability to carry out the offer,and production of the subject matter of the tender.constr.westinghouse,cir internal quotation omitted.
because the facts surrounding the government alleged tender of are not described in sufficient detail in the district court summary judgment order or the record on appeal,we questioned the parties at oral argument.government counsel stated 
t he government did offer to rothe,submitted a letter stating that it would satisfy tucker act damages of.there is a letter to that effect that was written by the employment litigation division of doj that was sent to rothe i presume that rothe either rejected it or did not respond because i do know of any reply that rothe made.
even assuming government counsel factual contentions to be true,they do not suffice to show a tender.at most,the government contentions demonstrate only an offer to tender.under construction,however,a mere offer to perform does not suffice.at.because the government has provided no evidence that it produced the subject matter of the tender,by providing rothe with a check or depositing such a check with the court,the government has failed to demonstrate it made a valid tender.see id.accordingly,rothe damages claim is not moot and the judgment in favor of the government on this claim must be vacated.
the district court also dismissed for mootness rothe claim to an equitable award of the contract.the district court reasoned that rothe could not prove that it would have been awarded the contract but for the allegedly unlawful conduct,because the conduct rothe challenges likely affected both the number of contractors who bid for the contract as well as the pricing of the offers submitted.
rothe contends that this portion of the district court jurisdictional order was effectively a partial summary judgment order and the district court erred by resolving against it a genuine issue of material fact.we agree with rothe that the district court decision turned on the determination that rothe had failed to meet its burden of proving that it would have been awarded the contract but for the allegedly unlawful action,which is a matter related to the merits of rothe case,not mootness.this error in the district court analysis,however,is harmless.
rothe claim to an award of the contract is moot because the contract was directed to the provision of services over a specific time period that has now passed.as we described in rothe iii,t he contract in this case was scheduled to expire on september.however,the air force exercised an option to extend ict contract through september.at.because an award of a contract that expired no later than could provide rothe no present or future relief,rothe claim is moot.furthermore,rothe briefs demonstrate that it does not even seek an award of the contract.instead,it claims that t he services under all the contracts are essentially the same,and award can be made through extension of rothe current contract.thus,because the time period associated with the contract has passed and,in any event,rothe does not actually seek an award of the contract,we affirm the district court dismissal of rothe claim to an equitable award of the contract.
the government also contends that the court lacks jurisdiction to consider rothe claim that section,as presently reauthorized,is facially unconstitutional.jurisdiction is lacking,the government contends,because the adjustment component of section has been serially suspended by the department of defense since october under the authority of e b.
the parties focus on the voluntary cessation line of mootness cases,with the cessation in this case being the suspension of the adjustment.a defendant voluntary cessation of alleged misconduct does not moot a claim unless the defendant proves it to be absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d describing this as a heavy burden of proof.
in this case,the district court found that the government failed to meet its burden of proving mootness.the government merely repeats here the sole evidence offered before the district the case is moot because the adjustment has been suspended since october.the district court,however,found that the current suspension of the adjustment is insufficient,by itself,to demonstrate that the adjustment will remain suspended,especially considering the heavy burden of proof associated with mootness.indeed,some facts suggest that the adjustment will not remain suspended.as the district court noted,defendants have also acknowledged sdb participation has steadily dropped over recent years and come closer to falling below the quota.because the continued viability of the suspension depends on the continued fulfillment of the five percent goal,this fact tends to undermine the government proof that the adjustment will remain suspended.
accordingly,we agree with the district court that the government has failed,at this time,to demonstrate that the adjustment will remain suspended in the future,even though the continued suspension of section along with other facts may eventually be sufficient to establish mootness.
the government responds by analogizing the suspension of the adjustment to a repeal of a law,citing to national black police ass district of columbia,in which the united states court of appeals for the circuit held that the mere power to reenact a challenged law is not a sufficient basis on which a court can conclude that a reasonable expectation of recurrence exists.rather,there must be evidence indicating that the challenged law likely will be reenacted.
the government analogy to a repeal is inapt because the future application of the adjustment does not depend on the mere power to reenact a challenged law.instead,because the adjustment has only been suspended,not repealed,whether the adjustment will be applied in the future depends on whether the government meets the five percent goal.to prove mootness,therefore,the government was required,but failed,to demonstrate it to be absolutely clear that the government will continue to meet the five percent goal.
the government also cites troiano supervisor of elections,which states that when the defendant is not a private citizen but a government actor,there is a rebuttable presumption that the objectionable behavior will not recur,cir emphasis omitted.troiano involved a class action suit brought by visually impaired and blind citizens to require the government to provide audio equipment to assist in voting.after the election in question,the election official provided audio equipment to each voting precinct.in dismissing for mootness,the troiano court found that all of the available evidence indicated a genuine effort to make elections consistently accessible to the visually impaired and that there was no evidence that she the election official is likely to remove the new machines in the future.id.at.
in addition to the fact that troiano does not bind our decision,we find it materially distinguishable from this case.in troiano,the election official took actions demonstrating a strong commitment to make audio equipment available to visually impaired and blind citizens,whereas here the government has not provided sufficient evidence that the allegedly offending conduct will not recur because it has not demonstrated that the five percent goal will continue to be met.furthermore,unlike troiano,in which the decision whether or not to provide audio equipment was in the discretion of the election official,in this case,the government is required by statute to apply the adjustment,so long as the five percent goal was not met in the previous year.the rebuttable presumption analysis of troiano thus does not apply in this case.
accordingly,because the government has not proven that the suspension of the adjustment will remain in place,it has failed to prove mootness 
we now turn to the government argument that rothe lacks standing to assert the claim that the present reauthorization of section is facially unconstitutional.notably,because the government does not bear the burden of proof on standing,its failure to demonstrate the likelihood that the suspension will remain in place does not foreclose this argument.lujan defenders of wildlife,d the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing the elements of standing.to establish standing,a plaintiff must demonstrate it has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.friends of the earth,at.internal quotation omitted.
the government contends that rothe lacks standing because the potential for recurrence of the claimed offending conduct is conjectural or hypothetical,as compared to actual or imminent.for its standing argument,the government relies on the same evidence that it presented for mootness,claiming that congress had passed the suspension provision before rothe filed its original complaint,the adjustment was in fact suspended by the department of defense before rothe filed its first amended complaint,and the suspension has remained in place to this point.
because standing is to be determined as of the commencement of suit,only the first of the three pieces of evidence cited by the government is relevant in determining whether rothe had standing to bring this suit.lujan,at.friends of the earth,at.discussing differences between standing and mootness paradise creations,uv sales,becker fed.election comm n,cir collecting cases and holding that while it is true that a plaintiff must have a personal interest at stake throughout the litigation of a case,such interest is to be assessed under the rubric of standing at the commencement of the case,and under the rubric of mootness thereafter.but see powder river basin res.council babbitt,cir considering events in examining a plaintiff standing.
at the time rothe filed suit,the adjustment was in full force.the mere passage of the mechanism by which the suspension could be implemented does not demonstrate that rothe claimed injury was so conjectural or hypothetical that it lacked standing.accordingly,we reject the government standing argument.
the last jurisdictional argument raised by the government against rothe facial unconstitutionality claim is based on ripeness grounds.a court should dismiss a case for lack of ripeness when the case is abstract or hypothetical a case is generally ripe if any remaining questions are purely legal ones conversely,a case is not ripe if further factual development is required.monk huston,cir internal quotations omitted maritrans,united states,citing abbott laboratories gardner,d.once again,the government bases its ripeness contention on the same evidence it offers for mootness and standing the pea program is suspended,has been for many years,shows no sign of reactivation,and section is slated to terminate in.
the government argument is misplaced because the issue whether section,as reauthorized in,is facially unconstitutional is a purely legal issue that is neither abstract nor hypothetical.indeed,as we held in rothe prior appeal,the analysis of the facial constitutionality of an act is limited to evidence before congress prior to the date of reauthorization.rothe iii,at.thus,we reject the government ripeness argument.
in sum,the district court improperly held the damages claim to be moot but properly held the claim to be moot.further,the district court properly held that jurisdiction lies as to rothe claim that the present reauthorization of section is facially unconstitutional.
on the merits,rothe contends that the district court findings and legal analysis do not support a holding that the present reauthorization of section is facially constitutional.surprisingly,the government agrees.
the government argues,however,that remand is required to develop the record so that legally sufficient findings can be made and required analysis can be conducted.the government argument is based on the procedural history of this case on remand after rothe iii,in which we stated 
we remand for a determination of the constitutionality of the program under a strict scrutiny standard the constitutionality of the program must be assessed as reauthorized in,as applied to rothe bid in,and at present,to the extent that declaratory or injunctive relief is still sought.
despite our clear guidance that the issues on remand were to include an analysis of section at present,the district court,in a series of three discovery rulings,narrowed the issues on remand to exclude the evaluation of the present reauthorization of section.in these rulings,the district court prohibited rothe from obtaining certain discovery it considered relevant to the reauthorization of section because,inter alia,such discovery was not relevant to sic issue before this is,the evidence before congress when the program was enacted and reauthorized in.the final discovery order most clearly identifies the district court restriction of the issues plaintiff must understand by now that the issue before this court is whether congress had a compelling interest in when it reauthorized the program and whether or not that program was narrowly tailored to meet that interest.this final order also set a briefing schedule for dispositive motions and admonished the parties to address all matters considered by the federal circuit in their opinion.although rothe disagreed with the district court decision to limit the issues to exclude examination of the facial constitutionality of the present reauthorization of section,rothe understood the district court to have so limited the case.in a brief before the district court,rothe stated defendants sic appear to agree with the court that the only evidence the court would consider is that used in reauthorization of in,notwithstanding defendants professed concern that this court was not addressing the broader issues remanded by the federal circuit.
despite its discovery orders,the district court concluded in its order addressing the parties dispositive motions that the constitutionality of the present reauthorization of section actually was at issue after all.in the district court words,the government argues that the law of the case limits this action to whether congress had a compelling interest in when it reauthorized the national defense authorization act of the act.this court,however,expressly ordered defendant to consider the federal circuit entire remand and as such,issues this order in accordance with that remand.the district court then ruled in favor of the government,holding the present reauthorization of section to be constitutional.
because the government had not moved for summary judgment on this claim,the district court ruling was a sua sponte grant of summary judgment in the government favor.in celotex catrett,the supreme court held that district courts are widely acknowledged to possess the power to enter summary judgments sua sponte,so long as the losing party was on notice that she had to come forward with all of her evidence,d.although the quotation from celotex is directed to losing parties,similar problems of procedural unfairness can arise for winning parties,as can be seen from rothe argument on appeal.rothe argues in this case that the insufficiency of the evidence presented by the government requires us to grant summary judgment in rothe favor,not merely to vacate and remand for further development of the record.if we were to agree with rothe,however,the government would have been unfairly deprived of an opportunity to introduce its evidence and arguments by the district court unwarned and sua sponte grant of summary judgment.
because the district court discovery orders clearly limited the issues to exclude the present reauthorization of section,we hold that the government was not on notice that it was required to come forward with all of its evidence and,therefore,remand is required.the district court vague requirement that the parties address all the matters considered by the federal circuit in its opinion did not specifically address the unconstitutionality of the present reauthorization of section and,therefore,was insufficient to overcome the clear language of the three discovery rulings that the present reauthorization would not be considered.
despite ultimately concluding that remand is required,we recognize several factors that weigh against remand.our mandate in rothe iii to consider the present reauthorization of section was quite clear.at.further,even though the district court narrowing of the issues favored the government litigation position,we find it troubling that the government appears to have argued in favor of the very narrowing that it now claims to be erroneous.additionally,the government claim that it was prevented from introducing evidence is weakened by its failure to cite in its appellate briefing to any specific evidence it would have introduced had it been provided the opportunity.since that evidence necessarily is published,for example,in congressional committee reports and hearing records,it could easily have been cited.finally,because the issue whether the present reauthorization would be addressed was clearly disputed,both parties would have been to request clarification from the district court before submitting their summary judgment motions.
in the end,we conclude that the matter must be remanded to allow both sides a fair opportunity to obtain and present congressional evidence and arguments on the facial constitutionality of the present reauthorization of section 
in a scattered approach,rothe raises a number of specific factual and legal content
