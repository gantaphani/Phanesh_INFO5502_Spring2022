for nearly half a century,the cia has each day sent the president a highly classified summary of the most important and timely intelligence relating to this country national defense and foreign policy priorities.we must decide in this case whether two of these as the president daily brief pdb from the administration of president lyndon johnson are exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act foia.we hold that the cia has provided ample justification that the disclosure of the two pdbs would reveal protected intelligence sources and methods,and thus these pdbs are protected by foia exemption and the national security act nsa,i.
the practice of specialized presidential intelligence briefing dates back to the administration of president john kennedy.after taking office,president kennedy asked the cia to produce a special briefing that succinctly summarized recently collected intelligence information that would be of interest to the president and his senior advisors.that briefing,which was then called the president intelligence checklist picl,became an important medium of communication between the leadership of the cia and the white house.when president johnson took office,the picl format was modified to suit his particular tastes,and was renamed the president daily brief.the pdbs of that era reported on international developments based on intelligence sources that included satellite photographs,signal intercepts,individual recruits,department of state communications,published news accounts and other publicly available information.because the pdbs were intelligence documents,they were then and still are classified documents that are available only to the president and his senior advisors.
over the years,a handful of the more than existing picls and pdbs have made their way into the public domain,either deliberately or by mistake.ten redacted picls from the kennedy administration were released pursuant to the president john kennedy assassination records collection act of.see note.two more recent pdbs were released as a part of the final report of the national commission on terrorist attacks on the united states,commonly known as the report.these pdbs were declassified after the director of central intelligence determined that the public interest in disclosure outweighed the potential damage to national security that could result from disclosure.see exec.order,b as amended by exec.order.
at least redacted pdbs from the johnson administration have also been released.these pdbs illustrate the format and content that was common during that period.they were produced in a format with particular countries listed on the left and one or two paragraphs about recent events in each country on the right.the content of these pdbs are generally factual,although in some cases the author provides predictions about where current events might lead.the tone is generally informal.
larry berman,a political science professor at the university of california,davis,filed a foia request seeking two pdbs from august,and from april.the cia denied his request,asserting foia exemptions for classified national security information exemption for protected intelligence sources and methods exemption and for privileged communications exemption.see b,b,b.after his administrative appeal was denied,berman filed a declaratory judgment action in the eastern district of california seeking disclosure.
in the district court proceedings,the cia supported its asserted exemptions with the declaration and supplemental declaration of cia information review officer terry buroker.in his declarations,buroker asserts that the pdbs must be withheld in their entirety,as no reasonably segregable,portions of the documents exist.buroker provides two related factual bases for the claimed necessity of keeping the pdbs secret.
first,buroker describes the general content and function of pdbs.he explains that during the johnson administration,pdbs were used to synthesize,in a few pages,the most recently gathered and critical intelligence information the cia possessed.because of their condensed format,the johnson pdbs contained only that information that leadership within the cia believed would be most important to the president and his senior advisors.buroker explains that pdbs served as a starting point for high level discussions regarding intelligence and national security between the president and the cia.as a result,the pdbs themselves reflect one side of this ongoing dialogue.according to buroker,the johnson pdbs include sensitive information such as a undisseminated raw operational information,sometimes including true names of sources cryptonyms,b sensitive operational information added to the document by the directorate of operations after the directorate of intelligence has written or edited the material in the pdb,c information restricted at the very highest levels of human and technical source intelligence gathering,d information from covert technical operations,and e information from specifically developed or acquired methods.
second,buroker discusses why the specific pdbs requested in this case would result in harm to the cia intelligence gathering interests.buroker states that the specific pdbs berman requests contain explicit references to information provided by foreign officials as well as other information that may incorporate information from foreign liaison relationships,including foreign governments and foreign intelligence services.the pdbs also contain references to intelligence obtained from individual human sources and from confidential liaison relationships.buroker warns that such information was provided only upon a guarantee of absolute secrecy,and disclosure of the requested pdbs would tend to reveal the identities of intelligence sources.this could lead to severe harms to the sources of the information,including embarrassment,political ruin,retribution imprisonment,torture or even death of the source or the source family and friends.moreover,buroker states that disclosure of the requested pdbs would disclose specific intelligence methods,including technical collection methods.for all of these reasons,disclosure reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the united states.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the cia,holding that the cia had made an adequate showing that the documents were shielded from disclosure by exemptions and.see berman cia,d.this timely appeal followed.
the district court grant of summary judgment in a foia case is reviewed under a test.see lion raisins dep t of,cir.first,we ask whether the district court had an adequate factual basis for its decision.we review the district court determination that a particular set of documents here the buroker declarations provided an adequate factual basis de novo.second,we ask whether the district court decision regarding applicability of foia exemptions was correct.if the district court determination turns mainly on findings of fact,we review for clear error.id.however,where as here the district court determination turned on its interpretation of the law,we review de novo.see generally schiffer fbi,cir although any factual conclusions that place a document within a stated exemption of foia are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard,the question of whether a document fits within one of foia prescribed exemptions is one of law,upon which the district court is entitled to no deference citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
foia exemption permits government agencies to maintain the secrecy of information that is specifically exempted from disclosure by certain statute s see b.the national security act is such a statute.see cia sims,d.that statute instructs the director of national intelligence to protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.i see also 
the nsa provides the director with very broad authority to protect all sources of intelligence information from disclosure.sims,at.because of this sweeping power,id.at,courts are required to give great deference to the cia assertion that a particular disclosure could reveal intelligence sources or methods,id.at.the term sources is to be broadly construed and encompasses not only secret agents,but instead reaches all sources of information the cia relies upon,including publicly available information.id.at.
we have acknowledged that after sims,there exists a foia exemption for cia records.hunt cia,cir.indeed,sims leaves courts only a short step from exempting all cia records from foia.id.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.concerned that this broad reading of cia authority might be contrary to congressional intent,we have invited congress to take the necessary legislative action to rectify that disparity.see also minier cia,cir only congress can override the plain language of the nsa.congress,however,has to date left the nsa materially unaltered and so we must continue to afford the cia broad deference.nonetheless,just as congress has not reduced the cia authority under the nsa,neither has it expanded the cia protection from foia from a exemption to a blanket exemption.we therefore continue to conduct some of the cia assertions.
the cia bears the burden of proving the applicability of the exemption.minier,at.although the cia reasons are entitled to deference,the cia declarations must still describe the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific detail,demonstrate that the information withheld logically falls within the claimed exemptions,and show that the justifications are not controverted by contrary evidence in the record or by evidence of cia bad faith.hunt,at.the cia must do more than show simply that it has acted in good faith.see wiener fbi,cir.
buroker asserts that exemption applies because the pdbs could expose the existence of specific intelligence sources and methods.he explains that each of the requested pdbs contains information specifically stating sensitive sources or methods of collection and would reveal substantial information about its provenance to an educated reader.buroker adds that each edition of the pdb is a piece of a mosaic of information reflecting the most sensitive,as well as the mundane,intelligence sources and methods employed by the cia and the intelligence community over time.
in wiener,we held that a cia affidavit was inadequate to support the cia invocation of exemption because it fail ed to discuss the facts or reasoning upon which the declarant based his conclusion.wiener,at.this was problematic because it denied the plaintiff the opportunity to contest the cia conclusions,and thus distorted the adversary process.see id.the cia affidavit we rejected stated without justification that disclosure of the withheld portions reasonably could be expected to lead to identification of the source of the information.id.alteration in original,internal quotation marks omitted.
unlike the affidavit in wiener,buroker declaration provides the facts and reasoning upon which his conclusion is based.he explains that each pdb contains the most sensitive and important intelligence information available to the cia on the day it is released and that the requested pdbs specifically identify intelligence sources and methods.he also explains how pdbs convey important contextual information that could reveal sources or methods even if the pdbs were produced in redacted form.because they are released on a daily basis and typically contain only the most current information fresh from the field,pdbs reveal when particular intelligence information became available to the cia.this is important,as buroker observes,because sophisticated foreign intelligence services might use that information to reliably infer that a human source for information contained in the pdb is most likely one of a very few number of individuals with access to the subject information,and that the source must have provided the information very close in time to when it was reported in the pdb.an educated observer could also determine other sensitive information,such as what intelligence was most important to the president and to senior officials within the cia at a particular time.see sims,at.a foreign government can learn a great deal about the agency activities by knowing the sources of information that interest the agency.furthermore,buroker explains,the release of pdbs would diminish the cia ability to assure current intelligence sources that their identities will be kept secret in the future.
finally,in addition to the buroker affidavit,berman has access to several other johnson pdbs that undisputedly contain a similar form and content to the ones he requests.he also has access to volumes of other information regarding intelligence and foreign policy during the johnson administration,including national security files available through the johnson presidential library.access to these documents has enabled him specifically to contest the cia claim that the pdbs would divulge protected sources and methods.berman therefore has sufficient facts at his disposal for the adversary process to function properly and thus he has been given a meaningful opportunity to contest,and the district court an adequate foundation to review,the soundness of the withholding.wiener,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.because of the broad deference we are to give the cia under sims,and because judges are poorly positioned to evaluate the sufficiency of the cia intelligence claims,see sims,at,we doubt that the cia provision of a more detailed declaration would enable berman to argue more effectively for their release.see wiener,at stating that the cia affidavit was sufficient with regard to one withholding because n o further disclosure would have enabled weiner to argue for their release.
berman argues nonetheless that the cia should be required to provide even greater detail regarding the content of the requested pdbs and how that content is tied to the harms the cia fears.we are satisfied,however,that the buroker declaration strikes the appropriate balance between justifying the applicability of the exemption with sufficient specificity to permit berman meaningfully to challenge it and the cia need to avoid providing a description that is so specific that it risks revealing protected sources and methods.as sims observed,i t is conceivable that the mere explanation of why information must be withheld can convey valuable information to a foreign intelligence agency.at.see also church of scientology of cal.dep t of army,cir stating that in asserting a foia exemption the government need not specify its objections in such detail as to compromise the secrecy of the information.we were mindful of this concern in hunt,where we permitted the cia to respond to a foia request by providing a glomar response in which the cia refused to confirm or deny the existence of records pertaining to a foreign national.at.we did not require the cia to identify particular harms that would occur if the documents were disclosed.instead,we were satisfied with the cia statements that a more specific response might allow foreign intelligence agents to determine the contours and gaps of cia intelligence operations and make informed judgments as to the identities of probable sources and targets in other countries,and that disclosure might prove to be a disincentive to future sources providing assistance the cia.id.at.we cited with approval gardels cia,in which the cia justified a glomar response by averring that disclosure might allow foreign operatives to discover the identities of covert cia sources and the cia research interests.hunt,at citing gardels,at.it was therefore unnecessary for the affidavits in that case to mention harms to particular individuals.id.the cia declarations here are comparable in specificity to those in hunt and gardels.we therefore hold that they are sufficient 
berman next argues that buroker declarations are insufficient because buroker states only that disclosure of the pdbs could reveal sources and methods,rather than stating definitively that the pdbs would divulge such protected matter.but buroker declaration speaks in more certain terms than berman suggests,in stating that the disclosur
