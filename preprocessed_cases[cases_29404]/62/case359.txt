the national institute of military justice nimj filed this action under the freedom of information act foia,seeking,inter alia,nineteen records containing the opinions and recommendations of lawyers whose advice the united states department of defense dod solicited to promulgate regulations establishing terrorist trial commissions.the district court granted summary judgment in dod favor,concluding that the documents are exempt from disclosure under foia exemption,id.b.see inst.of military justice dep t of defense,d.we agree that the documents are protected by foia exemption and therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
on november,president george bush issued a military order to establish military commissions to try terrorists.detention,treatment,and trial of certain in the war against terrorism.the military order stated that any person subject to,any who the president determines there is reason to believe has been a member of al qaeda,has engaged in acts of international terrorism against the united states or has knowingly harbored such persons shall,when tried,be tried by military commission for any and all offenses triable by military commission that such individual is alleged to have committed.id.at.the military order further directed that the secretary of defense shall issue such orders and regulations,including orders for the appointment of one or more military commissions,as may be necessary to carry out the trials.id 
in the course of promulgating regulations dod solicited and received comments from a number of lawyers,who were former high ranking governmental officials or academics or both.according to dod,it 
sought the opinions and recommendations of these outside consultants because their previous experience in the government their expertise made them uniquely qualified to provide advice to the general counsel office on the military commissions procedures.each was asked to provide their comments on the proposed military commission procedures.

on october,nimj submitted a foia request to dod seeking 
all written or electronic communications that the department including the secretary and general counsel has either sent to or received from anyone other than an officer or employee of the united states acting in the course of his or her official duties regarding the president november,military order,the secretary military commission orders,and the military commission instructions.this request includes but is not limited to suggestions or comments on potential,proposed,or actual terms of any of those orders or instructions and any similar,subsequent,superseding or related orders or instructions,whether proposed or adopted.
compl.quoting foia request letter,see inst.of military justice,d at.in response,dod released numerous documents but withheld others it considered exempt,including the nineteen documents nimj now seeks which dod withheld as exempt under foia exemption.
on february,nimj filed this action in the district court seeking the withheld documents.in an opinion and order filed december,the district court granted partial summary judgment in dod favor,concluding,inter alia,that the nineteen documents are exempt from disclosure,as claimed,under foia exemption.inst.of military justice,d at.in an opinion and order filed june,the district court granted final summary judgment in dod favor and this appeal followed.
nimj appeals the district court grant of summary judgment as to the nineteen documents the court held exempt under foia exemption.exemption provides that foia does not apply to matters that are or memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.b.relying heavily on the united states supreme court decision in department of the interior klamath water users protective ass n,d,nimj asserts that exemption does not apply because the documents sought are not or,as required by the statutory language we reject its challenge because our circuit precedent interprets to include agency records containing comments solicited from parties such as the lawyers whose counsel dod,more to the point,our precedent is not inconsistent with klamath.
in ryan department of justice,we held that documents submitted by united states senators in response to a questionnaire they received from the department of justice about procedures for selecting and recommending potential judicial nominees were exempt from foia disclosure under exemption.we rejected the foia requesters argument that,because the senators were not agencies within the meaning of the foia,the withheld questionnaires c ould not be termed or within the meaning of exemption,reasoning 
when interpreted in light of its purpose,the language of exemption clearly embraces this situation.the exemption was created to protect the deliberative process of the government,by ensuring that persons in an advisory role would be able to express their opinions freely to agency without fear of publicity.in the course of its activities,an agency often needs to rely on the opinions and recommendations of temporary consultants,as well as its own employees.such consultations are an integral part of its deliberative process to conduct this process in public view would inhibit frank discussion of policy matters and likely impair the quality of decisions.
ryan,at citation footnote omitted.noting that efficient government operation requires open discussions among all government and advisors,whether those giving advice are officially part of the agency or are solicited to give advice only for specific projects,we concluded when an agency record is submitted by outside consultants as part of the deliberative process,and it was solicited by the agency,we find it entirely reasonable to deem the resulting document to be an memorandum for purposes of determining the applicability of exemption.id.at.integral to the court analysis was the fact that the documents sought were generated by an initiative from the department of justice,the questionnaire sent out by the department to the senators.id 
in formaldehyde institute department of health human services,we clarified that exemption extends to documents received from private,nongovernmental parties.in particular,we concluded the exemption protected documents containing comments of two private referees for the american journal of epidemiology on a report submitted for publication by a staff member of the centers for disease control cdc.relying largely on ryan,we found immaterial the absence of any formal relationship between the reviewers and the department of health and human services hhs,at,explaining that w hether the author is a regular agency employee or a temporary consultant is irrelevant the pertinent element is the role,if any,that the document plays in the process of agency deliberations,id.at quoting cna fin.donovan,cert.denied,d.
more recently,in public citizen,department of justice,we held exempt from disclosure records containing communications among former president reagan,the national archives and the department of justice and among former president bush and the same agencies regarding electronic records of each of the two presidents administrations.acknowledging that public citizen is doubtless right that a former president is not an agency under foia,we affirmed that records of communications between an agency and outside consultants qualify as for purposes of exemption if they have been created for the purpose of aiding the agency deliberative process.pub.citizen,at quoting dow jones dep t of justice,emphasis by dow jones court citing cna fin.donovan.
taken together,the foregoing cases compel us to conclude that documents such as the ones by parties in response to an agency request for covered by exemption.nimj attempts to distinguish those cases factually but to no avail.nimj first asserts,for example,that neither ryan nor public citizen involved ordinary private citizen s,opening br.at quoting pub.citizen,at but this argument overlooks the fact that formaldehyde institute did involve private citizens two outside referees.nimj also contends that the consultative relationship here is not,as it was in public citizen,mandated by statute,neither was it in either ryan or formaldehyde institute see ryan,at questionnaires sent to senators in response to executive order directing attorney general to assist in promulgating standards and guidelines for the selection of nominees for united states district court judgeships,formaldehyde,at reviewers commented in response to cdc employee submission of article to private journal.
nimj next asserts that the cited circuit precedents,even if otherwise controlling,have been superseded by the supreme court decision in klamath.again we disagree.
in klamath,the court concluded that exemption does not protect documents submitted by indian tribes to the department of the interior,which documents addressed tribal interests that were then the subject of state and federal water allocation proceedings.in rejecting the government exemption claim,the court focused on the language in exemption requiring that exempt documents be either or,at,and emphasized that there is no textual justification for draining the first condition of independent vitality,id.at.noting that the statute was silent about communications with outsiders,the court observed that some courts of appeals have held that in some circumstances a document prepared outside the government may nevertheless qualify as an memorandum under exemption under the consultant corollary to exemption.id.at.typically,the court added,courts taking this view have held that the exemption extends to communications between government agencies and outside consultants hired by them.id.in such cases,the court noted,the records submitted by outside consultants played essentially the same part in an agency process of deliberation as documents prepared by agency personnel might have done,notwithstanding the consultants were independent contractors and were not assumed to be subject to the degree of control that agency employment could have entailed and they were not necessarily devoid of a definite point of view.id.the court concluded,however,that the indian tribes in klamath were not analogous to government consultants.
the court explained that the fact about the consultant that is constant in the typical cases is that the consultant does not represent an interest of its own,or the interest of any other client,when it advises the agency that hires it.id.at.its only obligations are to truth and its sense of what good judgment calls for,and in those respects the consultant functions just as an employee would be expected to do.id.at.by contrast the indian tribes necessarily communicate with the bureau with their own,albeit entirely legitimate,interests in mind.id.at.although concluding that this fact alone distinguishes tribal communications from the consultants examples recognized by several courts of appeals,the court further found that the distinction is even sharper,in that the indian tribes are at the expense of others seeking benefits inadequate to satisfy everyone.id.finding the circuit cases on outside consultants thus distinguishable,the court expressly declined to decide whether such consultants reports may qualify as under exemption.id.at.
given the supreme court disclaimer and its reasoning,we perceive no basis to jettison our binding circuit precedent.see united states carson,w e are,of course,bound to follow circuit precedent absent contrary authority from an en banc court or the supreme court.citing brewster comm r,it remains true that federal agencies occasionally will encounter problems outside their ken,and it clearly is preferable that they enlist the help of outside experts skilled at unravelling their knotty complexities.formaldehyde,at quoting cna fin.donovan.it was plainly preferable in this case for dod to consult as widely as possible in order to fairly but effectively try terrorists in the aftermath of september.unlike the indian tribes in klamath,the individuals dod consulted had no individual interests to promote in their submissions,as nimj itself concedes.see reply br.at the government is correct that nimj has made no suggestion of personal interest in these proceedings,nor does it intend to impugn the integrity of the distinguished individuals at issue.cobb.decl.stating that in addition to the few written comments received from individual lawyers who had been asked by the general counsel to provide confidential legal views comments which nimj now seeks m any more comments came from members of the public or organizations with an interest in these matters,like human rights watch or the american bar association s ome of these comments were solicited many were not comments for which dod did not claim the exemption emphasis added.for this reason,the case before us is readily distinguishable from klamath,in which the dispositive point was that the apparent object of the tribe communications is a decision by an agency of the government to support a claim by the tribe that is necessarily adverse to the interests of competitors.klamath,at.further,although the individuals dod consulted are,as nimj notes,private citizens rather than government employees or paid contract consultants,we see no reason why the absence of a contract or compensation should differentiate them from the typical outside agency consultants.these were not random citizens volunteering their opinions.dod sought these individuals out and solicited their counsel based on their undisputed experience and qualifications.see ricci decl.their contributions to dod deliberation in promulgating regulations were no less valuable or confidential for the lack of compensation or formal contract.
our established line of consultant cases is all the more compelling given that we have acknowledged the survival of our consultant corollary in the wake of klamath.in judicial watch,department of energy,two public interest organizations sought disclosure of documents held by eight federal agencies the documents had been prepared by the national energy policy development group nepdg,which was established by the president and composed of high ranking federal officials and employees detailed from federal agencies.we concluded that the withheld documents were protected under exemption notwithstanding nepdg did not qualify as an agency under foia because its sole function was to advise and assist the president,at and it did not prepare the documents for an agency.we there acknowledged klamath admonition that,to be protected by exemption,a document must not only be and deliberative but by the terms of exemption,it must also be an or an record,at citing klamath,at.we nonetheless found that o ur interpretation of exemption that documents held by agencies but prepared by the nepdg come within exemption protection is not inconsistent with its textual limitation to or communications r ather it follows from the principle,well established in this circuit,that a document need not be created by an agency or remain in the possession of the agency in order to qualify as.id.at.to exemplify this principle,the court quoted ryan dispositive determination when an agency record is submitted by outside consultants as part of the deliberative process,and it was solicited by the agency,we find it entirely reasonable to deem the resulting document to be an memorandum for purposes of determining the applicability of exemption.ryan,at,quoted in judicial watch,at concluding that n ot to treat in the same way documents shared with or received from the nepdg,a body established by the president solely to advise him,and composed entirely of federal officials,would be anomalous indeed.internal citation omitted.we base our decision here on the same well established principle.
notwithstanding this court has itself affirmed the continuing validity of the ryan line of cases,nimj offers two particular arguments to support its view that klamath supersedes circuit precedent.we find neither one persuasive.
first,nimj contends that the klamath court admonition to give independent vitality to the statutory terms interagency and forecloses exempting documents an agency receives from private citizens as such records are neither.contrary to nimj contention,our continued adherence to the consultant corollary does not diminish the independent vitality of the statutory terms,as we made clear in judicial watch.in ryan we explained that i n the course of its activities,an agency often needs to rely on the opinions and recommendations of temporary consultants,as well as its own employees,at,and it is entirely reasonable to adopt a common sense interpretation of that encompasses the advice submitted by such temporary consultants.in this case,dod itself solicited the advice contained in the documents from the individual nongovernmental lawyers for the agency own use in promulgating terrorist trial commission regulations.under such circumstances,it is consistent with ryan common sense interpretation to deem the documents so as to come within exemption protection.and it is likewise consistent with klamath directive to hew to the language of the statute.indeed,klamath itself acknowledges that disinterested outside consultants may be enough like the agency own personnel to justify calling their communications.at.
second,nimj contends that klamath expressly calls into question the holdings in ryan and public citizen.it is true that the court in klamath stated that the two decisions arguably extend beyond what we have characterized as the typical examples of agency consultants but,consistent with its reasoning in the case before it,the court expressed concern only with regard to the potential of the consultants involved in those cases.see klamath,at.noting the former presidents in public citizen had their own,independent interests and in ryan,the senators questionnaire responses were held exempt even though we would expect a senator to have strong personal views on the matter.as we have already noted,however,there is no dispute that the individuals dod consulted were not pursuing interests of their own so as to run afoul of klamath concern.thus,the extent to which either ryan or public citizen may have extended exemption beyond its permissible scope based on their peculiar facts is an issue we need not and do not decide here.
in applying the ryan line of cases,we emphasize two factors in their analyses that support our continued application of the consultant corollary.first,as our cases make clear,the expectation that communications will remain confidential is crucial to eliciting candid and honest advice from outside consultants.see ryan,at c onsultations with temporary consultants are an integral part of an agency deliberative process to conduct this process in public view would inhibit frank discussion of policy matters and likely impair the quality of decisions.formaldehyde,at a predecisional document is a part of the deliberative process,if the disclosure of the materials would expose an agency decisionmaking process in such a way as to discourage candid discussion within the agency and thereby undermine the agency ability to perform its functions.quoting dudman commc ns dep t of air force,emphasis and alteration in formaldehyde inst.pub.citizen,at f or a president to be able to give adequate assurances of confidentiality to his advisors,the assurances must last beyond his tenure.judicial watch,at exemption inclusion in the statute reflect s the legislative judgment that the quality of administrative would be seriously undermined if agencies were forced to operate in a fishbowl because the full and frank exchange of ideas on legal or policy matters would be impossible.quoting tax analysts irs,alteration in judicial watch see also nlrb sears,roebuck,d h uman experience teaches that those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances to the detriment of the decisionmaking process quoting united states nixon,d alteration in sears see also hecker decl.the public disclosure of these materials would discourage the frank,open discussions on these issues by these individuals.
second,throughout the ryan line of cases,there have been some indicia of a consultant relationship between the outsider and the agency.typically the relationship is evidenced by the fact that the agency seeks out the individual consultants and affirmatively solicits their advice in aid of agency business,as dod did here.see ryan,at when an agency record is submitted by outside consultants as part of the deliberative process,and it was solicited by the agency,we find it entirely reasonable to deem the resulting document to be an memorandum for purposes of determining the applicability of exemption.emphasis added id.we can not overlook the fact that the documents here were generated by an initiative from the department of justice,the questionnaire sent out by the department to the senators.formaldehyde,at i t is unquestionably true that efficient government operation requires open discussions among all government and advisors,whether those giving advice are officially part of the agency or are solicited to give advice only for specific projects.emphasis added internal quotation omitted the dissent is therefore wrong to suggest,see dissent at that our cases allow an agency merely to ask the general public for advice at a press conference or in the federal register and then to classify the resulting responses as documents nothing in our cases including today decision even remotely supports the view that such circumstances would establish a consultant relationship between the agency and each individual.in addition,we do not see how the advice here would be any more,as the dissent suggests,were the individuals consulted classified as committee members or paid nominal stipends.see dissent at.it was dod formal solicitation of their advice with or without nominal pay or title that created a consultant relationship and made them analogous to agency employees and documents containing their advice.we need not decide how exemption might apply to any agency solicitation for advice this case involves the solicitation of advice from a discrete group of experts,not from thousands of citizens.see dissent at.
the dissent alleges that our reliance,in this case,on formal agency solicitation of advice from a discrete group of experts consistent with circuit precedent presents a fundamental problem because these principles have no basis in exemption text.dissent at.but the dissent itself offers no anchoring in the text for a rule requiring that an agency provide consultants with nominal payment or membership on a nominal committee if it wishes to consider documents containing their advice.nor does it explain how the text of exemption limits the volunteer consultants who can produce documents to those on committees created under the federal advisory committee act faca.nor,indeed,on the dissent reading of klamath,how it authorizes treatment of consultants as.indeed,while the dissent is troubled by a belief that our analysis would permit advice to be solicited by from every law professor in the country,dissent at,and come within exemption a scenario we expressly do not reach,see supra,the dissent own analysis would seem to require us to extend exemption to such a case so long as the agency invited every law professor to join an ad hoc committee for advice on legal compliance and indicated that a professor who provided responsive comments would thereby consent to membership on the committee.there is nothing in the text of exemption that would require such what matters is the nature of the relationship between the consultant and the agency,not the formalities observed.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the nineteen documents nimj seeks are exempt from disclosure under foia exemption.b.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
so ordered.
in november,president bush issued a military order authorizing the department of defense to create military commissions to try suspected terrorists.dod then sought advice about how to implement the order from legal luminaries outside the agency,including bernard meltzer,lloyd cutler,ruth wedgwood,newton minow,terrence,william coleman,geoffrey hazard,william webster,martin hoffman,jack goldsmith,and joseph tompkins.in response,these outside experts sent letters,faxes,or emails to dod.all were unpaid volunteers and none were appointed by dod to any type of committee,task force,or other position,or made a part of dod in any other way.nonetheless,the district court now this court these documents are memorandums or letters protected from public disclosure under exemption of the freedom of information act.despite the textual implausibility of this holding,i acknowledge that this court precedent makes this a close case.as a policy matter,moreover,i agree with my colleagues that agencies will obtain more and better advice from outsiders if able to promise confidentiality.but i must respectfully dissent because i believe the court holding does exactly what the supreme court forbade in department of interior klamath water users protective ass n,d it makes a purely conclusory term,just a label to be placed on any document the government would find it valuable to keep confidential.id.at.
the freedom of information act foia,requires agencies to release all records upon public request unless they fall within an exemption enumerated in the act.klamath,at.these exemptions must be narrowly construed,and do not obscure the basic policy that disclosure,not secrecy,is the dominant objective of the act.dep t of air force rose,d.
dod withheld the documents at issue here under foia exemption,which protects from disclosure or memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.b.to qualify,a document must thus satisfy two conditions its source must be a government agency,and it must fall within the ambit of a privilege against discovery under judicial standards that would govern litigation against the agency that holds it,such as the,deliberative process,or attorney work product privileges.klamath,at.because appellant national institute of military justice concedes that these documents fall within the deliberative process privilege,the only question before us is whether they qualify as.
in answering this question,the court turns immediately to our precedent,but i begin with the statute text.the prefix intra means within.webster third new international dictionary accord black law dictionary ed.thus,the most natural meaning of the phrase memorandum is a memorandum that is addressed both to and from employees of a single agency.klamath,at.quoting doj julian,d scalia,dissenting.that said,several courts of appeals,including this one,have held that exemption extends to communications between government agencies and outside consultants hired by them.id.at.emphasis added.for example,in hoover department of interior,cir,the fifth circuit held that exemption protected a memo prepared for the agency by a consultant it hired to appraise a piece of property it wanted to buy.similarly,in government land bank general services administration,cir,the first circuit held that exemption protected a property appraisal prepared for the agency by an outside consultant.
cases like these,which apply exemption to protect documents written by paid outside consultants,certainly stretch the meaning of,arguably disregarding the supreme court directive that foia exemptions must be narrowly construed.rose,at.but they still plausibly interpret when an agency hires consultants to perform a task,it not unreasonable to say they have become part of the agency for purposes of that project,making any documents they produce for the project.one could even imagine situations in which a document written by a volunteer could plausibly be considered for example,if a person were appointed to a formal advisory committee created by an agency pursuant to the federal advisory committee act faca,and in that capacity wrote a memorandum to an agency employee.soucie david,stating in dicta that a report prepared by outside experts formally appointed to a federal advisory panel might be protected under exemption.
in this case,however,the government asks us to stretch exemption beyond its breaking point,to cover everyone an agency asks for advice.the government argument flatly ignores the statute text,as well as our obligation to construe foia exemptions narrowly.nonetheless,the government insists that our precedent requires the result it seeks,and this court now agrees,relying principally upon three cases from this circuit.below i describe these cases and then explain why i believe klamath undermines all of them.
the first case,ryan doj,involved questionnaires the attorney general sent to members of the senate asking how they chose whom to recommend for district court judgeships.id.at.responding to a foia request seeking the senators responses,the attorney general argued that the questionnaires were documents protected by exemption.this court agreed,explaining 
congress apparently did not intend and to be rigidly exclusive terms,but rather to include any agency document that is part of the deliberative process.we can not overlook the fact that the documents here were generated by an initiative from the department of justice,the questionnaire sent out by the department to the senators.the senators replied to the questionnaire when an agency record is submitted by outside consultants as part of the deliberative process,and it was solicited by the agency,we find it entirely reasonable to deem the resulting document to be an memorandum for purposes of exemption.
id.at emphasis added footnotes omitted.
in the second case,formaldehyde institute department of health human services,an hhs scientist submitted an article for publication in a journal.after the journal gave the article to outside reviewers who recommended against publishing it,the journal sent a rejection letter,along with the comments of its reviewers,to the scientist and hhs.we held the comments protected under exemption 
the institute argues,and the district court concluded,that because the journal is neither part of hhs nor one of hhs s consultants,the review letter is not entitled to exemption protections 
ryan established,however,that and are not rigidly exclusive terms,but rather embrace any agency document that is part of the deliberative process.thus,both the institute and the district court err in focusing on the absence of any formal relationship between the journal reviewers and hhs.
id.at emphasis added citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
in the third case,public citizen,doj,public citizen sought disclosure of letters sent by former presidents reagan and bush to the national archives and records administration regarding access to their presidential papers.we held the letters protected under exemption 
while public citizen is doubtless right that a former president is not an agency under foia,records of communications between an agency and outside consultants qualify as for purposes of exemption if they have been created for the purpose of aiding the agency deliberative process.it is irrelevant whether the author of the documents is a regular agency employee or a temporary consultant.two circumstances make application of this doctrine to the disputed records peculiarly appropriate.
first,the former president in this context can hardly be viewed as an ordinary private citizen.he retains aspects of his former importantly,for current purposes,the authority to assert the executive privilege regarding presidential communications 
second,the consultative relationship involved here is not only explicit,but is mandated by statute.the presidential records act establishes an elaborate structure for the management of presidential records.the united states retains ownership,possession and control.but the president plays a significant role even after he leaves office.
id.at emphasis added citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
as an initial matter,public citizen and ryan are distinguishable from this case.in public citizen we relied heavily on two facts not present here former presidents are still part of the government in many ways,and a statute expressly required the national archives and records administration to consult with them.both facts made it more plausible than it is here to call the documents at issue.and in ryan the outsiders offering comments were senators,making it more reasonable to consider their comments or.
that said,were public citizen,ryan,and formaldehyde the only cases on point,we would undoubtedly have to rule for dod based on the broad principles we announced in these cases.all three cases say it makes no difference whether the documents at issue were generated by someone within the agency.all that matters,they hold,is that the documents played a role in the agency deliberative process,a standard indisputably met here.
the problem with these cases,however,is that in klamath the supreme court rejected exactly this type of reasoning.in klamath,indian tribes were communicating with the department of interior about their interests during upcoming federal and state water allocation decisions.the government argued that its communications with the tribes enjoyed exemption protection because confidential communications with the tribes were crucial to the agency deliberative process.flatly rejecting this argument,the supreme court explained the first condition of exemption is no less important than the second the communication must be or.at.quoting b emphasis added.the court thus chided the government for making a fundamental error 
t he department argument skips a necessary step,for it ignores the first condition of exemption the department seems to be saying that is a purely conclusory term,just a label to be placed on any document the government would find it valuable to keep confidential.
there is,however,no textual justification for draining the first condition of independent vitality 
id.at.emphasis added.
the court then went on to decide klamath on a narrow ground.while acknowledging that some courts of appeals had held that exemption extends to communications between government agencies and outside consultants hired by them,id.at.emphasis added,the court expressly declined to decide whether consultants reports generally may qualify as under exemption,id.at.instead,it held that even if some communications from paid consultants could qualify for exemption protection,communications from the tribes in klamath could not because unlike the typical consultant,who does not represent an interest of its own when it advises the agency that hires it,id.at,the tribes,in their communications with the department of interior,were representing their own interests,id.at.
klamath thus presents us with a dilemma.while leaving open the possibility that some communications from consultants may qualify for exemption protection,the decision also makes clear that the first condition of exemption is no less important than the second the communication must be or.id.at.quoting b emphasis added.klamath also warns that t here is no textual justification for draining the first condition of independent vitality.id.at.thus,our earlier cases protecting communications from outside consultants under exemption remain good law only to the extent they give independent vitality to the meaning of.
in my view,none of the cases the court relies on passes this test.in ryan,the court held,in language this court never mentions congress apparently did not intend and to be rigidly exclusive terms,but rather to include any agency document that is part of the deliberative process.at emphasis added.formaldehyde holds exactly the same thing and intraagency are not rigidly exclusive terms,but rather embrace any agency document that is part of the deliberative process.at citing ryan,at emphasis added see also dow jones doj,ryan and formaldehyde,then,stand for the proposition that exemption permits an agency to protect the confidentiality of communications from outside the agency so long as those communications are part and parcel of the agency deliberative process.and public citizen holds that records of communications between an agency and outside consultants qualify as for purposes of exemption if they have been created for the purpose of aiding the agency deliberative process.at quoting dow jones,at.all three cases thus define documents as those that play a role in the agency deliberative process,regardless of their source.yet such reasoning is precisely what klamath rejects the argument skips a necessary step,for it ignores the first condition of exemption and makes a purely conclusory term.at.
despite this crucial language from klamath,the court holds that our earlier cases compel us to conclude that documents such as the ones by parties in response to an agency request for covered by exemption.op.at.the court derives this test from ryan statement that w hen an agency record is submitted by outside consultants as part of the deliberative process,and it was solicited by the agency,we find it entirely reasonable to deem the resulting document to be an memorandum for purposes of exemption.at.according to the court,this test from ryan survives klamath because it somehow gives independent vitality to.i would agree if the court read this passage from limited its holding mean that exemption protects documents agencies solicit from people who could plausibly be called,such as paid consultants or members of official agency committees created under faca.the problem,however,is that the court holds that a document qualifies as if an agency solicits it from anyone.
rather than giving independent vitality to,this test redefines that term.intra means within,and i n the absence of an indication to the contrary,words in a statute are assumed to bear their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.walters metro.educ,d quoting pioneer inv.servs.brunswick assocs,d.in enacting foia,congress gave no indication that it intended a previously unheard of definition of intra,so we are bound by the normal meaning of the term.see united states weber aircraft,d stating that compelling evidence of congressional intent would be necessary to persuade us to look beyond the plain statutory language of exemption.
the court nonetheless holds that documents submitted by parties in response to an agency request for advice are,op.at,effectively declaring that people come within an agency once the agency asks for their opinions.in my view,this does not represent a common sense interpretation of.id.at quoting ryan,at.indeed,under the court rule,if an agency held a press conference and asked citizens to send in advice,letters from everyone who responded would qualify as.seeking to escape this untenable result,the court adds a new requirement the solicitation must be formal.id.at.requiring formality,however,does nothing to prevent absurd results.for example,an agency request for advice published in the federal register would be formal,but hardly enough to make letters sent by members of the public who responded.perhaps by formal the court means individualized,but if an agency sent personalized letters to thousands of citizens asking for advice,no one could plausibly call their responses.the court next suggests that a solicitation suffices if addressed to a discrete group of experts.id.but a dod request for advice to every law professor in the country would qualify as a request to a discrete group of experts,yet the professors responses plainly would not be.apparently unable to distinguish away this ridiculous consequence of its rule,the court instead attacks my reading of the statute as lacking any basis in exemption text and leading to equally absurd results.id.the court is incorrect on both counts.
my discussion of the plausible outer limits of exemption possibly including some paid consultants and unpaid members of official agency directly from the statute text it rests on the ordinary,contemporary,common meaning of.pioneer,at.that is,as i explained above,one can plausibly say that some paid consultants and members of official agency committees have come within the agency.by contrast,the principles the court develops in response to the troubling examples in the previous paragraph have no basis in exemption text.an agency mere request for advice,no matter how formal or selective,has nothing to do with whether a person response comes from within or outside the agency.without some indicia that the person responding is within the agency,such as a paid consulting contract,has no meaning.moreover,contrary to the court claim,nothing i have said even suggests a rule that any person who receives nominal payment or is a member of a nominal committee qualifies as.op.at.i have said only that at least some paid consultants and members of formally created agency committees could plausibly qualify as.if,as the court hypothesizes,an agency called law professors committee members merely because it asked for their advice once,id.at,they would not qualify as.this ruse would fail not only because it would amount to a transparent attempt to game exemption,but also because there would be no meaningful indicators that the professors had actually come within the agency,such as might exist for members of official agency committees that meet and consult regularly with agency officials.making matters even worse,such a committee would violate faca in several ways,including that it would have been created neither by statute nor agency order published in the federal register.a.in the end,however,i need not address every such hypothetical,for regardless of where we ultimately establish the outer boundaries of,here it is crystal clear that the experts who submitted comments do not qualify.
of course,i understand the court desire to interpret exemption to accomplish what it perceives to be that exemption goal,but we may not use statutory purpose to produce an unreasonable interpretation.see freeman b b,w e will not ignore the words of the statute in pursuit of some disembodied congressional purpose.t hat congress might have acted with greater clarity or foresight by protecting some communications from outside volunteers does not give this court a carte blanche to redraft the statute in an effort to achieve that which congress is perceived to have failed to do.united states locke,d.
in any event,looking to foia purpose gives no clear answer to the question before us.congress certainly intended exemption to ensure that agencies not operate in a fishbowl,at,as reprinted in,but it also attempted to delimit the exception as narrowly as consistent with efficient government operation,at,suggesting that congress never intended courts to expand the exemption beyond its terms.what more,disclosure,not secrecy,is the dominant objective of foia.rose,at.because foia thus embodies conflicting purposes,we must presume that congress used language it believed properly reconciled these goals.d eference to the supremacy of the legislature,as well as recognition that members of congress typically vote on the language of a bill,generally requires us to assume that the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used.locke,at.quoting richards united states,d.
finally,and crucially,the court definition of disregards the supreme court command that foia exemptions be narrowly construed,rose,at,and read strictly in order to serve foia mandate of broad disclosure,klamath,at.whatever the policy merits of the court interpretation of,it is far from narrow or strict.
despite these problems with its approach,the court maintains that our precedent demands its result.it offers a number of reasons for this conclusion,each of which i think flawed.
to begin with,the court finds no basis to jettison our binding circuit precedent,op.at,because klamath never determined whether consultants reports may qualify as under exemption,at.but klamath did decide that courts may not ignore the first condition of exemption and make a purely conclusory term,what this court did in ryan,formaldehyde,and public citizen.thus,the test set forth in united states williams,upon which the court relies,op.at,is met here because klamath eviscerates the reasoning in the ryan line of cases.williams,at.indeed,klamath so clearly undermines formaldehyde that even under the expansive definition of the court adopts today,formaldehyde would have come out the opposite way,for there the agency did not solicit the documents it sought to,an outside journal solicited the comments and later gave them to the agency.this highlights just how much klamath has already jettison ed our binding circuit precedent.see in re sealed case,a panel may always determine that a prior holding has been superseded,and hence is no longer valid as precedent.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
next,the court insists it is irrelevant that the individuals who offered advice to dod were private citizens rather than government employees or paid contract consultants,saying we see no reason why the absence of a contract or compensation should differentiate them from the typical outside agency consultants.op.at.but the lack of a contract or compensation matters.for one thing,contracting with and paying a consultant establishes a formal relationship between that person and the agency,making it at least plausible to consider the person.in contrast,the court allows agencies to describe anyone they ask for advice as consultants,never explaining how private citizens can reasonably be described as merely because an agency asks for their views.moreover,although the court seeks support for its holding in klamath statement that outside consultants may be enough like the agency own personnel to justify calling their communications,op.at quoting klamath,at,it ignores that klamath was referring to communications between government agencies and outside consultants hired by them.at.emphasis added see also id.t he consultants in these cases were independent contractors.
lastly,the court believes that our decision in judicial watch,department of energy,reaffirms ryan,formaldehyde,and public citizen.but this reading overstates our holding in judicial watch.there we held that although the national energy policy development group nepdg a body composed entirely of federal employees from many agencies who advised the president on energy not an agency within the meaning of foia,exemption still protected documents created or received by the group as part of its deliberative process.our rationale,however,was not that it was irrelevant whether the documents were.instead,we held that because the federal employees who made up the nepdg were advising the president,they were,in effect,part of the president staff,and their documents were therefore protected under earlier decisions holding that documents prepared by presidential staff enjoy exemption protection.see id.at neither exemption nor the cases interpreting it distinguish between the activities of an agency subject to the foia and those of the president and his staff.
to be sure,after reaching this conclusion we went on to note,in language the court cites,that our holding was not inconsistent with exemption textual limitation to or communications,because in ryan and other cases we had established that a document need not be created by an agency or remain in the possession of the agency in order to qualify as.id.at.as an example of this principle,we pointed to ryan statement quoted above when an agency record is submitted by outside consultants as part of the deliberative process,and it was solicited by the agency,we find it entirely reasonable to deem the resulting document to be an memorandum for purposes of exemption.id.quoting ryan,at.in citing this passage from ryan,however,we could not possibly have been holding that documents solicited from outside volunteers qualify as,for no such documents were at issue in judicial watch.all we actually held is something undisputed here that at least some documents created by people other than agency employees may qualify as.moreover,as explained above,reading this statement to apply to documents solicited from anyone
