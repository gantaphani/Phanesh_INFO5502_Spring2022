what began as a straightforward transaction has escalated into a frustrating dispute,which the district court attempted to resolve by applying arbitration principles.at issue is whether a certain appraisal constituted an arbitration under the federal arbitration act faa,et.finding that the appraisal was an arbitration,the district court granted the considerable deference owed to arbitrators decisions and dismissed salt lake tribune publishing company,llc sltpc claims against medianews group,medianews and management planning,mpi.because we conclude that the appraisal did not constitute an arbitration,we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to and reverse.
shareholders of the corporation,which owned the salt lake tribune newspaper,sold their company to,which has now become medianews.shareholders formed a new company,sltpc,and,at the time of the sale,acquired an option to purchase the newspaper from medianews after five years option agreement.under the option agreement,the exercise price of the option equaled the fair market value of the newspaper assets if the parties could not agree on an exercise price,each side was to appoint an appraiser party appraisers to assess the newspaper fair market value.if the party appraisers differed from each other by more than ten percent in their estimation of the newspaper value,they would jointly select a third appraiser and the exercise price would equal the average of the two closest appraisal values reported by the three appraisers 
in august,sltpc began negotiations with medianews to establish the exercise price.unable to agree on a price,the parties each retained appraisers.medianews appraiser issued a report appraising the fair market value of the newspaper assets at million,which exceeded sltpc appraiser evaluation of million.because the party appraisers differed by more than ten percent,they turned to the selection of a third appraiser.following protracted negotiations,in which each side rejected the other preferred candidates,the parties ultimately selected mpi.in a letter to the party appraisers,mpi agreed to appraise the fair market value of the newspaper assets and specified the method by which it would conduct the appraisal.medianews and sltpc responded with a letter agreeing to retain mpi services.in combination,mpi letter to the party appraisers and sltpc and medianews response constitute the appraisal agreement.pursuant to the appraisal agreement,and after conducting the necessary investigation and receiving comments from both parties,mpi issued its final report valuing the newspaper assets at million.
claiming that mpi failed to produce its appraisal under the standards required by the option agreement,sltpc sued medianews and mpi in district court seeking,inter alia,a declaration that mpi appraisal may not be used to calculate the exercise price,a ruling imposing a new appraisal process using all new appraisals,a new valuation date,and a new selection of a third appraiser,compensatory damages from mpi based on its alleged breach of contract,compensatory and punitive damages based on mpi alleged breach of fiduciary duty,and if mpi appraisal were deemed an arbitration award,an order vacating such award.in an order denying,in part,motions to dismiss filed by medianews and mpi,the court below concluded that mpi appraisal constituted an arbitration within the meaning of the faa,which allowed sltpc to file a motion to vacate to overturn mpi arbitration award.following that order,sltpc filed a motion to vacate under the faa,which the district court denied.at this juncture,the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss.
in its final order,the court determined that its prior orders concluding that mpi appraisal was an arbitration,not vacated under the faa,resolved sltpc first,second,and fifth claims in favor of medianews.accordingly,the court dismissed all of sltpc claims against medianews.in dismissing sltpc claims against mpi,the court concluded that mpi acted as an arbitrator and therefore was entitled to immunity from civil liability for all acts performed in its arbitral capacity.sltpc appealed.
we review a district court dismissal under.b de novo,accepting the allegations of the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.see dubbs head start,cir.
we begin by analyzing whether mpi appraisal constituted an arbitration within the meaning of the faa.because congress did not define arbitration in the faa,we must first decide which source of law provides that definition.relying on the option agreement provision electing delaware law,the district court turned to delaware law to define arbitration.on appeal,sltpc urges us to apply federal law.our review of the authorities leads us to conclude that sltpc position is correct and that federal law supplies the standard by which we must determine whether mpi appraisal was an arbitration.
in the absence of clear evidence that congress intended state law to define arbitration,we must assume that federal law provides the definition.the meaning that the law attaches to the term arbitration establishes the scope and force of the faa.unless congress plainly intended the various states laws to define arbitration,and to therefore regulate the faa application within their borders,we will look to federal law for the definition.see mississippi band of choctaw indians holyfield,d we start with the general assumption that in the absence of a plain indication to the contrary,congress when it enacts a statute is not making the application of the federal act dependent on state law.internal citations omitted.because federal law applies nationally,we assume that congress desires national uniformity in the application of its laws.see,jerome united states.those cases where congress intended state law to define a statutory term have usually been those where congress clearly did not intend uniformity.see holyfield,at.
neither the language nor the legislative history of the faa demonstrate that congress plainly intended state law to define the faa central term.not only does the faa lack a plain indication that state law should govern,it is silent as to what law defines arbitration.we can not,on the basis of congressional muteness,conclude that state law should define the faa pivotal word.
were we to hold that state law guides our determination,we would empower states to define arbitration as they choose,thus limiting the faa utility.this we decline to do.congress passed the faa to ensure that state law would not undermine arbitration agreements.southland keating,d congress intended to foreclose state legislative attempts to undercut the enforceability of arbitration agreements.in passing the faa to curb state attempts to eliminate arbitration provisions,congress likely did not delegate to the states the power to define arbitration in a way that would circumscribe its availability.it should not be necessary,but it definitely is,to stress that whether a given dispute resolution procedure is arbitration within the meaning of the faa is a question of federal,not state,law.i ian macneil,et,federal arbitration law a supp.
in concluding that state law should define arbitration,the district court relied on decisions by the ninth and fifth circuits.in wasyl,first boston,cir,the ninth circuit defined arbitration by reference to california law.although a subsequent panel faced with a similar question felt constrained to follow wasyl,all three judges concurred specially to question the vitality of wasyl portland general electric united states bank trust,cir mckeown,concurring.the judges declared it inappropriate to look to state law to define a term in a federal statute on a subject as to which congress has declared the need for national uniformity,and that the case before it illustrated that wasyl created a patchwork in which the faa will mean one thing in one state and something else in another.id.tashima and lay,concurring.in hartford lloyd insurance teachworth,cir,which explicitly followed the reasoning in wasyl,the fifth circuit defined arbitration by reference to both texas law and the law of other states.although this approach is preferable to looking to only one state law,we nonetheless conclude that applying federal law is the only way to ensure national uniformity.
congress did not plainly intend arbitration to mean different things in different states.rather,it sought a uniform federal policy favoring agreements to arbitrate.accordingly,we will apply federal law standards to determine whether mpi appraisal constituted arbitration.
under federal law,we must determine if the process at issue sufficiently resembles classic arbitration to fall within the purview of the faa.see,fit tech,bally total fitness holding,cir the question is how closely the specified procedure resembles classic arbitration.central to any conception of classic arbitration is that the disputants empowered a third party to render a decision settling their dispute.see harrison nissan motor,cir the essence of arbitration is that parties agreed to arbitrate their disputes through to completion,to an award made by a arbitrator.under this test,mpi appraisal did not constitute an arbitration.
sltpc and medianews fashioned an agreement where,in the event that they could not agree on a price and their chosen appraisers were too far apart,a third appraiser would contribute a value that may,or may not,be used to calculate the exercise price.parties need not establish proceedings resolving their disputes to gain the protections of the faa,but may choose from a broad range of procedures and tailor arbitration to suit their peculiar circumstances.however,one feature that must necessarily appertain to a process to render it an arbitration is that the third party decision will settle the dispute.see,macneil process is arbitration under the faa where the decision of the dispute resolver shall be both final and binding,subject only to the limited judicial review spelled out in the faa.
furthermore,the language employed by the parties in their contract has little probative weight.if the contract states that the third party decision is final and binding,courts must nonetheless scrutinize the process created by the parties to ascertain whether the third party decision does in fact resolve the dispute.we agree with the second circuit that what is important is whether the parties clearly intended to submit some disputes to their chosen instrument for the definitive settlement of grievances under the agreement.mcdonnell douglas,at internal quotation omitted emphasis added.
here,mpi appraisal would by no means definitively settle the dispute between sltpc and medianews.at most,mpi supplied a data point that the parties could use in establishing the exercise price.under the terms of the option agreement,a scenario existed where the parties would not use mpi report at all.if the party appraisers reported fair market values that constituted the two closest values,mpi value would not contribute to the exercise price.thus,if sltpc appraiser valued the newspaper at million and medianews appraiser assigned a million price tag,the parties would turn to a third appraiser because the higher value is greater than of the lower value.if that third appraiser returned with a million figure,the exercise price would equal the average of sltpc and medianews appraised values and would totally disregard the third evaluation.in such a circumstance the third appraiser report would hardly settle the parties dispute,yet under the process established by sltpc and medianews the hypothetical situation is no less likely than the one giving rise to this case.
mpi was not asked to decide between two values established by sltpc and medianews,nor were they asked to assign independently a single value binding on the parties.indeed the parties did not even agree to average mpi figure with one or both of their own.the parties merely asked mpi to prepare a report evaluating the newspaper and establishing the fair market value of the newspaper assets,a value which the parties may,under certain circumstances,have used to fix the exercise price under the option agreement.mpi report would not necessarily settle a dispute between sltpc and medianews.
perhaps recognizing that mpi appraisal,standing alone,does not constitute an arbitration,medianews stated at oral argument that the entire process,including the party appraisals,was an arbitration.medianews suggests that the appraisers respectively by the two parties,whose qualifications,abilities,and methods have been thoroughly impugned by the opposing party in the briefs,were somehow arbitrators with mpi.first,the court below dismissed sltpc claims based on its conclusion that mpi appraisal constituted an arbitration.nowhere did the district court suggest that the entire process constituted an arbitration.see salt lake tribune publishing company,llc management planning,ts,slip op.at,defendants contend that the third appraisal is an arbitration the court finds that,under delaware law,the third appraisal is an arbitration.second,to the extent there existed a dispute requiring arbitration,the party appraisers produced the dispute by affixing values more than ten percent apart.the appraisers selected by the individual parties functioned more like dueling experts than arbitrators.also belying the suggestion that the process constituted arbitration is the express language of the appraisal agreement that provides in the event the option agreement preclude s an appraisal in accordance with industry standards and principles,the parties agree to then seek guidance from the court to resolve that conflict.this hardly sounds like arbitration to us.because the process does not resemble classic arbitration,we reject medianews suggestion that the entire process constituted an arbitration.
although our conclusion that the parties did not structure a process sufficiently resembling classic arbitration resolves the question before us,we also note that the parties did not intend to submit their dispute to arbitration.see,oil,chemical atomic workers int l union american oil,cir the issue of arbitrability is for judicial determination because no party has to arbitrate a dispute unless it has consented thereto.because we are reviewing the district court dismissal of sltpc complaint pursuant to rule b,we must accept the allegations in the complaint as true and view them in the light most favorable to sltpc.see fuller norton,cir.the complaint reveals that the parties did not consent to,or intend to establish,an arbitration process.
we accept as true that at no time during the negotiation of the option agreement did the parties discuss utilizing the third appraisal in an arbitral manner.our review of the pleadings,which include,by incorporation,the option agreement and appraisal agreement,confirms that at the time of contracting the parties did not understand that the third appraisal would be subject to the faa and its limitations on judicial review.furthermore,at no point during negotiations with mpi did any party suggest that mpi would function as an arbitrator or that its appraisal would be considered an arbitral award.neither at the time of negotiating the option agreement nor during discussions with mpi did the parties intend to contractually bind themselves to arbitration.
when sltpc and medianews negotiated the option agreement they did not intend to submit a dispute over the exercise price to arbitration governed by the faa.rather they crafted a flexible process maximizing the likelihood that their respective values would contribute to the exercise price and permitting a single scenario under which only one of their appraised values would factor into the price.simply because mpi assigned a value to the newspaper assets that was closer to one of the parties evaluations than the parties were to each other does not render mpi report an arbitrator decision deserving immunity.accordingly,we reverse the district court order dismissing sltpc claims 
because the court below erred in resolving this dispute on the basis of arbitral immunity,the court failed to resolve sltpc claims at the b stage.this leaves us no alternative but reluctantly to remand for further proceedings.in doing so,we do not intend this decision to express any opinion as
