this diversity case involves a challenge to the valuation of a limited liability company as determined by the statutory appraisal procedure provided under maryland law.a member of the company,who objected to a reclassification of membership interests and merger that eliminated his interest in the company,exercised his right to have a statutory appraisal resolve the fair value of that interest immediately prior to the reclassification.the district court accordingly appointed a panel of three appraisers,who determined the value of the interest as of the day the company members voted to approve the reclassification.the company contends a court must adjust the valuation of that appraisal panel downward or order a new appraisal because the objecting interest holder assertedly presented to the appraisers evidence and arguments that conflicted with earlier rulings of the district court and the appraisers improperly included in their valuation appreciation resulting from the contested reclassification.the magistrate judge,who presided over the appraisal proceedings with the agreement of the parties,rejected these arguments and entered judgment for the member on the basis of the appraisers valuation of the company.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
this appeal grows out of a dispute between senior campus living,llc scl,a developer of large,retirement communities,and one of its former employees and interest holders brian froelich.scl owns a number of operating retirement communities and several future projects in various stages of development.
one future project regarded as critical by scl in the fall of was greenspring village in springfield,virginia.equitable real estate investment management,equitable had agreed to provide million in mezzanine financing for greenspring if scl first obtained million in construction financing.by september,scl had obtained a million construction loan from deposit trust company,but only on the condition that scl founder john still had substantial financial interests in scl despite selling the firm to froelich and others in a leveraged buyout in guarantee the loan.erickson agreed to provide the guarantee,and equitable then scheduled the closing for the greenspring financing for october.
on october,however,the scl board voted to remove froelich from his position as chief executive officer of the company and replace him with erickson.as a result,equitable decided to postpone the greenspring closing.equitable subsequently notified scl that it would require an additional million in personal guarantees from erickson to assuage its concerns about scl financial condition.
erickson told the scl board that he would provide personal guarantees for the additional million if the board reclassified its membership interests both preferred and common into a single class of common interests,with the reclassification to be based upon the fair market value of the company determined by an independent appraisal.under the previous classification of membership interests resulting from the leveraged,erickson had preferred interests in the company worth about million including accrued and unpaid interest.in addition,froelich and erickson brother,michael erickson,had subordinate preferred interests with assigned values of million and million,respectively.the common interests in the company were allotted among john erickson,michael erickson,froelich,and thirteen other scl employees.
these subordinate preferred and common interests only had value to the extent the company was worth more than the value of erickson senior preferred interests,million.thus,if the board acted on erickson proposal to reclassify the company preferred and common interests into a single class of common interests based on the company fair market value,erickson would end up with virtually all of the common stock of scl if the appraisal valued the company at less than million.
after forming independent committees to negotiate with erickson regarding his proposal,explore available alternatives to erickson offer,and confer with equitable regarding the greenspring closing,the scl board unanimously voted to recommend to the members that they accept erickson reclassification proposal.by november,fifteen of sixteen members had approved the proposal,with only froelich dissenting.on november,after erickson supplied the additional million in guarantees,scl,in erickson words,completed the signing and execution of all documents with mercantile and equitable for the million project financing for the greenspring project.
in december,scl retained coopers lybrand,llp coopers to perform an independent appraisal valuing the company as of the november,reclassification.coopers valued scl at million.this valuation included an appraisal of million for the greenspring project.the scl board accepted coopers valuation in january.because coopers appraised the company at less than the value of erickson preferred interests,million,the reclassification resulted in erickson holding of the new common interests and left froelich with after a merger in february eliminated his remaining interest.
shortly after the merger,froelich filed a fourteen count complaint against scl,erickson,and others in federal court.froelich alleged,inter alia,breach of fiduciary duty,asserting that erickson had disparaged scl to potential investors thereby thwarting scl ability to obtain capital in order to regain control over scl and had devalued and engaged in with respect to froelich preferred and common interests.froelich also alleged fraud,claiming that erickson and the scl board had agreed,at the time of the leveraged of scl,that erickson would relinquish authority to run scl and not disparage scl,when in fact they knew that erickson would not honor this agreement.in addition,froelich asserted rights to severance pay and to a statutory appraisal the latter of which had allegedly been triggered by the november,reclassification and subsequent merger.
judge benson legg granted summary judgment to scl on all allegations of fraud and breach of fiduciary duty.see froelich erickson,d.however,judge legg granted summary judgment to froelich with respect to his claim for severance pay and his demand for a statutory appraisal.id.at.as to the latter,the judge concluded that froelich is entitled to appraisal rights and that appraisers would be appointed to value froelich interest in scl as of november,which is just prior to the reclassification.id.at.in an unpublished opinion,we affirmed in all respects the judgment entered by judge legg.froelich senior campus living,llc,no,wl.cir.
judge legg then followed the procedures set forth in,corps.ass ns a and appointed three disinterested appraisers,whom scl and froelich had recommended,to value scl as of november.the appraisers appointed to perform the valuation were patrick ring,joseph gardemal,and robert frank.patrick ring,the panel chairman,received an mba in financing from wharton,worked as a bank officer for almost twenty years,wrote over thirty articles on business valuation and other financial subjects,and since had worked with the company,a business valuation company.joseph gardemal,another panel member,was certified as a public accountant,fraud examiner,valuation panelist,and government financial manager,and had worked in a number of accounting firms on business valuation and related financial matters and was currently working with capital analysis group,a financial consulting firm,in which he was responsible for business valuation and litigation support.finally,robert frank was a chartered financial analyst,who had worked as a managing director of a real estate securities research group and was currently serving as the managing director of incap group.
the parties agreed that magistrate judge paul grimm would preside over the appraisal proceedings.the parties submitted two bound volumes of exhibits and deposition excerpts to the three appraisers,who heard testimony from witnesses for three days in march.the appraisers considered evidence that included a letter dated december,from an scl board member to coopers stating that scl has been unable to secure financing to further develop the future projects including greenspring,despite the fact that as of the november,valuation date,arrangements for financing the greenspring project were in place except for provision of million in personal guarantees from erickson and that scl actually closed on the greenspring project on november.the appraisers also heard testimony from coopers officials indicating that coopers had relied on these representations in its appraisal.additionally,an equitable official testified that equitable might have been willing to close on the greenspring deal without erickson million guarantee as long as the full million in construction financing was in place.froelich also presented the appraisers with evidence regarding the willingness of other financial institutions to invest in scl.
after considering this and other evidence,the appraisers heard closing arguments and received lengthy memoranda from the parties.on june,the panel issued majority and minority reports all three appraisers determined that the value of scl as of november,was million,which was million higher than coopers million valuation.
two members of the panel,ring and gardemal,issued a page majority report,which used two separate valuation methods to value scl at million.ring and gardemal first method analyzed the approaches used in the three appraisal reports submitted to the panel the coopers report,as well as two additional commissioned by each of the parties,and then determined which approach arrived at the most reasonable conclusion as to the fair value of each scl property.in this lead analysis,ring and gardemal adopted the million valuation of the greenspring project calculated by froelich appraiser,thomas nagle of valuation counselors,rather than coopers million valuation of greenspring or the million valuation advanced by the expert commissioned by scl.ring and gardemal also adopted nagle valuations for all of scl current projects which were generally lower that those offered by coopers,and adopted estimates significantly lower than nagle for scl other future projects.thus,the majority panelists higher appraisal for greenspring largely explains why their million total valuation of scl significantly exceeded coopers million total valuation 
to test the validity of the million total valuation based on their lead analysis,ring and gardemal conducted an alternative independent valuation analysis,which used cash flow projections provided by scl management.this alternative valuation confirmed the million value they had reached in the lead analysis.further,the third member of the panel,robert frank,filed an separate report,in which he employed still a different valuation method to arrive at an identical total value for scl of million as of november.
both scl and froelich filed objections seeking modification of the appraisal assessment.judge grimm heard extensive oral argument,and then,in a thorough and persuasive oral opinion,denied the objections and adopted the appraisal panel unanimous conclusion that the value of scl as of november,was million.judge grimm concluded that scl had not shown that any part of the greenspring valuation conflicted with judge legg ruling that the decision of the board of directors fell within the protection of the business judgment rule,nor had it presented evidence sufficient to convince him that the panel had erroneously included value created by the reclassification by failing to adjust for erickson million in personal guarantees.further,judge grimm held that even if he had found the majority lead analysis to be defective,he would have simply adopted the majority alternative analysis or frank minority report as his own valuation,and that this would have correct ed the error.judge grimm entered final judgment in favor of froelich in the amount of about million,representing the value of his interest in scl on november,and prejudgment interest.
scl noted a timely appeal froelich does not cross appeal.
the maryland general assembly first authorized corporate consolidations and mergers in.see roselle park trust ward baking.four decades later,in,the general assembly enacted legislation providing a stockholder objecting to a consolidation,merger,or sale of all corporate assets the right to demand fair value for his interests,as determined by a statutory appraisal.see warren baltimore transit,am.camp.this legislation was intended to overcome the problem,which had proved in the past a disadvantage to the other stockholders,of objecting stockholders blocking mergers or consolidations arguably beneficial to the corporation,and,at the same time,to protect fully the property rights of the objecting stockholder.am,at.
thus for almost a century,maryland has provided by statute that by compliance with prescribed conditions and procedure one maryland corporation can be consolidated with,or merged into,another,or sell substantially all of its assets,with the approval of less than all of the stockholders,but stockholders objecting to the consolidation,merger,or sale of substantially all corporate assets,upon satisfaction of certain conditions,have the absolute statutory right to demand and receive payment of the fair value of the stockholder stock from the successor,corps.assn a see,corps.assn et.see generally,hanks,maryland corporation law at and supp.hereinafter hanks manning,the stockholder appraisal remedy an essay for frank coker,yale.
the maryland general corporation law directs that this fair value is to be determined by an appraisal performed by three disinterested appraisers.ann.corps.assn a.the statute sets forth the valuation date,providing that,with exceptions inapplicable here,fair value is determined as of the close of business on the day the stockholders voted on the transaction objected to which the parties agree is november,in this case.b ii.the statute further provides that,again with inapplicable exceptions,fair value may not include any appreciation or depreciation which directly or indirectly results from the transaction objected to or from its proposal.b.it also sets forth in some detail the procedure to be followed in obtaining a statutory determination of fair value,including the time in which an objecting stockholder can exercise his appraisal right,the required notices,and the content of the petition for appraisal.see to.finally,the statute provides that the court shall,after consideration of the appraisers report and on motion of any party,enter an order which c onfirms,modifies,or rejects it.a.
the maryland general corporation law does not,however,further define or describe fair value.nor does it set forth the standard a court should employ in reviewing the appraisers determination of fair value.moreover,notwithstanding the venerable history of the maryland statutory appraisal right,few cases have discussed the meaning of fair value or the role of courts in reviewing the statutory appraisers resolution of that question.in those few cases,however,maryland high court has provided some helpful guidance.
the court has recognized that each corporation poses a particular valuation problem and noted the manifold possibilities and difficulties of the problem,and the impracticability of the statement of any rule of uniform application as to the factors of fair value.am,at.the court has also pointed out that t he real objective is to ascertain the actual worth of that which the dissenter loses because of his unwillingness to go along with the controlling stockholders,that is,to indemnify him.warren,at.thus,although the value of the dissenting stockholder stock should not be affected by a corporate change in which he refused to participate,am,at,the corporation should,unless in liquidation,be valued by assuming that it will continue as a going concern and by appraising all material factors and elements that affect value warren,at see hanks,at.accordingly,that the corporation may not offer stockholders more than the market value does not mean that the appraisers are so limited.burke fid.trust.
given the complexity and idiosyncracies of the valuation of a dissenting stockholder interest,it is hardly surprising that the maryland courts have concluded that the role of the judiciary in an appraisal proceeding is limited.warren,at.in recognition that t he questions involved are rather economic than legal in character,courts are to give great weight to the findings of the appraisers.id.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the standard for judicial review of an appraisal panel determination of fair value is extremely deferential 
the presumption is that their award is correct,and effect will be given to their determination unless it appear by clear and satisfactory evidence that the award was,by reason of some material and prejudicial error of law,in conduct or of fact,not the fair value of the stock,without regard to any depreciation or appreciation thereof in consequence of the merger or consolidation.
am,at accord warren,at see also burke,at.
with these principles in mind,we turn to scl two challenges regarding the statutory appraisal in this case.
scl initially contends that judge grimm erred in permitting froelich to present certain evidence and arguments to the appraisal panel that directly contradict the prior,binding judicial rulings of judge legg and this court.brief of appellant at.specifically,scl complains that judge grimm ignored judge legg prior rulings in permitting froelich to offer evidence and argument that coopers november,appraisal was flawed because coopers did not receive accurate and complete information from erickson and scl officials on which to base its appraisal.id.at.the company asserts that froelich submissions regarding the cooper appraisal directly conflict with judge legg rejection of froelich fraud and breach of fiduciary duty claims against scl and erickson and judge legg finding that the decisions of the scl board are protected by the business judgment rule.froelich,d at.
scl argument rests on a misunderstanding of judge legg initial findings,the statutory appraisal process,and the deference accorded a trial court rulings as to the propriety of legal argument and the admissibility of evidence.
first,judge legg never addressed most of the grounds on which scl objects to froelich evidence and argument.for example,in granting summary judgment to erickson and scl on froelich fraud counts,judge legg understandably addressed only froelich relevant allegations,that erickson and the scl board had fraudulently represented to froelich in the leveraged of scl that erickson would relinquish authority to run scl and not make disparaging remarks about the company when they knew he had no intention of honoring this agreement.froelich,at.similarly,in granting erickson summary judgment on froelich breach of fiduciary duty claim,judge legg only rejected froelich contention that erickson usurped a corporate opportunity by retaking control of the company and its profitability,finding no credible evidence that erickson created a financial crisis or that the scl board did not actually view erickson proposal as the best alternative for the company.id.at.nowhere in these rulings,or his rulings on froelich other counts,did judge legg even discuss scl provision of information to coopers.
certainly,judge legg never determined the factual accuracy of the financing information scl submitted to coopers.contrary to scl suggestions,judge legg ruling that the business judgment rule protected the scl board does not equate to a finding that the board decisions were correct.the business judgment rule simply requires courts to defer to the decisions of corporate boards unless a challenger produces evidence establishing that the directors acted fraudulently or in bad faith,naacp golding,or with gross or culpable negligence,parish maryland virginia milk producers ass n,see,corps.assn codifying standard of care required of corporate directors see also hanks,at supp.under the business judgment rule,a ll that is required of directors is that they act reasonably and in good faith in carrying out their duties they are not expected to be incapable of error.naacp,at emphasis added internal quotation marks and citation omitted 
we recognize that froelich arguments that erickson or other scl officials withheld relevant information from coopers resulting in fatal flaws in coopers valuation may be in some tension with judge legg rejection of froelich fraud and breach of fiduciary duty claims.but that tension does not constitute an irreconcilable conflict.judge legg found froelich entitled to a statutory appraisal at the very same time he rejected froelich fraud and fiduciary duty claims.moreover,judge legg explicitly recognized that froelich likelihood of success before the appraisers depended upon his ability to prove to them that the coopers and lybrand appraisal was flawed.froelich,d at.this entirely accords with the view of the maryland court of appeals that,without any proof of fraud,majority and minority stockholders may hold a wide variance in opinion as to the value of a corporation,necessitating a statutory appraisal.see homer crown cork seal,accord lerner lerner,see also walk baltimore ohio,cir noting,in the course of applying maryland law,that allegations of fraud are often nothing more than disagreements about methods of valuation,which are more appropriately resolved in the statutory appraisal proceeding,vacated on other grounds by,d.
indeed,the very purpose of the statutory appraisal in this value the company to determine the fair value of froelich interest as of november,required the appraisers to consider all evidence as to any shortcomings in the coopers appraisal.section a directs statutory appraisers to determine the fair value of a stockholder interest in the corporation in doing so,the appraisers must consider all material factors and elements that affect value.warren,at emphasis added.because coopers valued scl at less than million as of november,the reclassification of the company approved on that date resulted in a total elimination of froelich interest.the validity of the coopers appraisal,therefore,certainly constituted a material factor affect ing the value of froelich interest,which,under warren,the statutory appraisers were required to consider.
finally,scl argument completely ignores the operative standard of review when examining rulings challenging legal arguments as improper or evidence as inadmissible,under which we will vacate a judgment only if the trial court abused its discretion.see rowland am,cir arnold air lines,cir.because of a trial judge superior vantage point we defer to him or her in such matters even in jury trials,see,arnold,at,when any improper argument or inadmissible evidence could mislead lay people.this deference seems all the more appropriate in statutory appraisal proceedings in which three sophisticated business people determine the primarily economic question of corporate value.see warren,at.
our close review of the record here reveals no abuse of discretion.rather,froelich presented the appraisers with a very substantial amount of appropriate evidence and argument supporting his contention that the coopers appraisal lacked validity.accordingly,contrary to scl contentions,it was well within the district court discretion to find that any fragments of improper argument or inadmissible evidence did not unfairly prejudic e the company.brief of appellant at.indeed,we note that judge grimm patient superintending of numerous documents and complicated testimony and his scrupulous consideration of the parties legal contentions before,during,and after the appraisal hearings evidence the utmost care,rather than any abuse of discretion.
scl also contends that we must reject the statutory appraisal because it includes appreciation in value resulting from the very reclassification of scl stock to which froelich objected.as noted above,the maryland general corporation law expressly prohibits appraisers from including in their fair value determination any appreciation which directly or indirectly results from the transaction objected to or from its proposal.b emphasis added.
according to scl,the november reclassification was needed to obtain erickson agreement to pledge guarantees of million,which in turn were needed to secure the million in financing c
