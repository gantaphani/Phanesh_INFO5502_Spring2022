this is an appeal from a decision of the court of chancery refusing to vacate previous orders of the court ordering specific performance of a merger agreement and approving the settlement of related shareholder claims.the appellant,tyson foods,tyson,filed a timely appeal from the denial of vacatur but seeks to expand the scope of that appeal to include review of the merits of the subsidiary rulings as well.appellees,plaintiffs in a related derivative action pending in a federal district court,have moved to dismiss tyson appeal to the extent it seeks review of rulings of the court of chancery beyond the denial of vacatur.on that limited question,we now conclude that the subsidiary rulings of the court of chancery are time barred or moot and not subject to review in the present appeal.
this controversy was spawned by the attempted merger of tyson with a competitor in the food processing business,ibp,ibp in early.in the previous year,ibp had been the subject of a planned leveraged and an unsolicited offer from a third party.these efforts led to a series of stockholder class actions in the court of chancery and the district court for the district of delaware challenging management actions.following the announcement of the agreement,that proposal was challenged as well and both tyson and ibp became defendants in the court of chancery shareholder action.
in march,tyson,apparently disenchanted with the merger prospect,filed suit in arkansas to rescind its agreement with ibp.ibp responded by seeking specific performance of the merger agreement in the court of chancery through the filing of a in the consolidated shareholder action.eventually,the dispute was submitted to the court of chancery on an expedited basis and,on june,the court issued a lengthy opinion the opinion rejecting tyson attempt to withdraw from the merger agreement.in effect,the court of chancery ruled that ibp and the ibp shareholders were entitled to specific performance.
shortly after the court of chancery issued its opinion,federal securities suits were filed against tyson and its officers and directors the federal actions.the thrust of the federal actions was that the tyson defendants had violated the federal securities laws by,among other things,issuing a press release which contained false and materially misleading information regarding tyson reasons for terminating the merger agreement.the federal actions were brought by ibp stockholders who sold their stock allegedly in reliance upon the truth of tyson communications regarding its basis for terminating the merger agreement and its accusations of fraud against ibp.the federal plaintiffs relied,in part,on several factual findings made by the court of chancery in its opinion.
within two weeks of the court of chancery decision,tyson and ibp reached an agreement to consummate the merger.on june,the court of chancery entered an order that recited the parties settlement but acknowledged that because all the claims in the case had not been resolved or adjudicated,the order is not presently appealable as of right.tyson promptly set about to negotiate a resolution of the shareholders actions.on june,the parties submitted a stipulation of settlement to the court of chancery which,in addition to resolving the specific performance action,would release all claims by ibp shareholders,including those in the federal actions.
on august,the court of chancery held a hearing on the proposed settlement.at the hearing,the status of the federal action became a point of controversy.tyson sought court approval for the settlement on terms that would include release of all claims by ibp shareholders directed to the merger,including those in the federal action.objectors,the present appellees,representing the plaintiffs in the federal action,contested the release of their claims.tyson argued that the federal action should also be released because the federal plaintiffs were advancing claims based upon factual findings made by the court of chancery in its opinion.the court of chancery agreed with the federal plaintiffs and approved the settlement with a for the federal action.the august order settled t he plaintiffs claims asserted in the consolidated action on behalf of the class it further recited without affecting the finality of this order and final judgment,jurisdiction is hereby retained by this court for the purpose of protecting and implementing the stipulation and the terms of this order and final judgment emphasis added.
on august,three days after its entry,the register in chancery advised counsel for the parties that an order of final judgment was signed by the court of chancery.counsel for tyson responded in a letter to the court,acknowledging the register notice of the entry of a final judgment but noting,with the concurrence of ibp counsel,that no final order or judgment has been entered by the court with respect to the asserted by ibp,and tyson foods,against each other.we expect to contact the court promptly after consummation of the merger to discuss the disposition of the matter at that time.the merger between tyson and ibp closed on september,and effective that date ibp as a separate legal entity ceased to exist.
on january,tyson filed a motion in the court of chancery to vacate the opinion in order to negate the effect of the court factual findings,which were sought to be used for collateral estoppel purposes in the federal action.since ibp was no longer a responding entity and the ibp shareholders in the chancery action had settled their claims,tyson served its motion on the plaintiffs in the federal action.those individuals vigorously disputed tyson efforts in the court of chancery and,as appellees in this court,have moved to limit the scope of the present appeal.
in rejecting tyson vacatur motion,the court of chancery concluded that its order of august,approving settlement of both the shareholder action and ibp claim for specific performance was a final judgment,entered at tyson behest.since tyson had chosen to waive its appellate rights with full knowledge of the intentions of the federal plaintiffs to use certain factual findings in the opinion for preclusive effect,the court concluded that there was no equitable basis for granting vacatur.the court of chancery decision denying vacatur was entered on february.on march,tyson filed a notice of appeal seeking review of both the order denying vacatur and the opinion,as implemented by the court order of june,and four previous rulings,adverse to tyson,made prior to trial.
the federal plaintiffs,named as appellees in the present appeal,have moved to dismiss six of the seven rulings appealed by tyson.the appellees argue that,except for the court of chancery ruling denying vacatur,all other decisions sought to be appealed are either time barred or moot.in response to this motion,we ordered briefing and argument limited to the question of the permissible scope of tyson march,appeal.
an aggrieved party can appeal to this court only after a final judgment is entered by the trial court.const.art.iv,a harrison ramunno.a final judgment is generally defined as one that determines the merits of the controversy or defines the rights of the parties and leaves nothing for future determination or consideration.showell poultry,delmarva poultry,catlin united states.in short,a final judgment is one that determines all the claims as to all the parties.the test for whether an order is final and therefore ripe for appeal is whether the trial court has clearly declared its intention that the order be the court final act in a case.kislak mortgage william matthews builder,holding order is deemed final if decision is trial court last act in disposing of all justiciable matters within its jurisdiction.
despite the foregoing rules,the proper application of the final judgment rule continues to be the subject of frequent litigation in federal and state courts.d judgments this case illustrates the problem that may arise when a party seeks to appeal an order that the trial court believed was final when entered.although the trial court intention to enter a final order is an essential element in the inquiry,the mer
