respondent alliant insurance services,alliant is an insurance brokerage business that obtains insurance for construction companies.in,alliant purchased a competing insurance brokerage,gaddy ward company insurance brokers gwc,for million.pursuant to the purchase of the business,appellant scott gaddy,the majority shareholder in gwc,agreed in writing to refrain from carrying on a business,directly or indirectly,which provides any of alliant business within the counties of the state of california.
when it learned that gaddy was contacting its clients,alliant sought and obtained a preliminary injunction which,among other things,prohibits gaddy from carrying on business directly or indirectly which provides any company business within the counties of california.
gaddy appeals.he contends the geographic scope of the injunction is unlawful.he argues it should be limited to only four counties where,according to gaddy,alliant has construction clients.
for reasons that follow,we shall reject gaddy arguments and affirm the order granting the preliminary injunction.we find no reason to refuse to enforce the geographic counties of the state of gaddy expressly agreed to when he sold gwc for million.
factual and procedural background 
on january,plaintiffs alliant and gwc filed a complaint for breach of contract,misappropriation of trade secrets,breach of fiduciary duty,tortious interference with business relationships,conversion,and a request for a permanent injunction.the complaint alleged that,on april,alliant purchased its competitor,gwc,for million.defendant was a majority shareholder of gwc at the time of purchase and then became employed by alliant until he was terminated in october the stock purchase agreement,to which defendant was both a party and principal signatory,contained a covenant that defendant would not compete in the insurance business for a specified time through march.defendant employment agreement senior management agreement contained the same noncompetition covenant.each contract also contained a covenant whereby defendant agreed not to solicit any clients of alliant known to defendant by virtue of his employment at alliant or gwc for three years after termination of employment.
thus,section of the stock purchase agreement and senior management agreement each provided in part 
the sellers acknowledge and agree that substantial and valuable assets which belong to the company include the trade names,confidential information,relationships with clients and active prospective clients,and goodwill of the company,and that the relationships which the company have sic with its employees and independent producers are significant business relationships necessary for the company to continue to operate its business.the sellers further acknowledge and agree that,following the closing,such sellers will continue to have access to the aforesaid assets and relationships,as well as access to similar assets and relationships of other alliant companies,by virtue of continued employment with the company following the closing.the sellers further acknowledge and agree that each of buyer,the company and the other alliant companies has a reasonable,necessary and legitimate business interest in protecting the aforesaid assets and relationships and businesses,and that the covenants set forth below are reasonable and necessary in order to protect these legitimate business interests.the sellers further acknowledge and agree that the payment at closing of the portion of the purchase price due at closing shall constitute full consideration for such covenants in addition,the sellers acknowledge and agree that monetary damages will not be an adequate remedy for any material breach of any of their covenants contained in this section,and that irreparable injury may result to buyer,the company other alliant companies,or their successors in interest,in the event of any such material breach 
b each seller will not,directly or indirectly solicit the provision of any company business from,or provide,accept any offer to provide or otherwise induce the termination or of any company business to,any client or active prospective client of the company or any other alliant company provided in the latter case,that such seller had substantial contact or became familiar with such client or active prospective client during his employment with the company,except in the normal course of business on behalf of the company or such other alliant company.the restrictions contained in this subsection b shall terminate upon the later of i five years after the economic effective date or ii three years after the effective date on which such seller employment,if any,with the company,or its successors in interest,terminates,unless such seller is entitled following such termination to severance or commission sharing payments for a period extending beyond such three year period,in which event the restrictive period under this clause ii shall terminate the end of such payment period 
c each seller hereby agrees to refrain from carrying on a business,directly or indirectly,which provides any company business within the restricted territory defined in the contracts as the counties of the state of california.the restrictions contained in this subsection c shall terminate i in the case of a majority shareholder,upon the later of a five years after the economic effective date or b two years after the effective date on which such seller employment with the company,or its successors in interest,terminates,unless such seller is entitled following such termination to severance or commission sharing payments for a period extending beyond such two year period,in which event the restrictive period under this clause i b shall terminate at the end of such payment period 
the complaint alleged that defendant,after termination of his employment,began contacting more than gwc clients,misappropriating alliant property and trade secrets,and soliciting business from plaintiffs customers.
plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction.alliant vice president gregory zimmer attested in a declaration that defendant worked for alliant from until defendant termination in october.during his employment,defendant had access to alliant confidential customer files.defendant former gwc partner,harry stanley ward,who is currently employed by alliant,attested in a declaration that at least two of plaintiffs clients moved their accounts to a competitor after being contacted by defendant.plaintiffs declarations also stated gwc had its principal place of business in lodi but provided insurance products to construction based clients in all counties of the state of california.
defendant opposed the request for a preliminary injunction,arguing in part that the covenants against competition and solicitation were illegal and void.
defendant also submitted his own declaration,attesting in part that gwc principally did business in four counties,sacramento,san joaquin,stanislaus,and fresno,though we did have two clients in sonoma county and one client in contra costa county.defendant admitted contacting his former clients after plaintiffs terminated his employment but disputed that any customer information was confidential.he believed he could act as a consultant to former clients without violating the covenants.he stopped when plaintiffs objected.defendants former clients continued to call him.they asked him about other insurers and agents,and defendant did my best to answer as honestly as i could.again,at no time did i ever solicit their business or steel sic them away from gwc or alliant.defendant attested he did not know why customers left plaintiffs but i do know that the problems that i pointed out to plaintiff before i left would be a basis for customers to change to a different broker,and i also know that no client left plaintiffs based on any action by me.
defendant also made evidentiary objections to hearsay statements in plaintiffs declarations about plaintiffs clients being solicited by defendant.the trial court sustained the evidentiary objections and we therefore disregard that evidence.however,there was no objection to ward statement that at least two clients had moved their accounts from alliant after being contacted by defendant.
in their reply papers,plaintiffs submitted a supplemental declaration from ward attesting to conversations with defendant,in which defendant said he intended to start a consulting business providing insurance and surety consulting,and he would need approximately of his old clients and had been contacting them for that purpose.the supplemental declaration asserted plaintiffs customer information,including commission amounts and policy renewal dates when clients were most likely to switch to a competitor,was proprietary information.the supplemental declaration also said an essential part of gwc business was dealing with a nationwide network of insurance companies located in all counties of california as well as the entire united states.
although the trial court tentative ruling was to deny a preliminary injunction,the court was concerned about issues raised in the reply papers,and the court allowed defendant the opportunity to testify at the hearing,which he did.in his testimony,defendant said the consulting business he tried to start would not have involved the provision of insurance or bond products but would have encompassed matters such as reviewing financial reports,agreements,acquisition strategy,and financial planning.defendant admitted his conversation with ward about contacting former clients but denied saying he needed clients.defendant admitted he initiated contact with h alf a dozen to a dozen former clients.defendant said he was aware that plaintiffs lost two clients to a competitor who employed a good friend of defendant,though defendant denied speaking with the friend about the clients.defendant acknowledged gwc was licensed not only in california but also in other states,so that gwc could conduct business in those states.
on february,the trial court issued an order granting the preliminary injunction.the court said the information defendant had regarding gwc former customers,combined with his intimate knowledge of plaintiffs business operation and customer accounts,constituted trade secrets under civil code section,subdivision d and confidential information within the meaning of the stock purchase agreement.the court noted defendant admitted he initiated contact with gwc clients after plaintiffs terminated his employment.defendant failed to substantiate his estimated claim of a million loss.a preliminary injunction was necessary to maintain the status quo.failing to enjoin defendant could result in a subsequent judgment being ineffective and the amount of damages was difficult to ascertain.the court said its determination was based on the stock purchase agreement,but the alleged conduct may also violate the senior management agreement.the court directed plaintiffs to post as security a bond of 
the court ordered issuance of a preliminary injunction prohibiting defendant from a directly or indirectly using or willfully disclosing to any person without plaintiff permission or court approval information about plaintiff clients,as defined by the court b directly or indirectly soliciting plaintiffs clients within the counties of california c carrying on business directly or indirectly which provides any company business within the counties of california d directly or indirectly soliciting,hiring,retaining the services of plaintiffs employees or independent producers who were employees or independent producers of gwc or plaintiff e destroying or altering any information regarding the facts at issue in this case and f directly or indirectly soliciting,hiring,assisting,or accepting assistance of any other person or entity in attempting to accomplish any of the acts prohibited by the preliminary injunction.

discussion 
standard of review 
we review an order granting a preliminary injunction under an abuse of discretion standard,to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in evaluating the two interrelated factors pertinent to issuance of a preliminary injunction the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial,and the interim harm that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction were denied as compared to the harm the defendant is likely to suffer if the preliminary injunction were issued.vo city of garden grove th,d.abuse of discretion as to either factor warrants reversal.carsten city of del mar th,d.
where the likelihood of prevailing on the merits depends upon a question of law such as statutory construction,the question on appeal is whether the trial court correctly interpreted and applied the law,which we review de novo.strategix,infocrossing west,th,d strategix.
in determining the validity of the injunction,we look at the evidence presented to the trial court to determine if there was substantial support for the trial court determination that the plaintiff was entitled to the relief granted.monogram industries,sar industries,d.monogram.where the evidence before the trial court was in conflict,we do not reweigh it or determine the credibility of witnesses on appeal.t he trial court is the judge of the credibility of the affidavits filed in support of the application for preliminary injunction and it is that court province to resolve conflicts.citation.our task is to ensure that the trial court factual determinations,whether express or implied,are supported by substantial evidence.citation.thus,we interpret the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and indulge in all reasonable inferences in support of the trial court order.citations.shoemaker county of los angeles th,d shoemaker,citing monogram,supra,among other cases.
ii.validity of covenants 
defendant argues the trial court order enforces illegal restraints on trade.defendant refers to the two covenants as a noncompetition covenant and a nonsolicitation covenant,whereas plaintiffs call the nonsolicitation covenant a restrictive provision.we will use defendant terms,since both covenants restrict competition.
noncompetition covenant 
although defendant agreed to a noncompetition covenant which expressly defined the restricted territory as the counties in the state of california,he argues the covenant is invalid as an illegal restraint on trade because the geographic scope exceeds the territory where gwc did business.we shall conclude the covenant is not invalid on this record.
thus,california public policy affirms a person right to pursue the lawful occupation of his or her choice.citation.our legislature has codified this public policy in business and professions code section.it provides,except as provided in this chapter,every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession,trade,or business of any kind is to that extent void.ibid.strategix,supra,th at,d.an exception exists for a noncompetition covenant in connection with the sale of a business,pursuant to section,which provides in part any person who sells the goodwill of a business,or any owner of a business entity selling or otherwise disposing of all of his or her ownership interest in the business entity,may agree with the buyer to refrain from carrying on a similar business within a specified geographic in which the business so sold has been carried on,so long as the buyer,or any person deriving title to the goodwill or ownership interest from the buyer,carries on a like business therein.italics added.
the reason for this exception to the general rule against noncompetition covenants is to prevent the seller from depriving the buyer of the full value of its acquisition,including the sold company goodwill.strategix,supra,th at,d.it was the policy of the common law,within reasonable limits,to protect the purchaser in the enjoyment of the good will which he had purchased and paid for.kaplan nalpak d,kaplan.the sold business goodwill is the expectation of that patronage which has become an asset of the business.strategix,supra,th at,d.the geographic scope of a noncompetition covenant must be limited to the area where the sold company carried on business because o therwise,a seller could be barred from engaging in its business in places where it poses little threat of undercutting the company it sold to the buyer.ibid.
monogram,supra,d,upheld a preliminary injunction prohibiting competition anywhere within the united states following the sale of a business.the seller there argued the sold business was a mere subcontractor for the buyer,and the subcontracting activities making prototype toilets for the buyer magic flush system were confined to the area of laguna niguel and los angeles.id.at.the appellate court said,prior to the acquisition modular the sold company had achieved a favorable identity in the field on a nationwide basis.monogram,in marketing the magic flush system nationwide with the identifiable modular component,was creating additional goodwill for modular.a business can develop and enjoy a public goodwill even though its product is sold by another company as a component of the latter end product.id.at.monogram noted that,although section is designed to protect the buyer of business goodwill,it does not limit its application to transactions involving any quantum of prior sales activity.in fact in describing the permissible area to be covered by a covenant not to compete it speaks of where the business was carried on rather than the extent of the goodwill.the two terms are not necessarily synonymous.in kaplan,supra,d,the seller of shares in a manufacturing corporation sought to limit the scope of a covenant not to compete to the county in which the corporation maintained its plant and shipping department.he claimed that that was where the business was carried on even though the corporation had substantial sales in counties.the court there kaplan rejected this narrow interpretation,and in doing so held that the area in which a business is carried on is as broad as the area where the goodwill of the business has been established.in light of the context of that holding we monogram conclude that the kaplan court was not limiting the area to that of the goodwill of the business,but was in effect saying,by way of rejecting the limited interpretation of the seller,that the area was at least as broad as the area where the goodwill had been established.monogram,supra,d at.
monogram,supra,d,held the area where a business is carried on within the meaning of section is not limited to the locations of its buildings,plants and warehouses,nor the area in which it actually made sales.the territorial limits are coextensive with the entire area in which the parties conducted all phases of their business including production,promotional and marketing activities as well as sales.id.at.
monogram also said,the language of section insures that the competition is in fact such and not simply insubstantial and infrequent or isolated transactions.citations.id.at.monogram cited,among other authorities,swenson file cal d,which said with respect to the comparable statute authorizing noncompetition covenants upon dissolution of partnerships w e the california supreme court do not believe that the legislature intended the statute to sanction restraints upon all business transactions of whatever character,regardless of their noncompetitive effect,their insubstantial nature,or their infrequent occurrence.instead,we the california supreme court have concluded that in using the words carry on a similar business,the legislature had in mind the direct or indirect transaction or solicitation of substantial business activities in competition with the covenantee see kaplan nalpak,supra,d,rather than the occurrence of isolated,occasional transactions not substantially affecting the covenantee competition position.swenson,supra,cal d at.swenson added,ordinarily,a single,isolated transaction does not constitute carrying on business under statutes using that or similar terminology.citation.id.at,fn.
here,the specified geographic area defined in the covenant and in the trial court order was the entire state of california.
defendant argues the evidence showed that gwc,which was physically located in lodi,carried on its business primarily in sacramento,san joaquin,stanislaus and fresno c ounties.
plaintiffs brief on appeal agrees gwc construction clients were located mostly in northern california,but plaintiffs argue another part of gwc business involved relationships with the insurance companies which provided the products for the construction clients.
thus,in support of their request for a preliminary injunction,plaintiffs submitted a declaration from defendant former gwc partner,stanley ward,who attested that gwc was a california corporation,with its primary place of business in lodi,which was engaged in providing insurance related services to the construction industry throughout the state of california.plaintiffs also submitted a declaration of alliant vice president gregory zimmer,who attested prior to the time of its purchase by alliant on april,gwc,was an insurance agency and broker with its principal place of business in lodi,california and was a competitor to alliant,particularly in providing insurance products to construction based clients and prospective clients located in all counties in the state of california.
in opposition to the request for preliminary injunction,defendant submitted his own declaration attesting gwc principally did business in four counties,sacramento,san joaquin,stanislaus,and fresno,though gwc did have two clients in sonoma county and one client in contra costa county.
in reply,ward supplemental declaration did not dispute that gwc construction clients were based in those counties,but the declaration asserted that another part of its business consisted of procuring insurance from insurance companies throughout california.the supplemental declaration stated in part 
gwc provided brokerage services to construction clients to find them the most competitive insurance programs for their casualty needs,including property,automobile,general liability,and workers compensation,as well as to provide surety services,which include construction completion bonds that are required by the public and private entities.gwc client base started in with approximately construction based companies,and swelled to nearly companies by the time we sold the gwc clients as well as all other gwc assets to alliant in.gwc carried on its business in the following manner gwc would contact its construction clients and prospective clients to gather information concerning the nature and extent of their construction practice located throughout the state of california in order to determine what type of insurance and surety products would be necessary for the particular construction company.in order to provide appropriate insurance products,an essential part of gwc business was to determine the type of insurance and surety policies available as well as the price for those products from numerous insurance companies located throughout the counties of california,as well as the entire united states.typically,after gwc obtained insurance products and premium quotes from several insurance providers,it would present the competitive programs and premium quotes to the construction client who would make the decision as to which insurance program would be accepted based in part on the recommendations of gwc.once gwc construction client accepted an insurance proposal,gwc would interact with the selected insurance provider to formalize the insurance commitment and thereafter gwc would be compensated in one of two ways the construction client paid gwc a fee for its brokerage services,or the insurance provider would pay gwc a commission out of the premium that the construction client pays for the actual insurance coverage.the interaction with the nationwide network of insurance providers is essential to carrying on gwc business as an insurance broker for construction clients.gwc would not be able to engage in or carry on its business of providing insurance brokerage services without the relationships that it had with both its construction clients and the insurance providers.as such,gwc business relationships were two fold on the one hand providing the broker services to its construction clients,and on the other hand engaging in business with the insurance provider companies that it worked with to provide the actual policies to the gwc clients.
the supplemental declaration also said,insurance companies normally will only work with one broker or brokerage firm.in other words,the insurance company will reserve the market for its existing broker to send in an application to the client company,and will only provide premium quotes for this first applying broker or brokerage firm.on its face,this statement supports a conclusion that the goodwill which defendant sold to plaintiffs included the goodwill of the insurance companies which supplied policies for gwc clients.indeed,the covenants themselves stated that gwc relationships with its independent producers were significant business relationships necessary for gwc operation.
this latter statement in the supplemental declaration was made in connection with the issue of trade secrets pertinent to the nonsolicitation covenant,that knowledge of policy renewal dates gave an advantage in securing favorable quotes from insurance companies.nevertheless,it provides evidence supporting the trial court determination to issue the preliminary injunction regarding both covenants.
thus,the supplemental declaration indicated there were two components to gwc business selling insurance to construction clients,and procuring insurance from insurance companies.procuring insurance from insurance companies is analogous to the production referred to in monogram,supra,d at page.territorial limits are coextensive with the entire area in which the parties conducted all phases of their business including production,promotional and marketing activities as well as sales.gwc business was a business in which personal relationships were important in both aspects of the insurance products and procuring those products.the supplemental declaration provided evidence that the goodwill generated by gwc with insurance companies gave gwc a competitive advantage in servicing its construction clients.the covenants executed by defendant recognized the significance of gwc relationships with its independent producers,as necessary for gwc operation.thus,this case is not similar to defendant hypothetical of a local toy store that happens to get some of its toys from china.
the trial court also had before it evidence ward declaration that gwc procured the products from insurance companies located throughout the counties of california.defendant appellate brief admits it is probably true that gwc obtained policies from insurance companies throughout the united states.
our task is to ensure that the trial court factual determinations,whether express or implied,are supported by substantial evidence.citation.thus,we interpret the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and indulge in all reasonable inferences in support of the trial court order.citations.shoemaker,supra,th at,d.
ward supplemental declaration provides substantial evidence that gwc carried on its business in all counties of the state of california within the meaning of section.accordingly,we conclude defendant fails to show the noncompetition covenant is an illegal restraint on trade.we need not address plaintiffs argument that the fact gwc was licensed to transact business in other states,such as hawaii and nevada,supported the conclusion that gwc carried on business throughout the entire state of california.
nonsolicitation covenant 
as to the nonsolicitation covenant,defendant argues it is illegal because it prohibits defendant from soliciting not only clients of the business defendant sold gwc but also alliant other customers.we shall conclude defendant argument is without merit.
defendant relies entirely on a rule relating to a nonsolicitation covenant in connection with the sale of a business,the covenant is permissible if it prohibits the seller from soliciting the seller clients but is not permissible if it prohibits the seller from soliciting the buyer clients.strategix,supra,th,d.there are two reasons for this rule.first,the rationale for enforcing nonsolicitation,they prevent the seller from depriving the buyer of the full value of its acquisition,including the sold company not extend to the buyer other customers.id.at,d.second,the seller presumably knows who its own clients are but does not necessarily know who the buyer other clients are.id.at,d.
here,however,defendant not only sold his business to plaintiffs,he then became an employee of plaintiffs.the nonsolicitation covenant in both the stock purchase agreement and the senior management agreement limited the scope of the nonsolicitation covenant,stating defendant seller would not solicit the clients of gwc or any other alliant company provided in the latter case any other alliant company,that such seller had substantial contact or became familiar with such client or active prospective client during his employment with the company thus,the covenant prohibiting solicitation of alliant other customers related only to defendant employment by alliant,not his sale of gwc.
a covenant for an employee not to solicit the employer clients upon termination of the employment may be valid if necessary to protect the employer trade secrets.thompson impaxx,th,d.plaintiffs asserted in the trial court that their confidential client information constituted trade secrets,and the trial court expressly found defendant used plaintiffs trade secrets.defendant failed to challenge this point in his opening brief on appeal,and we decline to consider the argument he makes for the first time in his reply brief.neighbours buzz oates enterprises d,fn.
though not mentioned by defendant,we observe the trial court order,while prohibiting defendant from soliciting plaintiffs clients,also states the court determination to issue the preliminary injunction was based on the stock purchase agreement,though the parties indicated the conduct to be enjoined may also violate the senior management agreement.defendant does not argue this point as a basis for reversal.the same nonsolicitation covenant was contained in both contracts and,with respect to solicitation of alliant clients who were not former gwc clients,the covenant was restricted to alliant clients with whom defendant became familiar through his employment at alliant.we thus see no problem.
we conclude defendant fails to show invalidity of the nonsolicitation covenant.
iii.balancing of factors 
defendant argues the trial court abused its discretion in balancing the factors pertinent to issuance of a preliminary of prevailing on the merits versus interim harm.we disagree.
likelihood of prevailing on the merits 
our previous discussion upholding enforceability of the covenants defeats any argument that invalidity of the covenants makes it unlikely that plaintiffs could prevail on the merits.
defendant argues plaintiffs failed to show by competent evidence,as required by code of civil procedure section that defendant was engaging in the insurance business and soliciting alliant customers.we disagree.
as indicated,we disregard plaintiffs evidence to which the trial court sustained defendant evidentiary objections.
however,we can and do consider ward supplemental declaration filed with plaintiffs reply.although defendant argues in a footnote that it was inappropriate for plaintiffs to present new facts in their reply papers,his cited authority merely states the general rule that a reviewing court will not consider new issues presented in a reply brief on appeal.reichardt hoffman th,d.even if we were to consider plaintiff forfeiture argument,inadequately raised in a footnote placer ranch partners county of placer th,fn,d,the trial court had discretion whether to accept new evidence with the reply papers.plenger alza th,fn,d in summary judgment case,trial court had discretion to consider new evidence in reply papers as long as other party had opportunity to respond.here,in light of the supplemental declaration,the trial court allowed defendant the opportunity to testify at the hearing on the preliminary injunction,and he did.
ward supplemental declaration stated in part that de
