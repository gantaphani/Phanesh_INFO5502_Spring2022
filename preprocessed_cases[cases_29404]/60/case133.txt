a real estate limited partnership merges into a new entity,becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the new entity.the interests of the limited partners are liquidated or cashed out,while the general partner retains an equity interest in the postmerger entity,which then sells the assets of the limited partnership to third parties for more than the assets were valued for purposes of the and merger.under those circumstances,we hold that a limited partner claim against the general partner that the merger transaction harms the limited partner by undervaluing its partnership interest or by depriving it of the future earnings and growth generated by the assets of the limited partnership is individual in nature.the claim is not derivative because it is not based on any injury to the limited partnership or its assets,both of which survive the merger transaction intact.
accordingly,we reverse the summary judgment in favor of defendants because the trial court erroneously determined that the claims asserted by plaintiffs limited partners are not individual but derivative in nature,and because triable issues of fact exist with respect to the defense of the business judgment rule.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs referred to as everest are five california limited liability companies which held limited partnership interests in public real estate limited partnerships referred to as the mcneil partnerships the mcneil partnerships were all controlled by a general partner,defendant mcneil partners,and defendants related entities referred to as general partner or mcneil together the mcneil partnerships owned about real estate holdings,including commercial property,apartment buildings,units and properties.the general partner owned a small percentage of the equity interests in the mcneil partnerships the limited partners together owned a percent interest in mcneil real estate funds ix,x,xi,and xii the limited partners together owned a percent interest in mcneil real estate funds xiv,xv,xx,xxi,xxii,xxiii,xxiv,xxv,xxvi,and xxvii.
in and the mcneil partnerships were restructured,and the general partner agreed to commence a liquidation of the partnership properties seven years after the restructuring date and to use reasonable efforts to complete the liquidation and termination of the mcneil partnerships by december.in,some of the limited partners of some of the mcneil partnerships filed a class action lawsuit against robert mcneil and the general partner alleging that they breached their fiduciary duties to the limited partners in various ways,including rendering the limited partner units highly illiquid,artificially depressing the prices available for limited partner units in private sales,by charging excessive management fees and by not selling the real estate holdings and distributing the proceeds to the limited partners.
in september,the parties to the class action lawsuit referred to as the schofield action entered into a stipulation of settlement of all derivative and class claims pursuant to which the general partner would provide the limited partners with over million in cash distributions and would purportedly implement a fair and impartial bidding process,overseen by painewebber,designed to obtain the maximum value in connection with the sale,as part of one transaction,of the mcneil partnerships and the management assets owned by certain defendants,mcremi.
before the execution of the stipulation of settlement,the general partner had solicited bids and was then pursuing negotiations with the three highest bidders in order to finalize a transaction with the highest value.the stipulation of settlement set out the procedures for the sale of the mcneil partnerships and the allocation of the net proceeds from such sale to the limited partners.the procedures set out in the stipulation of settlement included the following requirements that the plans for allocation of net proceeds be based upon arm length negotiations between the general partner and the limited partners,each side receiving advice and counsel from its own independent investment adviser that the limited partners retain an independent adviser to perform analyses of the partnership properties and management assets and that an independent investment adviser issue a fairness opinion that the proposed allocations are fair to the limited partners and the mcneil partnerships from a financial point of view.the proposed plans for allocation of the proceeds of the sale were to be submitted to a vote of the limited partners of each mcneil partnership.
in october,the court in the schofield action entered an order preliminarily approving the proposed settlement and providing that within a certain time period any member of the settlement class could request exclusion from the class claims asserted in the action,but that class members can not opt out of that portion of the settlement which settles the derivative claims asserted in the action.it is undisputed that everest opted out of the class claims asserted in the schofield action.
in march,whitehall street real estate whitehall sent to mcneil an outline of a proposed transaction,offering to discuss an all cash purchase of the commercial properties by whitehall directly.but mcneil refused to consider it,responding that a n asset deal does not work for us and that mcneil wanted to share the proceeds of sales as partners.
whitehall then made a total bid for the mcneil partnerships and mcremi in the total amount of,which painewebber deemed to be the highest bid.the general partner negotiated with whitehall on the possibility of the mcneil affiliates receiving an equity interest in the special purpose acquisition entity,namely the entity created to receive the assets of the mcneil partnerships.the whitehall transaction ultimately resulted in a merger of the mcneil partnerships with whitehall,pursuant to which the interests of everest and all other limited partners in the mcneil partnerships were liquidated.mcneil received an equity interest in the postmerger entity of about percent,an increase from the percent interest which mcneil had owned in the mcneil partnerships.according to the proxy statement prepared in connection with the merger,as a result of the transaction,each participating mcneil partnership will become a direct indirect wholly owned subsidiary of realty the entity acquiring the mcneil partnerships 
in may,the general partner set up an independent special committee,comprised of a single individual,paul fay,an independent director on the general partner board of directors,to negotiate the final terms and conditions of the transaction with whitehall.because the general partner and other mcneil affiliates would be acquiring an equity interest in the new entity created by the proposed transaction,the general partner board of directors determined that an independent special committee was necessary in light of the actual or potential conflicts of interest created by the acquisition by mcneil of equity in realty as a result of the proposed transaction and that the special committee was to evaluate the transaction on behalf of the limited partners of the mcneil partnerships.
eastdil realty company was retained as the special committee financial adviser.the mcneil partnerships had previously,in january,retained the investment banking firm robert stanger stanger to render opinions as to the fairness of the consideration to be received by each of the mcneil partnerships pursuant to a sale transaction.mcneil hired its own investment adviser,houlihan lokey howard zukin capital houlihan,to negotiate the terms of the merger and the final formula for allocation of the proceeds of the transaction.the plaintiffs in the schofield action,on behalf of the limited partners,retained the investment banking firm cfc capital to review the analyses performed by stanger and houlihan and to advise lawrence kolker,counsel for the schofield action plaintiffs,during the negotiation process.after several days of negotiations characterized by kolker as and difficult,the parties reached an agreement as to the material terms of the merger transaction.according to kolker,virtually every valuation and allocation dispute was resolved in favor of the schofield class of limited partners.
under stanger analysis of the whitehall transaction,the mcneil partnerships real estate assets had an aggregate value of approximately million,and the value of mcremi was million.of the total consideration of million generated by the transaction,the amount allocated to the limited partners interests was million.stanger provided opinions that the following aspects of the merger transaction were fair and reasonable to the limited partners the aggregate consideration to be paid for mcremi,the limited partner interests and the general partner interests the allocation of the aggregate consideration between mcremi and the partnerships the per partnership allocated value and the methodology of the allocation.the independent special committee namely paul fay also concluded that stanger opinions were fair and reasonable and recommended the transaction to the limited partners.
on behalf of the plaintiffs in the schofield action,cfc capital agreed that the stanger valuations and allocations were well within a range of reasonableness and that the valuation of mcremi reflected a conservative valuation to the benefit of the limited partners.kolker also agreed that the terms of the merger transaction were resolved in a manner which is highly favorable to the limited partners and recommended that the court approve the settlement.
everest objected to the settlement.nevertheless,the court in the schofield action granted final approval of the settlement in july and entered a final order and judgment authorizing the parties to consummate the settlement according to the terms of the stipulation of settlement and dismissing the action with prejudice.the final order and judgment also provided that there is no right to exclusion from the settlement with respect to the derivative claims asserted in the action and that each unitholder who owned units during the settlement class period,shall be bound by this judgment and settlement of the derivative claims in the action regardless of whether or not any such persons timely and validly requested exclusion from the settlement class.
a july supplemental stipulation of settlement and order provided in pertinent part nothing contained herein shall act as a release of unknown,future claims whether derivative or individual for acts of the general partner occurring after the date upon which the final order and judgment is signed by the court on july.
in january,the merger transaction with whitehall was consummated after the proposed transaction was submitted to the limited partners for approval.in december,the limited partners had received a detailed proxy statement,including a description of the proposed terms of the settlement,the plan of allocation,and the fairness opinions prepared by stanger.according to mcneil,the limited partners voted to approve the merger transaction by a vote of percent,but the evidence offered by mcneil shows only that the limited partners of mcneil real estate fund xxvii approved the transaction.but everest maintained that each mcneil partnership voted separately and some rejected the merger.
brandon flaming,a of mcremi,stated that the merger transaction resulted in everest recouping more than a percent return on its investment in the mcneil partnerships.everest,however,asserted that the limited partners should have recouped a greater return on their investment.everest discovered that whitehall had projected before the consummation of the merger that it would be able to flip or resell the properties acquired in the transaction for more than the values they had been allocated in the settlement,and whitehall admitted that it sold some of the acquired properties within a year of the merger for more money than it had paid for them.whitehall itself had valued the assets of the mcneil partnerships at over million,assigning a value of to mcremi.
in january,everest filed the instant action for breach of fiduciary duty,unfair competition,and constructive fraud.everest alleged that defendants breached their fiduciary duties by engaging in wrongful actions which benefited themselves at the expense of the limited partners,causing everest return on its investments in the mcneil partnerships to be to percent lower,representing a loss to everest of about million.later,everest recalculated its damages as exceeding million.the wrongful actions of defendants,as alleged in the complaint,or asserted by everest in interrogatories and in opposition to the summary judgment motion,include structuring the transaction as a merger of the entire group of mcneil partnerships rather than conducting sales of each partnership real estate holdings,resulting in a distribution to the limited partners of an amount less than the fair market value of an individual partnership allocating a portion of the settlement price million to the management company controlled by robert mcneil mcremi,notwithstanding that mcremi possessed only contracts that could be canceled on notice and otherwise had no meaningful assets and no function other than to manage the real estate holdings for the mcneil partnerships including in the transaction oppressive fees of million that were designed to deter competing offers from third parties or rejection of the deal by the limited partners requiring that the limited partners pay nearly million in success fees to corporate insiders employed by mcremi structuring the transaction so that mcneil acquired an ownership interest in the postmerger entity,effectively constituting a sale of the mcneil partnership assets to itself,giving it more incentive to value the assets for purposes of the merger at a lowball price,and allowing it to profit from the sale of the assets to third parties at higher prices,which it did,thus obtaining a benefit from the transaction which the limited partners could not share.
everest claimed that had the transaction been conducted properly,the total distribution to the limited partners and the general partner would have been increased by million comprised of million improperly allocated as the value of mcremi,million in higher purchase prices,and million in improperly allocated success fees,with the limited partners receiving percent of that increase,or about million.everest share of the increased distribution to the limited partners,or percent,would have been approximately million.
mcneil moved for summary judgment on two grounds that everest claims are derivative in nature and therefore barred because they were released pursuant to the judgment in the schofield action and because everest lacks standing to pursue the derivative claims and that everest claims are barred by application of the business judgment rule,by which the courts defer to the business decisions of managers whose actions are the product of negotiation,analysis,and approval of a disinterested special committee.
everest opposed the motion,arguing as follows its action was individual or direct,and california law allows a limited partner to proceed directly against a general partner who breaches its fiduciary duty by misallocating proceeds among itself and the limited partners.in this situation,the action is direct and not derivative because the limited partners are harmed,but the general partner is not harmed,and the partnership as a whole is not harmed because its assets remain intact.the merger constituted a breach of fiduciary duty because it did not maximize the return to the limited partners in each individual mcneil partnership,which would have occurred if the real estate holdings had been sold or liquidated on an individual basis.because of the aspect of the merger transaction,whitehall had very little competition the deal was structured to eliminate buyers who could not finance an entire portfolio,and to eliminate buyers who want only a single property or property type,apartments,and thereby drive away competition for the properties the result a substantially lower total price for the partnerships properties take,for example,the properties.in the whitehall transaction,million in value was attributed to the properties in the portfolio owned by mcneil real estate funds xxvii.nonetheless,whitehall sold all of these properties to a single buyer for million within weeks after the transaction closed,resulting in an immediate profit.
with respect to the business judgment rule,everest contended that triable issues of material fact exist as to the applicability of the rule because of mcneil conflicts of interest arising out of its increased equity ownership in the postmerger entity,facts which were admitted in the proxy statement sent to the limited partners in december.
mcneil filed a reply,and after a hearing on the motion,the court granted summary judgment.the court february,minute order provided in pertinent part that the motion was granted as to all defendants on the ground that the claims are derivative in nature and are therefore barred by the court judgment in the schofield action.plaintiffs interrogatory responses make clear that the types of wrongdoing alleged do not relate to a special duty owed to plaintiffs or have their origin in circumstances independent of plaintiffs status as unitholders.nelson anderson th,d.rather,the types of wrongdoing alleged are incidental to an injury to the entire partnership.citations.plaintiffs attempt to distinguish the case law relied upon by defendants on the ground that the cases do not involve partnerships however,persuasive federal authority attached to defendants reply indicates that there is no basis for a special rule governing limited partners claims against general partners.mieuli debartolo.may,no.jcs wl at pp.
everest filed a timely notice of appeal from the april,judgment the principal issues presented are whether everest claims are barred on the ground that they are derivative in nature and seek recovery for injuries to the partnership entities,or whether the claims are actionable on the ground that they are individual or direct in nature and seek recovery for injuries sustained by everest and even if the claims are individual,whether they are nevertheless barred under the business judgment rule.
the notice of appeal states that everest also appeals from a january,order denying everest motion to set the discovery cutoff and deadline for expert witness disclosure.in the event that the summary judgment is reversed,everest seeks to vacate a prior order cutting off discovery and precluding expert witness disclosure based on a previous march,trial date.everest requests that on remand discovery should be reopened.
on this appeal,the parties do not dispute that any derivative claims sought to be asserted by everest in this action are barred and that everest can assert only claims that are properly classified as individual.thus,the parties disagreement concerns whether the nature of the claims asserted by everest are derivative or individual.
discussion 
standard of review 
a defendant motion for summary judgment should be granted if no triable issue exists as to any material fact and the defendant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.the burden of persuasion remains with the party moving for summary judgment.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,kahn east side union high school dist.cal th.we review the record and the determination of the trial court de novo.id.at,d.
the general rule on summary judgment is that the evidence and the inferences reasonably to be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the opposing party.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.and,when a motion for summary judgment includes a test as to whether the complaint states a viable claim,the court will apply the rule applicable to demurrers and accept the allegations of the complaint as true,and we will also consider those matters subject to judicial notice.american airlines,county of san mateo cal th,d.
accordingly,considering everest allegations and accepting the facts offered by everest and the reasonable inferences therefrom,our first task is to determine whether everest claims against mcneil are derivative or individual.in this case,that distinction involves a consideration of the nature of partnerships and the fiduciary obligations of general partners.
nature of partnerships and fiduciary obligations of general partners 
a partnership is an entity separate and apart from the partners of which it is comprised,and it is the partnership entity which owns its assets,not the partners.evans galardi cal d,limited partner has no property interest in specific partnership assets.california law treats a partnership as a hybrid organization that is viewed as an aggregation of individuals for some purposes,and as an entity for others.epstein frank d.one of the primary areas in which a partnership is viewed as an entity is with respect to ownership of property.california corporations code section specifically provides that a partnership may hold title to real property bartlome state farm fire casualty d.
partnership is a fiduciary relationship,and partners are held to the standards and duties of a trustee in their dealings with each other.equitable life assurance society th,d.in proceedings connected with the conduct of a partnership,partners are bound to act in the highest good faith to their copartners and may not obtain any advantage over them in the partnership affairs by the slightest misrepresentation,concealment,threat or adverse pressure of any kind.id.at,d.a general partner of a limited partnership is subject to the same restrictions,and has the same liabilities to the partnership and to the other partners as in a general partnership.id.at,d.the fiduciary obligations of a general partner with respect to matters fundamentally related to the partnership business can not be waived or contracted away in the partnership agreement.id.at,d fiduciary duty not to purchase partnership debt and foreclose on one partner can not be contracted away in the partnership agreement.
there is an obvious and essential unfairness in one partner attempted exploitation of a partnership opportunity for his own personal benefit and to the resulting detriment of his copartners.leff gunter cal d.thus,a partner who seeks a business advantage over another partner bears the burden of showing complete good faith and fairness to the other.laux freed cal d,see also smith,d.smith fiduciary has burden of justifying conduct.a partner fiduciary duty extends to the dissolution and liquidation of partnership affairs,as well as to the sale by one partner to another of an interest in the partnership.laux freed,supra,cal d at.a partner may not dissolve a partnership to gain the benefits of the business for himself,unless he fully compensates his copartner for his share of the prospective business opportunity.leff gunter,supra,cal d at.such a partnership opportunity may not be appropriated by one partner to the detriment of a copartner even after dissolution.ibid.
in the corporate context,it has also been held that directors breach their fiduciary duty to minority stockholders by using their control of the company to obtain an advantage not available to all stockholders to the detriment of the minority stockholders and without a compelling business purpose for the directors conduct.fisher pennsylvania life d.majority shareholders may not use their power to control corporate activities to benefit themselves alone or in a manner detrimental to the minority.any use to which they put the corporation or their power to control the corporation must benefit all shareholders proportionately and must not conflict with the proper conduct of the corporation business.jones ahmanson cal d,jones.in whatever form it occurs should be handled with rough hands for what it is dishonest dealing.and while it is often difficult to discover in mergers,consolidations,sale of all the assets or dissolution and liquidation,the difficulty makes it even more imperative that the search be thorough and relentless.id.at.
derivative versus individual actions 
an action is derivative,that is,in the corporate right,if the gravamen of the complaint is injury to the corporation,or to the whole body of its stock and property without any severance or distribution among individual holders,or it seeks to recover assets for the corporation or to prevent the dissipation of its assets.jones,supra,cal d at.
the purpose of a limited partner derivative action is to enforce a claim which the limited partnership possesses against others including the general partners but which the partnership refuses to enforce.citations.like a shareholder derivative action,a limited partner derivative suit is filed in the name of a limited partner,and the partnership is named as a defendant.although a limited partner is named as the plaintiff,it is the limited partnership which derives the benefits of the action.wallner parry professional,th,d under the california uniform limited partnership act,a limited partner may file a derivative action against general partners for and breach of fiduciary duties by leasing partnership property to themselves without paying rent to partnership.
thus,where the wrongful acts of a majority shareholder amounted to misfeasance or negligence in managing the corporation business,causing the business to lose earnings,profits,and opportunities,and causing the stock to be valueless,the court held that the claim was derivative and not individual because the resulting injury was to the corporation and the whole body of its stockholders.nelson anderson th,d nelson.in a case involving the fraudulent transfer of the assets of a limited liability company,without the payment of compensation to the company,a derivative,but not an individual,action was held to lie because the gravamen of the alleged wrongs was an injury to the company.paclink communications,superior court th,d paclink diminution in the value of the members percent ownership interest was incidental to injury to company,which was improperly deprived of its assets.
similarly,the allegations by shareholders of a bank that the bank directors breached their duties of care and loyalty by mismanaging operations and improperly placing the bank into voluntary receivership described an injury to the bank and not to the individual shareholders.pareto fdic cir,pareto depreciation of stock value was an indirect result of injury to the bank and an injury that fell on every stockholder alike,whether majority or minority.
in mieuli debartolo,supra,wl mieuli,the court,applying california law,held that cases applying the derivative versus individual distinction in the corporate context also applied in the context of a limited partnership and that the limited partner had not asserted an individual claim.the limited partner alleged that the general partner breached his fiduciary duty by converting partnership funds and engaging in other acts of mismanagement and which damaged the limited partner by depriving him of partnership distributions and reducing the value of his interest in the partnership.mieuli,supra,at.interpreting plaintiff allegations of mismanagement and as tantamount to the assertion that,as a limited partner,he was injured only indirectly through an injury to the partnership,the court concluded that such claims must be brought derivatively.id.at.
on the other hand,california cases recognize that a stockholder individual suit is a suit to enforce a right against the corporation which the stockholder possesses as an individual.jones,supra,cal d at.jones,a seminal case,involved a complaint by a minority shareholder for breach of fiduciary duties by majority stockholders in a savings and loan association.the majority shareholders allegedly took advantage of a bull market to render their own stock more valuable and the minority shareholders stock less valuable by creating a holding company,transferring their control block of shares to the holding company,receiving a majority of the holding company shares,excluding the minority shareholders from participation in the holding company,and pledging the association assets and earnings to secure the holding company debt that had been incurred for the majority shareholders own benefit.after the above actions had rendered the association stock unmarketable except to the holding company,the majority shareholders refused to either purchase the minority shareholder stock at a fair price or exchange the stock for that of the holding company on the same basis afforded to the majority.id.at.
the court in jones concluded that the minority shareholder had asserted an individual or nonderivative action,reasoning that the plaintiff does not seek to recover on behalf of the corporation for injury done to the corporation by defendants.although she does allege that the value of her stock has been diminished by defendants actions,she does not contend that the diminished value reflects an injury to the corporation and resultant depreciation in the value of the stock.thus the gravamen of her cause of action is injury to herself and the other minority stockholders.the individual wrong necessary to support a suit by a shareholder need not be unique to that plaintiff.the same injury may affect a substantial number of shareholders.if the injury is not incidental to an injury to the corporation,an individual cause of action exists.jones,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted see also crain electronic memories magnetics d.crain individual action stated by minority shareholders where majority shareholders engaged in activities which rendered worthless only the stock of the minority shareholders.
jones expressly disapproved of the articulation of the test in shaw empire savings loan d.shaw,which required that a minority shareholder demonstrate that the injury to him was different from that suffered by other minority shareholders.jones,supra,cal d at.the jones court stated that a nalysis of the nature and purpose of a shareholder derivative suit will demonstrate that the test,adopted in the shaw case does not properly distinguish the cases in which an individual cause of action lies.jones,supra,cal d at.
shaw also stated in a one sentence dictum that a stockholder may maintain an individual action where it appears that the injury resulted from the violation of some special duty owed the stockholder by the wrongdoer and having its origin in circumstances independent of the plaintiff status as a stockholder,citing only annotation as its authority.shaw,supra,d at,italics omitted.although the court in jones did not specifically discuss the special duty language in shaw,the test for an individual action as articulated in jones does not require that the wrongdoer owe the plaintiff a special duty independent of the stockholder relationship.we decline to follow shaw dictum because it is inconsistent with jones.we note that other appellate courts as well as mcneil herein have continued to cite shaw special duty language.see,rankin frebank d.nelson,supra,th at,d citing rankin.
nor in an individual action must a plaintiff sue on behalf of all minority shareholders or limited partners,or must all minority shareholders or limited partners assert the same claim.in low wheeler d,a case which predates jones,the court affirmed a judgment in favor of the plaintiff minority shareholder where the other minority shareholders had signed releases to the defendants as part of the sale of their stock.the court stated that the defendants can not be heard to complain that the other two minority shareholders were not parties,for if they had been successful parties,the judgment would have been larger.low wheeler,supra,d at.see also nelson,supra,th at,d.
following the test in jones,the court in smith,supra,d,held that a minority shareholder in a subsidiary asserted an individual cause of action for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty against directors of the subsidiary and the parent corporation,when the defendants allegedly had manipulated a consolidated tax procedure to afford increased tax benefits to the corporations,which resulted in a decreased distributive share to the plaintiff upon a sale of the assets of the subsidiary.the court concluded that h ere,it is clear that smith does not seek to recover on behalf of crystal brite the subsidiary.he does not contend that the diminishment in his share of the assets reflects an injury to crystal brite and a res
