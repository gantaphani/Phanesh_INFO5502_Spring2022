the case before the court arises out of the global settlement of a number of class action cases related to the merger of nationsbank and bankamerica into bank of america.plaintiff michael koehler was a lead plaintiff and class representative in those cases.he brought this action against the attorneys who had represented his class and against several attorneys who represented two of the other lead plaintiffs.he alleges that the attorneys breached their fiduciary duties,violated the private securities litigation reform act of,and engaged in civil conspiracy by settling the class actions without his approval and by misleading the court into approving the settlement.the district court granted defendants motions to dismiss his complaint,and he appeals from the judgment in.in koehler appeals from a post judgment order of the district court relating to document recovery.we affirm the judgment but dismiss the other appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
after nationsbank and bankamerica merged in,numerous state and federal actions were commenced.plaintiffs alleged that the merger had been effected through fraud and that misrepresentations had been made to shareholders.the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation consolidated the actions in the eastern district of missouri before judge john nangle.he appointed seven lead plaintiffs to represent one of the classes who had owned nationsbank stock.koehler was one of the lead plaintiffs,and the other six were earl gates,joseph hempen,robert hepworth,kevin kloster,david oetting,and pamela wootton.koehler also served as a class representative,along with kloster and oetting.
according to koehler complaint,the court appointed the law firm of green,schaaf jacobson,as lead counsel and liaison for the nationsbank classes,and the firms of chitwood harley and stull,stull brody were made counsel.the complaint alleges further that clooney anderson also represented the nationsbank classes and that attorneys entwistle and cappucci were named to the executive committee 
after three years of discovery,the parties entered into voluntary mediation in january in new york under the direction of a former federal district judge,the honorable nicholas politan.koehler and some of the other lead plaintiffs were present at the negotiations,but they left after two days.the mediation continued on the following day,and counsel representing all the parties reached an agreement.they executed a memorandum of understanding that the cases would settle for a cash payment by the defendants of million,and that million of that amount would be allocated to the two nationsbank classes.
in february,march,and may,judge nangle held a series of hearings to determine the fairness of the proposed settlement.koehler retained separate counsel to contest the settlement and filed objections to it.he and two others from his group of lead plaintiffs,david oetting and kevin kloster,complained to the district court that the settlement amount was too low and that it was disproportionately distributed among the shareholder classes.they also challenged the settlement on the ground that the lead plaintiffs had not been present the final day of mediation because they had been led to believe that the mediation was over and that the case would only settle for an amount exceeding million,payable in stock.koehler alleged that his attorneys had misled him and made false representations to the court and that this conduct violated the private securities litigation reform act of,the act,and other ethical duties.in support he submitted the declaration of professor geoffrey hazard,a well recognized expert in the field of legal ethics,discussing possible ethical breaches related to the settlement.
notice of the settlement terms was given to the hundreds of thousands of class members.the notice informed the class members that they should make the district court aware of any objections.only ten objections were submitted none was received from any of the institutional investors.the court explained that it was required to consider the merits of plaintiffs case,the defendant financial condition,the complexity involved in further litigation,and the amount of opposition to the settlement.in re bankamerica.sec,see van horn trickey,cir.it considered the objections and the arguments at several hearings and finally approved the settlement as fair,adequate,and reasonable based on the court experienced assessment.in re bankamerica.sec,at.
the district court observed that plaintiffs had faced many hurdles in the litigation and that a jury could have returned a defense verdict given the formidable risks of trial.in re bankamerica.sec,at.the court concluded that class counsel had reached a substantial settlement and fulfilled their obligations,that class representatives do not have the unfettered ability to decide whether to settle and,if so,for how much,and that class settlement agreements do not require the assent of named plaintiffs.id.at.it issued its final approval of the settlement on september.
following approval of the settlement,the court held hearings to determine the appropriate fee award for the attorneys.lead counsel requested of the total award,and koehler did not object.the court explained that even a small percentage of the class recoveries in this case is a very significant award of money,and awarded lead counsel of the net recovery on october.the court noted that the class members response to the settlement has been overwhelmingly favorable,that the experienced attorneys had obtained a significant recovery for their clients,and that class counsel had performed at exceptionally high levels.
despite continued allegations about ethical breaches and misrepresentations by counsel,koehler did not challenge the fee award on appeal,but he and oetting did appeal the order approving the settlement.at the oral argument on appeal koehler and oetting conceded they were not contesting the district court fairness and adequacy findings about the settlement,but were instead challenging whether the court had had the authority to approve the settlement over their objections.in re bankamerica.sec,cir.
we affirmed the judgment approving the settlement.we noted the district court findings that koehler and oetting had had unrealistic expectations about the litigation that were bordering on fantasy and that the global settlement amount far exceeded what had been previously offered to the separate classes.id.at.we also took note of the fact that lead plaintiffs robert hepworth and kevin kloster had ultimately approved the settlement.id.at.we observed that one of the concerns congress had in passing the act was to protect the interests of class members in securities cases,that the statute did not explicitly grant a veto power to lead plaintiffs,id.at,and that the district court found that the bankamerica litigation and settlement had not been.id.at.we concluded that the district court,which was intimately familiar with this lengthy and complex matter,had not abused its discretion by approving the settlement over the objections of koehler and oetting.
more than two full years after judgment was entered in the class actions,koehler filed this case in december in the southern district of new york against counsel who had represented his class,as well as the law firm of clooney anderson and attorneys entwistle and cappucci,complaining that the settlement was too low and should have been paid in stock.in addition to allegations identical to objections he had already raised before the class action settlement was approved,koehler alleges newly discovered facts to support his claims.these include allegations that class counsel engaged in secret negotiations in september,that hepworth and his counsel were intentionally excluded from the december mediation,and that hepworth attorneys had prepared a detailed valuation memorandum and had lied to the district court about their client presence at the mediation,that kloster was pressured by his attorney to approve the settlement amount,that defendant attorneys made numerous misrepresentations during the fairness hearings about the views of the lead plaintiffs and their role in the mediation,and that they falsely stated that the lead plaintiffs had approved the settlement or had only recently withdrawn their support.koehler also complains that the district court declined to determine in the fairness hearings whether counsel had violated ethical rules.
in his complaint koehler seeks damages for breaches of fiduciary duties,aiding and abetting such breaches,conspiracy to breach fiduciary duties,and violations of the act,alleging that the cases should not have settled for less than million paid in stock.he requests compensatory damages in an amount to be proved at trial,but believed to be in excess of,over in punitive damages,disgorgement of attorney fees,declaratory relief,and all other relief that would be fair and just.
the case was transferred by the district judge in new york to the eastern district of missouri where it was assigned to judge nangle who had presided over the consolidated class action cases.koehler moved to transfer the case back to his chosen venue,but the motion was denied.defendants then moved to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b.they argued among other things that koehler complaint was barred by collateral estoppel and that the act did not create a private cause of action for the conduct alleged.
the district court granted the motions to dismiss.it concluded that he could not prevail in this action because our court has determined that a lead plaintiff does not have the unilateral right to disapprove a settlement and the district court did not abuse its discretion in approving it.the district court referenced its long experience with the underlying cases which led it to conclude that the class action plaintiffs had been more than adequately compensated,that the plaintiffs in the class actions had faced tremendous hurdles,that the obvious fairness of this settlement had been approved after all persons had had full opportunity to comment,and that the court had been well aware of koehler disapproval,objections,and allegations of ethical misconduct before it ruled and before judgment was entered in the class actions.the court also referenced its findings in the settlement approval order that lead counsel for the class had conducted themselves professionally and have adequately and zealously represented the interests of their clients.
after the district court dismissed this action,it issued an order in response to a request for guidance and direction submitted by defendant green,schaaf jacobson,lead counsel and liaison for the nationsbank classes in the bankamerica cases.while the motions to dismiss had been pending in the district court and a discovery stay was in place,green had received a letter from david oetting,one of the former lead plaintiffs,requesting that his file in the class action cases be released to his current attorneys,martha cullina,llp.in its letter to the court green expressed its concern that oetting request was an attempt to circumvent the discovery stay and its uncertainty about which of the voluminous files from the class actions should be released.
the district court did not address the request until after the motions to dismiss were decided and judgment had been entered.at that time the district court issued an order characterizing green letter as a motion alluding to improper discovery and denied it as moot since the case had been dismissed.the court nevertheless added that it was willing to give limited guidance about oetting request and advised green to release all papers,documents,and materials oetting had forwarded to lead counsel during the class action litigation.
koehler appeals,arguing that the district court erred by dismissing his complaint and by not ordering green to provide oetting with all the class action files lead counsel had.he argues that the question of whether appellees violated their fiduciary duties or the act in settling the bankamerica cases was not decided by the district court when it approved the settlement and that it should have returned this case to the southern district of new york.he also claims that he learned facts after the settlement approval which are relevant to whether he is entitled to relief.
appellees respond that koehler claims are barred by the final judgment approving the settlement,that he has not shown that his case should have been sent back to new york,and that both the district court and this court were aware of the nature of koehler objections at the time the settlement was approved.they argue that any issue about oetting files is now moot.clooney anderson,cappucci,and entwistle assert that they are entitled to summary judgment on another they were not attorneys for the class and owed no fiduciary duties to koehler.
we review the district court rule b dismissal de novo,taking all facts alleged in the complaint as true.carter arkansas,cir.a motion to dismiss should be granted if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts which would entitle him to relief.knapp hanson,cir citation omitted.
in addition to his fiduciary duty claims koehler alleges that he has a cause of action under the provisions of the act,citing to dicta in one of our decisions in the bankamerica proceedings which stated that w e think it plain that the lead plaintiff provisions of the act create significant federal rights that previously did not exist.in re bankamerica.sec,cir.the court opinion did not identify any such right,however,and koehler has not pointed to any section of the act which provides for the cause of action he attempts to bring here.we conclude that koehler has failed to demonstrate that the act created a private right of action for the claims he alleges.
for koehler to prevail on his fiduciary duty claims,he must show among other things that he had a fiduciary relationship with appellees,that they breached a duty of that relationship,and that the breach was the proximate cause of damage to him.see klemme best,even if koehler had an attorney client relationship with all of the appellees,which some of them deny,koehler would still have to show that appellees breached their fiduciary duties and that such conduct was the proximate cause of damage to him.see,fletcher conoco pipe line,cir applying missouri law and affirming summary judgment because plaintiffs failed to present competent proof of causation faulkner ensz,cir under missouri law,a successful attorney malpractice claim requires a causal connection between the attorney negligence and the plaintiff damages klemme,at.
in his briefing koehler describes four categories of damages he seeks the difference between the settlement amount and the recovery which could have been achieved by trial or proper settlement negotiations estimate,recovery for adverse tax consequences from settling for cash instead of stock estimate,for injury caused by the method of allocating the settlement among the classes estimate,and disgorgement of the attorney fees.koehler thus attacks the prior judgment indirectly by this action against the attorneys who represented the nationsbank classes in the settlement negotiations.on the basis of asserted new evidence he seeks to recover in this individual case the amount to which his class was entitled.
koehler can not proceed with his claims if an issue which he needs to prove to obtain judgment in his favor has already been decided in the previous action.see montana united states,d an issue actually and necessarily determined by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive in subsequent suits based on a different cause of action see also liberty mut.ins.fag bearings,cir.in order to prevail on his fiduciary duty claims koehler must prove that the misconduct he alleges was the proximate cause of injury to him.
