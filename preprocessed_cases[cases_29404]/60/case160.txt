ncs healthcare,ncs,a delaware corporation,was the object of competing acquisition bids,one by genesis health ventures,genesis,a pennsylvania corporation,and the other by omnicare,omnicare,a delaware corporation.the proceedings before this court were expedited due to exigent circumstances,including the pendency of the stockholders meeting to consider the merger agreement.the determinations of this court were set forth in a summary manner following oral argument to provide clarity and certainty to the parties going forward.those determinations are explicated in this opinion.
overview of opinion 
the board of directors of ncs,an insolvent publicly traded delaware corporation,agreed to the terms of a merger with genesis.pursuant to that agreement,all of the ncs creditors would be paid in full and the corporation stockholders would exchange their shares for the shares of genesis,a publicly traded pennsylvania corporation.several months after approving the merger agreement,but before the stockholder vote was scheduled,the ncs board of directors withdrew its prior recommendation in favor of the genesis merger.
in fact,the ncs board recommended that the stockholders reject the genesis transaction after deciding that a competing proposal from omnicare was a superior transaction.the competing omnicare bid offered the ncs stockholders an amount of cash equal to more than twice the then current market value of the shares to be received in the genesis merger.the transaction offered by omnicare also treated the ncs corporation other stakeholders on equal terms with the genesis agreement.
the merger agreement between genesis and ncs contained a provision authorized by section c of delaware corporation law.it required that the genesis agreement be placed before the corporation stockholders for a vote,even if the ncs board of directors no longer recommended it at the insistence of genesis,the ncs board also agreed to omit any effective fiduciary clause from the merger agreement.in connection with the genesis merger agreement,two stockholders of ncs,who held a majority of the voting power,agreed unconditionally to vote all of their shares in favor of the genesis merger.thus,the combined terms of the voting agreements and merger agreement guaranteed,ab initio,that the transaction proposed by genesis would obtain ncs stockholder approval.
the court of chancery ruled that the voting agreements,when coupled with the provision in the genesis merger agreement requiring that it be presented to the stockholders for a vote pursuant to.c,constituted defensive measures within the meaning of unocal mesa petroleum after applying the unocal standard of enhanced judicial scrutiny,the court of chancery held that those defensive measures were reasonable.we have concluded that,in the absence of an effective fiduciary out clause,those defensive measures are both preclusive and coercive.therefore,we hold that those defensive measures are invalid and unenforceable.
the parties 
the defendant,ncs,is a delaware corporation headquartered in beachwood,ohio.ncs is a leading independent provider of pharmacy services to care institutions including skilled nursing facilities,assisted living facilities and other institutional healthcare facilities.ncs common stock consists of class a shares and class b shares.the class b shares are entitled to ten votes per share and the class a shares are entitled to one vote per share.the shares are virtually identical in every other respect.
the defendant jon outcalt is chairman of the ncs board of directors.outcalt owns shares of ncs class a common stock and shares of class b common stock.the defendant kevin shaw is president,ceo and a director of ncs.at the time the merger agreement at issue in this dispute was executed with genesis,shaw owned shares of ncs class a common stock and shares of class b common stock.
the ncs board has two other members,defendants boake sells and richard osborne.sells is a graduate of the harvard business school.he was chairman and ceo at revco drugstores in cleveland,ohio from to,when he was replaced by new owners.sells currently sits on the boards of both public and private companies.osborne is a professor at the weatherhead school of management at case western reserve university.he has been at the university for over thirty years.osborne currently sits on at least seven corporate boards other than ncs.
the defendant genesis is a pennsylvania corporation with its principal place of business in kennett square,pennsylvania.it is a leading provider of healthcare and support services to the elderly.the defendant geneva sub,a wholly owned subsidiary of genesis,is a delaware corporation formed by genesis to acquire ncs.
the plaintiffs in the class action own an unspecified number of shares of ncs class a common stock.they represent a class consisting of all holders of class a common stock.as of july,ncs had class a shares and class b shares outstanding.
omnicare is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in covington,kentucky.omnicare is in the institutional pharmacy business,with annual sales in excess of billion during its last fiscal year.omnicare purchased shares of ncs class a common stock on july.
procedural background 
this is a consolidated appeal from orders of the court of chancery in two separate proceedings.one proceeding is brought by omnicare seeking to invalidate a merger agreement between ncs and genesis on fiduciary duty grounds.in that proceeding,omnicare also challenges voting agreements between genesis and jon outcalt and kevin shaw,two major ncs stockholders,who collectively own over of the voting power of ncs stock.the voting agreements irrevocably commit these stockholders to vote for the merger.the omnicare action was in the court of chancery and is,in this court.
the other proceeding is a class action brought by ncs stockholders.that action seeks to invalidate the merger primarily on the ground that the directors of ncs violated their fiduciary duty of care in failing to establish an effective process designed to achieve the transaction that would produce the highest value for the ncs stockholders.the stockholder action was in the court of chancery and is,in this court.
standing decision 
in appeal,the omnicare appeal the court of chancery entered two orders.the first decision and order the standing decision,dated october,dismissed omnicare fiduciary duty claims because it lacked standing to assert those claims.the court of chancery refused to dismiss omnicare declaratory judgment claim,holding that omnicare had standing,notwithstanding the timing of its purchase of ncs stock to assert its claim,as a bona fide bidder for control,that the ncs charter should be interpreted to cause an automatic conversion of outcalt and shaw class b stock with ten votes per share to class a stock with one vote per share.
voting agreements decision 
the second decision and order of the court of chancery that is before this court in the omnicare appeal is the court of chancery order of october,the voting agreements decision adjudicating the merits of the voting agreements.with regard to that issue,the court of chancery held omnicare had standing,as set forth in the preceding paragraph.in the voting agreements decision on summary judgment,the court of chancery interpreted the applicable ncs charter provisions adversely to omnicare contention that the irrevocable proxies granted in those agreements by outcalt and shaw to vote for the genesis merger resulted in an automatic conversion of all of outcalt and shaw class b stock into class a stock.omnicare claim with respect to the voting agreements was,therefore,dismissed by the court of chancery.
fiduciary duty decision 
a class action to enjoin the merger was brought by certain stockholders of ncs in the court of chancery in.the court of chancery denied a preliminary injunction in a decision and order dated november,and revised november,the fiduciary duty decision.that decision is now before this court upon interlocutory review in appeal.the standing of these stockholders to seek injunctive relief based on alleged violations of fiduciary duties by the ncs directors in approving the proposed merger is apparently not challenged by the defendants.accordingly,the fiduciary duty claims,including those claims omnicare sought to assert are being asserted by the class action plaintiffs.
factual background 
the parties are in substantial agreement regarding the operative facts.they disagree,however,about the legal implications.this recitation of facts is taken primarily from the opinion by the court of chancery.
ncs seeks restructuring alternatives 
beginning in late,changes in the timing and level of reimbursements by government and providers adversely affected market conditions in the health care industry.as a result,ncs began to experience greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivables,which led to a precipitous decline in the market value of its stock.ncs common shares that traded above in january were worth as little as at the end of that year.by early,ncs was in default on approximately million in debt,including million in senior bank debt and million of its convertible subordinated debentures the notes.after these defaults,ncs common stock traded in a range of to per share until days before the announcement of the transaction at issue in this case.
ncs began to explore strategic alternatives that might address the problems it was confronting.as part of this effort,in february,ncs retained ubs warburg,to identify potential acquirers and possible equity investors.ubs warburg contacted over fifty different entities to solicit their interest in a variety of transactions with ncs.ubs warburg had marginal success in its efforts.by october,ncs had only received one indication of interest valued at million,substantially less than the face value of ncs senior debt.this proposal was reduced by after the offeror conducted its due diligence review.
ncs financial deterioration 
in december,ncs terminated its relationship with ubs warburg and retained brown,gibbons,lang company as its exclusive financial advisor.during this period,ncs financial condition continued to deteriorate.in april,ncs received a formal notice of default and acceleration from the trustee for holders of the notes.as ncs financial condition worsened,the noteholders formed a committee to represent their financial interests the ad hoc committee.at about that time,ncs began discussions with various investor groups regarding a restructuring in a bankruptcy.ncs did not receive any proposal that it believed provided adequate consideration for its stakeholders.at that time,full recovery for ncs creditors was a remote prospect,and any recovery for ncs stockholders seemed impossible.
omnicare initial negotiations 
in the summer of,ncs invited omnicare,to begin discussions with brown gibbons regarding a possible transaction.on july,joel gemunder,omnicare president and ceo,sent shaw a written proposal to acquire ncs in a bankruptcy sale under section of the bankruptcy code.this proposal was for million subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence.ncs asked omnicare to execute a confidentiality agreement so that more detailed discussions could take place 
in august,omnicare increased its bid to million,but still proposed to structure the deal as an asset sale in bankruptcy.even at million,omnicare proposal was substantially lower than the face value of ncs outstanding debt.it would have provided only a small recovery for omnicare noteholders and no recovery for its stockholders.in october,ncs sent glen pollack of brown gibbons to meet with omnicare financial advisor,merrill lynch,to discuss omnicare interest in ncs.omnicare responded that it was not interested in any transaction other than an asset sale in bankruptcy.
there was no further contact between omnicare and ncs between november and january.instead,omnicare began secret discussions with judy mencher,a representative of the ad hoc committee.in these discussions,omnicare continued to pursue a transaction structured as a sale of assets in bankruptcy.in february,the ad hoc committee notified the ncs board that omnicare had proposed an asset sale in bankruptcy for.
ncs independent board committee 
in january,genesis was contacted by members of the ad hoc committee concerning a possible transaction with ncs.genesis executed ncs standard confidentiality agreement and began a due diligence review.genesis had recently emerged from bankruptcy because,like ncs,it was suffering from dwindling government reimbursements.
genesis previously lost a bidding war to omnicare in a different transaction.this led to bitter feelings between the principals of both companies.more importantly,this bitter experience for genesis led to its insistence on exclusivity agreements and in any potential transaction with ncs.
ncs financial improvement 
ncs operating performance was improving by early.as ncs performance improved,the ncs directors began to believe that it might be possible for ncs to enter into a transaction that would provide some recovery for ncs stockholders equity.in march,ncs decided to form an independent committee of board members who were neither ncs employees nor major ncs stockholders the independent committee.the ncs board thought this was necessary because,due to ncs precarious financial condition,it felt that fiduciary duties were owed to the enterprise as a whole rather than solely to ncs stockholders.
sells and osborne were selected as the members of the committee,and given authority to consider and negotiate possible transactions for ncs.the entire four member ncs board,however,retained authority to approve any transaction.the independent committee retained the same legal and financial counsel as the ncs board.
the independent committee met for the first time on may.at that meeting pollack suggested that ncs seek a merger partner to obtain the highest possible value in any transaction.the independent committee agreed with the suggestion.
genesis initial proposal 
two days later,on may,scott berlin of brown gibbons,glen pollack and boake sells met with george hager,cfo of genesis,and michael walker,who was genesis ceo.at that meeting,genesis made it clear that if it were going to engage in any negotiations with ncs,it would not do so as a stalking horse.as one of its advisors testified,we did want to be someone who set forth a valuation for ncs which would only result in that valuation being publicly disclosed,and thereby creating an environment where omnicare felt to maintain its competitive monopolistic positions,that they had to match and exceed that level.thus,genesis wanted a degree of certainty that to the extent it w as willing to pursue a negotiated merger agreement,it would be able to consummate the transaction it negotiated and executed.
in june,genesis proposed a transaction that would take place outside the bankruptcy context.although it did not provide full recovery for ncs noteholders,it provided the possibility that ncs stockholders would be able to recover something for their investment.as discussions continued,the terms proposed by genesis continued to improve.on june,the economic terms of the genesis proposal included repayment of the ncs senior debt in full,full assumption of trade credit obligations,an exchange offer or direct purchase of the ncs notes providing ncs noteholders with a combination of cash and genesis common stock equal to the par value of the ncs notes not including accrued interest,and million in value for the ncs common stock.structurally,the genesis proposal continued to include consents from a significant majority of the noteholders as well as support agreements from stockholders owning a majority of the ncs voting power.
genesis exclusivity agreement 
ncs financial advisors and legal counsel met again with genesis and its legal counsel on june,to discuss a number of issues.at this meeting,pollack asked genesis to increase its offer to ncs stockholders.genesis agreed to consider this request.thereafter,pollack and hager had further conversations.genesis agreed to offer a total of million in consideration for the ncs common stock,or an additional million,in the form of genesis common stock.
at the june meeting,genesis representatives demanded that,before any further negotiations take place,ncs agree to enter into an exclusivity agreement with it.as hager from genesis explained it i f they wished us to continue to try to move this process to a definitive agreement,that they would need to do it on an exclusive basis with us.we were going to,and already had incurred significant expense,but we would incur additional expenses,both internal and external,to bring this transaction to a definitive signing.we wanted them to work with us on an exclusive basis for a short period of time to see if we could reach agreement.on june,genesis legal counsel delivered a draft form of exclusivity agreement for review and consideration by ncs legal counsel.
the independent committee met on july,to consider the proposed exclusivity agreement.pollack presented a summary of the terms of a possible genesis merger,which had continued to improve.the genesis proposal included repayment of the ncs senior debt in full,payment of par value for the notes without accrued interest in the form of a combination of cash and genesis stock,payment to ncs stockholders in the form of million in genesis stock,plus the assumption,because the transaction was to be structured as a merger,of additional liabilities to trade and other unsecured creditors.
ncs director sells testified,pollack told the independent committee at a july,meeting that genesis wanted the exclusivity agreement to be the first step towards a completely locked up transaction that would preclude a higher bid from omnicare 
pollack explained that genesis felt that they had suffered at the hands of omnicare and others.i guess maybe just omnicare.i do know much about genesis sic acquisition history.but they had suffered before at the and that they wanted to have a pretty much bulletproof deal or they were not going to go forward.
q.when you say they suffered at the hands of omnicare,what do you mean 
well,my expression is that that was related deal that was related to me or explained to me that they,genesis,had tried to acquire,i suppose,an institutional pharmacy,i do remember the name of it.thought they had a deal and then at the last minute,omnicare outbid them for the company in a like kind of thing,and that they were unhappy about that.and once burned,twice shy.
after ncs executed the exclusivity agreement,genesis provided ncs with a draft merger agreement,a draft noteholders support agreement,and draft voting agreements for outcalt and shaw,who together held a majority of the voting power of the ncs common stock.genesis and ncs negotiated the terms of the merger agreement over the next three weeks.during those negotiations,the independent committee and the ad hoc committee persuaded genesis to improve the terms of its merger.
the parties were still negotiating by july,and the exclusivity period was automatically extended to july.at that point,ncs and genesis were close to executing a merger agreement and related voting agreements.genesis proposed a short extension of the exclusivity agreement so a deal could be finalized.on the morning of july,the independent committee authorized an extension of the exclusivity period through july.
omnicare proposes negotiations 
by late july,omnicare came to believe that ncs was negotiating a transaction,possibly with genesis or another of omnicare competitors,that would potentially present a competitive threat to omnicare.omnicare also came to believe,in light of a in the price of ncs common stock,that whatever transaction ncs was negotiating probably included a payment for its stock.thus,the omnicare board of directors met on the morning of july and,on the recommendation of its management,authorized a proposal to acquire ncs that did not involve a sale of assets in bankruptcy.
on the afternoon of july,omnicare faxed to ncs a letter outlining a proposed acquisition.the letter suggested a transaction in which omnicare would retire ncs senior and subordinated debt at par plus accrued interest,and pay the ncs stockholders cash for their shares.omnicare proposal,however,was expressly conditioned on negotiating a merger agreement,obtaining certain third party consents,and completing its due diligence.
mencher saw the july omnicare letter and realized that,while its economic terms were attractive,the due diligence condition substantially undercut its strength.in an effort to get a better proposal from omnicare,mencher telephoned gemunder and told him that omnicare was unlikely to succeed in its bid unless it dropped the due diligence outs.she explained this was the only way a bid at the last minute would be able to succeed.gemunder considered mencher warning very real,and followed up with his advisors.they,however,insisted that he retain the due diligence condition to protect him from doing something foolish.taking this advice to heart,gemunder decided not to drop the due diligence condition.
late in the afternoon of july,ncs representatives received voicemail messages from omnicare asking to discuss the letter.the exclusivity agreement prevented ncs from returning those calls.in relevant part,that agreement precluded ncs from engag ing or particpat ing in any discussions or negotiations with respect to a competing transaction or a proposal for one.the july letter from omnicare met the definition of a competing transaction.
despite the exclusivity agreement,the independent committee met to consider a response to omnicare.it concluded that discussions with omnicare about its july letter presented an unacceptable risk that genesis would abandon merger discussions.the independent committee believed that,given omnicare past bankruptcy proposals and unwillingness to consider a merger,as well as its decision to negotiate exclusively with the ad hoc committee,the risk of losing the genesis proposal was too substantial.nevertheless,the independent committee instructed pollack to use omnicare letter to negotiate for improved terms with genesis.
genesis merger agreement and voting agreements 
genesis responded to the ncs request to improve its offer as a result of the omnicare fax the next day.on july,genesis proposed substantially improved terms.first,it proposed to retire the notes in accordance with the terms of the indenture,thus eliminating the need for noteholders to consent to the transaction.this change involved paying all accrued interest plus a small redemption premium.second,genesis increased the exchange ratio for ncs common stock to of a genesis common share for each ncs common share,an increase.third,it agreed to lower the proposed termination fee in the merger agreement from million to million.in return for these concessions,genesis stipulated that the transaction had to be approved by midnight the next day,july,or else genesis would terminate discussions and withdraw its offer.
the independent committee and the ncs board both scheduled meetings for july.the committee met first.although that meeting lasted less than an hour,the court of chancery determined the minutes reflect that the directors were fully informed of all material facts relating to the proposed transaction.after concluding that genesis was sincere in establishing the midnight deadline,the committee voted unanimously to recommend the transaction to the full board.
the full board met thereafter.after receiving similar reports and advice from its legal and financial advisors,the board concluded that balancing the potential loss of the genesis deal against the uncertainty of omnicare letter,results in the conclusion that the only reasonable alternative for the board of directors is to approve the genesis transaction.the board first voted to authorize the voting agreements with outcalt and shaw,for purposes of section of the delaware general corporation law dgcl.the board was advised by its legal counsel that under the terms of the merger agreement and because ncs shareholders representing in excess of of the outstanding voting power would be required by genesis to enter into stockholder voting agreements contemporaneously with the signing of the merger agreement,and would agree to vote their shares in favor of the merger agreement,shareholder approval of the merger would be assured even if the ncs board were to withdraw or change its recommendation.these facts would prevent ncs from engaging in any alternative or superior transaction in the future.emphasis added.
after listening to a summary of the merger terms,the board then resolved that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were advisable and fair and in the best interests of all the ncs stakeholders.the ncs board further resolved to recommend the transactions to the stockholders for their approval and adoption.a definitive merger agreement between ncs and genesis and the stockholder voting agreements were executed later that day.the court of chancery held that it was not a per se breach of fiduciary duty that the ncs board never read the merger agreement word for word 
merger agreement 
among other things,the merger agreement provided the following 
ncs stockholders would receive share of genesis common stock in exchange for every shares of ncs common stock held 
ncs stockholders could exercise appraisal rights under.
ncs would redeem ncs notes in accordance with their terms 
ncs would submit the merger agreement to ncs stockholders regardless of whether the ncs board continued to recommend the merger 
ncs would not enter into discussions with third parties concerning an alternative acquisition of ncs,or provide information to such parties,unless the third party provided an unsolicited,bona fide written proposal documenting the terms of the acquisition the ncs board believed in good faith that the proposal was or was likely to result in an acquisition on terms superior to those contemplated by the merger agreement and before providing information to that third party,the third party would execute a confidentiality agreement at least as restrictive as the one in place between ncs and genesis and 
if the merger agreement were to be terminated,under certain circumstances ncs would be required to pay genesis a million termination fee genesis documented expenses,up to million.
voting agreements 
outcalt and shaw,in their capacity as ncs stockholders,entered into voting agreements with genesis.ncs was also required to be a party to the voting agreements by genesis.those agreements provided,among other things,that 
outcalt and shaw were acting in their capacity as ncs stockholders in executing the agreements,not in their capacity as ncs directors or officers 
neither outcalt nor shaw would transfer their shares prior to the stockholder vote on the merger agreement 
outcalt and shaw agreed to vote all of their shares in favor of the merger agreement and 
outcalt and shaw granted to genesis an irrevocable proxy to vote their shares in favor of the merger agreement.
the voting agreement was specifically enforceable by genesis.
the merger agreement further provided that if either outcalt or shaw breached the terms of the voting agreements,genesis would be entitled to terminate the merger agreement and potentially receive a million termination fee from ncs.such a breach was impossible since section provided that the voting agreements were specifically enforceable by genesis.
omnicare superior proposal 
on july,hours after the transaction was executed,omnicare faxed a letter to ncs restating its conditional proposal and attaching a draft merger agreement.later that morning,omnicare issued a press release publicly disclosing the proposal.
on august,omnicare filed a lawsuit attempting to enjoin the merger,and announced that it intended to launch a tender offer for ncs shares at a price of per share.on august,omnicare began its tender offer.by letter dated that same day,omnicare expressed a desire to discuss the terms of the offer with ncs.omnicare letter continued to condition its proposal on satisfactory completion of a due diligence investigation of ncs.
on august,and again on august,the ncs independent committee and full board of directors met separately to consider the omnicare tender offer in light of the genesis merger agreement.ncs outside legal counsel and ncs financial advisor attended both meetings.the board was unable to determine that omnicare expressions of interest were likely to lead to a superior proposal,as the term was defined in the merger agreement.on september,ncs requested and received a waiver from genesis allowing ncs to enter into discussions with omnicare without first having to determine that omnicare proposal was a superior proposal.
on october,omnicare irrevocably committed itself to a transaction with ncs.pursuant to the terms of its proposal,omnicare agreed to acquire all the outstanding ncs class a and class b shares at a price of per share in cash.as a result of this irrevocable offer,on october,the ncs board withdrew its recommendation that the stockholders vote in favor of the merger agreement.ncs financial advisor withdrew its fairness opinion of the merger agreement as well.
genesis rejection impossible 
the genesis merger agreement permits the ncs directors to furnish information to,or enter into discussions with,any person in connection with an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal by such person that the board deems likely to constitute a superior proposal.that provision has absolutely no effect on the genesis merger agreement.even if the ncs board changes,withdraws or modifies its recommendation,as it did,it must still submit the merger to a stockholder vote.
a subsequent filing with the securities and exchange commission sec states the ncs independent committee and the ncs board of directors have determined to withdraw their recommendations of the genesis merger agreement and recommend that the ncs stockholders vote against the approval and adoption of the genesis merger.in that same sec filing,however,the ncs board explained why the success of the genesis merger had already been predetermined.notwithstanding the foregoing,the ncs independent committee and the ncs board of directors recognize that the existing contractual obligations to genesis currently prevent ncs from accepting the omnicare irrevocable merger proposal and the existence of the voting agreements entered into by outcalt and shaw,whereby outcalt and shaw agreed to vote their shares of ncs class a common stock and ncs class b common stock in favor of the genesis merger,ensure ncs stockholder approval of the genesis merger.this litigation was commenced to prevent the consummation of the inferior genesis transaction.
legal analysis 
business judgment or enhanced scrutiny 
the defining tension in corporate governance today has been characterized as the tension between deference to directors decisions and the scope of judicial review.the appropriate standard of judicial review is dispositive of which party has the burden of proof as any litigation proceeds from stage to stage until there is a substantive determination on the merits accordingly,identification of the correct analytical framework is essential to a proper judicial review of challenges to the process of a corporation board of directors 
the business judgment rule,as a standard of judicial review,is a recognition of the statutory authority to manage a corporation that is vested in the board of directors.the business judgment rule is a presumption that in making a business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis,in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.an application of the traditional business judgment rule places the burden on the party challenging the board decision to establish facts rebutting the presumption.the effect of a proper invocation of the business judgment rule,as a standard of judicial review,is powerful because it operates deferentially.unless the procedural presumption of the business judgment rule is rebutted,a court will not substitute its judgment for that of the board if the board decision can be attributed to any rational business purpose.
the business judgment rule embodies the deference that is accorded to managerial decisions of a board of directors.under normal circumstances,neither the courts nor the stockholders should interfere with the managerial decision of the directors.there are certain circumstances,however,which mandate that a court take a more direct and active role in overseeing the decisions made and actions taken by directors.in these situations,a court subjects the directors conduct to enhanced scrutiny to ensure that it is reasonable,before the protections of the business judgment rule may be conferred.
the prior decisions of this court have identified the circumstances where board action must be subjected to enhanced judicial scrutiny before the presumptive protection of the business judgment rule can be invoked.one of those circumstances was described in unocal when a board adopts defensive measures in response to a hostile takeover proposal that the board reasonably determines is a threat to corporate policy and effectiveness in moran household,we explained why a unocal analysis also was applied to the adoption of a stockholder rights plan,even in the absence of an immediate threat other circumstances requiring enhanced judicial scrutiny give rise to what are known as revlon duties,such as when the board enters into a merger transaction that will cause a change in corporate control,initiates an active bidding process seeking to sell the corporation,or makes a break up of the corporate entity inevitable 
merger decision review standard 
the first issue decided by the court of chancery addressed the standard of judicial review that should be applied to the decision by the ncs board to merge with genesis.this court has held that a board decision to enter into a merger transaction that does not involve a change in control is entitled to judicial deference pursuant to the procedural and substantive operation of the business judgment rule when a board decides to enter into a merger transaction that will result in a change of control,however,enhanced judicial scrutiny under revlon is the standard of review 
the court of chancery concluded that,because the merger between genesis and ncs did not result in a change of control,the ncs directors duties under revlon were not triggered by the decision to merge with genesis the court of chancery also recognized,however,that revlon duties are imposed when a corporation initiates an active bidding process seeking to sell itself.the court of chancery then concluded,alternatively,that revlon duties had not been triggered because ncs did not start an active bidding process,and the ncs board abandoned its efforts to sell the company when it entered into an exclusivity agreement with genesis.
after concluding that the revlon standard of enhanced judicial review was completely inapplicable,the court of chancery then held that it would examine the decision of the ncs board of directors to approve the genesis merger pursuant to the business judgment rule standard.after completing its business judgment rule review,the court of chancery held that the ncs board of directors had not breached their duty of care by entering into the exclusivity and merger agreements with genesis.the court of chancery also held,however,that even applying the more exacting revlon standard,the directors acted in conformity with their fiduciary duties in seeking to achieve the highest and best transaction that was reasonably available to the stockholders.
the appellants argue that the court of chancery revlon conclusions are without factual support in the record and contrary to delaware law for at least two reasons.first,they submit that ncs did initiate an active bidding process.second,they submit that ncs did not abandon its efforts to sell itself by entering into the exclusivity agreement with genesis.the appellants contend that once ncs decided to initiate a bidding process seeking to maximize stockholder value,it can not avoid enhanced judicial scrutiny under revlon simply because the bidder it selected genesis happens to have proposed a merger transaction that does not involve a change of control.
the court of chancery decision to review the ncs board decision to merge with genesis under the business judgment rule rather than the enhanced scrutiny standard of revlon is not outcome determinative for the purposes of deciding this appeal.we have assumed arguendo that the business judgment rule applied to the decision by the ncs board to merge with genesis we have also assumed arguendo that the ncs board exercised due care when it abandoned the independent committee recommendation to pursue a stalking horse strategy,without even trying to implement it executed an exclusivity agreement with genesis acceded to genesis hour ultimatum for making a final merger decision and executed a merger agreement that was summarized but never completely read by the ncs board of directors 
deal protection devices require enhanced scrutiny 
the dispositive issues in this appeal involve the defensive devices that protected the genesis merger agreement.the delaware corporation statute provides that the board management decision to enter into and recommend a merger transaction can become final only when ownership action is taken by a vote of the stockholders.thus,the delaware corporation law expressly provides for a balance of power between boards and stockholders which makes merger transactions a shared enterprise and ownership decision.consequently,a board of directors decision to adopt defensive devices to protect a merger agreement may implicate the stockholders right to effectively vote contrary to the initial recommendation of the board in favor of the transaction 
it is well established that conflicts of interest arise when a board of directors acts to prevent stockholders from effectively exercising their right to vote contrary to the will of the board the omnipresent specter of such conflict may be present whenever a board adopts defensive devices to protect a merger agreement the stockholders ability to effectively reject a merger agreement is likely to bear an inversely proportionate relationship to the structural and economic devices that the board has approved to protect the transaction.
in paramount time,the original merger agreement between time and warner did not constitute a change of control.the plaintiffs in paramount time argued that,although the original time and warner merger agreement did not involve a change of control,the use of a,clause,and provisions violated the time board revlon duties.this court held that t he adoption of structural safety devices alone does not trigger revlon.rather,as the chancellor stated,such devices are properly subject to a unocal analysis.
in footnote of paramount time,we stated that legality of the structural safety devices adopted to protect the original merger agreement between time and warner were not a central issue on appeal that is because the issue on appeal involved the time board decision to recast its consolidation with warner into an outright cash and securities acquisition of warner by time.nevertheless,we determined that there was substantial evidence on the record to support the conclusions reached by the chancellor in applying a unocal analysis to each of the structural devices contained in the original merger agreement between time and warner 
there are inherent conflicts between a board interest in protecting a merger transaction it has approved,the stockholders statutory right to make the final decision to either approve or not approve a merger,and the board continuing responsibility to effectively exercise its fiduciary duties at all times after the merger agreement is executed.these competing considerations require a threshold determination that defensive devices protecting a merger transaction are within the limitations of its statutory authority and consistent with the directors fiduciary duties.accordingly,in paramount time,we held that the business judgment rule applied to the time board original decision to merge with warner we further held,however,that defensive devices adopted by the board to protect the original merger transaction must withstand enhanced judicial scrutiny under the unocal standard of review,even when that merger transaction does not result in a change of control 
enhanced scrutiny generally 
in paramount qvc,this court identified the key features of an enhanced judicial scrutiny test.the first feature is a judicial determination regarding the adequacy of the decisionmaking process employed by the directors,including the information on which the directors based their decision.the second feature is a judicial examination of the reasonableness of the directors action in light of the circumstances then existing.we also held that the directors have the burden of proving that they were adequately informed and acted reasonably.
in qvc,we explained that the application of an enhanced judicial scrutiny test involves a judicial review of the reasonableness of the substantive merits of the board actions.in applying that standard,we held that a court should not ignore the complexity of the directors task in the context in which action was taken accordingly,we concluded that a court applying enhanced judicial scrutiny should not decide whether the directors made a perfect decision but instead should decide whether the directors decision was,on balance,within a range of reasonableness.
in unitrin,we explained the ratio decidendi for the range of reasonableness standard when a court applies enhanced judicial scrutiny to director action pursuant to our holding in unocal it is a recognition that a board of directors needs latitude in discharging its fiduciary duties to the corporation and its shareholders when defending against perceived threats.the concomitant requirement is for judicial restraint.therefore,if the board of directors collective defensive responses are not draconian preclusive or coercive and are within a range of reasonableness,a court must not substitute its judgment for the board judgment.the same ratio decidendi applies to the range of reasonableness when courts apply unocal enhanced judicial scrutiny standard to defensive devices intended to protect a merger agreement that will not result in a change of control.
a board decision to protect its decision to enter a merger agreement with defensive devices against uninvited competing transactions that may emerge is analogous to a board decision to protect against dangers to corporate policy and effectiveness when it adopts defensive measures in a hostile takeover contest.in applying unocal enhanced judicial scrutiny in assessing a challenge to defensive actions taken by a target corporation board of directors in a takeover context,this court held that the board does not have unbridled discretion to defeat perceived threats by any draconian means available similarly,just as a board statutory power with regard to a merger decision is not absolute,a board does not have unbridled discretion to defeat any perceived threat to a merger by protecting it with any draconian means available.
since unocal,this court has consistently recognized that defensive measures which are either preclusive or coercive are included within the common law definition of draconian.in applying enhanced judicial scrutiny to defensive actions under unocal,a court must evaluate the board overall response,including the justification for each contested defensive measure,and the results achieved thereby.if a board defensive actions are inextricably related,the principles of unocal require that such actions be scrutinized collectively as a unitary response to the perceived threat.
therefore,in applying enhanced judicial scrutiny to defensive devices designed to protect a merger agreement,a court must first determine that those measures are not preclusive or coercive before its focus shifts to the range of reasonableness in making a proportionality determination if the trial court determines that the defensive devices protecting a merger are not preclusive or coercive,the proportionality paradigm of unocal is applicable.the board must demonstrate that it has reasonable grounds for believing that a danger to the corporation and its stockholders exists if the merger transaction is not consummated that burden is satisfied by showing good faith and reasonable investigation.such proof is materially enhanced if it is approved by a board comprised of a majority of outside directors or by an independent committee 
when the focus of judicial scrutiny shifts to the range of reasonableness,unocal requires that any defensive devices must be proportionate to the perceived threat to the corporation and its stockholders if the merger transaction is not consummated.defensive devices taken to protect a merger agreement executed by a board of directors are intended to give that agreement an advantage over any subsequent transactions that materialize before the merger is approved by the stockholders and consummated.this is analogous to the favored treatment that a board of directors may properly give to encourage an initial bidder when it discharges its fiduciary duties under revlon.
therefore,in the context of a merger that does not involve a change of control,when defensive devices in the executed merger agreement are challenged their effect on a subsequent competing alternative merger transaction,this court analysis in macmillan is didactic in the context of a case of defensive measures taken against an existing bidder,we stated in macmillan 
in the face of disparate treatment,the trial court must first examine whether the directors properly perceived that shareholder interests were enhanced.in any event the board action must be reasonable in relation to the advantage sought to be achieved by the merger it approved,or conversely,to the threat which a competing transaction poses to stockholder interests.if on the basis of this enhanced unocal scrutiny the trial court is satisfied that the test has been met,then the directors actions necessarily are entitled to the protections of the business judgment rule 
the latitude a board will have in either maintaining or using the defensive devices it has adopted to protect the merger it approved will vary according to the degree of benefit or detriment to the stockholders interests that is presented by the value or terms of the subsequent competing transaction 
genesis one day ultimatum 
the record reflects that two of the four ncs board members,shaw and outcalt,were also the same two ncs stockholders who combined to control a majority of the stockholder voting power.genesis gave the four person ncs board less than hours to vote in favor of its proposed merger agreement.genesis insisted the merger agreement include a section c clause,mandating its submission for a stockholder vote even if the board recommendation was withdrawn.genesis further insisted that the merger agreement omit any effective fiduciary out clause.
genesis also gave the two stockholder members of the ncs board,shaw and outcalt,the same accelerated time table to personally sign the proposed voting agreements.these voting agreements committed them irrevocably to vote their majority power in favor of the merger and further provided in section that the voting agreements be specifically enforceable.genesis also required that ncs execute the voting agreements.
genesis hour ultimatum was that,unless both the merger agreement and the voting agreements were signed with the terms it requested,its offer was going to be withdrawn.according to genesis attorneys,these were unalterable conditions to genesis willingness to proceed.genesis insisted on the execution of the interlocking voting rights and merger agreements because it feared that omnicare would make a superior merger proposal.the ncs board signed the voting rights and merger agreements,without any effective fiduciary out clause,to expressly guarantee that the genesis merger would be approved,even if a superior merger transaction was presented from omnicare or any other entity.
deal protection devices 
defensive devices,as that term is used in this opinion,is a synonym for what are frequently referred to as deal protection devices.both terms are used interchangeably to describe any measure or combination of measures that are intended to protect the consummation of a merger transaction.defensive devices can be economic,structural,or both.
deal protection devices need not all be in the merger agreement itself.in this case,for example,the section c provision in the merger agreement was combined with the separate voting agreements to provide a structural defense for the genesis merger agreement against any subsequent superior transaction.genesis made the ncs board defense of its transaction absolute by insisting on the omission of any effective fiduciary out clause in the ncs merger agreement.
genesis argues that stockholder voting agreements can not be construed as deal protection devices taken by a board of directors because stockholders are entitled to vote in their own interest.genesis cites williams geier and stroud grace for the proposition that voting agreements are not subject to the unocal standard of review.neither of those cases,however,holds that the operative effect of a voting agreement must be disregarded per se when a unocal analysis is applied to a comprehensive and combined merger defense plan.
in this case,the stockholder voting agreements were inextricably intertwined with the defensive aspects of the genesis merger agreement.in fact,the voting agreements with shaw and outcalt were the linchpin of genesis proposed tripartite defense.therefore,genesis made the execution of those voting agreements a condition precedent to its execution of the merger agreement.in the case before us,the court of chancery held that the acts which the genesis transaction were the section c provision and the execution of the voting agreement by outcalt and shaw.
with the assurance that outcalt and shaw would irrevocably agree to exercise their majority voting power in favor of its transaction,genesis insisted that the merger agreement reflect the other two aspects of its concerted defense,the inclusion of a section c provision and the omission of any effective fiduciary out clause.those dual aspects of the merger agreement would not have provided genesis with a complete defense in the absence of the voting agreements with shaw and outcalt.
these deal protection devices unenforceable 
in this case,the court of chancery correctly held that the ncs directors decision to adopt defensive devices to completely lock up the genesis merger mandated special scrutiny under the test set forth in unocal that conclusion is consistent with our holding in paramount time that safety devices adopted to protect a transaction that did not result in a change of control are subject to enhanced judicial scrutiny under a unocal analysis the record does not,however,support the court of chancery conclusion that the defensive devices adopted by the ncs board to protect the genesis merger were reasonable and proportionate to the threat that ncs perceived from the potential loss of the genesis transaction.
pursuant to the judicial scrutiny required under unocal analysis,the ncs directors must first demonstrate that they had reasonable grounds for believing that a danger to corporate policy and effectiveness existed to satisfy that burden,the ncs directors are required to show they acted in good faith after conducting a reasonable investigation the threat identified by the ncs board was the possibility of losing the genesis offer and being left with no comparable alternative transaction.
the second stage of the unocal test requires the ncs directors to demonstrate that their defensive response was reasonable in relation to the threat posed.this inquiry involves a analysis.the ncs directors must first establish that the merger deal protection devices adopted in response to the threat were not coercive or preclusive,and then demonstrate that their response was within a range of reasonable responses to the threat perceived in unitrin,we stated 
a response is coercive if it is aimed at forcing upon stockholders a alternative to a hostile offer 
a response is preclusive if it deprives stockholders of the right to receive all tender offers or precludes a bidder from seeking control by fundamentally restricting proxy contests or otherwise 
this aspect of the unocal standard provides for a disjunctive analysis.if defensive measures are either preclusive or coercive they are draconian and impermissible.in this case,the deal protection devices of the ncs board were both preclusive and coercive.
this court enunciated the standard for determining stockholder coercion in the case of williams geier a stockholder vote may be nullified by wrongful coercion where the board or some other party takes actions which have the effect of causing the stockholders to vote in favor of the proposed transaction for some reason other than the merits of that transaction.in brazen bell atlantic corporation,we applied that test for stockholder coercion and held that although the termination fee provision may have influenced the stockholder vote,there were no structurally or situationally coercive factors that made an otherwise valid fee provision impermissibly coercive under the facts presented 
in brazen,we concluded the determination of whether a particular stockholder vote has been robbed of its effectiveness by impermissible coercion depends on the facts of the case.in this case,the court of chancery did not expressly address the issue of coercion in its unocal analysis.it did find as a fact,however,that ncs public stockholders who owned of ncs and overwhelmingly supported omnicare offer will be forced to accept the genesis merger because of the structural defenses approved by the ncs board.consequently,the record reflects that any stockholder vote would have been robbed of its effectiveness by the impermissible coercion that predetermined the outcome of the merger without regard to the merits of the genesis transaction at the time the vote was scheduled to be taken deal protection devices that result in such coercion can not withstand unocal enhanced judicial scrutiny standard of review because they are not within the range of reasonableness.
although the minority stockholders were not forced to vote for the genesis merger,they were required to accept it because it was a fait accompli.the record reflects that the defensive devices employed by the ncs board are preclusive and coercive in the sense that they accomplished a fait accompli.in this case,despite the fact that the ncs board has withdrawn its recommendation for the genesis transaction and recommended its rejection by the stockholders,the deal protection devices approved by the ncs board operated in concert to have a preclusive and coercive effect.those tripartite defensive section c provision,the voting agreements,and the absence of an effective fiduciary out it mathematically impossible and realistically unattainable for the omnicare transaction or any other proposal to succeed,no matter how superior the proposal 
the deal protection devices adopted by the ncs board were designed to coerce the consummation of the genesis merger and preclude the consideration of any superior transaction.the ncs directors defensive devices are not within a reasonable range of responses to the perceived threat of losing the genesis offer because they are preclusive and coercive accordingly,we hold that those deal protection devices are unenforceable.
effective fiduciary out required 
the defensive measures that protected the merger transaction are unenforceable not only because they are preclusive and coercive but,alternatively,they are unenforceable because they are invalid as they operate in this case.given the specifically enforceable irrevocable voting agreements,the provision in the merger agreement requiring the board to submit the transaction for a stockholder vote and the omission of a fiduciary out clause in the merger agreement completely prevented the board from discharging its fiduciary responsibilities to the minority stockholders when omnicare presented its superior transaction.to the extent that a merger contract,or a provision thereof,purports to require a board to act or not act in such a fashion as to limit the exercise of fiduciary duties,it is invalid and unenforceable.
in qvc this court recognized that w hen a majority of a corporation voting shares are acquired by a single person or entity,or by a cohesive group acting together as in this case,there is a significant diminution in the voting power of those who thereby become minority stockholders.therefore,we acknowledged that i n the absence of devices protecting the minority stockholders,stockholder votes are likely to become mere formalities,where a cohesive group acting together to exercise majority voting powers have already decided the outcome consequently,we concluded that since the minority stockholders lost the power to influence corporate direction through the ballot,minority stockholders must rely for protection solely on the fiduciary duties owed to them by the directors.
under the circumstances presented in this case,where a cohesive group of stockholders with majority voting power was irrevocably committed to the merger transaction,e ffective representation of the financial interests of the minority shareholders imposed upon the ncs board an affirmative responsibility to protect those minority shareholders interests.the ncs board could not abdicate its fiduciary duties to the minority by leaving it to the stockholders alone to approve or disapprove the merger agreement because two stockholders had already combined to establish a majority of the voting power that made the outcome of the stockholder vote a foregone conclusion.
the court of chancery noted that section c of the delaware general corporation law now permits boards to agree to submit a merger agreement for a stockholder vote,even if the board later withdraws its support for that agreement and recommends that the stockholders reject it the court of chancery also noted that stockholder voting agreements are permitted by delaware law.in refusing to certify this interlocutory appeal,the court of chancery stated it is simply nonsensical to say that a board of directors abdicates its duties to manage the business and affairs of a corporation under section a of the dgcl by agreeing to the inclusion in a merger agreement of a term authorized by c of the same statute.
taking action that is otherwise legally possible,however,does not ipso facto comport with the fiduciary responsibilities of directors in all circumstances the synopsis to the amendments that resulted in the enactment of section c in the delaware corporation law statute specifically provides the amendments are not intended to address the question of whether such a submission requirement is appropriate in any particular set of factual circumstances.section provisions,like the provision examined in qvc,are presumptively valid in the abstract.such provisions in a merger agreement may not,however,validly define or limit the directors fiduciary duties under delaware law or prevent the ncs directors from carrying out their fiduciary duties under delaware law.
genesis admits that when the ncs board agreed to its merger conditions,the ncs board was seeking to assure that the ncs creditors were paid in full and that the ncs stockholders received the highest value available for their stock.in fact,genesis defends its bulletproof merger agreement on that basis.we hold that the ncs board did not have authority to accede to the genesis demand for an absolute.
the directors of a delaware corporation have a continuing obligation to discharge their fiduciary responsibilities,as future circumstances develop,after a merger agreement is announced.genesis anticipated the likelihood of a superior offer after its merger agreement was announced and demanded defensive measures from the ncs board that completely protected its transaction instead of agreeing to the absolute defense of the genesis merger from a superior offer,however,the ncs board was required to negotiate a fiduciary out clause to protect the ncs stockholders if the genesis transaction became an inferior offer.by acceding to genesis ultimatum for complete protection in futuro,the ncs board disabled itself from exercising its own fiduciary obligations at a time when the board own judgment is most important receipt of a subsequent superior offer.
any board has authority to give the proponent of a recommended merger agreement reasonable structural and economic defenses,incentives,and fair compensation if the transaction is not completed.to the extent that defensive measures are economic and reasonable,they may become an increased cost to the proponent of any subsequent transaction.just as defensive measures can not be draconian,however,they can not limit or circumscribe the directors fiduciary duties.notwithstanding the corporation insolvent condition,the ncs board had no authority to execute a merger agreement that subsequently prevented it from effectively discharging its ongoing fiduciary responsibilities.
the stockholders of a delaware corporation are entitled to rely upon the board to discharge its fiduciary duties at all times the fiduciary duties of a director are unremitting and must be effectively discharged in the specific context of the actions that are required with regard to the corporation or its stockholders as circumstances change the stockholders with majority voting power,shaw and outcalt,had an absolute right to sell or exchange their shares with a third party at any price.this right was not only known to the other directors of ncs,it became an integral part of the genesis agreement.in its answering brief,genesis candidly states that its offer came with a would not be a stalking horse and would not agree to a transaction to which ncs controlling shareholders were not committed.
the ncs board was required to contract for an effective fiduciary out clause to exercise its continuing fiduciary responsibilities to the minority stockholders the issues in this appeal do not involve the general validity of either stockholder voting agreements or the authority of directors to insert a section c provision in a merger agreement.in this case,the ncs board combined those two otherwise valid actions and caused them to operate in concert as an absolute lock up,in the absence of an effective fiduciary out clause in the genesis merger agreement.
in the context of this preclusive and coercive lock up case,the protection of genesis contractual expectations must yield to the supervening responsibility of the directors to discharge their fiduciary duties on a continuing basis.the merger agreement and voting agreements,as they were combined to operate in concert in this case,are inconsistent with the ncs directors fiduciary duties.to that extent,we hold that they are invalid and unenforceable 
conclusion 
with respect to the fiduciary duty decision,the order of the court of chancery dated november,denying plaintiffs application for a preliminary injunction is reversed.with respect to the voting agreements decision,the order of the court of chancery dated october,is reversed to the extent that decision permits the implementation of the voting agreements contrary to this court ruling on the fiduciary duty claims.with respect to the appeal to this court of that portion of the standing decision constituting the order of the court of chancery dated october,that granted the motion to dismiss the remainder of the omnicare complaint,holding that omnicare lacked standing to assert fiduciary duty claims arising out of the action of the board of directors that preceded the date on which omnicare acquired its stock,the appeal is dismissed as moot.
the mandate shall issue immediately.
the beauty of the delaware corporation law,and the reason it has worked so well for stockholders,directors and officers,is that the framework is based on an enabling statute with the court of chancery and the supreme court applying principles of fiduciary duty in a common law mode on a basis.fiduciary duty cases are inherently and,therefore,unique.this case is unique in two important respects.first,the peculiar facts presented render this case an unlikely candidate for substantial repetition.second,this is a rare split decision of the supreme court 
in the present case,we are faced with a merger agreement and controlling stockholders commitment that assured stockholder approval of the merger before the emergence of a subsequent transaction offering greater value to the stockholders.this does not adequately summarize the unique facts before us,however.reference is made to the vice chancellor opinion and the factual summary in the majority opinion that adopts the vice chancellor findings 
the process by which this merger agreement came about involved a joint decision by the controlling stockholders and the board of directors to secure what appeared to be the only transaction available for a company on the brink of bankruptcy.the majority adopts a new rule of law that imposes a prohibition on the ncs board ability to act in concert with controlling stockholders to lock up this merger.the majority reaches this conclusion by analyzing the challenged deal protection measures as isolated board actions.the majority concludes that the board owed a duty to the ncs minority stockholders to refrain from acceding to the genesis demand for an irrevocable notwithstanding the compelling circumstances confronting the board and the board disinterested,informed,good faith exercise of its business judgment.
because we believe this court must respect the reasoned judgment of the board of directors and give effect to the wishes of the controlling stockholders,we respectfully disagree with the majority reasoning that results in a holding that the confluence of board and stockholder action constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty.the essential fact that must always be remembered is that this agreement and the voting commitments of outcalt and shaw concluded a lengthy search and intense negotiation process in the context of insolvency and creditor pressure where no other viable bid had emerged.accordingly,we endorse the vice chancellor analysis that the ncs board action before the hostile bid emerged was within the bounds of its fiduciary duties under these facts.
we share with the majority and the independent ncs board of directors the motivation to serve carefully and in good faith the best interests of the corporate enterprise and,thereby,the stockholders of ncs.it is now known,of course,after the case is over,that the stockholders of ncs will receive substantially more by tendering their shares into the topping bid of omnicare than they would have received in the genesis merger,as a result of the omnicare bid and the injunctive relief ordered by the majority of this court.our jurisprudence can not,however,be seen as turning on such ex post felicitous results.rather,the ncs board good faith decision must be subject to a review of the board action before the merger agreement was entered into.
an analysis of the process leading to the reflects a quintessential,disinterested and informed board decision reached in good faith 
the majority has adopted the vice chancellor findings and has assumed arguendo that the ncs board fulfilled its duties of care,loyalty,and good faith by entering into the genesis merger agreement.indeed,this conclusion is indisputable on this record.the problem is that the majority has removed from their proper context the contractual merger protection provisions.the here can not be reviewed in a vacuum.a court should review the entire bidding process to determine whether the independent board actions permitted the directors to inform themselves of their available options and whether they acted in good faith 
going into negotiations with genesis,the ncs directors knew that,up until that time,ncs had found only one potential bidder,omnicare.omnicare had refused to buy ncs except at a fire sale price through an asset sale in bankruptcy.omnicare best proposal at that stage would not have paid off all creditors and would have provided nothing for stockholders.the noteholders,represented by the ad hoc committee,were willing to oblige omnicare and force ncs into bankruptcy if omnicare would pay in full the ncs debt.through the ncs board efforts,genesis expressed interest that became increasingly attractive.negotiations with genesis led to an offer paying creditors off and conferring on ncs stockholders amount infinitely superior to the prior omnicare proposals.
but there was,understandably,a sine qua non.in exchange for offering the ncs stockholders a return on their equity and creditor payment,genesis demanded certainty that the merger would close.if the ncs board would not have acceded to the section c provision,if outcalt and shaw had not agreed to the voting agreements and if ncs had insisted on a fiduciary out,there would have been no genesis deal thus,the only transaction available would have disappeared.ncs knew that omnicare had spoiled a genesis acquisition in the past and it is not disputed by the majority that the ncs directors made a reasoned decision to accept as real the genesis threat to walk away 
when omnicare submitted its conditional bid,the ncs board had to weigh the economic terms of the proposal against the uncertainty of completing a deal with omnicare importantly,because omnicare bid was conditioned on its satisfactorily completing its due diligence review of ncs,the ncs board saw this as a crippling condition,as did the ad hoc committee.as a matter of business judgment,the risk of negotiating with omnicare and losing genesis at that point outweighed the possible benefits the was indisputably a sine qua non to any deal with genesis.
a permits a target board and a bidder to exchange certainties.certainty itself has value.the acquirer may pay a higher price for the target if the acquirer is assured consummation of the transaction.the target company also benefits from the certainty of completing a transaction with a bidder because losing an acquirer creates the perception that a target is damaged goods,thus reducing its value.
this court approved the recognition by the court of chancery of the value of certainty in rand western air lines the court of chancery upheld the decision of the board of western air lines to grant its only bidder a stock option agreement to acquire of western stock for an amount representing the closing price on the last trading day before execution of the merger agreement the court recognized that the agreement foreclose d further bidding,but noted that the board had canvassed the market,found only one party willing to acquire western,and made a decision calculated to maximize stockholder value by pursuing the only viable prospect that remained.the court also noted that,in return for the,the acquirer agreed to limit its own outs that would prevent consummation of the merger.the merging parties,then,exchanged certainties by locking up the deal,which was approved by the court of chancery and affirmed by this court 
while the present case does not involve an attempt to hold on to only one interested bidder,the ncs board was equally concerned about exchanging certainties with genesis.if the creditors decided to force ncs into bankruptcy,which could have happened at any time as ncs was unable to service its obligations,the stockholders would have received nothing.the ncs board also did not know if the ncs business prospects would have declined again,leaving ncs less attractive to other bidders,including omnicare,which could have changed its mind and again insisted on an asset sale in bankruptcy.
situations will arise where business realities demand a so that transactions may go forward.accordingly,any rule prohibiting could,in circumstances such as these,chill otherwise permissible conduct.
our jurisprudence does not compel this court to invalidate the joint action of the board and the controlling stockholders 
the majority invalidates the ncs board action by announcing a new rule that represents an extension of our jurisprudence.that new rule can be narrowly stated as follows a merger agreement entered into after a market search,before any prospect of a topping bid has emerged,which locks up stockholder approval and does not contain a fiduciary out provision,is per se invalid when a later significant topping bid emerges.as we have noted,this,per se rule would apply regardless of the circumstances leading up to the agreement and the fact that stockholders who control voting power had irrevocably committed themselves,as stockholders,to vote for the merger.narrowly stated,this new rule is a third rail that now becomes one of the given rules of the game,to be taken into account by the negotiators and drafters of merger agreements.in our view,this new rule is an unwise extension of existing precedent.
although it is debatable whether unocal we believe that the better rule in this situation is that the business judgment rule should apply we will,nevertheless,assume the vice chancellor unocal applies.therefore,under unocal the ncs directors had the burden of going forward with the evidence to show that there was a threat to corporate policy and effectiveness and that their actions were reasonable in response to that threat.the vice chancellor correctly found that they reasonably perceived the threat that ncs did not have a viable offer from anyone pay off its creditors,cure its insolvency and provide some payment to stockholders.the ncs board the vice chancellor correctly reasonable in relation to the threat because the genesis deal was the only game in town,the ncs directors got the best deal they could from genesis the emergence of genesis on the would have been no viable deal.
the vice chancellor held that the ncs directors satisfied unocal.he even held that they would have satisfied revlon,if it had applied,which it did not.indeed,he on the undisputed record and his considerable the overall quality of testimony given by the ncs directors is among the strongest this court has ever seen.all four ncs directors were deposed,and each deposition makes manifest the care and attention given to this project by every member of the board.we agree fully with the vice chancellor findings and conclusions,and we would have affirmed the judgment of the court of chancery on that basis.
in our view,the majority misapplies the unitrin concept of coercive and preclusive measures to preempt a proper proportionality balancing.thus,the majority asserts that in applying enhanced judicial scrutiny to defensive devices designed to protect a merger agreement,a court must determine that those measures are not preclusive or coercive here,the deal protection measures were not adopted unilaterally by the board to fend off an existing hostile offer that threatened the corporate policy and effectiveness of ncs they were adopted because only game in town would not save ncs,its creditors and its stockholders without these provisions.
the,in our on unitrin to advance its analysis.the discussion of draconian measures in unitrin dealt with unilateral board action,a repurchase program,designed to fend off an existing hostile offer by american general in unitrin we recognized the need to police preclusive and coercive actions initiated by the board to delay or retard an existing hostile bid so as to ensure that the stockholders can benefit from the board negotiations with the bidder or others and to exercise effectively the franchise as the ultimate check on board action unitrin polices the effect of board action on existing tender offers and proxy contests to ensure that the board can not permanently impose its will on the stockholders,leaving the stockholders no recourse to their voting rights 
the very measures the majority cites as coercive were approved by shaw and outcalt through the lens of their independent assessment of the merits of the transaction.the proper inquiry in this case is whether the ncs board had taken actions that have the effect of causing the stockholders to vote in favor of the proposed transaction for some reason other than the merits of that transaction.like the termination fee upheld as a valid liquidated damages clause against a claim of coercion in brazen bell atlantic,the deal protection measures at issue here were an integral part of the merits of the transaction as the ncs board struggled to did only deal available 
outcalt and shaw were fully informed stockholders.as the ncs controlling stockholders,they made an informed choice to commit their voting power to the merger.the minority stockholders were deemed to know that when controlling stockholders have of the vote they can approve a merger without the need for the minority votes.moreover,to the extent a minority stockholder may have felt coerced to vote for the merger,which was already a fait accompli,it was a meaningless no coercion at the controlling votes,those of outcalt and shaw,were already cast.although the fact that the controlling votes were committed to the merger precluded an overriding vote against the merger by the class a stockholders,the pejorative preclusive label applicable in a unitrin fact situation has no application here.therefore,there was no meaningful minority stockholder voting decision to coerce.
in applying unocal scrutiny,we believe the majority incorrectly preempted the proportionality inquiry.in our view,the proportionality inquiry must account for the reality that the contractual measures protecting this merger agreement were necessary to obtain the genesis deal.the majority has not demonstrated that the director action was a disproportionate response to the threat posed.indeed,it is clear to us that the board action to negotiate the best deal reasonably available with the only viable merger partner genesis who could satisfy the creditors and benefit the stockholders,was reasonable in relation to the threat,by any practical yardstick.
an absolute is not a per se violation of fiduciary duty 
we respectfully disagree with the majority conclusion that the ncs board breached its fiduciary duties to the class a stockholders by failing to negotiate a fiduciary out in the genesis merger agreement.what is the practical import of a fiduciary out it is a contractual provision,articulated in a manner to be negotiated,that would permit the board of the corporation being acquired to exit without breaching the merger agreement in the event of a superior offer.
in this case,genesis made it abundantly clear early on that it was willing to negotiate a deal with ncs but only on the condition that it would not be a stalking horse.thus,it wanted to be certain that a third party could not use its deal with ncs as a floor against which to begin a bidding war.as a result of this negotiating position,a fiduciary out was not acceptable to genesis.the majority opinion holds that such a negotiating position,if implemented in the agreement,is invalid per se where there is an absolute.we know of no authority in our jurisprudence supporting this new rule,and we believe it is unwise and unwarranted.
the majority relies on our decision in qvc to assert that the board fiduciary duties prevent the directors from negotiating a merger agreement without providing an escape provision.reliance on qvc for this proposition,however,confuses our statement of a board responsibilities when the directors confront a superior transaction and turn away from it to lock up a less valuable deal with the very different situation here,where the board committed itself to the only transaction available.the decision in qvc is an extension of prior decisions in revlon and mills that prevent a board from ignoring a bidder who is willing to match and exceed the favored bidder offer the majority application of continuing fiduciary duties here is a further extension of this concept and thus permits,wrongly in our view,a court to the risk and return analysis the board must make to weigh the value of the only viable transaction against the prospect of an offer that has not materialized.
the majority also mistakenly relies on our decision in qvc to support the notion that the ncs board should have retained a fiduciary out to save the minority stockholder from shaw and outcalt voting agreements.our reasoning in qvc,which recognizes that minority stockholders must rely for protection on the fiduciary duties owed to them by directors does not create a special duty to protect the minority stockholders from the consequences of a controlling stockholder ultimate decision unless the controlling stockholder stands on both sides of the transaction which is certainly not the case here.indeed,the discussion of a minority stockholders lack of voting power in qvc notes the importance of enhanced scrutiny in change of control transactions precisely because the minority stockholders interest in the newly merged entity thereafter will hinge on the course set by the controlling stockholder in qvc,sumner redstone owned of the voting stock of viacom,the surviving corporation unlike the stockholders who are confronted with a transaction that will relegate them to a minority status in the corporation,the class a stockholders of ncs purchased stock knowing that the charter provided class b stockholders voting control.
conclusion 
it is regrettable that the court is split in this important case.one hopes that the majority rule announced clearly erroneous in our be interpreted narrowly and will be seen as sui generis by deterring bidders from engaging in negotiations like those present here and requiring that there must always be a fiduciary out,the universe of potential bidders who could reasonably be expected to benefit stockholders could shrink or disappear.nevertheless,if the holding is confined to these unique facts,negotiators may be able to navigate around this new hazard.
accordingly,we respectfully dissent.
i respectfully dissent from the majority opinion,join the chief justice dissent in all respects and dissent separately in order to crystallize the central focus of my objection to the majority view.
i would affirm the vice chancellor holding denying injunctive relief.
here the board of directors acted selflessly pursuant to a careful,fair process and determined in good faith that the benefits to the stockholders and corporation flowing from a merger agreement containing reasonable deal protection provisions outweigh any speculative benefits that might result from entertaining a putative higher offer.a court asked to examine the decisionmaking process of the board should decline to interfere with the consummation and execution of an otherwise valid contract.
in my view,the vice chancellor unimpeachable factual findings preclude further judicial scrutiny of the ncs board business judgment that the hotly negotiated terms of its merger agreement were necessary in order to save the company from financial collapse,repay creditors and provide some benefits to ncs stockholders.
a concurring dissent is not a useful mechanism for restating the facts the vice chancellor found significant,particularly when the majority accepts those facts and a highly persuasive,compelling dissent,places them squarely in the correct perspective.what is far less clear to me is how the majority can adopt those facts and then conclude that the ncs board breached any fiduciary duty to ncs minority stockholders simply by endorsing a voting agreement between the majority stockholders that locked up a carefully negotiated and essential merger agreement with genesis.
in my opinion,delaware law mandates deference under the business judgment rule to a board of directors decision that is free from self interest,made with due care and in good faith.
under delaware law,the business judgment rule is the offspring of the fundamental principle,codified in a,that the business and affairs of a delaware corporation are managed by or under its board of directors the business judgment rule exists to protect and promote the full and free exercise of the managerial power granted to delaware directors 
importantly,smith van gorkom,correctly casts the focus on any court review of board action challenged for alleged breach of the fiduciary duty of care only upon the basis of the information then reasonably available to the directors and relevant to their decision though criticized particularly for the imposition of personal liability on directors for a breach of the duty of care,van gorkom still stands for the importance of recognizing the limited circumstances for court intervention and the importance of focusing on the timing of the decision attacked.
the majority concludes that unocal intermediate standard of review compels judicial interference to determine whether contract terms,that the majority refers to at various times as deal protection devices,defensive devices,defensive measures or structural safety devices,are preclusive and coercive.the majority conclusion substantially departs from both a common sense appraisal of the contextual landscape of this case and delaware case law applying the unocal standard.
in the factual context of this case,the ncs board had thoroughly canvassed the market in an attempt to find an acquirer,save the company,repay creditors and provide some financial benefit to stockholders.they did so in the face of silence,tepid interest to outright hostility from omnicare.the only bona fide,credible merger partner ncs could find during an exhaustive process was genesis,a company that had experienced less than desirable relations with omnicare in the past.small wonder ncs only viable merger partner made demands and concessions to acquire contract terms that enhanced assurance that the merger would close.the ncs board agreed to lock up the merger with contractual protection provisions in order to avoid the prospect of genesis walking away from the deal leaving ncs in the woefully undesirable position of negotiating with a company that had worked for months against ncs interests by negotiating with ncs creditors.those negotiations suggested no regard for ncs stockholders interests,and held out only the hope of structuring a purchase of ncs in a bankruptcy environment.
the contract terms that ncs board agreed to included no insidious,camouflaged side deals for the directors or the majority stockholders nor transparent provisions for entrenchment or control premiums.at the time the ncs board and the majority stockholders agreed to a voting lockup,the terms were the best reasonably available for all the stockholders,balanced against a genuine risk of no deal at all.the cost benefit analysis entered into by an independent committee of the board,approved by the full board and independently agreed to by the majority stockholders can not be second guessed by courts with no business expertise that would qualify them to substitute their judgment for that of a careful,selfless board or for majority stockholders who had the most significant economic stake in the outcome.
we should not encourage proscriptive rules that invalidate or render unenforceable precommitment strategies negotiated between two parties to a contract who will presumably,in the absence of conflicted interest,bargain intensely over every meaningful provision of a contract after a careful cost benefit analysis.where could this plain common sense approach be more wisely invoked than where a board,free of conflict,fully informed,supported by the equally holders of the largest economic interest in the transaction,reaches the conclusion that a voting lockup strategy is the best course to obtain the most benefit for all stockholders 
this fundamental principle of delaware law so eloquently put in the chief justice dissent,is particularly applicable here where the ncs board had no alternative if the company were to be saved.if attorneys counseling well motivated,careful,and boards can not be assured that their clients at the time but later less economically beneficial only because of,unforeseeable be respected by the courts,delaware law,and the courts that expound it,may well be questioned.i would not shame the ncs board,which acted in accordance with every fine instinct that we wish to encourage,by invalidating their action approving the genesis merger because they failed to insist upon a fiduciary out.i use shame here because the majority finds no breach of loyalty or care but nonetheless sanctions these directors for their failure to insist upon a fiduciary out as if those directors had no regard for the effect of their otherwise disinterested,careful decision on others the majority seeks to deter future boards from similar conduct by declaring that agreements negotiated under similar circumstances will be unenforceable.
delaware corporate citizens now face the prospect that in every circumstance,boards must obtain the highest price,even if that requires breaching a co
