the new orleans employees retirement system,the lead plaintiff in this class action,appeals from judge pauley grant of summary judgment dismissing its complaint alleging securities fraud in violation of section b,b,against omnicom group,and its managers.the district court held that appellant proffered no evidence sufficient to support a finding of loss causation.
for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
background 
given the procedural posture of this matter,an appeal from a grant of summary judgment dismissing a complaint,we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all ambiguities in its favor.colavito organ donor network,cir.
a the seneca transaction 
omnicom is a large global marketing and advertising holding company.around,omnicom began using its subsidiary,communicade,to invest in internet marketing and advertising companies.the value of the internet companies began to decline in.omnicom determined that these losses were not impairment s,and thus,a position that was reviewed without exception by arthur andersen.
during the first quarter of,omnicom entered into a transaction with pegasus partners ii,a delaware private equity firm,that created a new company,seneca,owned by both omnicom and pegasus.in a press release,omnicom and pegasus stated that the objective of the seneca transaction was to maximize consolidation and other strategic opportunities among companies in the currently depressed consulting and professional services marketplace.the seneca transaction involved omnicom transfer to seneca of million in cash and its communicade subsidiary,whose sole assets were the internet companies,and pegasus promise to transfer a total of million in cash,million up front and million when seneca requested it.omnicom received million in seneca preferred stock,while pegasus received all of seneca common stock.omnicom reported that it would incur no gain or loss from this transaction because it was exchanging the internet companies,purported to be worth million,and million in cash for preferred stock of equivalent value.
appellant alleges that the accounting for the seneca transaction was fraudulent,a claim we assume to be true,albeit one that is disputed.while omnicom auditors,it is claimed,viewed pegasus willingness to invest million in seneca as support for omnicom valuation of the internet companies at million,there is evidence that,despite the representations that pegasus would immediately transfer million to seneca,it instead transferred only to seneca,while transferring the million to a pegasus holding company.appellant argues that this fact,which was not disclosed to the market in any of the news articles that appellant relies on,raises doubts about omnicom valuation of the assets transferred to seneca.
appellant also claims that omnicom misrepresented the value of its seneca stock to its auditors at the end of.to conceal the decline in the value of seneca assets,omnicom is said to have arranged for seneca,rather than omnicom,to buy a technology license from live technology holdings,one of seneca investee companies.seneca would then sell the license to omnicom for million.the million would nearly offset seneca yearly losses.
b publicly available information about the seneca transaction 
several news articles at or near the time reported the seneca transaction and suggested that it was an attempt to move the internet companies,whose value was deteriorating,off omnicom books indeed,observers expressed these views well into however,omnicom stock never experienced any statistically significant drop in value at or near the time of these news reports.
on june,omnicom filed a form disclosing that robert callander,an outside director and chair of omnicom audit committee,had resigned from its board of directors on may.although the form did not disclose the reason for callander resignation,appellant argues that it was because of callander concern over the accounting of the seneca transaction.appellant relies on callander request for a review of the seneca transaction by a separate accounting firm,his handwritten notes on a copy of omnicom form,his request for seneca financial statements,questions he asked during audit committee meetings,and his request for advice regarding his responsibilities from a columbia business school professor.appellant also relies on the fact that callander resigned the same day that the board rejected his suggestion that the audit committee review omnicom proposal to reacquire two of the internet companies recently transferred to seneca.
on june,omnicom stock price declined as rumors circulated that the wall street journal would be publishing a negative article about accounting issues at omnicom.that same day,salomon smith barney issued a report noting an article circulated on which speculated that the wall street journal was set to break a potentially negative story about accounting issues at omnicom.joint app.at.however,the report also expressed the belief that callander resigned because his relationship with other board members had become increasingly strained and,noting that h ad callander complained about or disagreed with something in particular,omnicom would have had to disclose it.id.the next day,june,ubs warburg published a report stating that w e believe that callander resignation has more to do with fit than actual auditing improprieties,but note that the director who headed the audit committee has given fuel to concerns with auditing irregularity.id.at.
on june,the wall street journal published a short article in which it stated that callander quit the board after expressing concerns about the creation of an entity that houses omnicom internet assets,and,in particular,his unhapp iness with omnicom management limited disclosure to the audit committee about the entity that holds many of omnicom former internet assets.vanessa jesse eisinger,leading the news omnicom director quits due to entity concerns,wall,june,at.the article further suggested that callander left due to some broader corporate governance concerns,but quoted omnicom chairman as reassuring investors that there is no issue with seneca.id.
late on june,the financial times published an article describing omnicom investors enron concerns about disclosure.richard tomkins christopher grimes,omnicom shares wobble amid disclosure fears,fin.times,june.it acknowledged that there is no suggestion of impropriety,still less any breaking of the rules,but noted that,nonetheless,industry executives and analysts were still concerned with omnicom methods of calculating organic growth.id.the article also stated that investors were concerned with the seneca transaction,which the article stated had been described as a clever ploy and very skillful financial engineering,but the article stated that there is no suggestion of impropriety or.id.
on june,the wall street journal published the rumored article on omnicom that discussed callander resignation and the seneca transaction.vanessa jesse eisinger,unadvertised deals at an ad giant,nimble financing fuels rapid omnicom web stakes spark board controversy a question of impact of acquisitions,wall,june,at.the article stated that callander had resigned amid questions about how the company handled a series of soured internet investments,that h e questioned whether something was being disclosed to the board about the initial of the problematic investments and the proposal to buy two internet firms,that he had voiced doubts about seneca purpose for months,and that he had concerns that management had engaged in transactions without running it through the board.id.internal quotation marks omitted.in further discussing the seneca transaction,the article stated that it allowed the company to avoid the possibility of writing down the value of its investments in some of the online firms.id.it quoted omnicom ceo as saying that seneca was smart because instead of just walking away from these internet investments and taking a,we said we believe that pegasus,through seneca,could restructure the assets and make them valuable again.id.internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.
the article also quoted omnicom general counsel,who stated that he had told callander that the board had not approved seneca.id.this information was mistaken because the venture was called seneca then,so the word had shown up in automated searches of board minutes,even though the transaction had been approved.id.internal quotation marks omitted.furthermore,the june article referred to statements by two accounting professors,one who thought that seneca raises a red flag,and one who said,y ou really have to wonder where this fair value is coming from in this environment,in this area.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the june article also raised questions about omnicom general accounting practices.for example,the article stated that i n the wake of the collapse of enron,investors are demanding clearer and simpler financial statements from big companies,putting particular pressure on serial acquirers with tangled webs of deals.id.it noted that omnicom uses a more aggressive means than its competitors to calculate the critical statistic of how much of its growth it generates from existing operations.id.the article also claimed that t he clash over seneca between callander and management signals new concern about the financial side of the omnicom juggernaut.id.in addition,it suggested that omnicom may have a cash flow problem because if cash spent on acquisitions is subtracted,the company has a negative cash flow,further noting that omnicom has sharply increased its borrowing lately.id.finally,the june article discussed omnicom use of payments in its deal structures,stating that w ith such a high volume of acquisitions,omnicom obligations to make future payments amount to a substantial potential liability that omnicom does not carry on its balance sheet.id.
later that day,omnicom held a telephone conference to reassure investors.during the conference,omnicom ceo stated that there was no dissent among the board members,but acknowledged that callander reasons for resigning from the board were presented accurately as in the journal this morning.
a number of articles and analyst reports also responded to the june article,some of which suggested that the article raised questions about omnicom accounting practices.for example,a reuters article that day stated that omnicom was forced to play defense on wednesday amid questions about its accounting,and suggested that omnicom management credibility was harmed by the june article.adam pasick,update defends accounting as stock plunges,reuters,june.nonetheless,the article also noted that omnicom said callander resignation was the result of a misunderstanding that he was told,erroneously,that the board had not approved the creation of seneca when it sic fact it had.id.a new york times article on june also suggested that omnicom scrambled yesterday to repair damage caused by a newspaper article critical of its accounting practices.stuart elliott,omnicom shares tumble,times,june,at.similarly,an analyst report from lehman brothers on june,stated that i nvestors concerns focus on whether or not the assets should have been written down either at the time of the transaction or at the end of last year,yet it noted that yesterday wall street journal article did not bring up any substantial new issues.on june,a campaign article stated that t he questions now being asked are about whether the seneca deal was entirely at arm length,whether it was adequately disclosed and whether there might still be some lingering potential liabilities that might come back to haunt omnicom in the future.bob willott,omnicom could stand test of wsj allegations,campaign,june.
however,some analyst reports and news articles also indicated that the june article did not raise any new factual issues and suggested that the market negative reaction was due to the article negative tone and innuendo in the enron market.see,merrill lynch,flashnote,omnicom group good news no new news in wsj article,june,richard morgan,hatchet job,june,bear stearns,omnicom group buy follow up on wsj article,june,salomonsmithbarney,omnicom group omc comments on management meeting,june,salomonsmithbarney,omnicom group omc comments on wsj article,june,richard tomkins,omnicom slides on s p move to cut outlook,fin.times,june,ubs warburg,global equity research omnicom group omc,june.
in the two days following the june article,omnicom stock dropped over percent relative to trading prices and activity in the market and the industry.however,after omnicom announced that its new auditor,kpmg,reviewed the accounting for the seneca transaction and had not recommended any changes,omnicom stock increased substantially relative to the industry and the market.
c the present action 
on june,as omnicom closing price fell,appellant and other plaintiffs filed this action.on may,appellant filed an amended complaint,which appellees moved to dismiss.the district court granted appellees motion in part,dismissing claims involving omnicom organic growth calculations and its and liabilities,but denied the motion with regard to the seneca transaction.
the complaint made three allegations of fraud concerning the seneca transaction.first,it alleged that omnicom should have written down the value of the internet companies before engaging in the seneca transaction.second,it alleged that the accounting of the seneca transaction was fraudulent because omnicom failed to appropriately value the internet companies.third,it alleged that omnicom should have accounted for seneca losses after the seneca transaction occurred because omnicom controlled seneca.each allegation,therefore,focused on the loss in value of the internet companies and the failure to reflect that loss on omnicom books.
the class action complaint invoked the rebutable presumption of shareholder reliance established in basic,levinson,d.it alleged that omnicom was an actively traded company and that the market for its shares promptly reflected public information about the company.
in july,appellant moved to certify a class consisting of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired the securities of omnicom from february,through june,and who were damaged thereby.appellant br.at.the district court certified the class on april.
after extensive discovery and in response to appellees motion for summary judgment,appellant proffered,inter alia,a report of its expert witness,scott hakala.hakala prepared an event study analysis and was prepared to testify that the investing public initial reactions to the partially corrective disclosures in june were tied to the news of omnicom inappropriate accounting for investments in entities and not to other news during that time period.joint app.at.he claimed that i nvestors legitimately feared that omnicom transfers of its internet investments created the potential for losses and hidden liabilities had allowed omnicom to hide losses in the past.joint app.at.hakala also stated that 
t he declines from june to june,would not have occurred on those dates had defendants not previously engaged in the fraudulent scheme alleged by plaintiffs.the information revealed in that time period constituted a partial revelation of information about this scheme.

discussion 
a standard of review 
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo.lawrence cohn,cir.summary judgment is only appropriate if the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see also celotex catrett,d.an issue of fact is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby,d.in looking at the record,we constru e the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all inferences and resolv e all ambiguities in favor of the nonmoving party.doro sheet metal workers int l ass n,cir.nonetheless,summary judgment is appropriate where a defendant 
has moved for summary judgment on the ground that undisputed facts reveal that the plaintiff can not establish an essential element of the claim,on which element the plaintiff has the burden of proof,and the plaintiff has failed to come forth with evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable juror to return a verdict in his or her favor on that element 
burke jacoby,cir see also anderson,at.
b the section b claims 
to sustain a claim under section b,appellant must show i a material misrepresentation or omission ii scienter iii a connection with the purchase or sale of a security iv reliance by the plaintiff s v economic loss and vi loss causation.dura,broudo,d.the district court granted summary judgment on the ground that appellant failed to proffer sufficient evidence to show loss causation.
use of the term loss causation is occasionally confusing because it is often used to refer to three overlapping but somewhat different concepts.it may be used to refer to whether the particular plaintiff or plaintiff class relied is refutably presumed to have relied misrepresentation.atsi commc ns,shaar fund,cir.generally,however,courts use the term transaction causation to refer to this element.see,dura,at.emergent capital inv,llc stonepath group,cir like reliance,transaction causation refers to the causal link between the defendant misconduct and the plaintiff decision to buy or sell securities.
loss causation may also refer to the requirement that the wrong for which the action was brought is a cause or of the losses suffered,also a requirement for an actionable section b claim.dura,at.see also b in any private action arising under this chapter,the plaintiff shall have the burden of proving that the act or omission of the defendant alleged to violate this chapter caused the loss for which the plaintiff seeks to recover damages.in short,plaintiffs must show a sufficient connection between the fraudulent conduct and the losses suffered lattanzio deloitte touche llp,cir this requirement exists because private securities fraud actions are available,not to provide investors with broad insurance against market losses,but to protect them against those economic losses that misrepresentations actually cause.dura,at.
a third concept sometimes referred to as loss causation relates to the question whether events that are a of investor losses fall within the class of events from which section b was intended to protect the particular plaintiffs and which the securities laws were intended to prevent.this issue,one of proximate cause,was the subject of extended to say the least discussion in three opinions in ausa life ins.ernst young,cir.subsequently,we adopted the zone of risk test outlined in the dissenting opinion in ausa.see lentell merrill lynch,citing ausa,at,winter,dissenting.
to one degree or another,all three of these overlapping but somewhat differing issues are involved in the present matter.
with regard to reliance,appellant complaint invokes the presumption of reliance based on the theory adopted in basic,at.reliance of investors on misrepresentations is presumed where market for securities is open and developed.the complaint alleges active trading by omnicom in a highly efficient and automated market,omnicom provision of information to the public through sec filings and other means of disclosure,and scrutiny of available information by professional analysts who themselves communicate with the public.joint app.at.it further alleges that a s a result the market for omnicom securities promptly digested current information regarding omnicom from all publicly available sources and reflected such information in omnicom stock price.id.at.
having sought to establish investor reliance by the theory,appellant faces a difficult task.the fraud seneca transaction and failure to write down the value of the internet the subject of continuing media reports beginning in may.see supra notes.the stock price decline,which is the basis for the damages claim,occurred in june.in short,appellant must concede that the numerous public reports on the seneca transaction were promptly digested by the market and reflected in omnicom stock price in while seeking to recover for a stock price decline a year later in.
appellant seeks to do so through two means first,by claiming the existence of on the ground that the market reacted negatively to a corrective disclosure of the fraud,lentell,at and,second,by arguing the existence of proximate cause on the ground that negative investor inferences drawn from callander resignation and from the news stories in june caused the loss and were a foreseeable materialization of the risk concealed by the fraudulent statement.atsi,at cir citing lentell,at.establishing either theory as applicable would suffice to show loss causation.
corrective disclosure 
a fraud regarding a company financial condition in may,if concealed,may cause investors losses in june when disclosure of the fraud is made and the available public information regarding the company financial condition is corrected.see lentell,at acknowledging that loss causation can be established by a corrective disclosure to the market that reveal s the falsity of prior recommendations.appellant argues that information disclosed to the market in june,particularly by the june article,constituted a partial corrective disclosure of the fraud and that the disclosure caused the market to respond negatively.
to reiterate,the june article reported that callander,a director and chair of omnicom audit committee,had resigned amid questions he had raised for months regarding the purpose of the seneca transaction.callander was also reported to have questioned whether the board had received full information about the initial seneca transaction and about the new proposal to buy back two of the internet companies.the article also noted concerns,including those of accounting professors,about omnicom aggressive accounting strategy and about omnicom cash flow and increased borrowing.in opposing the motion for summary judgment,appellant offered the expert testimony of hakala regarding causation issues.
however,none of these matters even purported to reveal some fact with regard to the specific misrepresentations alleged in the complaint concerning the seneca transaction.see in re flag telecom holdings.sec,cir holding that plaintiffs evidence of news events and the expert event study did not provide sufficient evidence of causation.the use of the seneca transaction as an accounting method to remove losses from omnicom books was known to the market a year before callander resignation.see supra notes.there was no ambiguity in that regard in these articles.
all that the june article stated was that callander resignation was due to general concerns over an aggressive accounting strategy,including perhaps omnicom failure to the value of the internet companies,and other matters concerning governance,in particular management keeping the board informed.at best,from appellant viewpoint,it has shown that the market may have reacted as it did because of concerns that callander resignation and the negative tone of the june article implied accounting or other problems in addition to the known seneca transaction.
appellant also relies on comments in the june article by the two accounting professors to support a nexus between the fraud alleged and the june decline in share price.they argue that a reasonable jury could conclude that the professor found omnicom accounting suspicious in light of callander resignation and omnicom decision to unwind seneca,which were newly disclosed facts.appellant br.at.however,the conclusory suspicions of the accounting professors and the unwinding of the seneca transaction added nothing to the public knowledge that the seneca transaction was designed to remove losses from omnicom books 
what appellant has shown is a negative characterization of information.see teacher ret.of hunter,cir negative characterization of previously known information can not constitu
