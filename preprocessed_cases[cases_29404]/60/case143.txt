we have for review phillips corporate express office products,so d dca,which expressly and directly conflicts with sears termite pest control,arnold,so d dca.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.
this case involves the enforceability of noncompete agreements against former employees.corporate express office products,corporate express sought to enforce noncompete agreements against respondents edward goff,doug phillips,and lori farrell.the former employees raised as a defense that the noncompete agreements had been entered into with prior employers and not with corporate express.because one corporate acquisition by corporate express was initially accomplished through a percent stock purchase,as occurred in the conflict case of sears termite,and the other corporate acquisition occurred through a sale of assets,we explain the facts of each acquisition separately.
the first factual scenario involved employees phillips and farrell.in,phillips signed a noncompete agreement with his employer,bishop office furniture company bishop.in,farrell signed a noncompete agreement with bishop.neither agreement included an assignment clause.in,corporate express of the south,ces purchased percent of bishop stock.the stock purchase agreement between bishop and ces listed the noncompete agreements with phillips and farrell.ces operated the business under the bishop name until,when bishop was merged into ces.shortly thereafter,ces merged into corporate express of the east,cee.cee then changed its name to corporate express office products.
the second scenario began in when goff signed a noncompete agreement with his employer,ciera office products ciera.in,ciera sold its assets,including the noncompete agreement with goff,to ces.goff executed a consent to ciera assignment of his noncompete agreement to ces.goff did not execute any additional consents to assignment after ces merged with cee and then changed its name to corporate express.
like bishop and ciera,corporate express is engaged in the business of selling office furniture and business equipment.phillips,farrell,and goff remained continuously employed with ces from the time of the corporate acquisition through the merger into cee and the renaming of cee as corporate express.in,the employees terminated their employment with corporate express and joined a different employer,allegedly in violation of their noncompete agreements.
the terms of the noncompete agreements precluded the employees from competing against their employers or soliciting the employers customers for one year following the termination of employment.further,the agreements covered seven florida counties,which were the territories serviced by respondents.corporate express sued goff,phillips,and farrell and their new employer for unlawful use of trade secrets and breach of the noncompete agreements.corporate express sought a preliminary injunction to enforce the agreements.
the former employees asserted that because the noncompete agreements did not contain a clause authorizing assignment and were in fact never assigned to corporate express,the noncompete agreements could not be enforced.the former employees also argued that the agreements were unreasonable as to duration and geographic scope.the trial court found it undisputed that the series of changes that bishop and ciera underwent before ultimately becoming known as corporate express were mergers,not dissolutions.the court relied on sears termite,which held that because a percent stock purchase does not involve the dissolution of the corporate entity,a noncompete agreement is enforceable by the purchasing corporation without an assignment.based on sears termite,as well as goff consent to the assignment of his agreement to ces and a finding that the time and area restrictions in the agreements were reasonable,the trial court granted the preliminary injunction that provided in pertinent part 
defendants are enjoined from engaging in conduct that is in violation of the noncompete agreements that phillips,goff,and farrell entered into as set forth in part herein,and that is in violation of florida statutory and common law until further order of this court.
on appeal,phillips,farrell,and goff asserted that corporate express had no legal right to enforce the noncompete agreements because corporate express was not their employer when the agreements were made.see corporate express,so d at.the fifth district agreed,holding that the former employees noncompete agreements with ciera and bishop did not bind them to corporate express as the successor to their original employers.see id.at.acknowledging the trial court reliance on sears termite,the fifth district rejected its reasoning by explaining 
we understand how the trial court could be led astray by sears termite.we simply do not agree with the rationale of that case.the fact that after the change in ownership or stock sale or name change,liabilities or property rights are not changed,is irrelevant to the issue in this case.equally irrelevant to our analysis is the fact that one corporation is dissolved and a new entity created.
we focus instead on the reality that goff,phillips and farrell worked for ciera and bishop office furniture.those companies had a culture and mode of operation unique to themselves.corporate express had a culture and mode of operation different from bishop or ciera.both phillips and farrell signed agreements with bishop,in which bishop is referred to as the employer.goff agreement refers to his employer as ciera office products,or the employer.there is no language in any of the agreements indicating that the employee is agreeing to be bound to the employers successors or assigns.thus,because corporate express did not contract with any of the former employees for new agreements,it can not be considered the employer that is identified in the agreements and the authorizing statute.
corporate express,so d at emphasis supplied 
discussion 
the noncompete agreements between goff and ciera,and phillips and bishop,and the noncompete agreement between farrell and bishop,are governed by section,florida statutes,which states in pertinent part 
a o ne who is employed as an agent or employee may agree with his employer to refrain from carrying on or engaging in a similar business and from soliciting old customers of such employer within a reasonably limited time and area,so long as such employer continues to carry on a like business therein.said agreements may,in the discretion of a court of competent jurisdiction,be enforced by injunction.
this statutory provision applies to noncompete agreements entered into before july,at which time section was replaced by section,florida statutes supp.see ch,at,laws of section,florida statutes,specifically provides that the repeal of section does not affect restrictive covenants entered into before july.
the question in this case is whether the nature of the business transaction affects whether a consent to an assignment of a noncompete agreement is necessary either in the original agreement or in connection with the subsequent transactions the types of transactions relevant to this case are an asset sale,a percent stock sale,a merger,and a name change.
the fifth district held that regardless of the nature of the business transactions involved,corporate express could not enforce the noncompete agreements without a consent by the employees to assignment.see corporate express,so d at.in contrast,the first district in sears termite held that a consent to an assignment of the noncompete agreement was not required in a percent stock purchase by one corporation of another because the stock purchase did not result in a dissolution of the corporate entity.see so d at.
in addressing this conflict,we begin by reviewing schweiger hoch,so d dca,the case relied on by the fifth district.schweiger involved a noncompete agreement that had been entered into with a partnership.the subsequent withdrawal of a partner caused the dissolution of the original partnership and the creation of a new partnership.see id.at.under those factual circumstances,the fourth district held 
when the initial partnership was dissolved and the new one created,the defendant continued employment could not in itself be construed as sufficient knowledge and consent to conclude that the parties intended the original contract to be assigned or that the assignment was consented to or ratified by the defendant.
the contract not to compete was for the benefit of the employing firm and when the firm changed it was incumbent upon the new firm to then have a new contract not to compete entered into.naturally it would be the responsibility of the employee to then sign the contract or the employer could release him.it would not be the duty of the employee,when the firm was changed,to approach the employer and repudiate the contract which he had with the original employer.
id.at.this reasoning is consistent with the law of partnerships that recognizes that the withdrawal of a partner dissolves the partnership as a matter of law and a new partnership is formed.see.stat.stating that the dissolution of a partnership at will is caused by a partner giving notice of express will to withdraw as a partner fisher grady,so,a s a general rule,any change in the membership of a firm operates as a dissolution of the same and the formation of a new partnership.
similar to the partnership dissolution in schweiger,johnston dockside fueling of north america,so d dca,involved an effort by a new corporation to enforce a noncompete agreement entered into by a former employee and a dissolved corporation.the third district cited schweiger with approval and held that the employee continued employment with the new corporation was insufficient to constitute consent to the assignment.see id.at.
in strehlow legend equities,so d dca,the fourth district relied on schweiger and johnston in reversing a temporary injunction enforcing nonsolicitation clauses of the appellants sales representative contracts,signed in w hen they worked for a different company.id.at.the sales representatives had not consented to assignment of the contracts to the appellee corporation when it purchased the business with which the representatives had originally contracted.see id.at.unlike schweiger and johnston,the cases on which the fourth district relied,the opinion in strehlow does not reflect whether the corporation that originally entered into the contract was dissolved.
in the conflict case,sears termite,the first district reversed the denial of a temporary injunction sought against two former employees of all america termite and pest control after it was sold to sears in a percent stock sale.so d at.the first district held that the stock sale did not affect all america contractual rights and obligations,and a subsequent name change did not affect the corporate identity.thus,assignment of the employment contracts was unnecessary.see id.
we disagree with the fifth district conclusion that the reasoning of schweiger,a case involving partnerships,is applicable to other forms of commercial transactions without regard to the legal ramifications of the transaction.we begin with a discussion of the effect of a percent stock purchase on a corporation existence.unlike partnerships,a corporate entity is not dissolved by a change of ownership.see petersburg sheraton stuart,so d,dca ownership by one corporation of all the stock of another corporation does not destroy the identity of the latter as a distinct legal entity.in fact,a foundation of corporate law is that,unlike a partnership or a sole proprietorship,the existence of a corporate entity is not affected by changes in its ownership or changes in management.see cedric kushner promotions,king,d the corporate,a natural person,is distinct from the corporation itself,a legally different entity with different rights and responsibilities due to its different legal status.see also am.states ins.kelley,so d,dca the general rule is that corporations are legal entities separate and distinct from the persons comprising them.moreover,there is a clear distinction between the transfer of an asset of a corporation,such as a franchise agreement,and a transfer of the stock in a corporation itself.hawkins ford motor,so d.cruising world,westermeyer,so d,dca stating that a share of stock does not vest owner with any right or title to any of corporation property.with a stock purchase,the corporation whose stock is acquired continues in existence,even though there may be a change in its management.as explained in sears termite,the fact that there is a change in ownership of corporate stock does not affect the corporation existence or its contract rights,or its liabilities.so d at.
in contrast to a sale of corporate stock,in a sale of corporate assets the transaction introduces into the equation an entirely different entity,the acquiring business.the asset sale to that entity may include some or all of the corporate assets,and the transferred assets may include tangibles such as machinery and intangibles such as accounts receivable.see.stat.a corporation may sell,lease,exchange,or otherwise dispose of all,or substantially all,of its property.a corporation that sells its assets may continue in existence,may dissolve,or may merge with the entity that purchased its assets.see best towing recovery,beggs,so d,dca noting that pursuant to an agreement,a transfer of assets may immediately dissolve a corporation.
a corporation that acquires the assets of another business entity does not as a matter of law assume the liabilities of the prior business.see bernard kee,so d.in bernard,this court declined to impose product liability on a successor corporation that purchased the assets of the manufacturer of a defective product and continued the product line under the same trade name,but discontinued the allegedly defective model.see id.at.this court set out the generally accepted rule applicable to an asset purchase 
the vast majority of jurisdictions follow the traditional corporate law rule which does not impose the liabilities of the selling predecessor upon the buying successor company unless the successor expressly or impliedly assumes obligations of the predecessor,the transaction is a de facto merger,the successor is a mere continuation of the predecessor,or the transaction is a fraudulent effort to avoid liabilities of the predecessor.see sens slavia,so d fletcher,cyclopedia of the law of private corporations,perm.ed.note,products of transferee for defective products manufactured by transferor.
id.at.the court expressly adhere d to the traditional corporate law rule.id.at.
in an asset purchase,the liabilities and responsibilities of each party would be set forth in the parties agreement.see william meade fletcher et,fletcher cyclopedia of the law of private corporations,the general rule is that where one company sells or otherwise transfers all its assets to another company,the latter is not liable for the debts and liabilities of the transferor an express agreement,or one that can be implied,to assume the other company debts and obligations,is necessary.thus,when the sale of the assets includes a personal service contract that contains a noncompete agreement,the purchaser can enforce its terms only with the employee consent to an assignment.see,pino spanish broad.of,so d,dca holding that because contract containing covenant not to compete included a provision permitting assignment,the covenant was assignable and enforceable by business that bought assets of employee former employer 
we next address a corporate merger,which is also involved in this case.under longstanding precedent,on the date of a merger the surviving corporation becomes liable for the debts,contracts and torts of the former corporation.barnes liebig,so d.this principle is codified in section,florida statutes,which provides in pertinent part 
when a merger becomes effective 
a every other corporation party to the merger merges into the surviving corporation and the separate existence of every corporation except the surviving corporation ceases 
b the title to all real estate and other property,or any interest therein,owned by each corporation party to the merger is vested in the surviving corporation without reversion or impairment
