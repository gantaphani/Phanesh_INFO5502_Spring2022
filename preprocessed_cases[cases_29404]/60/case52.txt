this case involves the claims of a plaintiff class that believes the defendant corporation defrauded them.the class asserts that the corporation knew that it had flawed products,but in the face of that knowledge made false or misleading public statements about the products and about a pending merger.in addition,the plaintiffs charge,the individual defendants sold nearly million in company stock during the period covered by the class allegations.the district court dismissed the case on the pleadings with prejudice,concluding that the class complaint failed to raise the strong inference of scienter required by the private securities litigation reform act pslra and rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.the court also rejected the plaintiffs motion under.e to reconsider based on newly discovered evidence,and their related motion under.a to amend their complaint.
on appeal,the plaintiffs have limited themselves to three principal arguments first,that the district court abused its discretion by immediately dismissing their first consolidated complaint with prejudice rather than without prejudice,so that the plaintiffs could try again to submit a legally sufficient pleading second,that the court abused its discretion when it denied their motion for leave to amend their complaint and finally,that it abused its discretion by denying their motion under rule e to reconsider its dismissal.notably,the plaintiffs have not urged us directly to review the district court assessment of the legal sufficiency of their complaint,and so we do not have any issue before us that we review de novo and we need not again consider the standards for pleading a securities fraud case.instead,each of the rulings before us is one that lies within the district court discretion,and our review is deferential.with that in mind,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion,and we therefore affirm its judgment.
because factual detail is so important in pslra cases,we begin with an overview of the underlying events.we present the alleged facts in the light most favorable to the putative class,without vouching for them otherwise.guidant is a multinational corporation that develops,manufactures,and markets medical devices.among those devices are implantable cardioverter defibrillators icds and pacemakers that are used to monitor the heart and to deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities.the plaintiffs represent a putative class that was never certified of investors who purchased guidant stock between december,and october.
beginning in,guidant launched the ventak line of icds.in february,guidant discovered a design flaw in one model,the ventak prizm dr,after it received some reports of device failures.by april,it had addressed those flaws and begun producing a corrected version of the device.but it did not recall the defective products.instead,it continued selling its inventory of defective units without disclosing either to physicians or the public the design flaw or malfunctions that had led to device failures.guidant was aware of at least reports of device in the older units in circulation.
two years after guidant redesigned the prizm dr,in the spring and summer of,it entered into negotiations with johnson johnson j j for a possible merger.the two companies executed a confidentiality agreement as part of those early discussions.on december,the first day of the class period,guidant issued a press release containing highly positive news about growth prospects for its icd and pacemaker businesses.the release expressed guidant confidence about the continued worldwide growth of that market and guidant expected performance in it.this press release,the plaintiffs assert,was false and misleading,because guidant knew at the time that there were unresolved liability issues related to the defects in its devices,but the release was silent about this problem.in the week following the issuance of the december press release,guidant share price rose more than,from about to around.
an announcement of a merger agreement between guidant and j j followed soon afterwards,on december.the second release stated that j j was to acquire guidant for approximately billion in cash and stock this reflected an imputed price of per share for guidant stock.the december release touted the strength of the worldwide market for cardiovascular products.guidant and j j filed that release with the securities and exchange commission sec,as a form.according to the plaintiffs,guidant share price had jumped from to in anticipation of the merger announcement.this second release,however,was also silent about the liability risks that guidant faced from its defective products.
on three,january,and january,filed form with the sec to provide updated information to investors about the j j merger.those updates were just as silent as everything else had been about the problems with guidant icds.between the end of january and march,guidant issued other statements about the company performance and the merger.these statements too said nothing about the liability risks it faced.
sadly,those risks were realized when,on march,joshua oukrop died after his ventak prizm dr.guidant learned of oukrop death three days later,on march.it acknowledged to oukrop physician,barry marron,that the icd had and that it knew of other such cases.it also told marron that approximately icds similar to the one implanted in oukrop had been sold.when marron asked guidant whether the other recipients would be told of the defect,guidant said no,it did not want to alarm anyone.
true to its word,when guidant filed a preliminary proxy statement with the sec on march,it said nothing about the fact that one patient had recently died as a result of the malfunction of its product.the same omissions occurred in other sec filings and guidant press releases from march to july.on april,guidant shareholders approved the sale to j j at a price of per share.not until may,did guidant disclose in a letter to physicians that there were reported problems with its icd and pacemaker devices.that action was prompted by an article that the new york times was about to publish,revealing the full story of the flaws.guidant may letter informed the doctors that it had learned of the defects in,had fixed them in later devices,and did not recommend replacement of the defective devices because of the low risk of failure and the risk attendant to additional surgery.on may,guidant issued a press release to the same effect.
the food and drug administration fda issued a national recall for the guidant devices on june.guidant issued a physician communication and a press release on the same day.that press release disclosed that there had been reports of failure in the contak renewal and contak renewal defibrillators,out of approximately implanted worldwide,and two memory error incidents among its four models of avt defibrillators,out of about implanted worldwide.after the recall,guidant share price dropped immediately,falling to.that alone represented a loss of billion to guidant investors.further press statements downplaying the significance of the defects followed in june and july,while guidant share price dropped another.in october,j j announced that it was reconsidering the merger this announcement also hit guidant share price hard,dropping it in one day from to.j j began renegotiating the terms of the merger,but eventually another company,boston scientific,entered the bidding as well,and the latter firm ultimately agreed to buy guidant for about per share.that deal was finalized on april.guidant became and still is a wholly owned subsidiary of boston scientific.
in the wake of the fluctuations in guidant share price,which,over the class period,went from a low of about up to the high of paid by boston scientific,four class action suits were filed between june and august in the southern district of indiana where guidant is headquartered against guidant and eleven of its senior officers and directors we refer to the defendants collectively as guidant.these suits all alleged that guidant had made false statements in the j j merger documents,and in other press
