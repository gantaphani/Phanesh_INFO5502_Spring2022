background 
prior to,briggs was a company incorporated in new york.robert rosenstock,his father edward rosenstock,and robert genser genser were officers and directors of briggs and owned,respectively,approximately percent,percent,and percent of its outstanding stock.in january,robert rosenstock and genser decided to take briggs private in a merger they incorporated bac and planned to merge bac and briggs,buy out briggs minority shareholders,and make briggs the surviving corporation.rosenstock and genser contributed all of their briggs shares to bac.rosenstock purchased his father shares of briggs stock and contributed them to bac.as a result,bac owned percent of the stock of briggs,with rosenstock and genser owning all of the stock of bac.
briggs outlined a plan for a merger with bac in a january proxy statement to its shareholders.all shareholders would be bought out at per share.percent of the minority shareholders,including named plaintiffs,filed notices of election to dissent.a february special meeting approved the merger based solely on bac vote.at the meeting,plaintiffs voted their shares against the merger.the merger was nevertheless consummated on february,when rosenstock and genser became the sole holders of briggs shares,owning approximately percent and percent,respectively.
on may,plaintiffs brought an appraisal action against briggs in the supreme court of the state of new york,nassau county,to fix the fair value of their shares as dissenting shareholders briggs answered this action through counsel on july.plaintiffs also notified the state court of their intention to file a federal action and requested that their appraisal action be held in abeyance pending the final determination of their case in federal court.the state court did so on october.plaintiffs then commenced a federal action,asserting individual,class,and derivative claims for equitable and other relief,in an amended complaint dated july.they named robert rosenstock,genser,edward rosenstock,briggs,and bac as defendants.they alleged,inter alia,violations of the securities exchange act of,the new york business corporation law bcl,and fiduciary duties.they also brought derivative actions on behalf of briggs against robert rosenstock,genser,and edward rosenstock,for allegedly using corporate funds for personal expenses and diverting corporate opportunities to competing companies they owned.they requested that the class action be certified,the merger be set aside,the terms of the merger be reformed,the defendants account for the damages suffered by briggs and the profits and benefits enjoyed by the individual defendants by reason of their wrongful conduct,and the court give such other,further,and different relief as may be just,including damages,together with costs,disbursements and a reasonable fee for plaintiffs attorneys.defendants robert rosenstock,genser,and edward rosenstock answered this complaint on july,and briggs answered separately,also on july.briggs and the individual defendants were represented by different attorneys.
in an august,memorandum and order,the district court costantino,granted plaintiffs motion for class certification.grace rosenstock,no,grace i in january,finley,kumble,wagner,heine,underberg,manley casey finley kumble,the law firm that represented briggs,declared bankruptcy,leaving briggs without legal representation.michael rosen,the attorney for the individual defendants,determined that briggs and his clients had a conflict of interest,and he could therefore not represent briggs.briggs did not appear by counsel for the next five years.meanwhile,on january,an order of discontinuance was entered by the united states district court for the eastern district of new york costantino,because the court received a report stating that the action had been settled.grace rosenstock,grace ii.in fact,halperin rosenstock,an action brought by robert rosenstock sister and also briggs minority shareholders,had settled.this settlement inadvertently led judge costantino to close grace 
four years later,on march,plaintiffs moved to set aside the order of discontinuance and reopen grace on march,an order from the united states district court for the eastern district of new york raggi,held that grace i had been closed in error and reopened it.grace rosenstock,no,grace iii.plaintiffs then moved for a default judgment against briggs and bac on the issue of liability,and for an inquest after discovery to determine the amount of damages to be included in the judgment.michael rosen filed a motion to withdraw as counsel for defendants in june.genser obtained new counsel.briggs and rosenstock did not obtain new counsel.in,pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,default judgments were entered against briggs and bac,as neither corporation was represented by counsel.grace rosenstock,june,grace iv.
almost years later,in january,plaintiffs moved for leave to amend the complaint,which had been filed nearly nine years earlier,to assert additional claims against the defendants and add additional defendants,including movants.plaintiffs wanted to set aside as void the allegedly fraudulent transfers to bank leumi,david mack,leo berger,and apex marine corporation.plaintiffs alleged that briggs executed promissory notes and mortgages on real property in favor of berger and mack,in exchange for loans.neither party disputed that berger and mack paid out and loaned the full amount,but plaintiffs alleged that pursuant to robert rosenstock and genser instructions,berger and mack disbursed some of the money in the loans to rosenstock and genser individually.the district court levy,issued a memorandum and order on september,which denied permission to add new defendants and assert new claims.see grace rosenstock,grace v.judge levy reasoned that the new claims did not relate back to the original complaint,in part because they set forth a completely new set of operational facts.id.at.judge levy also denied plaintiffs arguments on equitable tolling and equitable estoppel,explaining,although plaintiffs complain that they did not learn of the alleged fraudulent conveyances until late,they clearly could have learned of the note and mortgage transactions earlier had they been more diligent in noticing depositions or seeking court intervention regarding discovery.id.at.
judge trager affirmed judge levy order in its entirety,grace rosenstock,grace vi,and on february,plaintiffs were denied leave to take an interlocutory appeal.on july,the parties attended a status conference before the district court wolle.according to plaintiffs,the only parties that were then appearing before judge wolle were the party of plaintiffs,plaintiff sic rosenstock,pro se and briggs leasing by rosenstock.plaintiffs entered into a stipulation of settlement dated july,as to their claims against defendants robert rosenstock and briggs.rosenstock,who according to plaintiffs was,executed the stipulation on behalf of himself for,and on behalf of briggs for.neither rosenstock nor briggs had legal representation.judge trager entered a judgment for these amounts against both rosenstock and briggs.grace rosenstock,grace vii.the judgment declared as moot the state court proceedings against both rosenstock and briggs.id.
after entry of the judgment,plaintiffs and genser consented to have all further proceedings,including entry of any judgment,conducted by a magistrate judge.the matter was referred to magistrate judge levy.following a bench trial,judge levy dismissed the claims against genser in their entirety.see grace rosenstock,d,grace viii.plaintiffs appealed from the dismissal of their claims and we affirmed the judgment on august.see grace rosenstock,cir grace ix.in that case,we affirmed,inter alia,the order denying leave to add claims and parties,issued by judge levy in grace v the order dismissing plaintiffs claims against genser,issued by judge levy in grace viii and judge levy denial of other arguments advanced by plaintiffs,including equitable estoppel and equitable tolling.id.at 
according to plaintiffs,writs of execution against briggs and rosenstock were returned unsatisfied.in august,plaintiffs commenced separate actions in the southern district of new york against briggs and movants,using the unsatisfied judgment as a predicate to bringing fraudulent conveyance claims against movants,under section of dcl.see cls dr cr.plaintiffs alleged that notes,guarantees,and mortgages on real property of briggs,given to movants between and,were made without fair consideration plaintiffs argued that movants helped robert rosenstock loot the corporation by giving the loans directly to robert rosenstock and other companies he owned.
on february,the first fraudulent conveyance action was transferred from the united stated district court for the southern district of new york berman,to the united stated district court for the eastern district of new york.grace bank leumi trust,dist.lexis at grace x.this had the effect of transferring the second action for fraudulent conveyance.id.at.judge berman reasoned that the proper venue was the eastern district,the alleged fraudulent conveyances involved real property located in the eastern district,the transfer promoted efficiency,and plaintiffs choice of forum was entitled to little weight.he also called the plaintiffs choice of forum an attempt at judge shopping.id.at.
in october,movants had written to judge trager to request a conference,explaining that they intended to file a motion to vacate the judgment.in,movants filed motions to vacate.the district court then issued a memorandum and order,which addressed movants arguments for vacating the judgment.grace rosenstock,grace xi.these reasons included the following briggs was not represented by counsel when the settlement was entered robert rosenstock lacked power to confess judgment against briggs the amount of the default judgment against briggs exceeded the relief sought against briggs in the original complaint and the class was not notified of the settlement and a fairness hearing was not held.see id.at.
judge trager vacated the judgment as void under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.he explained that it is law that a corporation may appear in the federal courts only through licensed counsel damages for a default judgment should not be awarded without a hearing or a demonstration by affidavits establishing the facts no inquest was held because the stipulation was the basis for entry of judgment against briggs rescissory damages are not available for mergers the amount was both excessive and different in kind from that sought in the complaint and there was evidence of collusion between rosenstock and plaintiffs to the detriment of movants.grace xi,at.judge trager concluded,i n any event,movants should not be required to suffer further legal costs to bring a summary judgment motion,while plaintiffs press forward with a litigation fraught with procedural errors and excessive,if not completely meritless,claims.id.at.he then dismissed the two fraudulent conveyance actions,because there was no longer a judgment on which to collect.grace bank leumi,grace xii grace schwartz,grace xiii.
plaintiffs filed an appeal to this court on november.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction over the appeals of grace xi,grace xii,and grace xiii based on,the notices of appeal having been filed on november.the district court had jurisdiction over grace xi under,as it was an action arising under federal law.jurisdiction in grace xii and grace xiii was based on rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,because they concerned the collection of a federal judgment.see epperson entm t express,cir.
ii.standard of review 
federal rule of civil procedure b decisions by district courts are accorded deference.we reverse only where there has been an abuse of discretion.see lawrence wink in re lawrence,cir nemaizer baker,cir 
iii.standing 
rule b states,in part,that a court may relieve a party or a party legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding.b.here,movants are neither parties nor a party legal representatives.however,we observed in lawrence,at 
several circuit courts have permitted a to bring a rule b motion or a direct appeal when its interests are strongly affected,and we have permitted such a motion on at least one occasion.see dunlop pan am.world airways,cir plaintiffs had standing to invoke rule b to amend a federal judgment,where they were sufficiently connected and identified with the suit.
alternation in original.in dunlop,movants were precluded from bringing an age discrimination action because of a prior judgment to which they were not a party,but which nonetheless restricted their litigation options.we held that on the facts of this case appellants were sufficiently connected and identified with the secretary suit to entitle them to standing to invoke rule b.at.while we limited our holding in dunlop to the facts of that case,which are clearly distinguishable from the facts here,we rested our decision on the principles governing standing,which,given the facts of dunlop,were sufficiently flexible to permit a finding of standing.id.at.
finding that movants here were sufficiently connected and identified with the settlement is also in keeping with the principles governing standing.see dunlop,at.both plaintiffs and movants concur that the purpose of the stipulation was to collect money from movants.plaintiffs argue that they laid out their strategy to obtain a judgment against briggs in order to pursue collection of that judgment by recapturing the fraudulent conveyances from movants.this is evidenced not only by their own admissions,but also by the fact that briggs was and not represented by counsel at the time of the default judgment on liability.
today,as in dunlop,we limit our decision to the facts of this case,and hold that where plaintiffs enter into a settlement agreement with a,pro se defendant with the intent at the time of the settlement to collect from a third party that allegedly received fraudulent conveyances,and further,they attempt to use the judgment as a predicate for a fraudulent conveyance action against the third party,the third party is strongly affected by the judgment and entitled to standing to bring a rule b motion.see lawrence,at.this decision does not mean that similarly situated plaintiffs must automatically defend their judgments from transferees.rather,if a plaintiff holds a judgment on liability against a pro se defendant and hopes to use the judgment as a predicate for a fraudulent conveyance claim,she need only carry out a judicially supervised inquest to protect her judgment.
to prevail on a claim under dcl,a plaintiff must establish that the conveyance was made without fair consideration that the conveyor is a defendant in an action for money damages or that a judgment in such action has been docketed against him and that the defendant has failed to satisfy the judgment.see cls dr cr.it is not the judgment itself that plaintiffs collect from transferees.therefore,the unsatisfied judgment,while a necessary predicate to bringing a dcl case,is not a sword that can be directly turned upon transferees.the proper remedy in a fraudulent conveyance claim is to rescind,or set aside,the allegedly fraudulent transfer,and cause the transferee to return the transferred property to the transferor.geren quantum chem.the purpose of such an action is to force the debtor to recover property transferred for inadequate consideration so that the property can be used to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor.id.at.the creditor remedy is limited to reaching the property which would have been available to satisfy the judgment had there been no conveyance,and requiring that it be restored to the debtor possession.id.internal quotations and citations omitted.
one underlying purpose of dcl to prevent defendants from liquidating their assets in contemplation of an adverse judgment would be undermined if third parties could routinely attack judgments to which they were not a party.it could add additional and potentially onerous steps to plaintiffs litigation before they could collect on a judgment.for instance,in a hypothetical lawsuit in which defendants are,some plaintiffs might pursue dcl claims against a transferee.if the hypothetical plaintiffs judgment were vacated under rule b,a possible due process violation could be visited upon the absent plaintiffs.here,as judge trager correctly acknowledged,the judgment has no res judicata or collateral estoppel effect on movants.it does,however,have res judicata effects on any plaintiffs or class members who are not a party to the fraudulent conveyance lawsuit.
in this case,however,there is a strong possibility that the predicate judgment that forms the basis of this fraudulent conveyance action is the result of a settlement process devoid of due process protections and marred by serious procedural shortcomings.there is the appearance that plaintiffs and defendants entered settlement negotiations with the mutual intent of laying the burden of compensating plaintiffs squarely on movants.should the fraudulent conveyance claims be heard on the merits,the trial court could choose not to look behind the judgment for any improprieties.we thus carve out an exceedingly narrow exception to the rule that litigants,who were neither a party,nor a party legal representative to a judgment,lack standing to question a judgment under rule b.
iv.timeliness 
this circuit will not examine the merits of a judgment if the motion to set it aside was untimely.see state bank trust inversiones errazuriz limitada,cir.as judge trager explained,rule b motions brought pursuant to b,b,or b must be made not more than one year after the entry of judgment.grace xi,at accord.b.movants could not seek to vacate it under these first three clauses and therefore do not allege or argue mistake,newly discovered evidence,fraud,or misrepresentation.they instead rely on rule b,the judgment is void,and rule b,any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment,which do not have a time limit.see.b.
plaintiffs argue that movants rule b motion is approximately nine years too late,because their collateral attack on the appeal to the second circuit demonstrates they could have made this motion then.plaintiffs br.at.putting aside for a moment the fact that this subverts plaintiffs opposition to movants standing,plaintiffs also contend that movants resisted being made parties to this suit,deliberately decided not to from the final order,and deliberately chose to wait for over five years before bringing a rule b motion.plaintiffs br.at.plaintiffs argue that movants should have paid greater attention to a january,letter,from plaintiffs to judge trager,which argued,inter alia,that under controlling second circuit authorities,the statute of limitations for dcl transfers in fraud of creditors does not begin to run until the defendants fail to satisfy the judgment that plaintiffs would go to trial to obtain a judgment that was allegedly worthless because briggs was only an empty shell and that the mortgages were not issued for fair consideration and were therefore fraudulent.see plaintiffs br.at.therefore,plaintiffs argue that they clearly laid out their strategy to obtain a judgment against briggs in order to pursue collection of that judgment by recapturing the fraudulent conveyances from the,bank leumi,mack,berger and apex marine plaintiffs br.at.
movants collaterally attacked the judgment during plaintiffs appeal.they did so to avoid being joined as defendants in this litigation.they were not parties to this case,money was not being collected from them,and they chose this strategy among the several legal options available to them.and,they were successful.the district court agreed with their collateral attack,and they successfully avoided being joined as defendants.see grace further,the courts below,and this court on appeal,uniformly denied plaintiffs attempts to bring fraudulent conveyance actions against movants.see grace v grace vi grace ix.therefore,it would have been a act if movants having been kept out of litigation had injected themselves in the case in order to attack a judgment that did not then affect them.
a rule b motion must be made within a reasonable time after entry of the judgment.b.courts have been exceedingly lenient in defining the term reasonable time,with regard to voidness challenges.in fact,it has been that,for all intents and purposes,a motion to vacate a default judgment as void may be made at any time.state bank,at quoting beller keller tyler,cir.in our decision in central vermont public service,the rule b motion was not untimely although the movant had waited more than four years to bring its motion,and did so when prompted by a suit at.we held in state street bank,where a party has previously filed a motion to vacate a default judgment that failed to raise a voidness argument and subsequently advances such an argument in a rule b motion more than a year after the entry of the default judgment,the rule b motion should be denied as untimely.at 
judge trager distinguished the movants here from those in beller keller,as the movants here had not filed any previous appeal or motion to vacate.he reasoned 
regardless of whether or not they theoretically had the option of doing so,they have provided a simple explanation for their actions they waited until plaintiffs had actually sued them under dcl.taking into account this lenient standard,the motion was filed within a reasonable time,namely,shortly after the commencement of the actions for fraudulent conveyances.
grace xi,at.judge trager observation was especially appropriate considering that the allegedly fraudulent transactions occurred nearly fifteen years earlier.
in a typical case,five years from the judgment to a rule b motion would be considered too long by many courts.this case,however,is anything but typical.plaintiffs created significant delay by bringing a fraudulent conveyance claim more than fifteen years after the conveyances were alleged to have been made,and five years after the judgment that they could not satisfy.plaintiffs argument that movants have waited too long,when movants brought this motion only weeks after plaintiffs filed this lawsuit,is unpersuasive.in this case,we are interested less in the number of years from the time of judgment,than we are in what has happened in between.it was well within judge trager discretion to determine that the rule b motion was timely,because being directly sued provides good cause.
v.the judgment is void under rule b 
movants contend that the judgment here is void for several reasons a the default judgment was entered without any evidentiary hearings,detailed affidavits,or documentary evidence having been presented to the district court b a corporation can not appear pro se in federal court c ther
