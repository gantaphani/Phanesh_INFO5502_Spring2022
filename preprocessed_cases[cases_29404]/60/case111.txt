sbc challenges a federal communications commission order finding that sbc through various affiliates violated the terms of a requirement,imposed as a condition to the fcc approval of a merger between sbc and ameritech,that sbc offer intervenors and core access to shared transport for intralata toll call traffic.because the fcc failed to address the questions whether telecommunications carriers could waive their right to shared transport under the merger order and whether and core had in fact waived that right,we vacate the commission order and remand to the commission for further proceedings.
under the telecommunications act of,pub,stat,codified at et the act,incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs are required to allow new entrants,known as competitive local exchange carriers clecs,to lease unbundled network elements unes for use by the clecs in providing telephone service.see c.the terms and conditions of this obligation to unbundle are set forth in interconnection agreements icas negotiated between the ilec and clec or,if necessary,arbitrated by state commissions.id.at a,b.the parties must submit any interconnection agreement to the relevant state commission for approval.id.at e.where an ilec provides a network element to one clec under a agreement it must make that element available to any other requesting.at i.the act also makes clear that ilecs and clecs may enter icas that differ from the unbundling requirements of b or c.see id.at a.
the fcc has determined that the network elements subject to the unbundling requirements include shared transport facilities.see in the matter of implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,wl,fcc rcd.shared transport is defined as the transmission facilities shared by more than one carrier,including the incumbent lec,between end office switches,between end office switches and tandem switches,and between tandem switches in the incumbent lec network.d i c.
the merger required fcc approval,to be granted only if the commission found that the attendant license transfers would serve the public interest,convenience,and necessity.d.the commission approved the merger subject to conditions aimed at mitigating certain potential anticompetitive effects.see in re applications of ameritech and sbc communications,wl,fcc rcd merger order,vacated in part on other grounds,ass of communications entrs.fcc.among these was the requirement that sbc and appropriate affiliates offer shared transport access to clecs in the states formerly served by ameritech,a condition imposed in response to ameritech prior reluctance to offer unbundled access to shared transport services.see merger order,fcc rcd at.specifically,that condition provided 
within months of the merger closing date but subject to state commission approval and the terms of any future commission orders regarding the obligation to provide unbundled local switching and shared transport,shall offer shared transport in the service area within the ameritech states under terms and conditions,other than rate structure and price,that are substantially similar to or more favorable than the most favorable terms offers to telecommunications carriers in texas as of august.subject to state commission approval and the terms of any future commission orders regarding the obligation to provide unbundled local switching and shared transport,shall continue to make this offer,at a minimum,until the earlier of i the date the commission issues a final order in its une remand proceeding finding that shared transport is not required to be provided by in the relevant geographic area,or ii the date of a final,judicial decision providing that shared transport is not required to be provided by in the relevant geographic area.
merger order,fcc rcd at,app.c emphasis added.
sbc interpreted the merger order to require that it provide shared transport in the former ameritech,indiana,michigan,ohio and for local exchange service,not for intralata toll service.latas local access and transport areas are service areas within which the bell operating companies were permitted to operate and provide telephone service.see united states western.intralata service is what consumers generally know as local service intralata toll calls,however,encompass those calls that do not travel beyond the borders of a single lata.see sbc communications fcc.
the commission initiated a proceeding with a notice of apparent liability,and went on to find that sbc had failed to offer shared transport for intralata toll service in the five former ameritech states,and that this failure violated of the merger conditions.in the matter of sbc communications,wl,fcc rcd,forfeiture order.as authorized by b b and b,b,the commission imposed on sbc the statutory maximum fine of million for each of the five states,for a total of million.see forfeiture order,fcc rcd at.sbc petitioned for review,and we upheld the commission.sbc communications,fcc,sbc i.
in august two clecs,communications and corecomm communications,filed a joint complaint with the fcc under,alleging that nine sbc affiliates had improperly refused to allow them to use shared transport to complete intralata toll calls in violation of the act,the fcc implementing rules,and the merger order.
with regard to eight states outside the former ameritech region the fcc denied the complaint.in the matter of core communications,et sbc communications et,wl,fcc rcd,liability order.for seven states the matter turned on circumstances of no great relevance here.as to california,the commission found no violation because core was irrelevant because it had no agreement with pacific bell and never attempted to negotiate one had voluntarily exercised its right under i to to an existing ica that did not permit the use of shared transport for intralata toll traffic.id.at.notwithstanding sbc obligation to make shared transport access available for intralata toll traffic under c and the commission rules,see id.at,the commission found no violation because the obligations created by section and our rules are effectuated through the process established in section is,by reaching agreement through negotiation,arbitration,or,and in california had sought to negotiate an amendment to the in this respect narrower ica without,as required,comply ing with the modification or change of law provisions in the ica,id.
the fcc granted the complaint,however,with respect to the five states in the former ameritech region.paragraph of the merger order obligated sbc to offer shared transport for intralata toll.the commission appeared to assume incorrectly that sbc conduct in relation to core and rested on icas antedating the merger order 
to the extent that sbc existing agreements with the complainants did not make available shared transport for intralata toll,the merger order required sbc to agree to the necessary amendments to do so.when core and asked for this functionality,however,sbc just said no.
id.at,emphasis added.although under section a,parties are free to negotiate terms that do not meet the requirements of sections b and c,id.at,the commission held that e ven if sections and did not obligate defendants to amend their agreements with core and to provide for shared transport for intralata toll traffic,the merger order did.id.the commission reasoned that sbc contrary view would run entirely counter to the basic purpose of the paragraph condition,id.at,because carriers who had been denied shared transport previously under icas antedating the merger order would be unable to amend their agreements to take advantage of a merger condition specifically designed to remedy the situation,id.at.
although the commission assumed that sbc was standing on order icas,sbc points out that and core had entered into or amended icas with sbc after the merger that did not provide for shared transport for intralata toll.according to sbc submissions that appear uncontradicted,in illinois had to the illinois base agreement,which did not provide this functionality that agreement was approved by the relevant illinois commission on august,long after issuance of the merger order on october.see decl.o
