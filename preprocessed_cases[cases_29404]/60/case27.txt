the background of this case is the classic corporate love story.company a meets company b.they are attracted to each other and after a brief courtship,they merge.investor c,hoping that the two companies will be fruitful and multiply,agrees to pay million for the wedding.nine months later,however,things begin to fall apart and the combined entity declares bankruptcy.investor c feels misled.he believes that company a knew that there were problems with company b but that it made the oft repeated mistake of thinking that it would be able to change company b for the better.investor c files suit in the district court and after his complaint is dismissed,we find ourselves here.it is an old story but it never fails to elicit a tear.
in this case,appellants gsc partners cdo fund,gsc partners cdo fund.ii,and gsc recovery ii,the plaintiffs appeal the district court dismissal of their action against individual officers and directors of washington group international,washington and credit suisse first boston corporation csfb.the plaintiffs filed this action under section b,rule of the securities exchange act of the act,alleging that their purchase from csfb of million in notes,which washington used to finance its acquisition of raytheon engineers constructors international,rec,was carried out pursuant to defendants allegedly false and misleading offering circular.because the plaintiffs failed to meet the heightened pleading requirements of the act,we affirm the district court grant of defendants motion to dismiss.
washington is an international engineering and construction firm that,in,employed approximately workers and brought in approximately billion in annual revenue app.at.defendants dennis washington,hanks,zarges,cleberg,batchelder,judd,miller,parkinson,payne,and roach were officers directors of washington during the acquisition process.app.at cplt.
washington representatives commenced negotiations during the summer of for the acquisition of rec,the engineering and construction division of raytheon company.app.at cplt.after conducting an initial examination of rec financial information,washington submitted a offer of between and million for the business operations of rec,subject to its findings in due diligence.app.at cplt.raytheon accepted this offer in september.id.at.before finalizing the deal,washington began its due diligence process,which entailed thorough scrutiny of rec financial statements and projections.id.in this process,it received assistance from arthur andersen,id.at.meanwhile,the parties began negotiating a definitive agreement for the acquisition.id.at.to augment this process,washington employed defendant csfb to act as its financial advisor for the rec purchase.id.at.csfb conducted its own due diligence and had access to all of washington due diligence findings as well.id.at.throughout the due diligence process,the two companies communicated their findings and concerns to each other.id.
on october,after one month of interviews,document reviews and project site visits,washington management reported to the washington board its findings regarding the accuracy of rec financial information.app.at cplt.the team was impressed with the s trong,capable management team in place and with rec solid position in the independent power producer ipp market,as well as in the rail,power,chemicals,metals pharmaceutical,pulp and paper,chemical demilitarization,refinery and heavy maintenance markets.app.at.the team also noted that the personnel it worked with had been cooperative and forthcoming.id.at.
the due diligence team expressed some concerns as well.it cited as among rec general weaknesses its aggressive and optimistic plans for sales volume and profit growth in certain businesses,the volatility of the company working capital,the possible lack of accounting integrity of its unaudited financial statements and its u nderstated or undisclosed liabilities.id.at.in particular,the team calculated that the profit projections for some of the construction projects were inaccurate.for example,the team revised estimated profit projections for the pine bluff project from million to million,for the sadaf project from million to million and for the hudson bergen project from million to million.id.at.at the same time,however,washington noted,that w ider leverage of proprietary technology could improve some of the projects deteriorating margins,and that o perational synergies offer an upside to a combined new company.id.at.
on november,defendant zarges sent a memorandum to other members of the washington management,elaborating on some of the perceived inaccuracies in the project profit estimates but projecting that if the acquisition went through,even taking into account the risks,the combined entity could perform well in the engineering and construction industry.app.at.zarges first emphasized that the findings in the october board presentation were not conclusive.id.he wrote that,although the umatilla and pine bluff projects had been presented as breakeven projects through,they were at the time of the memo in loss positions with deteriorating performance trends.app.at.the memorandum reiterated concerns about raytheon aggressive plans and optimistic positions on most projects,reporting inconsistencies and shaky performance history.id.at.zarges concluded,however,that the projected operating fee in could,taking into account washington adjustments to rec calculations,provide an margin of on adjusted revenues.app.at.he added,this represents quite an improvement over recent performance histories and is no easy task.id.
a month later,on december,defendant hanks sent a memorandum to the board on the progress of the due diligence team.app.at.he reported that in order to address washington concerns about the accuracy of rec financial statements,washington had hired pricewaterhousecoopers,independent accountants,to audit the financial statements for,and,and to review the financial statement for.app.at.these audited financial statements required million of adjustments to bring them into compliance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap.id.hanks stipulated that in order to remedy the discrepancies,it would be necessary to arrange for an increase in liabilities assumed by raytheon of up to million.id.
the washington board met on march,to consider the progress of the due diligence team.app.at.the team again reported some concerns about rec financial health,but also expressed confidence that a partnership with washington would improve rec position,having actually experienced what it takes to turn a company around.app.at.the team reported risks involved in the acquisition of rec,citing historical performance that was characterized by large loss projects.id.at.the team revised the projected profit for the umatilla project downward to loss,best case,an adjustment of million from rec estimate.app.at.it also adjusted the projected profit for the pine bluff project from breakeven to a million loss.id.rec had p oor financial practices,and the team suspected that there may have been inadequate restructuring reserves in the hague and in houston.id.at.the due diligence team also revised rec projected ebitda earnings before interest,taxes,depreciation and amortization for the year,from million to million,assuming that the combined company would be indemnified by raytheon against any downside from umatilla and pine bluff and that it would incur of the million of vulnerabilities identified in the due diligence report.id.at.
in addition,the due diligence team had encountered practical difficulties in completing the due diligence.defendant hanks recorded in his notes and reported to the board that the due diligence and negotiation process has been a difficult procedural rules limited our opportunities for open and candid discussions with management,limited our ability to see company offices and projects and raytheon has not been cooperative with washington group attempts to reconcile the discrepancies between financial and operational reports and other comparative data.app.at.these limitations led hanks to suspect that raytheon was hiding serious business issues and problems.id.the same concern had been recorded in the november memorandum,which noted that the team has been concerned about the abrupt limits of the due diligence process and data.with weeks to evaluate data,the diligence was restricted to selected projects and issues.app.at.
hanks also recorded in his presentation notes some high points disclosed by the due diligence process.he wrote,raytheon power group is poised to benefit greatly from the surge in demand for new power,and expressed confidence that t he combination of mk contractors unit with raytheon infrastructure business would create the most experienced and powerful provider of design and build services in the infrastructure market today.id.at.in addition,t he combination of mk industrial process unit with raytheon industrial unit affords synergetic opportunities and a greatly improved client base.id.at.he reported that the due diligence team was not in complete agreement as to the value of rec.id.at.he highlighted some points on which they all agreed,however,including that t he strengths of the strengths of raytheon are complementary and that the markets that the combined will serve going forward are the fastest growing segments of the industry.id.at.his notes concluded by suggesting that washington should pursue the acquisition.id.
zarges april memorandum was more positive about the team access to data,reporting that the recent site visits were more informative.app.at.having been given more access to data,the team had been able to update its calculations about profit from operations.its findings did confirm some losses.in large part due to the lower profitability of the damshead creek and san roque projects,the team reduced its estimate of rec operating fee from million to million.id.at.a further memorandum dated july disclosed that for certain projects,the total mac material adverse changes liabilities was million.app.at.
it appears that throughout the due diligence process,the due diligence team and the washington board communicated regularly and frankly about their assessment of rec strengths and weaknesses.at no point in this process did the washington management express the conviction that the acquisition would prove a failure.in fact,the management team took steps to remedy the weaknesses it pinpointed by renegotiating the purchase so as to avoid acquisition of liabilities and risky projects.app.at.
on april,washington entered into a stock purchase agreement with raytheon and rec.id.the agreement specified that the purchase price,which was to be based on the april,balance sheet,would be approximately and million less than washington initial offer.id.washington would acquire the engineering,design,procurement,construction,operation and maintenance business of rec,as well as the capital stock of certain rec subsidiaries.app.at cplt.the purchase price reflected the exclusion of the four most significant rec loss projects,for which raytheon had agreed to retain liability.id.at cplt.raytheon also agreed to retain specified assets of rec and to indemnify washington for specified liabilities of rec and its subsidiaries.app.at.later,washington was able to get raytheon to retain partial liability for the umatilla project as well,which washington had predicted was in a position to show a loss of million.see.discussed supra at.
on july,washington acquisition of rec closed.app.at cplt.the acquisition was primarily financed through the million note offering,sold pursuant to a confidential offering circular dated june.id.at.the offering circular included certain audited financial statements as well as unaudited financial statements for the first quarter of and the first quarter of.app.defendant csfb was one of the lead underwriters and initial purchasers of the notes.app.at cplt.it purchased million in principal amount of the notes,then offered and resold some of those notes to the petitioners,who purchased million face amount of notes.id.cplt.
on october,washington form filing announced that as a result of a comprehensive review of rec existing contracts,washington reduced rec net assets relating to contracts in the preliminary purchase price by approximately million and had made reductions in net contract assets in the preliminary purchase price allocation of approximately million.app.at cplt.washington also disclosed that it had to record approximately billion in goodwill.id.in a press release dated march,washington disclosed that s everal rec projects had serious undisclosed problems and were in trouble before it acquired.at cplt.it noted that as of september,washington had reduced rec assets and increased its liabilities by approximately million from the amounts originally estimated.app.at cplt.on march,washington form filing indicated that rec financial statements referred to in the circular should not be relied upon.id.at.
on may,washington and some of its subsidiaries filed petitions in bankruptcy in the bankruptcy court in nevada for relief pursuant to chapter of the bankruptcy code.id.at cplt.washington also filed a complaint in a idaho state court against raytheon alleging fraudulent inducement,fraud and misrepresentation,requesting rescission or specific performance.app.at.that suit was apparently settled in november,and is under a confidentiality restriction.pl.br.at.plaintiffs commenced this action alleging violation of federal and state securities laws.id.at.in january,the defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs amended complaint.although no formal discovery had taken place in the civil action,the plaintiffs were able to obtain access through washington bankruptcy to documents discussed in the instant opinion.the district court granted the defendants motion,holding that the complaint failed to state a cause of action for securities fraud.app.at.this appeal followed.
we exercise plenary review over the district court decision to grant the defendants motions to dismiss.see broselow fisher,cir.we also exercise plenary review over the district court interpretation of federal securities laws.see oran stafford,cir in re westinghouse sec,cir.we accept all allegations in the plaintiffs complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.see oran,at.a court may look beyond the complaint to extrinsic documents when the plaintiffs claims are based on those documents.see in re burlington coat factory sec,cir.a court may not dismiss the complaint unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiffs can prove no set of facts in support of their claims that would entitle them to relief.see in re rockefeller ctr.sec,cir.
the plaintiffs allege a violation under section b of the securities exchange act and rule under it.in order to state a claim under rule,plaintiffs must allege with particularity that defendants made a misstatement or omission of material fact with scienter in connection with the purchase or the sale of a security upon which the plaintiffs reasonably relied and the plaintiffs reliance was the proximate cause of their injury.semerenko cendant,cir see also in re westinghouse,at.
the plaintiffs securities fraud claim is also subject to heightened pleading requirements.under federal rule of civil procedure b,i n all averments of fraud,the circumstances constituting fraud shall be stated with particularity.malice,intent,knowledge,and other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally.b.this particularity requirement is rigorously applied in securities fraud cases.burlington,at.the private securities litigation reform act pslra,imposes another layer of factual particularity to allegations of securities fraud.in re rockefeller,at.if a complaint fails to comply with the pslra pleading requirements,dismissal is mandatory.b a.the pslra requires the complaint to specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.b.
with regard to the scienter component of the claim,the critical issue before this court,the pslra further requires the plaintiffs,with respect to each act or omission,to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b.this particularity requirement supersedes rule b provision allowing state of mind to be averred generally.see in re nahc.sec,cir citing in re advanta.sec,cir.
the plaintiffs may establish a strong inference that the defendants acted with scienter either a by alleging facts to show that defendants had both motive and opportunity to commit fraud,or b by alleging facts that constitute strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.in re burlington,at quoting acito imcera group,cir see also in re advanta,at oran,at.
motive and opportunity 
motive must be supported by facts stated with particularity,and must give rise to a strong inference of scienter.in re advanta,at b.blanket assertions of motive and opportunity will not suffice,and allegations that defendants stood to benefit from wrongdoing and had the opportunity to implement a fraudulent scheme are no longer sufficient,because they do not state facts with particularity or give rise to a strong inference of scienter.in re advanta,at.moreover,m otives that are generally possessed by most corporate directors and officers do not suffice instead,plaintiffs must assert a concrete and personal benefit to the individual defendants resulting from this fraud.kalnit eichler,cir citation omitted.
in their amended complaint,the plaintiffs allege that the defendants motive to commit fraud was that washington would not have been able to acquire rec without the successful issuance of the notes,and would not have been able to sell any of the notes at or near the price sought had the true financial condition of the rec been revealed in the circular.pl.br.at app.at,cplt.further,the complaint suggests that because defendant dennis washington received stock options in after washington acquired westinghouse,it can be inferred that he would receive stock options after the present merger.see app.at,cplt.plaintiffs argue that these alleged stock options provided washington with an additional motive to commit fraud.these allegations are insufficient.
in every corporate transaction,the corporation and its officers have a desire to complete the transaction,and officers will usually reap financial benefits from a successful transaction.such allegations alone can not give rise to a strong inference of fraudulent intent.see in re burlington,at see also phillips lci int l,cir similar situations arise in every merger thus,allowing a plaintiff to prove a motive to defraud by simply alleging a corporate defendant desire to retain his position with its attendant salary,or realize gains on company stock,would force the directors of virtually every company to defend securities fraud actions every time that company effected a merger or acquisition.san leandro emergency med.group profit sharing plan philip morris,cir finding that a company desire to maintain a high bond or credit rating insufficient motive for fraud because such motive could be imputed to any company tuchman dsc communications,cir i ncentive compensation can hardly be the basis on which an allegation of fraud is predicated.citation omitted herzog gt interactive software,civ,wl,at,holding that a defendant desire to consummate a corporate transaction does not constitute a motive for securities fraud leventhal tow,d,t he allegation that the defendants artificially inflated citizens stock price in order to protect and enhance their executive positions and negotiate as favorable a deal as possible on a pending employment contract also fail s to give rise to a strong inference of scienter.this motive has been rejected routinely.thacker medaphis,civ,wl,at,finding plaintiff claim that defendant was motivated by a desire to eliminate competitors and to acquire related companies insufficient to plead scienter because such motive could be imputed to any corporate officer.
although the allegation is not apparent from the complaint,plaintiffs now argue that csfb had a motive to commit fraud because it stood to receive underwriting and financial advisory fees.this allegation is undoubtedly true but equally unavailing.see melder morris,cir declining to find scienter where plaintiffs alleged that underwriters motive in participating in fraud was to collect fees schnell conseco,d,a n underwriter alleged motive to earn its underwriting fees is not alone sufficient to sustain a strong inference of fraudulent intent.if it were,every underwriter,law firm,accountant,and investment advisor whose compensation or commission depended on the completion of an initial public offering would have a motive to commit fraud,which would make rule b wholly meaningless.quoting fisher offerman,civ,wl at.therefore,plaintiffs have failed to meet the scienter requirement by pleading motive and opportunity to commit fraud on the part of any of the defendants.
recklessness or conscious misbehavior 
because the plaintiffs have not adequately pleaded that the defendants had both motive and opportunity to commit fraud,their complaint will survive the motion to dismiss only if they allege specific facts that constitute strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.oran,at kalnit,at where motive is not apparent,it is still possible to plead scienter by identifying circumstances indicating conscious behavior by the defendant,though the strength of the circumstantial allegations must be correspondingly greater.quoting beck mfrs.hanover trust,cir.
a reckless statement is a material misrepresentation or omission involving not merely simple,or even inexcusable negligence,but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,and which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it.in re advanta,at quoting mclean alexander,cir.
the plaintiffs argue that they alleged specific information transmitted to defendants prior to issuance of the offering circular and sale of the notes that contradicted representations made in the circular,identifying who communicated them to whom,when,and how.pl.br.at.in other words,it is the plaintiffs position that the defendants had actual knowledge of the falsity of their statements in the circular at the time they were made.it is certainly true that in a situation,any required element of scienter is satisfied where the defendant had actual knowledge of the material information.fenstermacher phila.bank,cir see also in re advanta,at.
of course,it is not enough for plaintiffs to merely allege that defendants knew their statements were fraudulent or that defendants must have known their statements were false.see in re digital island sec,cir rombach chang,cir finding no scienter where plaintiffs did not allege facts and circumstances that would support an inference that defendants knew of specific facts that are contrary to their public statements bovee coopers lybrand,cir plaintiffs may not simply rely on the proposition that defendants must have known or should have known of,and participated in,the fraud.plaintiffs must plead allegations of scienter with particularity.see b.they must support their allegations with the essential factual background that would accompany the first paragraph of any newspaper story that is,the who,what,when,where and how of the events at issue.in re burlington,at citing dileo ernst young,cir.
although the plaintiffs argue that they have demonstrated that the defendants had actual knowledge that their public statements were false and misleading at the time in which they were made,the plaintiffs have failed to plead with particularity facts that so demonstrate.the plaintiffs point to many statements that the individual defendants made during the due diligence period as evidence that they had actual knowledge that their circular statements were false and misleading.however,these statements made during the due diligence period can not be connected directly to any misleading statement in the offering circular.
liabilities 
the plaintiffs allege a number of different affirmative misstatements that form the basis of their claim.first,the plaintiffs argue that the circular was misleading in including rec financials for the stub period which indicated that as of april,rec had liabilities of.reply br.at pl.br.at app.at.to establish that washington had actual knowledge to the contrary,plaintiffs refer to a comment in washington october,presentation which indicated that rec had understated or undisclosed liabilities.see app.at cplt,app.at.however,this comment could not have been made in reference to the financial statements for the stub period between january and april,since those statements would not have been available in october of.see app.at cplt.noting that as of december,washington group had requested audited financials for re c for years,and and reviewed financial statements for the stub period from january to september.moreover,in the october presentation,washington was referring to understated liabilities in rec unaudited financial statements.app.at referring to a ccounting integrity of financial statements unaudited provided to date.these statements were later audited and adjusted to comply with gaap before they were incorporated into the circular.app.at.plaintiffs present no evidence that washington had actual knowledge that the audited statements were inaccurate during the relevant time period.
plaintiffs also rely on their complaint allegation that a s of january,washington group and defendants knew that rec financial statements of september,overstated assets by approximately million and understated liabilities by million.reply br.at app.at cplt.the plaintiffs,however,do not provide any source to connect this accusation to record evidence.in other words,plaintiffs have failed to plead with particularity.see in re party city sec,d,simply referring to a series of public statements and then alleging,in a general and conclusory manner,that those disclosures were false or misleading is insufficient.plaintiffs do not even mention whether,in this paragraph,they are referring to rec audited or unaudited statements.moreover,any knowledge washington may have had regarding the accuracy of the financial statements is of little relevance in determining whether washington had actual knowledge that the statements from the later stub period were inaccurate.
contracts in progress 
similarly,the plaintiffs argue that the circular was misleading in that rec unaudited financials for the stub period indicated that as of april,rec contracts in process had a value of.reply br.at gsc br.at app.at.to show that washington knew this statement was misleading,plaintiffs refer us to various documents washington produced during its due diligence period,in which washington indicated its belief that several of rec many contracts were overvalued.id.citing app.cplt.again,in some of these documents,washington was referring to rec unaudited statements which were later audited before inclusion in the circular and the other documents focused on projects for which washington was later indemnified moreover,there is no indication that any of washington documents referred to the april stub period or to any other value appearing in the circular,and in none of these documents does washington provide an estimate of the total value of rec contracts in progress.for both of these reasons,there is no way to know whether washington would have disagreed with rec april valuation at the time the circular was issued.
in any case,washington made it plain in the circular that rec accounting for these contracts was aggressive,when it warned that rec revenue recognition policies are significantly different from those used by mk on certain contracts where significant components are procured in advance of installation rec revenue recognition policy on such contracts generally result in more revenue recognition in the early stages of a contract.app.at.it also suggested that this difference could be critical when it noted that t he loss of one or more major contracts,or our inability to perform profitably under one or more major contracts could have a material adverse effect on our businesses,financial condition,results of operation and cash flows.app.at.
four projects deviate significantly 
the plaintiffs also take issue with a statement in the circular indicating that four projects for which rec retained liability deviate significantly and are not representative of other contracts being acquired.pl.br.at,quoting app.at.plaintiffs argue that this statement was misleading because defendants knew that numerous other projects were also misestimated,likely to incur costly overruns that were uncollectible and were losing money.id.first,a fair reading of this excerpt from the circular is that these four projects deviated significantly because of a the extent of loss already incurred on each project b the reversal of profit and c the establishment of reserves for future losses.in re burlington,at noting that if plaintiffs rely on extrinsic documents in their complaint,the documents must be understood in their entirety.plaintiffs have failed to identify any evidence suggesting that washington believed that other contracts equally met these three criteria.to the contrary,plaintiffs concede in their complaint that these projects are distinguishable,referring to them as the four most significant loss projects.app.at cplt.finally,because raytheon ultimately retained liability for at least one additional project that plaintiffs allege deviate d significantly,any misleading statements based on that project is immaterial as a matter of law.see in re nahc.sec,cir if the disclosure of certain information has no effect on stock prices,it follows that the information disclosed was immaterial as a matter of law.
collection is probable 
the plaintiffs also argue that the circular was misleading in stating that u napproved change orders and claims are included in contracts in process at their estimated realizable value.rec has a contractual or legal basis for pursuing recovery of these unapproved change orders and claims and has determined that collection is probable.pl.br.at quoting app.at,see also pl.br.at.plaintiffs suggests that washington knew this statement was false,because in a march,memorandum it indicated that it believed the recovery percentage for one particular project would be poor and that attempted recovery could result in a loss of between and million.app.at.it should be noted,however,that the circular refers to a total of million worth of change orders and claims.app.at.therefore,plaintiffs argument comes down to the fact that washington actually believed that between and percent of these contracts were not recoverable.as far as we know,washington believed collection was probable for at least percent of these change orders.moreover,far from having actual knowledge that between and million of change orders would be uncollectible,the march memorandum suggests a lack of certainty or confidence in washington predictions.app.at p rojects results are difficult to quantify id.at i t is difficult to predict the extent of the loss.
on top of this,the circular statement was qualified through the use of the word probable and was accompanied by cautionary language,which indicated that t he settlement of these amounts depends on individual circumstances and negotiations with the counterparty accordingly,the timing of the collection will vary and approximately million of collections are expected to extend beyond one year.app.at.any reasonable reading of this statement,would make one skeptical about the recovery of the full million.similarly,as noted supra,the circular emphasized that rec took an aggressive approach to revenue recognition.app.at.when viewed in this context,we do not believe that the plaintiffs have adequately alleged that any knowing misstatement washington may have made in print here was material.this is especially true given that washington was at least partially indemnified by raytheon for losses associated with the very project discussed in the march memorandum.see.
in any case,because the statement about c
