a new parent company terminated plaintiff employees upon its purchasing their employer.the employees sued,claiming the parent company violated the terms of its purchase contract with the prior parent company regarding termination of employees and severance pay.the trial court granted summary judgment against the employees,concluding they were not third party beneficiaries who could recover under the contract.we disagree and reverse.
in april,defendant gores technology group gtg entered into a stock purchase agreement by which gtg agreed to purchase from company all of the capital stock of verifone.among various matters,the parties agreed in section of the agreement that gtg would offer employment to all verifone employees with salaries and benefits similar to those the employees received at verifone,except gtg had no duty to continue any severance obligation had provided them other than as required by law.gtg agreed to indemnify for any costs or expenses incurred as a result of terminating an employee after the closing on the stock sale purchase.
regarding third party beneficiaries,section of the stock sale agreement stated the agreement is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto,the company verifone,and other entities not relevant here any rights or remedies hereunder.
on july,and gtg entered into amendment to the stock sale agreement.in section of the amendment,gtg agreed not to terminate any verifone employees during the first days after closing the stock sale.gtg also agreed if it terminated any verifone employees during the first days after the prohibition period,it would pay such employees severance benefits that are approximately equivalent to the cash compensation element of unassigned pool benefits for employees which the parties agree shall be no less than six months base salary the equivalent severance policy.
in amending section of the original agreement regarding employees and employee benefits,gtg further agreed to indemnify against any cost,expense,loss or liability including interest and penalties recovered by a third party with respect thereto,and which arise out of gtg termination of an employee after the closing,including,without limitation,any breach by gtg of any of the matters set forth in section sic of the amendment to the agreement.italics added.because section of the amendment imposes no obligation on gtg and does not concern employees at all,the reference in this amendment to section is an obvious typographical mistake,and the reference should be to section of the amendment.
also,in section b of the amendment,the parties ratified certain agreements not relevant here as continuing obligations that would survive closing.to implement this provision,the parties expressly waived the operation of section of the stock sale agreement as to those agreements but as to no other matters.
at the time gtg and entered into the stock sale agreement and its amendment,the cash component of severance policy differed depending on whether the terminated employee signed a legal release.if the employee signed the release,severance consisted in primary part of a minimum six months salary plus additional salary based on length of service up to a maximum of months salary,plus payment for other calendar events.if the terminated employee refused to sign a release,the employee received two months salary in lieu of notice of termination,along with other incidental payments.
plaintiffs william prouty,paul warenycia,russ carlson,and eric lecesne were employees assigned to the verifone division at the time gtg purchased verifone.each had worked for for more than years.gtg terminated plaintiffs employment within one week of closing its acquisition of verifone.
when gtg officials informed plaintiffs of their termination,they offered plaintiffs two months salary in lieu of notice,and told them they did not need to report to work any longer unless called back.they were free to look for other employment.gtg also offered an additional four months salary if plaintiffs agreed to sign a release.plaintiffs did not accept the offer,and they each received the two months salary.plaintiff allege had gtg complied with the contract,they would have received an additional two months pay for the time the contract prohibited gtg from terminating them.they also allege gtg was obligated to offer them up to months severance plus other payments,as would have offered them had it terminated plaintiffs.
procedural history 
in march,plaintiffs filed this action against verifone,gtg and gtg chairman,alec gores,seeking declaratory relief and damages for breach of contract.we refer to gtg and alec gores collectively as gtg.plaintiffs later dismissed the action against.
in december,the remaining defendants filed motions for summary judgment.gtg moving papers did not include a separate statement of undisputed facts,but instead relied upon the statement prepared by verifone.verifone separate statement was served on plaintiffs,but it was not stamped as having been filed with the court.the document,however,appears in the clerk transcript,about which the clerk declared was a true and correct copy of all the documents that appeared on record and on file in the clerk office in this matter.
plaintiffs settled with verifone prior to the hearing on the motions,and verifone motion was dropped.on the same day plaintiffs filed their opposition to gtg motion,gtg filed a supplemental statement adopting verifone separate statement as its own and filing it with the court.this filing occurred on december,days before the scheduled hearing.
gtg argued summary judgment was required because plaintiffs were not parties to the stock sale agreement and the amendment,and they were foreclosed by the agreement terms from being third party beneficiaries.plaintiffs opposed in part by asserting gtg motion was defective due to its failure to file a separate statement.they also claimed they were intended third party beneficiaries who could recover for gtg alleged breach of section of the amendment.
by ruling dated january,the trial court granted gtg motion for summary judgment.the court concluded the undisputed facts demonstrated plaintiffs were not parties or third party beneficiaries to the agreement and the amendment.the express language of the contract,the court wrote,provides that there are no third party beneficiaries,and plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the contract was made expressly for the benefit of the third person.citation.the court also concluded gtg motion was not defective for failing to file a separate statement with its moving papers.gtg satisfied the statutory purpose behind the requirement to file a separate statement by adopting verifone statement.
before us,plaintiffs claim the trial court erred because gtg motion was defective due to its failure to file a separate statement and plaintiffs were intended third party beneficiaries of the amended agreement.

istandard of review 
under summary judgment law,any party to an action,whether plaintiff or defendant,may move the court for summary judgment in his favor on a cause of action,claim or defense code civ,subd.a a plaintiff contend ing that there is no defense to the action,a defendant contend ing that the action has no merit ibid.the court must grant the motion if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact,subd.c that is,there is no issue requiring a trial as to any fact that is necessary under the pleadings and,ultimately,the law citations and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law code civ,subd.c.the moving party must support the motion with evidence including affidavits,declarations,admissions,answers to interrogatories,depositions,and matters of which judicial notice must or may be taken,subd.b.likewise,any adverse party may oppose the motion,and,where appropriate,must present evidence including affidavits,declarations,admissions,answers to interrogatories,depositions,and matters of which judicial notice must or may be taken.ibid.an adverse party who chooses to oppose the motion must be allowed a reasonable opportunity to do so,subd.h.in ruling on the motion,the court must consider all of the evidence and all of the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom,subd.c,and must view such evidence citations and such inferences citations,in the light most favorable to the opposing party.
i n moving for summary judgment,a defendant has met his burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if he has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.once the defendant has met that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.the plaintiff may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but,instead,must set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.code civ,subd.o.
there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.
thus,if a plaintiff who would bear the burden of proof by a preponderance of evidence at trial moves for summary judgment,he must present evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact to find any underlying material fact more likely than,he would not be entitled to judgment as a matter of law,but would have to present his evidence to a trier of fact.by contrast,if a defendant moves for summary judgment against such a plaintiff,he must present evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact not to find any underlying material fact more likely than,he would not be entitled to judgment as a matter of law,but would have to present his evidence to a trier of fact.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,italics in original,fns.omitted.
on appeal,we review the record de novo to determine whether the moving party met its burden of proof.lewis county of sacramento th,d.we consider all of the evidence set forth in the supporting and opposition papers,except that to which objections have been made and sustained by the court,and all noncontradicted inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence.artiglio corning cal th,d.
third party beneficiaries 
gtg argues the express language of section of the agreement and section b of the amendment preclude plaintiffs from being third party beneficiaries.plaintiffs argue that despite sections and b,gtg and adopted section of the amendment with the express intent to benefit plaintiffs,thus making them third party beneficiaries who could enforce the agreement.plaintiffs argument provides the favored interpretation.
where one person for a valuable consideration engages with another to do some act for the benefit of a third person,and the agreement thus made has not been rescinded,the party for whose benefit the contract or promise was made,or who would enjoy the benefit of the act,may maintain an action against the promisor for the breach of his engagement.while the contract remains unrescinded,the relations of the parties are the same as though the promise had been made directly to the third party.although the party for whose benefit the promise was made was not cognizant of it when made,it is,if adopted by him,deemed to have been made to him.he may sue on the promise the action by a third party beneficiary for the breach of the promisor engagement does not rest on the ground of any actual or supposed relationship between the parties but on the broad and more satisfactory basis that the law,operating on the acts of the parties,creates the duty,establishes a privity,and implies the promise and obligation on which the action is founded.citation.
it is not necessary that the beneficiary be named and identified as an individual a third party may enforce a contract if he can show he is a member of a class for whose benefit it was made 
the test for determining whether a contract was made for the benefit of a third person is whether an intent to benefit a third person appears from the terms of the contract.citation.if the terms of the contract necessarily require the promisor to confer a benefit on a third person,then the contract,and hence the parties thereto,contemplate a benefit to the third person.the parties are presumed to intend the consequences of a performance of the contract.johnson holmes tuttle,d.
this rule is codified a contract,made expressly for the benefit of a third person,may be enforced by him at any time before the parties thereto rescind it.the word expressly,by judicial interpretation,has now come to mean merely the negative of incidentally.gilbert financial steelform contracting d.also,the contract need not be exclusively for the benefit of the third party.he does not need to be the sole or the primary beneficiary.johnson superior court th,d.
in contrast,a third party who is only incidentally benefited by performance of a contract is not entitled to enforce it.citation.the fact that he is incidentally named in the contract,or that the contract,if carried out according to its terms,would inure to his benefit,is not sufficient to entitle him to demand its fulfillment.it must appear to have been the intention of the parties to secure to him personally the benefit of its provisions.citation.whether the third party is an intended beneficiary or merely an incidental beneficiary involves construction of the intention of the parties,gathered from reading the contract as a whole in light of the circumstances under which it was entered.eastern aviation group,airborne express,th,d,italics in original.
generally,it is a question of fact whether a particular third person is an intended beneficiary of a contract.bancomer,superior court th,d.however,where,as here,the issue can be answered by interpreting the contract as a whole and doing so in light of the uncontradicted evidence of the circumstances and negotiations of the parties in making the contract,the issue becomes one of law that we resolve independently.
applying the law of third party beneficiaries to the language of the contract discloses gtg and expressly intended to grant plaintiffs the promises contained in section of the amendment.indeed,section is a classic third party provision.it is patently intended to preclude early termination of the affected employees and to provide those terminated soon after the closing with severance benefits similar to what they would have received had they been terminated when employed by.the provision expressly benefits them,and only them.
other portions of the contract and amendment disclose this intent.previously,the parties agreed gtg would not provide any voluntary severance benefits to employees it eventually terminated.however,section of the amendment superceded the original agreement.moreover,in agreeing not to terminate employees and to pay them similar severance benefits,gtg agreed to extend its indemnity obligations towards to include any breaches on the new promise.it is difficult for gtg to argue section did not intend to benefit plaintiffs when gtg gained nothing from agreeing to its terms.
the uncontradicted facts of the amendment negotiation also disclose and gtg intended to benefit plaintiffs.david prindiville,testifying on behalf of,stated entered this transaction with the intent its verifone employees who became gtg employees would have the same or similar type of severance package as they would with.prindiville claimed learned gtg would lay off many employees after the closing.it was concerned about that,and very concerned those laid off would not be treated the same as would have treated them.prindiville explained severance policy to his company negotiators on the deal,and they took this information to gtg.
catherine scanlon,gtg chief financial officer,did not contradict prindiville claims.scanlon testified gtg contemplated laying off verifone employees before the parties signed the stock sale agreement in april.on july,representatives met with her and others a
