this expedited appeal pursuant to a arises against the backdrop of a proxy vote among shareholders of mony group,mony,whose management seeks shareholder approval of a proposed merger of mony with french insurance conglomerate axa financial,axa.are institutional shareholders of mony that oppose the merger and seek to distribute an exempt proxy solicitation to mony shareholders under rule b rule b,b.this solicitation consisted of i a letter urging mony shareholders to withhold their approval of the proposed merger,and ii a duplicate copy of the proxy card that had been sent to shareholders by mony management after mony had filed a proxy statement to the securities and exchange commission sec under rule a rule a,a.
rule b exempts from sec proxy regulations a ny solicitation by any person who does not seek the power to act as proxy and does not furnish a form of revocation to a company shareholders as part of the solicitation.mony argues that the duplicate proxy card is a form of revocation within the meaning of rule b,and sought a preliminary injunction in the united states district court for the southern district of new york holwell,barring appellees from including the duplicate card with their solicitations.on february,the district court denied mony request,concluding that it was unlikely to succeed on the merits of its claim against appellees under section a of the exchange act of section a,a.
we conclude that,in the circumstances of this proxy vote to authorize a proposed merger under delaware duplicate of management proxy card,when included in a mailing opposing a proposed merger,is a form of revocation under rule b.we also conclude that mony will suffer irreparable harm if appellees enclose the duplicate card in their solicitations to mony shareholders without first satisfying the disclosure regulations promulgated under section a.
background 
mony is a new life insurance and financial services company incorporated in delaware and registered under the exchange act.highfields capital management highfields,longleaf partners fund longleaf,and southeastern asset management southeastern collectively own approximately eight percent of mony stock.on september,mony through its management agreed to be acquired by axa,a french life insurance and financial services conglomerate,in an merger valued at approximately billion.under the merger terms,mony shareholders were to receive per share of mony common stock and a dividend to be paid by axa based on mony earnings in the second half of.after a full review by the sec,mony issued its definitive proxy statement on january,and scheduled a shareholder vote for february.under delaware law,a merger agreement is binding only if a majority of all issued and outstanding company shares approve it.see.c.
reaction to the merger announcement was mixed many shareholders argued that axa offer representing percent of mony book value substantially undervalued the company and that the million severance payments for mony management were excessive and suggestive of a.the merger announcement also spawned numerous lawsuits this appeal arises from mony action challenging appellees proxy solicitations.
in late january,appellees began considering a proxy solicitation to mony shareholders that would be exempt under rule b from the proxy regulations promulgated by the sec.on january,southeastern announced its intention to vote its mony shares against the axa merger,urged other mony shareholders to do likewise,and indicated that southeastern would further communicate its views by means of an exempt solicitation under the federal proxy rules.by january,highfields had begun exploring a similar shareholder communication and sought advice from sec staff on any constraints imposed by the exchange act,particularly on whether an exempt solicitation under rule b could include a copy of mony proxy card in its mailing for the convenience of mony shareholders to facilitate voting against the merger.
highfields was advised by sec staff that although it had not been released formally,the office of mergers and acquisitions at the sec had considered and adopted a nonpublished position in an informal april interpretation circulated internally among sec staff that gave qualified approval to shareholders seeking to mail duplicates of management proxy cards as part of an exempt proxy solicitation under rule b.on the basis of these discussions with sec staff,highfields planned an exempt proxy solicitation to mony shareholders that included duplicates of mony proxy card and conformed to the restrictions described in the april opinion 
mony commenced an action on february,in the united states district court for the southern district preska,seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction blocking appellees from sending the duplicate proxy cards without first filing a proxy statement under rule a.after a hearing on february,judge preska granted mony request for a restraining order,stating that t he exemption set out in rule b does not apply here because appellees solicitation furnishes or otherwise requests a form of revocation.judge preska also noted that a few votes changed by reason of the possibly invalid proxy solicitation would cause irreparable harm to mony b ecause of the requirement that of mony shareholders vote in favor of the proposal 
judge preska ordered appellees to show cause on february,as to why a preliminary injunction should not issue prohibiting appellees from sending the duplicate cards.in the interim,highfields and longleaf sent solicitation letters to mony shareholders without the duplicate proxy cards that detailed how shareholders could vote,change,or revoke their proxies.
the case was assigned to judge holwell,who extended the restraining order for the reasons set forth in judge preska initial order until he had considered the arguments of all of the parties.judge holwell also invited the sec to submit an amicus letter brief setting forth its position on 
whether a party is entitled to the rule b exemption if 
the party sends shareholders a proxy solicitation that includes a proxy voting card which is an exact duplicate of a card previously sent to shareholders as part of a proxy solicitation by a party who complied with the sec disclosure rules 
the party solicits the shareholders to use the duplicate proxy card to vote against the proposal recommended by the company board of directors and thereby to revoke any proxy previously given 
this duplicate card is sent with instructions that,once marked,it be returned to the party or agent thereof who sent the original proxy card and 
the duplicate card does not provide for any exercise of authority by the party who sent it,nor does it ever come back into the possession or under the control of the party who sent it.
by fax on february,alan beller,director of the sec division of corporation finance,and giovanni prezioso,general counsel of the sec,declined to take a formal position on behalf of the commission in light of the short time frame,we have not had an opportunity to seek the view of the commission with respect to the specific question raised by your letter.the instead provided background to rule b and positions that the sec had taken historically,noting that,in an informal april internal opinion,the sec had considered whether 
a person otherwise qualified to rely on the exemptions of rule b could provide a solicited shareholder with a copy of management proxy card for the purposes of facilitating the shareholder revocation of a previous card or a vote in favor of a proposal supported by the soliciting party 
the sec letter summarized this internal april opinion as follows 
the provision of rule b would not be violated since providing a copy of management proxy would be returned directly to not create any proxy authority in the soliciting party and 
although management proxy card could have the effect of a revocation of an earlier dated proxy submitted by the same shareholder,this should not constitute a form of revocation envisioned by rule b

in an opinion and order entered february,judge holwell denied mony motion for a preliminary injunction on the ground that mony was unlikely to succeed on the merits of its claim because,as a matter of law,a duplicate of the issuer proxy card was not a form of revocation under rule b.the district court invoked policy considerations and cited the sec informal april opinion as summarized in the sec letter brief.
as to irreparable harm,the court ruled that,although many of mony assertions were for the most part too speculative and causally tenuous to support a preliminary injunction there is support for plaintiff showing that a misinformed shareholder vote may result in irreparable harm.however,in light of its ruling that mony was unlikely to succeed on the merits of its claim,the court dissolved the restraining order and denied mony motion for a preliminary injunction.in the alternative,the district court ruled that mony had failed to show serious questions going to the merits of its claim and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in its favor.
on february,mony board voted i to sweeten the terms of the merger agreement by issuing a special dividend of a dime a share to mony shareholders of record at the closing of the merger,and ii to postpone the shareholder vote to may,with a record date of april.mony appealed the district court denial of the preliminary injunction,claiming in its brief to this court that it has every reason to believe that,once the date nears and mony has mailed its proxy voting card,appellees will again seek to engage in solicitations of the type which led to the filing of this action.nothing in appellees briefs to this court disavows that intention and at oral argument,appellees made clear that,unless enjoined,they will after the april,record date distribute proxy solicitations that include the duplicate proxy cards.
the appeal of the district court denial of a preliminary injunction was heard by this court on april.the parties agree on appeal that i the mailings are solicitations and ii the solicitations do not seek proxy authority from mony shareholders.the viability of the rule b exemption therefore turns on one the proxy card duplicate was a form of revocation.see b.after deliberations,we reversed from the bench and issued an order later that day directing the district court to grant mony motion for a preliminary injunction,and reciting that an opinion would follow.
discussion 
to secure a preliminary injunction in district court,the moving party must demonstrate that it will be irreparably harmed in the absence of an injunction,and either a a likelihood of success on the merits or b sufficiently serious questions going to the merits of the case to make it a fair ground for litigation,and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in its favor.forest city daly,town of north hempstead,cir.we evaluate mony request for a preliminary injunction under the likelihood of success on the merits prong because mony does not appeal the district court alternative holding that it failed to meet the more lenient standard of showing sufficiently serious questions going to the merits of the case and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in its favor.
it is settled that a district court decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction is not generally reviewed de novo but rather for abuse of discretion.zervos verizon,cir.at the same time,
a district court abuses or exceeds the discretion accorded to it when its decision rests on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or its not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual be located within the range of permissible decisions.

rule b is part of a comprehensive proxy regulation scheme promulgated by the sec pursuant to section a of the exchange act.see a,et see also,et.rule a states in relevant part that 
n o solicitation subject to this regulation shall be made unless each person solicited is furnished with a written proxy statement containing the information specified in schedule or with a preliminary or definitive written proxy statement included in a registration statement filed under the securities act of on form or or form and containing the information specified in such form.
a.appellees elected not to file proxy statements under rule a.
in,the sec modified its proxy regulations to encourage free discussion,debate and learning among shareholders.regulation of communications among shareholders,exchange act release,sec lexis,at october,the amendments.as modified by the amendments,rule b exempted from sec proxy regulations 
any solicitation by or on behalf of any person who does not,at any time during such solicitation,seek directly or indirectly,either on its own or another behalf,the power to act as proxy for a security holder and does not furnish or otherwise request,or act on behalf of a person who furnishes or requests,a form of revocation,abstention,consent,or authorization 
b emphases added.thus,any communication that meets the rule b exemption need not comply with,inter alia,the proxy statement disclosure requirement of rule a according to the sec,this exemption sought to balance the policy goal of open shareholder communication with the potential for abuse both by insurgents and by management especially in a proxy fight.amendments at.
until the events underlying this appeal,no federal court had addressed whether a proxy card duplicate is a form of revocation under rule b.we agree with judge holwell that where a shareholder has previously submitted a proxy,transmission of a duplicate proxy card could legally have the effect of a revocation,but that revocation is not a necessary effect inherent in the card and does not transform management proxy card into a form of revocation that places appellees outside the ambit of the exemption.we further agree that,in some proxy voting situations,the submission of a subsequent proxy card may be something other or more than a revocation of a previous vote.for example,a shareholder might use a duplicate proxy card to substitute a new vote for one slate of director candidates in place of a prior vote for a slate.
we conclude,however,that the district court gave insufficient consideration to the particular circumstances of this case as affected by the mechanics of delaware corporate law.under delaware law,any merger or consolidation of domestic corporations must meet a number of statutory requirements,including that,at a special meeting for the purpose of acting on the merger agreement a majority of the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be voted for the adoption of the agreement.c.thus,in the context of a proxy vote to approve a merger agreement under delaware law,a majority of all outstanding shares must vote yes in order to approve the merger an abstention or any vote other than yes is tantamount to a no vote.see id.moreover,when two proxies are offered bearing the same name,then the proxy that appears to have been last executed will be accepted and counted under the theory that the is,more constitutes a revocation of the former.standard power light investment associates.the duplicate proxy cards would thus operate as a revocation only when returned by mony shareholders who previously voted in support of the merger with axa.
appellees vigorously argue on appeal that duplicates of mony proxy card may be used by persons other than the mony shareholders who have already voted and seek to revoke their votes.most obviously,such duplicates are handy for shareholders who have lost or discarded their original proxy cards.here,however,appellees own solicitations reflect that they intend the duplicate proxy card to be a form of revocation for mony shareholders who have already voted.for example,the text of highfields first proposed proxy solicitation in part sought to inform mony shareholders that w hen properly signed and returned this proxy card shall revoke any proxy previously given in connection with the special meeting.
revocation is the only likely use for such a duplicate proxy because i undecided mony shareholders presumably retain blank copies of their original management proxy
