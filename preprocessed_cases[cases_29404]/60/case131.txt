introduction 
we hold that when a trial court judgment decides a case on two alternate grounds,and the appellate court affirms based on one ground,the judgment is binding under principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel only on the ground addressed by the appellate court.in so holding,we decline to follow people skidmore cal.skidmore because subsequent developments in california law and the trend of decisions have weakened that case authority to the point where we can conclude it no longer reflects the views of the california supreme court.our holding,which is consistent with the restatement second of judgments and recent california state appellate court authority,leads us to reverse the judgment and remand.
this case is a sequel to our decision in founding members of the newport beach country club newport beach country club,th,d founding members i.in founding members i,the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the newport beach country club,nbcc,on two grounds.we affirmed based on the first ground,and expressly declined to address the second.in this case founding members ii,the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of nbcc on the second ground.relying on skidmore,the trial court concluded the second ground had been resolved under principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel by our decision in founding members because,as we now hold,the judgment in founding members i is binding only on the ground actually decided in that decision,we reverse and remand.
facts and procedural history 
in founding members i,an unincorporated association of country club members known as the founding members of the newport beach country club founding members sued the newport beach country club,incorporated nbcc,to enforce a right of first offer contained in nbcc governing regulations founding members i,supra,th at,d.founding members alleged a proposed sale in october of the stock of ibc,ibc,which owned nbcc,triggered founding members rights under the right of first offer to purchase nbcc.
the trial court in founding members i construed the right of first offer as extending only to a member organization in existence.founding members i,supra,th at,d.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of nbcc on two grounds no such member organization existed on the date of the proposed sale that founding members asserted triggered the right of first offer and the proposed sale of ibc stock did not trigger the right of first offer.id.at,d.
we affirmed based on the first ground only.we agreed with the trial court construction of the right of first offer as extending only to a member organization in existence when the triggering event occurred,and concluded because the undisputed facts revealed that neither founding members nor any member organization,as referred to in the governing regulations,existed as of the date of the agreement to sell ibc stock,nbcc had no obligations under the right of first offer.in light of this conclusion,we do not address whether the agreement to sell ibc stock constituted an agreement to sell part or all of nbcc legal interest in the club.founding members i,supra,th at,d.
in,after we issued our decision in founding members i,founding members registered with nbcc as an organization entitled to exercise the right of first offer.nbcc recognized that right,subject to the limitation that founding members had no right to exercise the right of first offer with respect to a sale of the stock of ibc.when founding members refused to acknowledge that limitation,nbcc filed this lawsuit for declaratory relief,founding members ii.nbcc complaint in founding members ii sought a declaration that the right of first offer is not triggered and does not apply to a proposed sale of all or a majority of the stock of ibc,parent company of nbcc and the order and judgment in founding members i are binding in their entirety on defendants and establish,through collateral estoppel res judicata,that the right of first offer is not triggered and does not apply to a proposed sale of all or a majority of the stock of ibc.
the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of nbcc and decreed the order granting summary judgment in favor of nbcc and against founding members in that certain action known as founding members of the newport beach count r y club newport beach country club,incorporated orange county superior court case is binding upon founding members in its entirety,including,without limitation,the conclusion in the order that the sale of the stock of nbcc parent corporation,international bay clubs,incorporated,does not trigger the right of first offer in article v,section of the governing regulations.the trial court explained in granting this summary judgment,the court has examined the competing lines of authority on the scope of res judicata collateral estoppel effect to be accorded orders and judgments of trial courts,including the california appellate court decision cited by founding members of butcher truck ins.exchange,th,d.however,this court ultimately concludes that auto equity sales superior court,cal d,people skidmore,cal.and the persuasive discussion of california law in di r uzza county of tehama,cir establish that,under california law,the affirmance of a decision at the trial court level by an appellate court extends binding and legal effect to the whole of the trial court determination,with attendant collateral estoppel effect.
founding members timely appealed from the judgment in favor of nbcc in founding members ii,bringing the matter back to us.the issues presented this time are is the judgment affirmed by founding members i binding on the issue whether a sale of ibc stock triggered the right of first offer,even though we did not address that issue in affirming the judgment and if the first judgment is not binding on that issue,is nbcc entitled to summary judgment in founding members ii on the issue whether a sale of ibc stock triggered the founding members rights of purchase under the right of first offer 
discussion 
when a trial court judgment decides a case on two alternate grounds,and the appellate court affirms based on one ground,is the judgment binding under principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel on both grounds recited in the judgment,or only on the ground addressed by the appellate court 
there are two contrary lines of authority on this issue.one line,which we call the traditional rule,provides that a general affirmance of a judgment on appeal makes it res judicata as to all the issues,claims,or controversies involved in the action and passed upon by the court below,although the appellate court does not consider or decide upon all of them.bank of america mclaughlin.d,mclaughlin,quoting judgments.the other line of authority,which we call the modern or restatement second rule,provides that i f the appellant court upholds one of these determinations as sufficient and refuses to consider whether or not the other is sufficient and accordingly affirms the judgment,the judgment is conclusive as to the first determination.butcher truck ins.exchange th,d butcher,quoting rest d judgments,com.
a.the traditional rule 
nbcc advocates the traditional rule,which finds its source in california law in skidmore,supra,cal.in that case,the parties stipulated that a referee would try the issues of law and fact and report a judgment thereon.id.at.in the resulting report,the referee found the plaintiff should not recover.id.at.judgment was entered accordingly,and the plaintiff appealed to the california supreme court.the supreme court affirmed the judgment,but relied on a procedural reach its decision.the case eventually returned to the california supreme court for a determination whether the plaintiff,having corrected the misjoinder,could sue again.the supreme court concluded the referee report and resulting judgment,which reached the merits of the case,had been affirmed by the judgment accompanying the previous opinion,despite that opinion reliance on misjoinder.the plaintiff could not sue again,the supreme court held,because the court,in examining the judgment in connection with the errors assigned,found that there was at least one ground upon which the judgment could be justified,and therefore very properly refrained from considering it in connection with the other errors.but the affirmance,still,was an affirmance to the whole extent of the legal effect of the judgment at the time when it was entered in the court below.the supreme court found no error in the record,and therefore not only allowed it to stand,but affirmed it as an entirety,and by direct expression.id.at.
in,some years after the skidmore case,the california court of appeal for the first district applied the traditional rule in mclaughlin,supra,d,in evaluating the collateral estoppel effect of a bankruptcy court judgment that had been affirmed by the federal court of appeals.the bankruptcy court had determined two issues mclaughlin,a corporation,was not a farmer under the terms of the bankruptcy act,and mclaughlin was not the owner of the property it claimed to be farming.id.at.the ninth circuit court of appeals affirmed the judgment based on the first issue alone.ibid.in the state court action,the plaintiff bank sued in unlawful detainer following nonjudicial foreclosure of a deed of trust.id.at.the trial court granted a directed verdict in the plaintiff favor,and the court of appeal affirmed the resulting judgment.the court of appeal held the bankruptcy court judgment was res judicata on the issue of mclaughlin ownership of the land the bankruptcy court,upon issues squarely presented by this appellant,found that appellant was not a farming corporation,and also found that the trustees sale was valid,that the bank became the owner of the property by purchase at a trustees sale,and that appellant owned no interest.these findings having been incorporated in the judgment it must be assumed that when the circuit court of appeals affirmed the judgment it became res judicata of both the issues tendered and tried.id.at.
the mclaughlin court did not cite skidmore,but relied upon corpus juris,supra,judgments,section,stating a general affirmance of a judgment on appeal makes it res judicata as to all the issues,claims,or controversies involved in the action and passed upon by the court below,although the appellate court does not consider or decide upon all of them.mclaughlin,supra,d at.from the foregoing,the mclaughlin court stated,it must follow that,when the bankruptcy court determined that the petitioner therein had no interest in the property listed,such determination became final as to that issue,notwithstanding the fact that the circuit court of appeals,in affirming the judgment,based its conclusions upon the other issue.id.at.
in diruzza county of tehama cir,the ninth circuit court of appeals confronted the issue whether the traditional rule or the modern rule reflected the law of the state of california.after surveying case authority,including butcher,supra,th,d,the ninth circuit acknowledged there were plausible arguments against the traditional rule,but concluded it remained the law of california until we receive a definitive indication that skidmore no longer represents the law of california,we will adhere to that case precepts.diruzza county of tehama,supra,at.according to the ninth circuit,t he california position is that even if the appellate court refrains from considering one of the grounds upon which the decision below rests,an affirmance of the decision below extends legal effects to the whole of the lower court determination,with attendant collateral estoppel effect.ibid.
b.the modern or restatement second rule 
the modern or restatement second rule,advocated by founding members,was established in california case law by butcher,supra,th,d.its antecedents are much earlier,however,stretching back at least to judge augustus hand opinion in moran towing transportation navigazione libera triestina,cir,moran towing,certiorari denied.in moran towing,the court declined to adopt the traditional rule,criticizing it as the height of unreason.ibid.to treat as controlling the findings of a trial court when the appellate court upsets or disregards them and renders a decision of affirmance on different grounds furnishes parties to other litigations affected by the decision a false guide.ibid.the better practice,according to moran towing,is to look at such evidence as there is to discover the ground of the decision.id.at.
section of the restatement second of judgments,adopted in,is in agreement with moran towing and adopts the modern rule.comment o to section states,in relevant part if a judgment rendered by a court of first instance is reversed by the appellate court and a final judgment is entered by the appellate court or by the court of first instance in pursuance of the mandate of the appellate court,this latter judgment is conclusive between the parties.if the judgment of the court of first instance was based on a determination of two issues,either of which standing independently would be sufficient to support the result,and the appellate court upholds both of these determinations as sufficient,and accordingly affirms the judgment,the judgment is conclusive as to both determinations if the appellate court upholds one of these determinations as sufficient but not the other,and accordingly affirms the judgment,the judgment is conclusive as to the first determination.if the appellate court upholds one of these determinations as sufficient and refuses to consider whether or not the other is sufficient and accordingly affirms the judgment,the judgment is conclusive as to the first determination.
in butcher,division four of the second district court of appeal adopted the modern rule,holding,if a court of first instance makes its judgment on alternative grounds and the reviewing court affirms on only one of those grounds,declining to consider the other,the second ground is no longer conclusively established.butcher,supra,th at,d.the facts of butcher are as follows.the insureds turned to their insurer to provide them a defense to a lawsuit for malicious prosecution.the insurer denied a defense,claiming the policy did not provide coverage.the insureds sued the insurer and produced evidence the insurer agent had misled them into believing he had delivered a policy duplicating coverage including coverage for malicious prosecution of a policy from an insurer whose policy was not being renewed.id.at,d.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the insurer on the ground a prior judgment in a federal court action between the insureds and the former insurer precluded the insureds claim.ibid.
the federal court action was a coverage lawsuit between the insureds and the former insurer.the district court in the federal court action had ruled against the insureds on two alternate grounds the policy did not cover the type of injury the insureds allegedly suffered,and the claims were based on events occurring outside the policy period.butcher,supra,th at,d.the ninth circuit court of appeals affirmed the judgment on the second ground alone and refused to consider the first ground.ibid.
the issue on appeal in the state court action was whether the federal court judgment was res judicata on both grounds decided by the federal district court.the court of appeal reviewed the line of authority supporting the modern rule,including the moran towing decision and section of the restatement second of judgments,and the line of authority supporting the traditional rule,including mclaughlin.the butcher court criticized mclaughlin reasoning,concluding it has not withstood the test of time.butcher,supra,th at,d.as the butcher court explained,the rule stated in corpus juris,supra,judgments,section,cited and relied upon by mclaughlin,is completely abandoned in the modern work.butcher,supra,th at,d.corpus juris secundum follows the restatement second of judgments in stating in the case of a judgment based on alternative grounds,which is affirmed on only one of the grounds,the ground omitted from the decision is not considered to have been fully adjudicated and is not conclusively established for the purposes of res judicata.judgments.the butcher court explained the other authority relied on in mclaughlin an
