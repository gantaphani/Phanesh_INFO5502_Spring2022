factual and procedural background 
in,tenet healthcare corporation sought to divest itself of a number of california hospitals it owned,including four in orange county.among those seeking to purchase the orange county hospitals was ihhi,a holding company formed for this purpose.as its president concedes,ihhi is a heavily debt leveraged company trying to develop sufficient cash flow to survive in a difficult healthcare market.because of concerns about ihhi financial ability to operate the four hospitals,the county of orange and the california senate conducted public hearings on the proposed acquisitions.
among the hospitals ihhi sought to purchase was western medical ana wmc,a acute care facility and one of only three trauma centers in orange county.wmc medical staff opposed ihhi acquisition of wmc due to concerns about both ihhi financial stability and its principal,kali chaudhuri,who had been involved in the failure of a previous healthcare company.one of the medical staff opposing ihhi purchase was fitzgibbons,a member of the medical staff medical executive committee and wmc former chief of staff.
the medical staff dropped its opposition to the purchase when they entered into a written agreement with ihhi,effective january.under the contract,wmc medical staff received significant financial oversight of wmc operations,and chaudhuri agreed to limit his interest in ihhi to a minority share.the agreement also assured wmc that ihhi had a lender commitment for a working capital line of credit loan in the approximate aggregate amount of million,to be available to the hospital no later than ten days following the closing of the purchasing parties acquisition of the hospitals.
under the heading,consideration,the agreement provided the parties further agree that this agreement will be submitted to the department of health services as part of the hospital license application process.in consideration for the binding and enforceable commitments of ihhi,and in reliance upon these commitments,the medical staff of western medical ana will express public support for the acquisition and operation of ihhi of,and issuance of hospital licenses to ihhi for,the hospitals,in accordance with the commitments made herein,including being represented at any public hearings on this proposed acquisition and delivering to dhs mark helmar a letter supporting ihhi acquisition and licensure of the hospitals.
ihhi acquisition and licensing of the hospitals was completed in march.on may,the lender on ihhi acquisition loan,and a million working capital line of credit,served ihhi with a notice of default.the default was disclosed in ihhi filing with the securities exchange commission sec,and reported in an article in the may,orange county register,which cited an analyst warning that ihhi needed to find another investment partner really quickly or the whole thing could be headed for bankruptcy court.
two days after the article appeared,fitzgibbons sent an message to medical executive committee members and other individuals fitzgibbons believed might offer financial assistance to the hospital,expressing concern ihhi could be headed for bankruptcy.the stated by the way,the hospital appears to be underwater and i do think ihhi can get an investor to pony up the million,for the million shares of stock which they are selling.admissions are down.they got a reduction of costs by dumping tenet by,and increased insurance payment of but that is neutralized by the factoring.then their nursing salaries went up so they in the red.no way to get out.that is ominous.what would the buyer get buying ihhi stock control of ihhi,but not the land sounds like its going bk.get ready.now,if the doctors had been in the deal interest rates would have been better say,would have had our capital say million,and admissions would have been even.result happiness.sad.it might work if they came to us on hands and knees and gave us the stock in exchange for our telling the world we support them,and get a refinance at a better rate who would lend ligon the cfo family supposedly has money.the loan default is classic chaudhuri.i guess mogel wo be pooring sic expensive brandy on the table today.mike fitzgibbons.
on june,ihhi filed a complaint against fitzgibbons based on his may message,seeking damages for defamation intentional interference with a contractual relationship negligent interference with a contractual relationship breach of contract breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and violation of business and professions code section et.the complaint alleges fitzgibbons message was forwarded to blue,blue cross,which had been negotiating with ihhi for higher insurance payments,and the message provoked concern on the part of blue cross,stalling negotiations.ihhi alleges this delay has cost it over.
fitzgibbons filed a special motion to strike under the statute,which the trial court denied.fitzgibbons now appeals.
standard of review 
an order denying an special motion to strike is appealable under sections,subdivision i,and.we review the order de novo.computerxpress,jackson th,d.
discussiona.fitzgibbons has met his burden of demonstrating the may message concerned an issue of public interest 
the statute provides a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b.an act in furtherance of the right of free speech includes any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.
the statute arose from the legislature recognition that slapp suit plaintiffs are not seeking to succeed on the merits,but to use the legal system to chill the defendant first amendment right of free speech.moore liu th,d.thus,the statute notes the legislature finds and declares that there has been a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances.the legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process.to this end,this section shall be construed broadly,subd.a.
to prevail on an motion,the movant must first make a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action arises from an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue.varian medical systems,delfino cal th,d.once the movant meets this burden,the plaintiff must demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the claim.ibid.if the plaintiff can not meet this burden,the trial court must strike the cause of action.ibid.
section,subdivision e,clarifies what speech is covered by the statute as used in this section,act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue includes any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.fitzgibbons contends his message falls within both clauses and of section,subdivision e.
we have little trouble concluding fitzgibbons message concerned a public issue and an issue of public interest under section,subdivision e.ihhi acquisition and operation of four orange county hospitals was the subject of public hearings held by both the california senate and the orange county board of supervisors,and discussed in numerous articles in newspapers and other periodicals.the hearings and articles focused on ihhi financial ability to successfully operate the hospitals,and the potential harm to the public should ihhi fail.fitzgibbons message expressing concern for ihhi financial health and its ability to operate wmc falls squarely within these issues.
citing zhao wong th,d,ihhi contends the did not concern a public issue because it did not relate to the exercise of democratic.id.at,d.ihhi reliance on zhao is misplaced,however,because its discussion of the statute scope has been superseded by the amendments to section.see sipple foundation for national progress th,d.the senate judiciary committee expressly amended section to mandate a broad interpretation of the statute in reaction to the interpretation of zhao wong.indeed,the california supreme court expressly disapproved zhao on the very point for which ihhi cites it.briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d,we agree that zhao is incorrect in its assertion that the only activities qualifying for statutory protection are those which meet the lofty standard of pertaining to the heart of.
the definition of public interest within the meaning of the statute has been broadly construed to include not only governmental matters,but also private conduct that impacts a broad segment of society that affects a community in a manner similar to that of a governmental entity.citations.m atters of public interest include activities that involve private persons and entities,especially when a large,powerful organization may impact the lives of many individuals.damon ocean hills journalism club th,d.although ihhi asserts it is a small corporate entity that is heavily debt leveraged,its ownership and operation of four orange county hospitals makes it large and powerful enough to impact the healthcare needs of the county residents.
ihhi also notes the public hearings on ihhi acquisition and operation of the four hospitals had ended months before fitzgibbons sent the,making the issues involved in the hearings moot.ihhi asserts its sec filing and newspaper article reporting on the lender default notice did not create a new public issue.
ihhi relies on du charme international brotherhood of electrical workers th,d du charme and rivero american federation of state,county and municipal employees,th,d rivero.du charme held a statement posted on a labor union local web site announcing that the local business manager had been removed because of financial mismanagement did not concern a public issue or issue of public interest within section,subdivision e.in reaching this conclusion,the court determined in order to satisfy the public of public interest requirement of section,subdivision e and of the statute,in cases where the issue is not of interest to the public at large,but rather to a limited,but definable portion of the public a private group,organization,or community,the constitutionally protected activity must,at a minimum,occur in the context of an ongoing controversy,dispute or discussion,such that it warrants protection by a statute that embodies the public policy of encouraging participation in matters of public significance.du charme,at,d.du charme rejected the defendant attempt to invoke the statute because the web site statement was unconnected to any discussion,debate or controversy then existing.id.at,d.
du charme contrasted its situation involving union members with matters of widespread public interest,providing as examples of the latter,increased traffic and natural drainage impacts of a proposed mall,a television show that generated considerable media debate,and issues concerning domestic violence and child molestation.du charme,supra,th at,d.the court noted such matters involve private conduct which impacts a broad segment of society ibid.
we have no difficulty placing the financial survival of four hospitals within the county into the category of widespread public interest,and thus not subject to the ongoing controversy rule enunciated in du charme thus,du charme provides no support to ihhi position.
in rivero,a demoted supervisor sued former subordinates and a union over statements accusing him of abuse,theft,and extortion.the union contended its statements concerned an issue of public interest because they related to abusive supervision of employees throughout the university of california system which impacts a community of public employees numbering.rivero,supra,th at,d.the union also contended its communications concerned a public issue because plaintiff purported wrongdoing occurred at a publicly financed institution.ibid.rejecting the union contentions,rivero viewed the statements as relating primarily to the plaintiff and eight employees.the court noted that it accepted the union contentions,every workplace dispute would qualify as a matter of public interest.
we have interpreted rivero as outlining three general categories of cases falling within subdivision e of section the subject of the statement or activity precipitating the claim was a person or entity in the public eye.citations.the statement or activity precipitating the claim involved conduct that could affect large numbers of people beyond the direct participants.citations.the statement or activity precipitating the claim involved a topic of widespread public interest.citations.commonwealth energy investor data exchange,th,d.here,each of these three criteria has been met.accordingly,rivero also provides ihhi no support.
finally,ihhi contends the statute does not apply to the challenged because fitzgibbons was ihhi competitor,and therefore the fell into the category of unprotected commercial speech specifically,ihhi introduced evidence that fitzgibbons belonged to an entity called western medical center acquisition,llc wmca,formed to purchase wmc.tenet healthcare rejected wmc offer,and later accepted ihhi.in support of its argument,ihhi relies on mcsi,woods d mcsi and mann quality old time service,th,d mann.
in mcsi,a federal court formulated a rule that statements by a commercial competitor about the competition are not matters of public interest.mcsi,supra,d at.the only basis for this rule,however,stemmed from the same court earlier ruling in globetrotter software,elan computer group,d,globetrotter in which the court relied on the lack of any california case law addressing the issue as support for its decision 
although in most cases a competitor statements regarding its competition would not fall within section,subdivision e,we decline to adopt a per se rule excluding all competitor statements from protection.instead,we must consider each case in light of its own unique facts.this was the approach taken in mann,supra,th,d,in which the defendants were alleged to have solicited the customers of a former employer with false statements that the former employer used toxic chemicals.after considering the facts surrounding the communications at issue,the court rejected the defendants contention their speech concerned a public issue because they presented no argument or evidence that their former employer is an entity in the public eye.id.at,d.in the present case,however,ihhi was very much in the public eye at the time fitzgibbons sent his missive.
further,to the extent fitzgibbons activities with wmca prior to ihhi purchase of the hospitals made him ihhi competitor,this competition ended when tenet accepted ihhi offer,months before fitzgibbons sent the.moreover,fitzgibbons membership in the medical staff medical executive committee at wmc does not make him a competitor of ihhi.see redding francis medical center d.hospitals and doctors are not in competition with each other.
because we conclude the challenged manifestly concerned a public issue,we need not decide whether it concerned an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,under section,subdivision e.
ihhi has not established a probability of prevailing on any of its claims 
having determined fitzgibbons met his burden of demonstrating his message fell within the statute,the burden now shifts to ihhi to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on its claims.
to establish a probability of prevailing,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.wilson parker,covert chidester cal th,d.in doing so,the trial court considers the pleadings and evidentiary submissions of both the plaintiff and the defendant.ibid.although the court does not weigh the credibility or comparative probative strength of competing evidence,it should grant the motion if,as a matter of law,the defendant evidence supporting the motion defeats the plaintiff attempt to establish evidentiary support for the claim.ibid.moreover,the plaintiff can not rely on the allegations of the complaint,but must produce evidence that would be admissible at trial.hms capital,lawyers title th,d hms capital.with these standards in mind,we now address each of ihhi claims.
defamation 
civil code section provides libel is a false and unprivileged publication by writing,printing,picture,effigy,or other fixed representation to the eye,which exposes any person to hatred,contempt,ridicule,or obloquy,or which causes him to be shunned or avoided,or which has a tendency to injure him in his occupation.fitzgibbons contends his may message is not actionable because it consists of only his opinion,and not factual assertions.ihhi,on the other hand,asserts that opinions and criticism may be actionable even though they are based on true statements of fact.neither paints an accurate picture of the law.
in determining whether disparaging remarks are actionable defamation,the question is not strictly whether the published statement is fact or opinion r ather,the dispositive question is whether a reasonable fact finder could conclude the published statement declares or implies a provably false assertion of fact.citation.ruiz,supra,th at,d.in other words,an opinion or legal conclusion is actionable only if it could reasonably be understood as declaring or implying actual facts capable of being proved true or false.citation.thus,an opinion based on implied,undisclosed facts is actionable if the speaker has no factual basis for the opinion.citation.an opinion is not actionable if it discloses all the statements of fact on which the opinion is based and those statements are true.citation.an opinion is actionable if it discloses all the statements of fact on which the opinion is based and those statements are false.citation.ibid.
in franklin dynamic details,th,d franklin,we contrasted opinions based upon expressly stated facts from opinions based on implied,undisclosed facts the statement,i think jones is an alcoholic,for example,is an expression of opinion based on implied facts,citation,because the statement gives rise to the inference that there are undisclosed facts that justify the forming of the opinion,citation.readers of this statement will reasonably understand the author to be implying he knows facts supporting his,that jones stops at a bar every night after work and has three martinis.if the speaker has no such factual basis for his assertion,the statement is actionable,even though phrased in terms of the author personal belief.citation.id.at,d.
an expression of opinion based on express facts would be jones moved in six months ago.he works downtown,and i have seen him during that time only twice,in his backyard around seated in a deck chair with a drink in his hand.i think he must be an alcoholic.citation.citation.this opinion disclosed all the facts on which it was based and did not imply there are other,unstated facts supporting the belief jones is an alcoholic.the opinion that jones must be an alcoholic is actionable only if the disclosed facts are false and defamatory.a statement of opinion based on fully disclosed facts can be punished only if the stated facts are themselves false and demeaning.citation.the rationale for this rule is that w hen the facts underlying a statement of opinion are disclosed,readers will understand they are getting the author interpretation of the facts presented they are therefore unlikely to construe the statement as insinuating the existence of additional,undisclosed facts.citation.when the facts supporting an opinion are disclosed,readers are free to accept or reject the author opinion based on their own independent evaluation of the facts.citations.franklin,supra,th at,d.
when determining whether a statement of opinion is actionable we examine the totality of the circumstances,starting with the language of the allegedly defamatory statement itself.ruiz,supra,th at,d.the first paragraph of fitzgibbons message reads by the way,the hospital appears to be underwater and i do think ihhi can get an investor to pony up the million,for the million shares of stock which they are selling.admissions are down.they got a reduction of costs by dumping tenet by,and increased insurance payment of but that is neutralized by the factoring.then their nursing salaries went up so they in the red.no way to get out.that is ominous.what would the buyer get buying ihhi stock control of ihhi,but not the land sounds like its going bk.get ready.
ihhi contends the opinions expressed in this portion of the hospital is underwater,ihhi is unable to find investors to purchase its stock,and it is going false and actionable libel.this portion of the,however,sets forth the basis for these opinions and does not imply other facts.specifically,these opinions appear based on the following facts admissions are down.they got a reduction of costs by dumping tenet by,and increased insurance payment of but that is neutralized by the factoring.then their nursing salaries went up because the discloses the facts underlying fitzgibbons opinions,the opinions are actionable only if these facts are false.ihhi challenges only one of the underlying facts,that a dmissions are down.
in its brief,ihhi argues that fitzgibbons bears the burden of proving the truth of the statements in his message,and that t his burden is shifted to the plaintiff only if the plaintiff is a public figure,which in this case,ihhi is not.for this proposition,ihhi cites philadelphia newspapers,hepps,d hepps.ihhi apparently did not read hepps closely because the supreme court in hepps held that the burden to prove falsity shifts to the plaintiff when the statement relates to an issue of public concern,even when the plaintiff is not a public figure.id.at.true,hepps applied the burden shifting to a situation involving a media defendant.but california has since applied hepps to cases involving nonmedia defendants.city of oakland th,d see also brown kelly broadcasting cal d,when the speech involves a matter of public concern,a plaintiff has the burden of proving the falsity of the defamation.because we have determined the at issue related to an issue of public concern,ihhi bears the burden of demonstrating the challenged statements are false.
in challenging the assertion that a dmissions are down,ihhi cites two reports covering,respectively,april and may of.these reports purport to show the number of inpatient and outpatient surgeries performed,and the revenues generated from them.ihhi asserts these reports show wmc to be above budget
