this action arises out of the merger of defendant photon dynamics photon with cr technology,crt.plaintiff richard amtower,formerly the president of crt,alleged,among other things,that certain officers and directors of photon violated section of the federal securities act of a,hereafter section,breached their fiduciary duty,and misrepresented and concealed certain facts about the transferability of the stock amtower acquired in connection with the merger.at the commencement of trial,the trial court granted an in limine motion to exclude all evidence pertaining to the section claim on the ground that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations.the jury rejected plaintiff remaining causes of action and plaintiff has appealed from the judgment.
plaintiff maintains that the trial court use of an in limine motion to adjudicate his section claim deprived him of the right to a jury trial on the statute of limitations issue.plaintiff argument highlights a procedure that has become increasingly common among litigants in our trial courts,which is the use of in limine motions as substitutes for summary adjudication motions,motions for judgment on the pleadings,or other dispositive motions authorized by statute.we have certified this case for publication in order to express our concerns surrounding the proliferation of such procedures.the better practice in nearly every case is to afford the litigant the protections provided by trial or by the statutory processes.in the present case,however,although we would have preferred that the statute of limitations issue be decided by a proper summary adjudication motion or motion for nonsuit,the trial court unorthodox procedure does not warrant reversal because plaintiff could not have prevailed under any circumstances.case no.
in a separate case,plaintiff appeals from the trial court postjudgment order awarding attorneys fees to photon.photon has filed a in that case.case no.we have ordered the two cases considered together for purposes of oral argument and decision and now affirm.
in august,the board of directors of crt and the board of directors of photon executed an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization merger agreement.under the merger agreement,which plaintiff negotiated and signed on behalf of crt,photon was to acquire crt through a pooling of interests.photon would trade shares of its stock for each share of crt stock and crt would become a subsidiary of photon.
one condition of the merger agreement was that crt shareholders sign an agreement the affiliate agreement promising not to sell the photon stock they acquired through the merger for days following the merger.plaintiff signed an affiliate agreement on his own behalf at the same time he signed the merger agreement on behalf of crt.on october,as part of the merger transaction,photon filed a form registration statement under the securities act of the statement,representing that photon common stock issued in connection with the merger will be freely transferable,except that shares issued to a crt affiliate are subject to certain restrictions on resale as set forth in the affiliate agreement.
on november,plaintiff signed an employment agreement with photon by which he agreed to continue as president of crt for an annual salary of and benefits,including options to purchase shares of photon stock options.plaintiff alleged that he was induced to enter into this agreement because of the salary,the stock options,and the expectation that he would be able to sell his photon stock shortly after the merger.when the merger was complete on november,plaintiff received approximately shares of photon common stock,which were valued at approximately per share at the time.
on december,plaintiff signed a agreement by which he promised not to sell any of his photon shares until days after photon filed a second registration statement with the securities and exchange commission in in order to carry out a public offering of photon stock.
plaintiff claimed that by the time he signed the agreement,his understanding was that the only restrictions upon the sale of his stock were the restrictions imposed by federal law and those contained in the affiliate and agreements.the ability to sell the stock was important to plaintiff.he explained at trial that crt had received an offer to purchase the company for cash but turned it down in favor of photon proposed transaction,based upon assurances that the crt shareholders would be able to promptly and freely sell the photon stock acquired in connection with the merger.
according to plaintiff,defendant richard dissly,photon chief financial officer,telephoned him after the merger was complete and told him,for the first time,that photon had a policy that was designed to prevent officers and directors from selling photon stock in violation of federal laws insider trading policy.dissly explained that the policy created temporary quarterly blackout periods for selling stock and provided for a securities watch team,made up of dissly and photon chief executive officer,defendant vincent sollitto.the securities watch team was charged with ensuring compliance with the policy.insiders were to obtain permission from the securities watch team before selling any photon stock.dissly allegedly assured plaintiff that,notwithstanding the policy terms,which gave dissly and sollitto the power to prohibit a sale for any reason,amtower would be permitted to sell as much of his stock as he wanted as long as the sale did not take place during the specified periods.dissly said that plaintiff employment by photon was contingent upon his agreement to be bound by the policy.allegedly relying upon dissly representations,plaintiff agreed.
in early may,when the trading windows had opened under the affiliate agreement,the agreement,and the insider trading policy,and when the value of the stock had increased to over per share,plaintiff claims that he asked the securities watch team for permission to sell all his stock but permission was denied.the securities watch team allowed him to sell a small portion of his holdings approximately shares but no more.plaintiff later decided that he would rather be free to sell his stock than be an officer of photon and,therefore,resigned on april,by which time the stock had dropped in value to less than per share.
ii.procedural background 
plaintiff sued photon,dissly and sollitto,and photon directors francois henley,floyd kvamme,barry cox,michael kim,and malcolm thompson,complaining that he had been misled about the transferability of photon stock.he filed the initial complaint on april,alleging causes of action for breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,negligence,and several species of fraud.plaintiff first amended complaint filed on january,added a cause of action for violation of section.that cause of action alleged that the statement contained omissions and misrepresentations in that it characterized the photon stock as freely transferable and did not reveal the existence of the insider trading policy that prohibited the sale of photon stock during quarterly blackout periods and required prior approval from the securities watch team in order to sell at any other time.
on april,the superior court sustained a demurer,without leave to amend,to the causes of action for breach of contract and negligence.remaining for trial were causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty,fraudulent inducement,fraudulent concealment,intentional misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation,and the eighth cause of action for violation of section.
trial commenced april.defendants filed several motions in limine seeking to exclude or restrict plaintiff evidence.one motion in limine requested an order excluding the testimony of plaintiff expert witness,law professor kenneth scott,on the ground the testimony would consist solely of legal standards and conclusions.the trial court decided to limit scott opinion to whether dissly had violated a duty of candor and good faith in his discussions with plaintiff.
another motion in limine sought an order excluding evidence to support plaintiff section claim.in the alternative,defendants requested an evidence code section hearing or a separate trial on their statute of limitations defense to the section claim.the court chose to hold what it characterized as a.evidence consisted of the pertinent documents and plaintiff testimony concerning his discovery of the alleged omissions and misrepresentations in the statement.based upon the evidence presented,the court concluded that plaintiff section claim was barred by the statute of limitations,as a matter of law,because plaintiff actually knew of the omissions and misrepresentations in the statement as early as december.
at the close of the evidence the trial court granted the motions for nonsuit made by the five photon directors.by special verdict,the jury found that sollitto and dissly had not made any false representations or concealed material facts regarding the insider trading policy and that neither had breached his fiduciary duty to plaintiff.the trial court entered judgment for defendants in the amount of,of which reflected the trial court determination of reasonable attorneys fees allowed for defense of the section and breach of contract causes of action.the court refused to award photon fees for defense of the lawsuit as a whole,rejecting the argument that the affiliate agreement,which did not contain an attorneys fees clause,actually incorporated the attorneys fees clause from the merger agreement.
iii.plaintiff contentions 
plaintiff makes the following contentions in these appeals 
the trial court deprived plaintiff of his right to a jury trial by dismissing the section claim during in limine proceedings and erred in concluding that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations.
the trial court abused its discretion in precluding plaintiff expert from testifying about the standards,customs,and general background information pertaining to corporations and the securities industry.
the trial court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys fees to defendants for defense of the section claim on the ground the claim was without merit and bordered on frivolity.
the trial court erred in awarding defendants attorneys fees incurred in defending the cause of action labeled breach of contract because that cause of action really sounded in tort.
in its,photon contends that the affiliate agreement,upon which plaintiff lawsuit was largely based,incorporated the attorneys fees clause from the merger agreement so that photon was entitled to recover all its fees incurred in defending this lawsuit.
v.the motion in limine concerning the statute of limitations 
background 
section describes the civil liability imposed for filing a false statement.the section creates a private right of action where,any part of the registration statement,when such part became effective,contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading a.the applicable statute of limitations is set forth in title of the united states code section,which provides that the action must be commenced within one year after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission,or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence,but in no event later than three years after the sale or public offering of the security.
plaintiff eighth cause of action alleged that when defendants signed and filed the statement on october,the statement contained untrue and false statements of material facts and omitted and failed to state material facts that misled plaintiff and deprived him of the opportunity to make intelligent and informed decisions as to whether to agree to the merger and acquire shares of photon stock.the allegedly false statement was that the only restrictions on the sale of photon stock by amtower would be those imposed by federal law and set forth in the affiliate agreement.the statement allegedly omitted the material fact that photon had an insider trading policy and securities watch team that imposed additional restrictions on the sale of photon stock.plaintiff further alleged that he did not know of the falsity of the statement until june,when he obtained a copy of the statement.just days before trial,at his continued deposition,plaintiff testified that he had actually read the statement in.that testimony showed that plaintiff must have been aware of any deficiency in the statement in,and since the instant action was not filed until april,defendants decided that the section claim must be barred by the statute of limitations.they raised the issue by way of a motion in limine.
the trial court decided to hold a without a jury.plaintiff was the only witness.he testified that he had reviewed the statement for accuracy in,that he was given an internal company policy on december,that pertained to insider trading,and that he was later given a second policy the insider trading policy at issue here,which he reviewed and signed on december.plaintiff admitted that when he reviewed the statement in he was aware that it made no mention of any insider trading policy.the trial court ruled as follows 
the court finds that in order for there to be a cause of action here,it must be proven that there was an omission to state a material fact which was required to be stated in the.the complaint about omissions involved the insider trading policy plaintiff,the court finds,knew of these material omissions in december of the discovery of the omission was december.cause of action was not filed until after the year the statute had expired therefore,this cause of action is time barred.
use of the in limine proceedings to dismiss the eighth cause of action 
plaintiff argues that the trial court ruling deprived him of his right to a jury trial on the statute of limitations defense.jefferson county of kern th,d.photon does not dispute that the running of the statute of limitations is ordinarily a question of fact upon which a plaintiff has the right to a jury.photon position is that there was no question of fact and that its in limine motion was the proper vehicle for the court to decide the issue as a matter of law.
strictly speaking,photon motion was not an in limine motion.in limine motions are designed to facilitate the management of a case,generally by deciding difficult evidentiary issues in advance of trial.the usual purpose of motions in limine is to preclude the presentation of evidence deemed inadmissible and prejudicial by the moving party.a typical order in limine excludes the challenged evidence and directs counsel,parties,and witnesses not to refer to the excluded matters during trial.witkin,cal.evidence.ed,supra,at.the advantage of such motions is to avoid the obviously futile attempt to unring the bell in the event a motion to strike is granted in the proceedings before the jury.hyatt sierra boat d.kelly new west federal savings th,d.what in limine motions are not designed to do is to replace the dispositive motions prescribed by the code of civil procedure.it has become increasingly common,however,for litigants to utilize in limine motions for this purpose.
these nontraditional in limine motions can result in a court dismissing a cause on the pleadings.see,coshow city of escondido th,d trial court construed motions in limine as a motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the action.some courts have also used the in limine process to examine the sufficiency of the evidence.for example,in michelson camp th,d,in response to allegations in the defendant trial brief,the trial court instructed the plaintiffs to make an offer of proof as to the existence of damages.construing the plaintiffs offer of proof as tantamount to an opening statement with regard to evidence of damages,the trial court concluded that,as a matter of law,the plaintiffs could not show recoverable damages and granted a nonsuit for the defense.id.at,d.a similar situation was considered in group,home indemnity th,d,an insurance coverage case.the trial court ordered the plaintiff to file a pretrial motion in limine setting forth its best case scenario in favor of coverage.id.at,d.the trial court concluded that,even under plaintiff best case scenario,there was no potential for coverage and entered judgment for the defense.ibid.the appellate court characterized the unusual and unorthodox procedure as,in effect,a motion for nonsuit,or demurrer to the evidence.id.at,d see also atkinson elk th,d trial court granted nonsuit on its own motion after studying the law and inviting stipulations concerning the contractual relationship between the parties.
in purpose and effect,the foregoing nonstatutory procedures are merely substitutes for the dispositive motions authorized by statute.appellate courts are becoming increasingly wary of this tactic.see r b auto center,farmers group,th,d conc.opn.of rylaarsdam,to have the sufficiency of the pleading or the existence of triable issues of material fact decided in the guise of a motion in limine is a perversion of the process.the disadvantages of such shortcuts are obvious.they circumvent procedural protections provided by the statutory motions or by trial on the merits they risk blindsiding the nonmoving party and,in some cases,they could infringe a litigant right to a jury trial.cal,art.i.adherence to the statutory processes would avoid all these risks.furthermore,these irregular procedures can result in unnecessary reversals.the risk of reversal arises when appellate courts are required to review a dispositive ruling on an in limine motion as if it were the product of a motion for nonsuit after opening statement.g ranting of a nonsuit after an opening statement is a disfavored practice it will be upheld only when it is clear that counsel has undertaken to state all of the facts which he expects to prove and it is plainly evident that those facts will not constitute a cause of action.uccello laudenslayer d.and see john norton farms,todagco d.the standard of review in such cases requires that all inferences and conflicts in the evidence be resolved in favor of the losing party and against the judgment.panico truck ins.exchange th,d.in contrast,on appeal from a judgment following trial,appellate review favors the judgment.in re marriage of arceneaux cal d.thus,some cases will be subject to reversal where,had the trial court just taken the time to hold a trial,reversal would not be warranted.panico truck ins.exchange,supra,th at,d.
in spite of the obvious drawbacks to the use of in limine motions to dispose of a claim,trial courts do have the inherent power to use them in this way.lucas county of los angeles th,d see also coshow city of escondido,supra,th at,d atkinson elk,supra,th,d finding the court nonsuit before opening statement to be irregular but not prejudicial and see code civ.courts have inherent power,separate from any statutory authority,to control the litigation before them and to adopt any suitable method of practice,even if the method is not specified by statute or by the rules of court.bauguess paine cal d,tide water oil superior court cal d,citizens utilities superior court cal d.but when the trial court utilizes the in limine process to dispose of a case or cause of action for evidentiary reasons,we review the result as we would the grant of a motion for nonsuit after opening statement,keeping in mind that the grant of such a motion is not favored,that a key consideration is that the nonmoving party has had a full and fair opportunity to state all the facts in its favor,and that all inferences and conflicts in the evidence must be viewed most favorably to the nonmoving party.
in the present case,plaintiff did not make an opening statement.and,unlike the process employed in some of the cases,plaintiff was not offered the chance to make a comprehensive offer of proof.see,michelson camp,supra,th at,d and group,home indemnity,supra,th at,d.he certainly was not afforded the detailed procedural protections he would have had if photon had filed a summary adjudication motion or had the court allowed the statute of limitations defense to be tried separately as contemplated by code of civil procedure section.nevertheless,the perfunctory nature of the proceedings does not warrant reversal if the record shows that plaintiff could not have prevailed under any circumstances.atkinson elk,supra,th at,d.that is the case here.as we shall explain in the following section,plaintiff could not have produced any additional evidence that would have changed the result.accordingly,the procedural irregularity was harmless.
c.the statute of limitations 
plaintiff maintains that actual knowledge of the contents of the statement and the insider trading policy was not sufficient to put him on inquiry notice of fraud.simply knowing that the statement failed to mention the insider trading policy was not enough,he says,to put him on notice that the statement contained a material omission,namely,that his stock would not be freely transferable except as specified in the affiliate and lockout agreements.he claims that merely reading the documents did not give him reason to believe that defendants were affirmatively lying and actively concealing the true nature and meaning of the policy.
defendants representations to plaintiff outside the statement are not relevant to the section claim.section is a strict liability statute.in re daou systems,cir.violation of section does not require proof of plaintiff reliance or any of the elements of fraud.see fischman raytheon cir,in re global crossing.securities litigation d.violation of section is established by showing that the registration statement contained an omission or misrepresentation and that the omission or misrepresentation was such that it would have misled any reasonable investor about the nature of the investment.in re stac electronics securities litigation cir.the limitations period for a section claim begins to run upon discovery of the untrue statement or the omission.the cases plaintiff cites are inapplicable here because they involve securities fraud actions they do not pertain to section.gray first winthrop cir section b of the securities exchange act of davis birr,wilson,cir,same cook avien,cir,section of the securities act of.
dissly alleged assurances to plaintiff did not change the fact that the statement did not mention the company internal policies limiting transferability of the shares beyond that described in the statement.limitations in the insider trading policies that did not appear in the statement were the quarterly blackout periods and the requirement that insiders obtain approval before selling their shares at any time outside those blackout periods.there is no dispute that these omissions were material.indeed,that is the gist of plaintiff entire case.plaintiff conceded in the pretrial hearing that he had seen and read the statement and both insider trading policies in.these facts conclusively demonstrate that plaintiff had actual knowledge,in,of a material omission or misrepresentation in the statement.since he did not file his complaint until april,well over a year after he admittedly read all the pertinent documents,the section claim was barred.
plaintiff argues that the statute was tolled during the time defendants owed him a fiduciary duty as the officers and directors of photon.we reject the argument.it is true that,in some cases,a confidential or fiduciary relationship between a defendant and a plaintiff will toll the statute of limitations.united states liab.ins,cal d.that is because such relationships carry a duty of full disclosure and delaying accrual of the statute prevents the fiduciary from obtaining immunity for an initial breach of duty by a subsequent breach of the obligation of disclosure.neel magana,olney,levy,cathcart gelfand cal d.here,defendants disclosed the facts necessary to support the section cause of action in december.even if the statute is subject to tolling,we decline to apply the concept in this case since the nature of the relationship between plaintiff and defendants did not prevent plaintiff from discovering the misrepresentations in the statement.
accepting,as we must,that the facts to which plaintiff testified are true group,home indemnity,supra,th at,d,the inescapable conclusion is that the section claim was barred by the statute of limitations as a matter of law.there is no evidence that plaintiff could produce that would change this result.accordingly,there was no issue for the jury to decide and the trial court properly dismissed the section claim.
vi.defendants motion in limine re expert testimony 
background 
defendants motions in limine also sought an order limiting or excluding the testimony of plaintiff expert,professor kenneth scott,a retired professor of law and business at stanford university.defendants maintained that the professor intended testimony would consist primarily of explanations of the law,subjects that defendants claimed were inappropriate for expert testimony and,therefore,should be excluded.plaintiff counsel explained that scott would testify as to the types of things that are disclosed in an statement as a matter of good corporate practice.he would also testify about the fiduciary relationship between a corporation officers and directors and its shareholders.the trial court deferred ruling on the motion and obtained a copy of the expert deposition to read.
on the day scott was to testify,the trial court made its ruling.the court noted that scott deposition had made it clear that he was prepared to testify about only the section and breach of fiduciary duty causes of action.therefore,scott could not render any opinions on the fraud counts.he did do so at deposition he should not be allowed to do so now.as to the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action,scott had opined that,to the extent dissly or sollitto had induced plaintiff to sign an agreement by untruthful statements,they had breached the fiduciary duty they owed him as shareholder.the court pointed out that,assuming the case went to the jury,there would be an instruction on the fiduciary duty that officers and directors owed to the shareholders.there a question in my mind as to whether the things that professor scott is going to talk about are really things that the jurors do understand already.although the court was tempted to exclude the testimony altogether,the court decided to allow limited questioning.the question i going to allow is,in essence,assuming that the judge tells the jury that a director owes a duty of candor and good faith and fair dealing to its shareholders,how did dissly violate that duty in his discussions amtower getting him to sign the shareholder agreement.that it.that what i allowing.
once scott took the stand,plaintiff counsel asked a number of questions to which objections were sustained on grounds of relevance,overbreadth,and,in some instances,that the question called for a conclusion of law.for example,counsel asked,can you tell us,what a corporation is and how it comes into existence c an you describe for us what the basic duties of a fiduciary are and can you tell us what the fiduciary duty is that a director,and officer has to a shareholder 
finally,counsel posed,without objection,one long hypothetical question.he asked scott to assume as true plaintiff version of the events,that the agreements were signed and representations were made as plaintiff claimed they had been.counsel then asked if,under those circumstances,it was scott opinion that dissly had violated his fiduciary duty.scott agreed that,yes,that would be his opinion,and he was allowed to explain why that was so.
the opinion of an expert witness is limited to testimony r elated to a subject that is sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact,subd.a.on the other hand,e xpert opinion is not admissible if it consists of inferences and conclusions which can be drawn as easily and intelligently by the trier of fact as by the witness.people valdez th,d.furthermore,t he calling of lawyers as expert witnesses to give opinions as to the application of the law to particular facts usurps the duty of the trial court to instruct the jury on the law as applicable to the facts,and results in no more than a modern day trial by oath in which the side producing the greater number of lawyers able to opine in their favor wins.downer bramet d.on review,we may not disturb the trial court ruling on the admissibility of opinion evidence absent an abuse of discretion.caloroso hathaway th,d.
plaintiff maintains that he should have been allowed to ask scott questions concerning the standards,customs,and practices in the securities industry.the testimony was necessary,plaintiff claims,to assist the jury in making its determinations on the ultimate questions of whether defendants violated section of the securities act and defrauded and breached a fiduciary duty to plaintiff and to allow scott to comment upon issues critical to assessing the parties credibility.
to the extent plaintiff argument is that the testimony was relevant to plaintiff section claim,we reject it.the trial court properly dismissed that claim prior to trial.to the extent plaintiff argument is that testimony was relevant to his fraud claims,we reject that as well.the trial court properly prohibited any opinions relating to the fraud causes of action since scott had testified at his deposition that he had formed no opinions on those causes of action.jones moore th,d trial court may exclude expert opinion that goes beyond the opinions expressed at deposition.the only remaining cause of action to which the expert could properly have testified was the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.
the elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty are the existence of a fiduciary relationship,its breach,and damage proximately caused by that breach.city of atascadero merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,th,d.whether a fiduciary duty exists is generally a question of law.david welch erskine tulley d.whether the defendant breached that duty towards the plaintiff is a question of fact.ibid.thus,insofar as the excluded testimony would have described the fiduciary relationship,it was properly excluded as pertaining to a question of law.the judge would explain that in the jury instructions.downer bramet,supra,d at.as to the factual element of breach,scott was allowed to give his opinion as to how defendants breached their duty to plaintiff.in explaining his opinion,scott opined t he statements being made by dissly to amtower in connection with obtaining his signature,his agreement to the new insider trading policy were untrue and misleading in material respects and that that would violate a fiduciary duty of honesty and candor in dealing with someone to whom the fiduciary owed that duty.what plaintiff should have been told was the accurate state of affairs relating to the policy and whether the scope of restriction that he would be agreeing to observe with respect to any transactions in his own photon stock was as broad as to give the securities watch team,in effect,a complete discretion and absolute veto over any sales of stock by him.we fail to see how a discussion of the customs and practices in the securities industry would have added any substance to plaintiff fiduciary duty claim.there was no abuse of discretion.
vii.attorneys fees 
background 
photon filed a motion for attorneys fees.the motion had three bases.photon first cited title of the united states code section e,which allows a prevailing party to recover attorneys fees for a section cause of action if the court believes the suit or the defense to have been without merit.photon argued that plaintiff section claim was meritless,and,therefore,it was entitled to recoup the attorneys fees they incurred in defending that claim.second,photon argued that the attorneys fees clause in the employment agreement applied to plaintiff breach of contract claim so that it was entitled to fees for its defense of that cause of action as well.third,photon maintained that the attorneys fees clause in the merger agreement,which,it claimed,was incorporated into the affiliate agreement,provided an independent ground for an order awarding photon all of its legal expenses incurred in the lawsuit.
the trial court granted the motion in part.with respect to the section claim,the court stated the court finds entirely persuasive that amtower section claim was without merit and bordered on frivolity,especially given the court conclusion that amtower knew or reasonably should have known from the outset of filing this cause of action that his section claim would never have survived the limitations period under title of the united states code s ection.this court in its discretion believes that reasonable costs should be awarded photon for its expenses in defending this claim.the court found that it could not apportion the fees based upon counsel billing records but recognized that the section claim was narrower in scope than plaintiff general fraud claims so that all fees generated during the life of the section claim could not fairly be recovered.the court determined that the reasonable amount of attorneys fees for the pertinent period from january when the section claim was added to the date of trial was.the court awarded photon percent of that total,or.
the trial court also concluded that photon was entitled to fees under the employment contract,which included an attorneys fees clause,for defense of plaintiff breach of contract cause of action.the court determined that plaintiff tort allegations overlapped the contract allegations such that allocation was not required.the court awarded photon,reflecting reasonable attorneys fees incurred from april when the complaint was filed through april when the breach of contract cause of action was dismissed.the trial court refused to award additional fees under the merger agreement.
plaintiff appeal 
fees for defending the section claim 
unless a contract or statute provides otherwise,each party to a lawsuit must pay its own attorney fees.code civ.section e provides that if any suit under that section or any other section of the securities act is without merit,the court may award attorneys fees when the defendants prevail.e.the without merit standard encompasses claims and defenses that either are brought in bad faith or border on the frivolous.western federal erickson cir,see also,aizuss commonwealth equity trust.we review the trial court decision awarding fees under section e for abuse of discretion.layman combs cir.
plaintiff argues that his section claim was not frivolous because he had a reasonable basis for arguing that just because he looked at the statement he was not on inquiry notice as a matter of law.as we explained above,plaintiff duty of inquiry is irrelevant.he actually knew,in,after reading the statement and the insider trading policies,that the statement did not contain any reference to the policies,which is the omission that plaintiff claims violated section.plaintiff insistence that his actual knowledge of the omission did not put him on inquiry notice makes no sense.according to black law dictionary,inquiry notice is notice attributed to a person when the information would lead an ordinarily prudent person to investigate the matter further.black law dict.ed.that is to say,the concept of inquiry notice applies only where the plaintiff does not already have actual notice of the facts supporting his cause of action.section is a strict liability statute.in re daou systems,supra,at.the mere existence of the omission or misrepresentation is sufficient to support a claim under section.since plaintiff had actual notice of the facts to support his section claim at least as early as december,his repeated insistence that there existed a factual dispute based upon the concept of inquiry notice can reasonably be said to have bordered on the frivolous.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in so finding.
fees for defense of the breach of contract cause of action 
the employment agreement between plaintiff and photon contained an attorneys fees clause,which stated,if either party hereto brings any action to enforce its rights hereunder,the prevailing party in any such action shall be entitled to recover his or its reasonable attorneys fees and costs incurred in connection with such action.plaintiff first cause of action,which was entitled breach of contract,pertained to the employment agreement between plaintiff and photon.plaintiff now argues that the cause of action was not really a contract cause of action.the argument is disingenuous,at best.
whether an action is based on contract or tort depends upon the nature of the right sued upon,not the form of the pleading or relief demanded.if based on breach of promise it is contractual if based on breach of a noncontractual duty it is tortious.citation.if unclear the action will be considered based on contract rather than tort.citation.in the final analysis we look to the pleading to determine the nature of plaintiff claim.arthur sachs,city of oceanside d.kangarlou progressive title,th,d.where the pertinent facts are not in dispute,we independently review the trial court determination pertaining to an award of attorney fees under a contractual provision.id.at,d.
plaintiff claims that,in spite of its contract label,the first cause of action alleged only tort defendants fraudulently misrepresented and concealed the nature and meaning of the insider trading policy.in the first amended complaint,plaintiff cause of action for breach of contract alleged that when he signed the employment agreement,photon did not intend to perform the conditions of that agreement and breached that agreement when it refused amtower requests to sell all of his photon stock.the insider trading policy was one of the internal rules and policies that photon agreed to follow when it entered into the employment agreement with amtower and the periods of time set forth in the insider trading policy in which amtower could not sell photon stock were not in effect when amtower asked for permission to sell all of his photon stock.although it is no model of clarity,the paragraph does allege that photon breached the conditions of the employment agreement when it refused plaintiff permission to sell all his photon stock.plaintiff now claims that the pleading was really intended to allege the tort of promissory fraud.that claim is belied by his revision of the first cause of action after the trial court sustained defendants first demurrer with leave to amend.
in the second amended complaint,the first cause of action was again labeled as a breach of contract cause of action and its specific allegations were as follows when dissly told amtower about the insider trading policy for the first time and told him that he would be terminated if he did not agree to follow the insider trading policy and get permission from the securities watch team before he sold any of his photon stock,he acted on behalf of photon and its board of directors and made it impossible for photon to perform the terms of the employment agreement and breached the employment agreement on behalf of photon and repudiated it by implication.the employment agreement did not give photon and its board of directors the right to terminate amtower if he did not comply with the insider trading policy and get permission from the securities watch team before he sold any of his photon stock and the threat to terminate amtower if he did not comply with the insider trading policy and get permission from the securities watch team before he sold any of his photon stock was a breach of the employment agreement and anticipatory repudiation of the employment agreement.
as this passage plainly shows,the wrong plaintiff was attempting to allege in the first cause of action was defendants breach of a duty established by the employment agreement.the cause of action does not even touch upon defendants alleged misrepresentations concerning the insider trading policy.nor does it allege,as plaintiff now claims,that defendants had fraudulently induced plaintiff to enter into any agreements.
it is true that the cause of action incorporates the factual allegations pertaining to defendants alleged fraud as set forth in the first part of the pleading.but the first cause of action repeatedly invokes the language of contract and the prayer includes a request for attorneys fees,the only source for which is the employment agreement.thus,the first cause of action was unquestionably an attempt by plaintiff to enforce his rights under the employment agreement it was an action on the contract.photon was entitled to its attorneys fees in defending that claim.
apportionment 
plaintiff finally contends that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to apportion the fees photon incurred up to the time the contract cause of action was dismissed.reynolds metals alperson cal d,which involved a claim for fees under civil code section,held as follows where a cause of action based on the contract providing for attorney fees is joined with other causes of action beyond the contract,the prevailing party may recover attorney fees under section only as they relate to the contract action.the court clarified that fees need not be apportioned when incurred for representation on an issue common to both a cause of action in which fees are proper and one in which they are not allowed.all expenses incurred with respect to the issues common to all causes of action qualify for award.reynolds metals alperson,supra,cal d at.thus,allocation is not required when the issues are so interrelated that it would have been impossible to separate them into claims for which attorney fees are properly awarded and claims for which they are not.akins enterprise th,d.
where fees are authorized for some causes of action in a complaint but not for others,allocation is a matter within the trial court discretion.erickson concepts,th,d.a trial court exercise of discretion is abused only when its ruling exceeds the bounds of reason,all of the circumstances before it being considered.san dieguito partnership san dieguito river valley regional.authority th,d,disapproved on another point in plcm group,drexler cal th,d.
plaintiff argues the trial court abused its discretion in failing to apportion fees incurred on the contract claim and fees incurred on the remaining seven causes of action.plaintiff cites heppler peters th,d,in support of his argument.in heppler,the plaintiffs sued a contractor,who against four subcontractors,for construction defects.the trial court awarded plaintiffs all their requested attorney fees against one subcontractor,martin,pursuant to a contract provision.the court of appeal found this to be an abuse of discretion,noting martin part of the case could have been tried in considerably less time than seven weeks had the trial not taken up issues that involved the other nonsettling subcontractors.it strikes us as eminently unfair to tag martin with all of plaintiffs attorney fees for the entire trial.not all the issues involving martin case were integrally associated with the other issues in the case at the very least,some of them could have been severed and isolated for purposes of the attorney fees award.id.at,d.
this case is not like heppler.in heppler,there was a clear line of demarcation between the claims against one subcontractor and the claims against the others.here there is no clear distinctions.although there were seven causes of action other than the breach of contract cause of action,the allegations of all eight overlapped.plaintiff alleged that defendants misrepresented and concealed material information that led him to enter into agreements to which he would not have agreed otherwise,that as a result of those misrepresentations plaintiff acquired photon stock that he was prevented from selling,and that defendants conduct in preventing plaintiff from selling the stock was a breach of one or more of the agreements.all of the causes of action in the pleading relied upon the same factual allegations.considering these circumstances,the trial court ruling that the legal services rendered on behalf of the contract cause of action could not be separated from the services rendered for the lawsuit as a whole did not exceed the bounds of reason.
fees under the affiliate agreement 
except for the first cause of action for breach of contract,which focused upon the employment agreement,plaintiff suit was primarily based upon the affiliate and agreements.plaintiff claimed that he was led to believe that the affiliate and agreements,in combination with federal law,set the rules pertaining to his sale of photon stock but that defendants actual intention was to prevent him from selling all his stock,in spite of the conditions set forth in those two agreements.following trial,photon argued that the affiliate agreement,which did not contain an attorneys fees clause,effectively incorporated all the terms of the merger agreement,which did.photon claimed,therefore,that it was entitled to all its reasonable attorneys fees defending the entire action.the trial court rejected the argument.photon now argues that the trial court erred in its interpretation of the agreements.
as we stated above,the determination of the legal basis for an attorney fee award is a question of law,which we review independently of the trial court.akins enterprise,supra,th at,d.in particular,we independently review the trial court determination with respect to whether the terms of a written agreement constitute a legal basis for awarding attorney fees.exxess electronixx heger realty th,d.to resolve the parties dispute concerning the meaning of the two agreements at issue,we resort to the traditional rules governing interpretation of contracts,which teach us that the overriding goal of interpretation is to give effect to the parties mutual intentions as of the time of contracting where contract language is clear and explicit and does not lead to absurd results,we ascertain intent from the written terms and go no further.shaw regents of university of california th,d shaw,quoting ticor title ins.employers ins.of wausau th,d.
