this case emanates from a stock purchase transaction pursuant to which appellant media general,media general acquired park communications,park from donald tomlin,tomlin and gary knapp knapp,park sole shareholders.after the deal had been closed,media general filed an action in district court against appellees tomlin,knapp,wright thomas thomas,stephen burr burr,and the law firm eckert seamans cherin mellott,llc eckert seamans,alleging securities fraud under b of the securities exchange act of,b,and securities and exchange commission sec rule,common law fraud,and civil conspiracy,and seeking damages in connection with its purchase of park.media general principal complaint is that,during their negotiations,appellees deliberately deceived media general by concealing and misrepresenting a threat by a former park employee,rick prusator prusator,to bring a multimillion dollar law suit against park.media general contends that,in concealing the full extent of prusator claims,park unlawfully withheld information that was material at the time of negotiations between park and media general.
the district court granted summary judgment to appellees.the trial court noted that,within days of acquiring park,media general was legally required to file an form with the sec disclosing any material contingencies such as lawsuits that might be material to park financial condition.although media general became aware of the full extent of prusator claims within two weeks of acquiring park,the prusator claims were not listed as a material loss contingency in the filing.in the district court view,the filing proved beyond any doubt that the prusator claims were not material to media general.the district court thus held that,h aving conceded in this case that it deemed the prusator litigation not to be material,media general can not now oppose summary judgment against it by claiming that appellees alleged failure to disclose the full extent of prusator claims was material.media general,tomlin,mem.op.at june.because materiality is an essential element of each of media general claims,the district court concluded that appellees were entitled to summary judgment.
media general now appeals,claiming that the district court erred in concluding that media general filing constituted a concession that prusator threatened claims were not material to its purchase of park.on the record at hand,we conclude that media general has created a triable question of fact as to whether the relevant circumstances changed between the time of the closing and the time of the sec filing.a reasonable jury could find that the prusator matter was material at the time of the negotiations between park and media general even though it was later viewed as immaterial at the time of the filing.the district court thus erred in granting summary judgment to appellees.accordingly,we reverse and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
on july,appellant media general,a publicly owned communications company,entered into a merger agreement the merger agreement with park acquisitions,pai,a holding company for park stock.the merger agreement specified that media general would gain control of all park stock in exchange for cash payments to tomlin and knapp,park sole shareholders.the total consideration for the merger was to be million,exclusive of certain adjustments and debt to be assumed by media general.at closing,thomas,president of park,was to receive a substantial severance package.burr and his law firm,eckert seamans,represented park,pai,tomlin,and knapp during the merger negotiations.media general,tomlin,no.civ,wl,at.

on december,eckert seamans prepared an audit response letter audit letter for park auditors,coopers lybrand,llc coopers,in which they reported prusator expanded claims as a material loss contingenc y.see eckert seamans letter,deposition of stephen burr.the audit letter indicates that eckert seamans was unable to predict the outcome or to estimate the amount or range of potential loss with respect to the prusator matter.eckert seamans letter.following receipt of the audit letter,coopers concluded that the prusator claims met coopers materiality thresholds for disclosure and included a footnote referencing prusator in park draft audited financial statement for the period ending september.deposition of phillip gregory.media general did not see the audit letter or the draft audited financial statement until january,after the merger deal had been closed.
media general alleges that,in the months after it received prusator september,letter,it made several inquiries of park regarding the details of prusator claims and was never informed by appellees of prusator new claims.see deposition of stephen dickinson,deposition of marshall morton.according to media general,on january,the day before the scheduled closing of the merger,thomas and burr stated that the maximum liability that could result from prusator threatened lawsuit was.at closing,the parties agreed to amend the merger agreement to provide that media general would assume responsibility for the resolution of prusator claims in exchange for a reduction in the purchase price,which constituted the amount of the disputed severance payment plus an allowance for fees and expenses.

on january,in accordance with sec regulations,media general filed an form with the sec.in its filing,media general was required to disclose any contingencies that would be material to park financial condition.see a.in light of the january,remoteness letter from eckert seamans and coopers decision to delete the prusator matter from the draft financial statement,media general concluded that it was unnecessary to include prusato
