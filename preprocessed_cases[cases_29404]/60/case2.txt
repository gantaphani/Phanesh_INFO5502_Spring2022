we must interpret a merger agreement in which one party agreed to indemnify the other against a purely hypothetical tax loss.the sellers agreed to indemnify the buyer for the tax liabilities of the company being sold,except that the tax bills for indemnification purposes were to be calculated as if certain deductions would not be taken,when both parties knew they would be.given that these deductions,perhaps in combination with other deductions,reduced the company tax liability to zero,the company tax prepayments and credits were refunded in their entirety,benefitting the buyer as the company new owner.yet,because the calculation of the indemnity obligation was based on a counterfactual measure of tax liability,that calculation resulted in the sellers nonetheless owing the buyer a substantial amount of money.the issue that divides the parties is whether the prepayments and credits,and resulting tax refunds,affect the tax indemnification obligation of the sellers.
the district court concluded that the indemnification provision,by its terms,unambiguously required that the indemnity obligation be offset by the amount of the refunded prepayments and credits.it therefore entered judgment on the pleadings in favor of the seller.
we conclude that the indemnification provision is ambiguous as to how the tax refunds affect the indemnification obligation of the sellers.though these sophisticated parties knew of the tax prepayments and credits,and expected substantial tax refunds,they failed to specify how those refunds should be treated.this critical omission renders their contract ambiguous on the issue before us.the plain language arguments of the parties are not fully convincing reasonable interpretations of the text support both positions.their arguments about the purpose and negotiating history of the provision can not be resolved without the aid of a.indeed,the parties dispute key facts about the company tax refunds.hence,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
background 
the indemnity provision at issue is part of a merger agreement by which mercury systems,mercury purchased kor electronics kor from kor stockholders and optionholders securityholders,represented on appeal by shareholder representative services,srs.consistent with the terms of the agreement,mercury created a merger subsidiary king merger and merged it with and into kor,which thus became a subsidiary of mercury.
mercury agreed to pay kor securityholders million for the company,with adjustments for,inter alia,expenses and the amount of cash and debt on kor books as of the closing date.merger agreement ma.these adjustments would be based on a balance sheet reflecting estimates of kor assets and liabilities,which kor promised to provide.ma a.of the purchase amount of million,million would be paid into an escrow account to cover various obligations of the securityholders.ma b.
the indemnity arrangement relevant to this appeal is set forth in detail in article x,section a,and referenced in sections and a and b.section a provides that srs will prepare kor federal and state tax returns.then,srs,on behalf of the former securityholders,must release money from the escrow account to pay mercury the amount of the aggregate tax liabilities due,if any.app.the unusual feature of the arrangement is how the obligation to pay mercury was to be measured.when preparing kor tax returns,srs was required to claim two types of expenses as tax deductions.this requirement is stated in section a and echoed in sections a and b.app.requiring srs to giv e effect to any deductions described in section.id.at specifying that the deductions shall be claimed id.same.however,the securityholders obligation to pay mercury was to be calculated without claiming those deductions.ma a.the arrangement is set forth as follows 
f or purposes of determining the tax liability due with respect to such tax return for purposes of calculating the securityholders indemnification obligations,the determination of the tax liability for any such pre closing tax period will be calculated and determined excluding any deductions described in section below.the amounts actually due on the tax return after giving effect to any deductions described in section.below shall promptly be paid by mercury to the appropriate governmental authority.
id.app.emphasis in original.in other words,mercury would receive,in payment of the indemnity obligation,an amount from escrow equal to kor tax liabilities as calculated without the deductions,but pay kor actual taxes if any were still owed computed with the deductions.because kor was required to claim the section deductions on its tax return,the calculation of taxes without those deductions was necessarily greater than kor actual taxes owed.srs conceded in the district court that this arrangement could require it to pay mercury for a phantom liability for indemnification purposes that is not actually due to the government.
section a creates an obligation specific to one tax year,the year to which the tax deductions apply.further,by its terms,section a applies only to taxes related to returns due after the closing date.app.the parties identify no tax period,other than,for which returns had yet to be filed as of december.this obligation specific to is distinct from the conventional tax indemnification provision in section,which applies more generally to all time periods 
e ach securityholder shall indemnify and hold harmless mercury from,against and in respect of any and all losses that constitute or that result from,arise out of or relate to,directly or indirectly taxes or the thereof of kor for all pre closing tax periods 
ma app.section clarifies,however,that this general tax indemnification provision does not override the specific arrangement for 
notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement,the determination of the taxes with respect to this section will be calculated without taking into account any deductions described in section below.
ma app.in other words,section recognizes that the former securityholders are required to indemnify mercury for more than its actual tax losses for,consistent with section a.
despite the detailed treatment of tax matters in article x,and though the parties anticipated that kor would receive tax refunds for,the merger agreement does not explicitly address kor expected tax refunds or mention any offset.
mercury,its subsidiary king merger,kor,and srs for kor securityholders signed the merger agreement on december.in connection with the agreement,kor furnished mercury with a company disclosure schedule,including its consolidated financial statements the statements contained tax data for prior years and tax figures for.the merger closed on december,the last day of kor federal tax year.
to determine kor actual tax obligations,srs took advantage of the deductions specified in section,as section required.with those deductions taken into account,kor operated at a loss for federal tax purposes and,consequently,had no federal tax liability.having prepaid million in federal taxes and owing no federal income tax,kor was refunded all million similarly,after deducting the expenses,kor was left with no income taxable by various states as a result,kor state tax prepayments and credits exceeded what it actually owed,and it accordingly received in state tax refunds.srs asserts that the federal and state refunds were the result of the tax deductions.mercury disagrees,claiming that the parties expected that million in tax and would be refunded to kor for the benefit of mercury,irrespective of the section deductions.whether or not the deductions were the cause,it is undisputed that kor was refunded a total of million by federal and state tax authorities for,benefitting mercury as kor new owner.
to determine the securityholders tax indemnity obligation,mercury recalculated kor tax liabilities without the deductions.in that calculation,kor had a taxable income of over million in,resulting in substantial though hypothetical state and federal tax obligations.mercury asserts that the correct measure of kor tax liabilities for indemnification purposes is million.because srs already has paid of the indemnity obligation mercury now seeks million from srs.srs agrees that million is the correct measure of kor tax indemnification obligation,not counting prepayments and credits,but asserts that after the offset for the million in prepayments and credits,only was owed.since srs previously paid,it argues that mercury is now owed only.
procedural history 
the operative complaint here is the first amended complaint,which mercury filed against srs and various former securityholders on october.in it,mercury asserted claims for,inter alia,declaratory relief and breach of contract.in count i,mercury sought a declaration that it was entitled to million from the escrow account pursuant to section a s indemnification calculation.in count iv,mercury asserted that srs had breached the merger agreement by failing to release those funds from escrow,and sought damages.
srs moved for partial judgment on the pleadings on counts i and iv.mercury opposed the motion and filed a cross motion for partial judgment on the pleadings.the district court granted srs motion for judgment on the pleadings,denied mercury motion,and entered judgment for srs.mercury timely filed this appeal

massachusetts law 
under massachusetts law,contract terms are ambiguous when they are inconsistent on their face or where the phraseology can support reasonable difference of opinion as to the meaning of the words employed and obligations undertaken.fashion house,k mart,cir.ambiguity exists where reasonably intelligent persons would differ as to which meaning is the proper one.id.quoting citation ins.gomez,see also caldwell tanks,haley ward,cir.where more than one interpretation fits the literal meaning of the text and is compatible with common sense and practical economic reality,a court may find a provision to be ambiguous as a matter of law.see den norske bank as first bank of boston,cir.
where the contract language is ambiguous,on its face or as applied,contract interpretation normally becomes a question of fact to be decided with reference to extrinsic evidence.den norske bank,at citing freelander realty,robert,spence.extrinsic evidence may include the parties negotiations during contracting,their course of performance under the contract,their course of dealing prior to the contract,and trade usage in the relevant industry.id.at.
as described above,this case involves three provisions of the merger agreement sections,a,and.the last of those,simply obliges mercury to take the applicable deductions when filing returns for the pre closing tax period,and it is not in dispute.the controversy centers primarily on section a and the indemnification amount it requires srs to pay mercury.although the parties agree that the provision purpose was to pay mercury the value of the tax deductions,they disagree on the magnitude of that benefit.the relationship between section,the general indemnification provision,and section a is one of the questions that must be considered in construing the latter provision.
srs accepts that mercury was owed the million attributable to the deductions,but it insists that the parties understood that part of that amount million had already been paid in the form of kor tax refunds.srs draws support for its interpretation from the text of section,which imposes an indemnification burden on the securityholders for losses,while instructing that the deductions must be treated differently.mercury,on the other hand,contends that srs must pay the full million from the escrow account.mercury argues that,because kor was in a tax loss position for and thus had no tax debt,kor would have received full refunds of its tax prepayments even without the deductions.hence,the refunds were unrelated to the payment required by section a,and,under mercury reading,section a in effect amounted to a price adjustment.
we first review the pertinent terms of the agreement and then briefly consider the parties additional contentions regarding its construction.see den norske bank,at.
plain language 
we begin our examination of the agreement language with section a,the provision that details the indemnification benefit to mercury,and then consider whether the general indemnification provision,section,sheds light on how that benefit is to be calculated.
this section,labeled tax return preparation,appears to have three primary purposes.first,it states srs obligation to prepare,and mercury obligation to file,any kor tax returns covering time periods that are due after the merger closing date.app.that obligation,of course,incorporates the requirement of section that mercury take advantage of available deductions.app.second,section a provides for a transfer of funds from the escrow account to mercury to cover payment of the taxes due for the period,but with the amount calculated as if the deductions had not been taken.app.third,section a requires mercury to promptly pay t he amounts actually due on the tax return.app.thus,the text plainly requires payment to mercury of an amount in excess of the actual tax debt,leaving mercury with a cash payment that appears to be,in effect,a purchase price adjustment.
strikingly,section a does not in explicit terms address the fact known to both parties that kor had made substantial prepayments of its tax obligations and,accordingly,expected refunds mercury argues that this omission itself reveals that the parties did not intend to offset srs indemnity obligation by the amount of the anticipated refunds.it insists that a deduction of that magnitude from the tax liability calculation can not be presumed from silence,and it asserts that implying an offset into the agreement is tantamount to rewriting the contract.see paterson leitch.mun.wholesale,cir warning that courts should not rewrite contracts freely entered into between sophisticated business entities quoting rci ne.servs.div.bos.edison,cir.
srs,however,draws meaning from the fact that section a addresses both preparation of tax returns and the calculation of the indemnity obligation.it sees a plain recognition of the offset in the relationship between the provision requirements,emphasizing that srs obligation to make indemnification payments from the escrow account is expressly linked to the preparation of tax returns through the phrases w ith respect to any such tax return,app,and with respect to such tax return.app.thus,srs argues,the indemnification must be calculated on the same basis as the real tax calculation that is,on the basis of kor tax return with the only departure being the exclusion of two deductions specified in section.the real tax calculation would include deducting the amount of any prepayments and refundable credits to arrive at the amount owed at the time the return is filed.srs thus reads section a,in context,to include an offset for the amount of prepayments and refundable credits.
we conclude that the language of section a is reasonably susceptible to both of these interpretations.on the one hand,as mercury argues,it is difficult to imagine the parties intending,but not expressly addressing,the substantial reduction in the indemnification obligation that would occur through an offset for the tax prepayments.contrary to srs view,the language linking the indemnification amount to such tax return does not inevitably refer to the routine mechanics of calculating taxes with an offset for prepayments and credits but may be a simple reference back to the provision,a tax return due after the closing date for a period.if,as mercury argues,the tax calculation was intended to define an appropriate rebate for mercury rather than a classic indemnification it would be reasonable to conclude,absent explicit instruction to the contrary,that the agreement does not call for deducting the prepayments and credits.on the other hand,as described above,the focus in section a on both tax return preparation and indemnification makes plausible srs view that the required payment was intended to be a net amount.
hence,the language of section a,on its own,leaves us uncertain about what the parties intended.notwithstanding its view that the section plain language requires an offset for the tax refunds,srs asserts that the text of section clarifies any possible ambiguity and reinforces its contention that the amount owed to mercury is the difference between the total tax savings and the refund amount.we thus consider whether the ambiguity we discern in section is resolved by section plain language.
the conventional tax indemnification language of section protects mercury against,inter alia,any and all losses relate d to taxes or the thereof for all pre closing tax periods.app.srs avers that this language,notwithstanding its generality,is susceptible to only one meaning.it asserts that the term losses,app,read in its usual and ordinary sense,union,at,requires an offset for tax prepayments to be read into the agreement.in srs words,there can be no indemnifiable losses arising from kor taxes if kor has already actually paid,and thereby discharged,all or part of any such taxes.
srs may be correct that,once kor fictional tax liability for is determined,the fictional part of the calculation is complete and the amount owed to mercury is intended to be determined as it would be in a typical indemnification scenario.ordinarily,kor tax debt and,in turn,mercury loss,would be reduced by the amount of the prepayments and credits.however,it may be that the parties did not intend the word to be read in this way.in fact,supporting the conclusion that they intended the word to be read without regard to offsetting prepayments,the language in section on which srs relies is followed by the notwithstanding proviso,which instructs that,regardless of any other provision of this agreement,the determination of the taxes with respect to this section will be calculated without taking into account any deductions described in section below.this sentence appears to say that neither the general indemnity obligation just stated,nor any other provision in the agreement,negates the unusual arrangement specified in section a,that mercury is owed an amount to be calculated by reference to a fictional tax liability.
of course,the notwithstanding sentence does not by its terms exclude the possibility that the ordinary concept of loss was intended in section and thus was meant to be applied to the fictional liability,requiring a deduction for the prepayments and credits.it is also plausible to read the notwithstanding caveat as recognizing and reinforcing a distinct method of calculating the indemnification obligation for the taxes due,disregarding the usual method of determining a loss.indeed,as we have described,section a creates both a tax liability and thus an indemnification obligation where none in fact existed because of kor financial circumstances.that explicit fiction belies the inevitability of the parties intention to apply a literal concept of loss to calculate the tax indemnification amount.see.mun.wholesale town of danvers,recognizing that plain meaning does not control where context shows that the parties have assigned an unusual meaning to a term.
to the contrary,while section as a general matter imposes responsibility on the securityholders for possible tax losses resulting from future irs audits,including for,the section can reasonably be read to identify srs indemnification obligation at the time of the merger as the amount specified in section a without accounting for the prepayments and credits.the parties sophistication and the obviousness of the refund issue makes it unlikely that,given the section a fiction,they would have hidden the answer to the refund question between the lines of section.again,the absence of explicit reference to the anticipated refunds leaves the parties intent unclear.
in sum,given that section a appears to use the tax liability context as a way to define a price adjustment and calls for a transfer of funds that ordinarily would not be described as an indemnification we have no confidence that the parties intended the ordinary calculation of loss to apply.we thus find no decisive guidance on the meaning of section a in the plain language of section.
b.other arguments 
the parties offer multiple theories to support their competing contentions that the intent of section is discernible from the provision plain language.these theories are largely and,hence,require judgments based on that we can not do.
srs,for example,argues that kor tax refund must offset mercury recovery lest mercury receive what it calls a double recovery,or a windfall by recovering some amounts twice.as noted above,srs believes that no refunds would have been paid absent the deductions.because kor tax refunds are part of the benefit of the tax deductions,srs argues,they must be counted against the former securityholders indemnity obligation.to allow mercury to claim kor tax refunds worth million,and the full million value of the tax deductions without an offset,would give mercury million twice however,whether the refunds are solely attributable to the merger is a disputed fact that can not be determined on the limited record before us.moreover,this argument has force only if the parties in fact intended to define the total amount due to mercury by the net benefit from the deductions.as we have explained,the agreement does not plainly limit the indemnification payment to that amount.
mercury,meanwhile,asserts that it bargained separately for the tax refunds and the tax indemnification provisions.it supports this assertion with drafts of the merger agreement and associated correspondence to and from its counsel during negotiations.mercury br.however,we may not consider such evidence in our review of a judgment on the pleadings,as these materials are not fairly incorporated in the pleadings or susceptible to judicial notice,see fin,at,and mercury cites no other basis on which they may be considered 
although there are elements of reasonableness in both parties arguments,neither party succeeds in clarifying the meaning of the merger agreement with respect to the offset issue.on this point,sections and are inescapably ambiguous reasonably intelligent persons would differ as to which meaning is the proper one.union,at quoting citation ins,at.
this ambiguity is remarkable given the sophistication of the parties.mercury and the former owners of kor agreed to a seemingly novel contract provision,incorporating elements of an indemnity and a purchase price adjustment.although the parties knew that kor had tax prepayments and credits and anticipated a tax refund,they failed to clarify how these prepayments and credits would affect the indemnification provision.indeed,the failure to speak expressly to the issue suggests that the parties,inexplicably,may have neglected to address how the refunds would be handled.having thus agreed to an ambiguous contract,the parties now must shoulder the costs of additional litigation in the district court to clarify its meaning,through consideration of negotiating history and other extrinsic evidence probative of the intentions of the parties,consistent with massachusetts law.see den norske bank as,at.
we vacate judgment in favor of srs,affirm the denial of judgment to mercury,and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion each party shall bear its own costs.
so ordered.
