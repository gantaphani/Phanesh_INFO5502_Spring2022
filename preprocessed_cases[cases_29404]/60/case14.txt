this appeal arises from an arrangement gone awry between two groups for their joint acquisition of a company that was on the block.scs communications,and its principal stephen swid appeal from the march,amended judgment entered following a jury verdict in the united states district court for the southern district of new york patterson,awarding compensatory damages to the herrick company,and its principal norton herrick collectively herrick for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty under new york law.scs attacks the judgment on the grounds that the district court dismissal of a nondiverse party failed to cure the jurisdictional defect that occasioned the vacatur and remand the district court erred in deciding on summary judgment that a binding contract existed among herrick,scs,and others the evidence does not support the jury findings that swid is personally liable as a knowing participant in a breach of fiduciary duty and as scs alter ego the jury instructions on damages were erroneous and the admission into evidence of an unauthenticated handwritten note was reversible error.

we conclude that the district court cured the jurisdictional defect by dismissing the nondiverse party after considering the relevant factors.we affirm on the appeal because scs substantive arguments are either without merit or waived.on the,we reverse the grant of scs motion to amend its answer to assert setoff.
background 
a.the orleander transaction 
the following facts are either undisputed or,where touching on issues decided by the jury,viewed in the light most favorable to herrick.see nadel isaksson,cir.in,a number of efforts were mounted to acquire the orleander group orleander,a manufacturer of bicycle accessories.first,richard sheinberg and henry chan his associate attempted an acquisition by a company they formed for that purpose,tog acquisition tog but failed for lack of financing.later that year,on august,the owners of orleander granted to herrick an exclusive right to negotiate for the sale of the business.shortly thereafter,herrick approached sheinberg and stephen weinroth a director of scs to discuss a joint acquisition effort.
on august,a letter was executed by herrick,scs by weinroth,and tog by sheinberg,in which they undertook to work together to acquire the business of the orleander group,and set certain terms for the conduct of the venture the letter agreement.the letter agreement concluded the parties agree that neither they nor any of their affiliates n or any other entity in which they own an interest will acquire the orleander group without complying with the terms of this letter.shortly after signing the letter agreement,the signatories enlisted the services of skadden,arps,slate,meager flom skadden and skadden partner,mark smith.
herrick contends and the district court agreed on summary judgment that the letter agreement is a legally binding contract establishing a joint venture to pursue the purchase of orleander.
on november,after failed efforts to agree on the structure of the acquisition vehicle and the allocation of rights in the company,sheinberg and weinroth told herrick that he was out of the venture.on november,orleander was acquired by scs,swid the majority stockholder of scs,and herrick.after herrick ejection,the skadden firm continued to advise scs and tog in respect of the acquisition.
herrick brought suit against scs,swid,weinroth,sheinberg,chan,and vetta sports,as successor to tog collectively,the business defendants,alleging breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,fraudulent inducement,and knowing participation in a breach of fiduciary duties.skadden and smith were also named as defendants for allegedly breaching their fiduciary duties.herrick sought compensatory and punitive damages from all defendants.
b.the district court proceedings 
the business defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that the letter agreement was unenforceable,and herrick on the ground that the business defendants breached an enforceable contract.the court ruled as a matter of law that the letter agreement was a valid and enforceable contract establishing a joint venture among its signatories,but identified genuine issues of material fact as to breach and damages.
trial opened on january,with two days of opening statements.on january,norton herrick began his direct testimony.the next day,a settlement was reached with defendants sheinberg,weinroth,chan,skadden,and smith.
herrick pressed its case to verdict against scs and swid.the judge instructed the jury that the absence of certain defendants and claims has no significance whatsoever for your consideration of the plaintiff s case against scs communications and stephen swid.
a special verdict form posed six questions on liability,followed by a final question on damages if you answered yes to any of the above questions,what damages do you find plaintiff suffered the form did not ask whether any of the settling defendants caused or contributed to herrick loss.the jury found scs liable to herrick for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty,and found swid personally liable as scs alter ego and for his own knowing participation in a breach of fiduciary duty.herrick was awarded over million.motions ensued.
scs argued that skadden presence defeated diversity jurisdiction and that skadden remained a defendant notwithstanding the settlement because no dismissal had yet been entered and because the district court retained jurisdiction over the settlement.the district court rejected the jurisdictional challenge on the grounds that,even assuming complete diversity was lacking at the outset,skadden was no longer a party after the settlement within the meaning of the diversity jurisdiction statute,a,and that upholding scs challenge would waste judicial resources.that ruling was the chief focus of the first appeal.
scs and swid also moved for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial.the denial of those motions is challenged on the present appeal.
the district court granted,however,scs motion to amend the answer to assert a setoff for sums paid by the settling defendants.the court determined that the setoff was proper under new york general obligations law a,implicitly rejecting herrick contention that it was prejudiced by scs failure to assert the defense earlier.
on august,the district court entered an amended judgment in favor of herrick in the amount of over million,a sum derived by the court subtracting from the original award of over million plus prejudgment interest a setoff of million a figure which represented the present value of herrick settlement with the settling defendants.
both herrick and scs appealed from that judgment.
c.the first appeal 
herrick i focused on jurisdiction.we ruled that if skadden has among its partners any citizens who are domiciled abroad,then skadden and herrick which is a citizen of florida are,herrick i,at that the burden of establishing jurisdiction was on herrick,id.at and that herrick only evidence in support of skadden diverse pretrial admission that diversity jurisdiction insufficient,id.at 
we acknowledged that a defect in jurisdiction may be curable by nunc pro tunc dismissal of dispensable jurisdictional spoilers,pursuant to,and we concluded,under,d,that appellate courts have power to be used conservatively to cure a jurisdictional defect in that way.herrick i,at.at the same time,we recognized that mandates consideration of prejudice,and cautions that remand might be appropriate to decide factual disputes bearing on that issue.id.at quoting,at.
accordingly,we vacated the judgment,remanded,and directed the district court to decide whether skadden presence defeats diversity,and if so,whether was unduly prejudiced by skadden participation in the lawsuit and consequently whether jurisdiction over the main case may be salvaged,under,by eliminating the court previously asserted jurisdiction over the settlement involving skadden.id.at.we pointed out that,under,if the presence of the nondiverse party may afford another party a tactical advantage,id.at quoting,at,then a jurisdictional defect that might have produced the advantage can not properly be cured on appeal it is usually best in such cases to let the district court weigh the exists,the advantage causes,and also the existence of countervailing factors,before the first the propriety of curing,ex post,the jurisdictional defect.id.at.
d.the remand 
on remand,the district court determined that herrick could not establish that skadden was a diverse party at the outset of the lawsuit skadden is a dispensable party and dismissing skadden from the lawsuit pursuant to rule is not unjust because skadden presence caused scs no prejudice.only the final determination is an issue on this appeal.
preliminarily,the district court ruled that herrick had the burden of showing by a preponderance both tactical advantage and lack of undue prejudice.
tracking our language in herrick i,the district court then considered whether skadden presence produced a tactical advantage for one party or another.the court observed that tactical advantage could occur where the presence of a party allows one side to introduce evidence that would otherwise be inadmissible or access materials that would otherwise have been unobtainable,or where the nature of the party bolsters the credibility of one side but the court found that neither concern was raised in the present case.
as to prejudice,scs argued that skadden settlement on the fourth day of trial would have been seen by the jury as an obvious defeat for defendants and lent credence to herrick claims that skadden was acting as agent in the alleged wrongdoing.the court concluded that the alleged prejudice was speculative,and in any event forestalled by the precautionary jury instruction.the court also concluded that skadden presence in fact assisted scs litigation strategy,which actively relied on skadden prestige to argue that herrick exclusion from the transaction was effected pursuant to that firm sound legal advice.
the district court vacated its previous order asserting supplemental jurisdiction over the settlement involving skadden,dismissed skadden as a party nunc pro tunc as of the date the action was commenced,and reinstated its prior judgment.this appeal followed.
discussion 
scs invites us to revisit herrick i and conclude that though an appellate court can salvage diversity jurisdiction by jettison of the party or remand for that purpose,an appellate may do so only where as in the judgment rests on the grant of summary judgment.although the law of the case doctrine does not deprive an appellate court of discretion to reconsider its own prior rulings,even when the ruling constituted a final decision in a previous appeal,rezzonico h r block,cir,we do not revisit such a final decision absent cogent or compelling reasons,id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.no such reasons are presented here.
true,was a summary judgment case,and the opinion notes that,when summary judgment has been granted,dismissal solely because a jurisdictional spoiler is present would result in the of the same case in the same the nondiverse the same preordained result.at.however,the court also cited several considerations that are unrelated to summary disposition such as lack of prejudice and the conservation of time and resources,id.at,and nowhere confined the cure of jurisdictional defects on appeal to summary judgment cases.moreover,the power under rule to dismiss parties was exercised here by the district court.
i t is well settled that rule invests district courts with authority to allow a dispensable nondiverse party to be dropped at any time,even after judgment has been rendered.id.at.emphasis added see also squibb sons,lloyd,cir affirming the district court dismissal of jurisdictional spoiler under following jury and nonjury trials.this language bespeaks no distinction between types of judgments indeed,certain of the considerations animating may be more compelling after a jury verdict has been rendered.see at.r equiring dismissal of the case after years of litigation would impose unnecessary and wasteful burdens on the parties,judges,and other litigants waiting for judicial attention.see also caterpillar,lewis,d after entry of a final judgment,considerations of finality,efficiency,and economy become overwhelming.squibb sons,accident cas.ins,cir.
as to the merits of the analysis,scs asserts that the proper standard for gauging tactical is a key component of measuring prejudice,see,at.herrick i,at the potential for tactical advantage,and that the district court erred in looking only for actual advantage.scs relies on kanzelberger kanzelberger,cir,in which a shareholder of a corporation joined the corporation as in a suit against the other shareholders,and won a jury verdict.on appeal,the seventh circuit declined to salvage the judgment by dismissing the corporation,because its presence may have colored the outcome of plaintiff suit.id.at.
scs argues from kanzelberger that herrick bore the burden of proving that skadden presence could not have colored the outcome before the jury.however,kanzelberger,fairly read,suggests that the corporation presence was a tactical advantage for the plaintiff,which in a trial is always a matter of probabilities.in any event,the analysis requires consideration of the prejudice to the remaining parties tactical advantage is a subset of the prejudice analysis.see at.we turn next to that issue.
scs claims that they were prejudiced at trial and herrick advantaged by skadden initial presence and by its exit by way of settlement,that skadden presence allegedly allowed herrick to paint itself in the transaction as david facing goliath,and that the settlement was a spurious validation of herrick claims against scs rejecting scs argument,the district court relied on the court instruction to the jury that it was not to draw any inferences for or against any of the remaining parties by reason of the departures of some of the parties,the speculative nature of claim of undue prejudice,the fact that all statements about skadden could have been introduced via smith,and the fact that any supposed settlements by weinroth and sheinberg,undisputed signatories to the letter agreement,would have been far more damaging to as an alleged partner than any supposed settlements by smith and skadden.
as the district court observed,there is little case law on what constitutes a tactical advantage.however,the cases suggest that the presence of the nondiverse party must have materially affected the course of the trial proceedings.in sweeney westvaco,cir,the first circuit found no tactical advantage because e ven without the nondiverse defendant presence as a party,plaintiff could have concluded the same discovery,called the nondiverse defendant as a witness,and introduced all the evidence that,in fact,she presented to the jury.in casas office machines,mita copystar america,cir,the first circuit found no tactical advantage where the presence of the nondiverse defendants afforded plaintiffs no access to materials that were otherwise unobtainable.scs does not undertake to demonstrate that kind of advantage.
the tactical advantage identified in kanzelberger is that joinder of the corporation as a plaintiff in a suit by some shareholders against others lent some additional credence to the claim that the defendants had usurped control of the the dispute seem less a squabble among the shareholders and more an effort by the defendants to despoil the corporation.at.by analogy to kanzelberger,scs argues that the presence of a large law firm allied with it cast scs as a bully and overreacher,and that the apparent settlement by the law firm reinforced the claim against scs.however,these arguments about prejudice to herrick resulting from skadden presence in the case ignore the fact that smith was also a defendant,and that every damaging imputation,appearance,and adversary argument fed by skadden presence could have been sustained as well by reference to smith as a partner in the firm.smith exited the trial under the same circumstances but his presence did not defeat diversity and thus remains unchallenged.thus,the prejudice scs claims to have suffered as a result of skadden presence would have been triggered by smith participation in the suit in any case.
as to skadden exit from the suit via settlement,the district court properly instructed the jury that no inferences are to be drawn against the parties.such instructions are regularly given when fewer than all of the parties settle,and there is no reason to upset the presumption that juries follow instructions.see lnc,westminster bank,cir w e must presume the jury to follow its instructions,cert.denied,d.
scs next challenges the district court ruling,as a matter of law,that the letter agreement constituted a binding,enforceable contract.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,young county of fulton,cir,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.see anderson liberty lobby,d.summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
we agree with the district court conclusion that the letter agreement is a binding contract to work together in good faith toward a joint acquisition of orleander a necessary mechanism to enforce such an forgo any acquisition by fewer than all.
after herrick approached sheinberg and weinroth about a joint acquisition of orleander,the parties exchanged several letters on the subject.
an august,letter from sheinberg to herrick recited,inter alia,that t he proposed partnership discussed above expresses the intentions of the parties hereto,and that the terms of a binding agreement with respect to such partnership shall result only upon the execution of definitive agreements among us.the next day,herrick sent sheinberg a revised letter that omitted these provisions replaced the term approved by herrick at the close of the letter with accepted and stated that tog and scs would not acquire orleander without complying with the terms of the letter.
the letter agreement was sent by sheinberg to herrick on august,and was consistent with the language in herrick august draft the parties defined as herrick,scs,and tog would work together to acquire the business of the orleander group certain steps would be taken should financing arrangements succeed and herrick,scs,tog,and their affiliates would refrain from acquiring orleander without complying with the terms of the letter.the letter was sent and signed by sheinberg for tog and by weinroth for scs,and was accepted by herrick for the herrick.
by letter dated august,they advised orleander that the herrick,tog acquisition,and scs communications,have agreed to proceed collectively in the acquisition of the business of the orleander group from you.
in september,skadden and counsel for orleander began negotiating the terms of an asset purchase agreement sheinberg,weinroth,and herrick attended the negotiations or were kept informed by skadden.skadden advised orleander that although the draft documents prepared for the sale refer to the buyer as tog,all references to tog in these agreements as well as in the asset purchase agreement and the quota purchase agreement should be deemed to include tog,scs communications,and the herrick company.
the letter agreement had provided that in the event the signatories were able to arrange for the acquisition and financing of orleander,they would form an entity either a limited partnership or a corporation to complete the acquisition of the orleander group on such terms and conditions.the letter agreement had also specified certain features of the new entity for example,and herrick will be equal owners and and herrick will be required to provide equal amounts of capital.the signatories expressly acknowledge d that no such entity ha d yet been formed nor w ould any such entity be formed,until and unless formal written agreements between and herrick shall have been entered into establishing such new entity and defining each party rights and obligations therein which rights and obligations will be consistent with those set forth in this letter.
in october,herrick formed a shell company and offered it for use as the acquisition vehicle referred to in the letter agreement.instead,the signatories adopted skadden suggestion to use tog as the acquisition vehicle.
on october,herrick paid skadden.on october,tog executed an asset purchase agreement and related agreements with the sellers of orleander.on october,a check from herrick for and a check from sheinberg for were deposited into tog checking account and used for acquisition expenses weinroth deposited in the same account several days later.on november and,skadden sent drafts of a proposed shareholders agreement to herrick,sheinberg,and weinroth.herrick retained michael tannenbaum as counsel to represent herrick in connection with the negotiation of the shareholders agreement.
in a november memo,tog advised herrick,sheinberg,and weinroth that needed to be deposited into tog immediately.herrick deposited into tog checking account three days later.there is no record of any corresponding payment by sheinberg or weinroth.
the acquiring group obtained an extension of the closing date from november to december,in exchange for a deposit to orleander sellers.herrick paid toward this deposit.
by letter dated november,sheinberg and weinroth informed herrick that unless he sent back a signed copy of an enclosed shareholders agreement by the next day,we will reluctantly conclude that you are unwilling to abide by the terms of our agreement in principle and we will proceed to consummate the acquisition without you.
the following day according to herrick,the parties met at skadden offices and,by evening,worked out an acceptable shareholders agreement.skadden determined,however,that the shareholders agreement was incompatible with the tog bylaws,and conformed the bylaws accordingly.herrick received the revised bylaws that night,and protested that he had relied on the existing bylaws when he agreed to the shareholders agreement.
on november,sheinberg and weinroth rejected herrick demands and stopped accepting his phone calls.that afternoon,herrick and some associates went to skadden office to see smith at smith direction,they were escorted out by security.on november,herrick sought a state court injunction against the sale of orleander,and solicited the sellers of orleander to close the transaction with him alone.on november,herrick instructed skadden not to close without herrick participation.on november,herrick asked sheinberg,weinroth,and swid who had stepped into herrick place as an investor in tog to issue herrick of tog stock,so that closing could occur in accordance with the letter agreement.all of these initiatives failed.the orleander sale was closed without herrick on november.
the district court determined that the letter agreement constituted a binding contract,in part because the parties considered the letter agreement to be binding on them.the court examined the parties conduct before and after the letter agreement was signed.although the august draft of the letter proposed by sheinberg stated that a binding agreement with respect to such partnership shall result only upon the execution of definitive agreements between us,herrick demurred,and no such express condition appeared in the letter agreement,which instead provided the parties agree that neither they nor any of their affiliates or any other entity in which they own an interest will acquire the orleander group without complying with the terms of this letter.
for a time after the letter agreement was executed,the parties conducted their affairs in accordance with it they agreed to acquisition terms,obtained commitments on financing,contributed capital,shared expenses,and exchanged due diligence materials.the business defendants called upon herrick to provide,and he complied.
the district court also concluded that the letter agreement satisfied the elements necessary to establish a joint venture.
on appeal,scs contends that the letter agreement was an unenforceable containing material open terms alternatively,the obligations contained in the letter agreement were subject to express,unfulfilled conditions precedent no joint venture was established and the district court erroneously resorted to extrinsic evidence.
open terms.scs arguments are premised on a conceptual misunderstanding of the letter agreement.noting the existence of a series of material open terms concerning the financing,equity,structure,and management of the putative acquisition vehicle,scs reads the letter agreement as a failed stab at an acquisition agreement.however,the district court correctly read the letter agreement as a binding agreement that the parties would work together to attempt to acquire orleander,and would acquire it together or not at as to that there are no open terms.scs argument would render meaningless the final provision of the letter agreement,which prevents any party from acquiring orleander without complying with the terms of the letter.
conditions precedent.the unfulfilled conditions precedent cited by scs are that the joint acquisition entity referred to in the letter agreement will not be formed until i the parties agree on the terms of financing and ii execute written formal agreements establishing their rights and obligations in that entity.this argument ignores the difference under new york law between a condition that must occur before a party performance under an existing contract becomes due and a condition to the formation of the contract itself.westerbeke daihatsu motor,cir.nothing in the letter agreement expressly provides that the conditions identified by scs are conditions to the formation of a contract to act jointly in the acquisition of orleander or not at all see oppenheimer oppenheim,appel,dixon,finding that a letter agreement contained an express condition precedent to contract formation where the agreement provided that the contract would be null and void unless the condition was fulfilled.
joint venture.under new york law,a joint venture is formed when a two or more persons enter into an agreement to carry on a venture for profit b the agreement evinces their intent to be joint venturers c each contributes property,financing,skill,knowledge,or effort d each has some degree of joint control over the venture and e provision is made for the sharing of both profits and losses.itel containers int l atlanttrafik express,cir.
scs argument that there was no joint venture fatally relies on its view that there was no agreement in the first place.for the reasons above,the letter agreement is an agreement to carry on a venture for profit.the intent to be joint venturers is sufficiently expressed in the contractual undertaking to work together to acquire the business of orleander.the letter agreement provides that the parties would contribute equal amounts of capital to the acquisition entity.the requisite degree of joint control is located in the contract requirement that all acquisition and financing terms would require approval by each party.the anticipated equal ownership of orleander contemplates the sharing of profits and losses.
extrinsic evidence.scs asserts that the district court erroneously relied on extrinsic evidence to determine whether the parties intended to be bound,and whether the parties contemplated that a shareholders agreement was necessary to close the transaction.scs also argues that to resort to extrinsic evidence necessarily implies a finding of ambiguity on those issues that precluded summary judgment.we see no ambiguity.the court consulted extrinsic showed that the parties conformed their business relations to the contract order to confirm that the letter agreement was binding.moreover,even assuming the letter agreement was ambiguous as to intent,summary judgment is still proper when the extrinsic evidence is so that no reasonable factfinder could decide contrary to one party interpretation.collins,cir quotation marks omitted.the letter agreement unambiguously provided that the parties would acquire orleander together or not at all,and their conduct thereafter demonstrated and confirmed their intent to be so bound.the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to herrick.
swid was held personally liable for the breach of the letter agreement on two theories as the alter ego of scs,and as a knowing participant in a breach of fiduciary duty.
swid contended in a rule motion that there was no evidence at trial to sustain the jury finding that he was the alter ego of scs and therefore liable for scs breach of the letter agreement and for scs failure to perform its duties under the letter agreement.the district court denied the motion,holding that there was sufficient evidence of swid domination of least with respect to the transaction at a reasonable jury to find for herrick.because we conclude that swid is personally liable as a knowing participant in a breach of fiduciary duty,we need not consider whether the evidence supported a finding of alter ego.
we review de novo the district court denial of swid rule motion for judgment as a matter of law on the knowing participation verdict,and we view the evidence in the light most favorable to herrick,the nonmovant.see wolf yamin,cir.
the elements of a cause of action for participation in a breach of fiduciary duty are breach by a fiduciary of a duty owed to plaintiff defendant knowing participation in the breach and damages.diduck kaszycki sons contractors,cir.swid only contention is that herrick adduced no evidence of swid knowledge that the letter agreement created fiduciary duties.
the district court instructed the jury that,for herrick to prevail,it must be established that swid knew that the had fiduciary obligations to plaintiffs,that one or more of the was breaching these fiduciary obligations,and that swid participated in it and knowingly accepted the benefit of such breach.emphasis added.
the evidence was sufficient to support the element of knowledge swid,a sophisticated businessman active in many partnerships,knew of herrick relationship with the,was aware of the letter agreement terms,caused the breach by closing the orleander acquisition without herrick,and accepted the benefit of that breach after herrick notified swid that these actions would violate the letter agreement.
scs argues that the district court erroneously instructed the jury that herrick could recover as damages either or of the value of orleander,depending on the legal theory used.we conclude that scs has failed to preserve this argument for appeal because it failed to object to the instruction at the charging conference,after the jury charge,or as part of the motions.true,scs argued to the district court that there is simply no basis for instructing the jury that herrick is entitled to percent however,this argument was advanced immediately preceding the testimony of herrick valuation expert,and was directed to a preliminary damage instruction,not to the damages instruction ultimately given the jury.
under,a party who fails to object to a jury instruction at trial waives the right to make that instruction the basis for an appeal.fogarty near ins.brokerage,cir.where,as here,the party fails to object to the instruction before the jury begins deliberations,a subsequent challenge based on that charge should be entertained only if the alleged errors are fundamental.shade ex rel.hous.auth.of new haven,cir quotation marks omitted.fundamental error is a more exacting standard than the plain error standard in the criminal context and must be so serious and flagrant that it goes to the very integrity of the trial.fashion boutique of short hills,fendi usa,cir quoting shade,at.we have found fundamental error where the jury instructions were hopelessly confusing and fail ed to provide even the barest legal guideposts to aid the jury in rationally reaching a decision.frederic wiedersum assocs.homes constr,cir quotation marks omitted.moreover,a jury verdict will be reversed only when an appellant can show that t
