the lawsuit underlying this appeal was filed in.it arose from a merger and acquisition between xpedite systems,and premiere technologies.the case is before us for a second time.as will be discussed in part i infra,the claims and issues have been winnowed over the years and we are now faced with what is tantamount to a single question are sophisticated investors involved in an merger transaction entitled to recover under section of the securities act of if they make a legally binding investment commitment months before the issuance of a defective registration statement 
background 
plaintiffs are investment funds and individuals who are former shareholders of xpedite systems,xpedite.xpedite,a delaware corporation,was formed in to provide enhanced facsimile and messaging delivery services.plaintiffs apa excelsior iii,apa excelsior iii offshore,pennsylvania venture capital fund,and cin venture nominees limited collectively,the plaintiff funds are investment funds managed by alan patricof associates apa.plaintiffs stuart and david epstein are brothers who invested in xpedite as individual investors.together,plaintiffs held approximately percent of the stock of xpedite.due to the plaintiff funds substantial holdings in xpedite,a representative from apa,robert chefitz,served as a member of xpedite board of directors the board.similarly,due to the epsteins holdings in xpedite,david epstein sat on the board.
in,xpedite began to consider strategic alternatives to provide an exit strategy for xpedite early investors,which included plaintiffs.in february,the board appointed a special committee to evaluate xpedite alternatives and to engage advisors.members of the special committee included chefitz who testified at deposition that he may have actually been chair of the committee and david epstein,among others.
during this process,contact was made with defendant premiere technologies,premiere,which expressed an interest in acquiring xpedite.premiere,now known as ptek holdings,or premiere global services,is in the business of providing telecommunication services,including conference calling,voice messaging,and telephone calling services.premiere proposed a merger and acquisition,which xpedite felt was an attractive proposal.on october,its senior officers,investment banker merrill lynch,accountants ernst young,and legal counsel paul,hastings,janofsky walker llp began its due diligence investigation of premiere.the special committee on which chefitz and david epstein sat had oversight responsibility for this investigation.
as we noted in our prior opinion,and as recognized by the district court on remand which has not been seriously challenged in this appeal,plaintiffs were sophisticated investors with due diligence rights,but they failed to exercise them in any meaningful way.for example,chefitz testified that he did not direct anyone to examine premiere key telephone calling card customers,he did not negotiate for specific warranties regarding the calling card business,and he did not direct anyone to perform due diligence as to the technical capacity of the calling card business software platform.roy anderson,xpedite former ceo,told chefitz that premiere contract and business dealings with a particular telephone calling card customer,digitec,digitec,were important to premiere revenues.however,chefitz did not recall performing any examination of the digitec account,other than reviewing some of the company public materials,nor did he recall directing anyone to make contact with that company as part of the due diligence efforts.further,although chefitz believed xpedite due diligence team had access to premiere accounts receivable for the telephone calling card business,chefitz did not review them personally or direct anyone else to do so.
despite this apparently superficial due diligence,on november,the board entered into a merger agreement with premiere agreeing to the transaction and unanimously voted to recommend the merger to xpedite shareholders.as a condition of entering into the merger agreement,and in order to have some assurance of a favorable merger vote by the shareholders,premiere required all plaintiffs and some of the other shareholders to execute stockholder agreements.under these stockholder agreements,plaintiffs granted irrevocable proxies to premiere to vote their xpedite stock in favor of the merger 
section voting agreement.the stockholder hereby agrees that the stockholder shall vote or cause to be voted the shares and the other securities in xpedite in favor of the merger with premiere 
section irrevocable proxy.the stockholder hereby irrevocably appoints premiere and each of its officers to vote and otherwise act by written consent or otherwise with respect to the shares and other securities,which the stockholder is entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders of the company 
the stockholder agreements were only upon the termination of the merger agreement or at the effective time of the merger itself,whichever occurred first.premiere also required plaintiffs except stuart epstein and others to execute affiliate letters,setting forth potential limitations on the transferability of the premiere securities they would receive upon consummation of the merger.by executing the affiliate letters,plaintiffs acknowledged that a restrictive legend would be placed on the premiere common stock they were to receive in the merger.notably,plaintiffs warranted in the affiliate letters that they understood premiere was under no obligation to file a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec covering the disposition of their shares.emphasis in original.
more than two months later,on january,premiere registration statement for the xpedite merger became effective.on february,a majority of both xpedite and premiere shareholders voted to approve the merger.upon consummation of the merger,all xpedite shareholders received shares of premiere common stock for each share of xpedite stock they owned.pursuant to the merger agreement,the exchange ratio was determined by reference to the average closing price of premiere stock for a predetermined period of time.
on june and,premiere announced that it would have a shortfall in its revenues,and that it would be taking a charge against its bad debt reserves.this was a development not mentioned in the registration statement.on june,the price of premiere stock dropped from per share to per share,a decline of percent and an overall decline of percent from the merger price 
in november,within months after the premiere stock price dropped and before it rebounded,plaintiffs filed the underlying lawsuit and named premiere and certain of its directors and officers as defendants.in their complaint,plaintiffs asserted claims for breach of contract,negligent misrepresentation,and violations of several different provisions of the securities act of the securities act.as is relevant for the securities act claims and this appeal,plaintiffs contended that the decline in stock price was the result of numerous material defects in the registration statement.these allegedly false and misleading statements or omissions generally concerned premiere financial condition and expected growth.specifically,plaintiffs alleged that premiere had overstated its prior acquisitions of and attempts to integrate two voice messaging businesses enterprises and voicecom holdings,it misrepresented the status and viability of a particular product,orchestrate a comprehensive suite of integrated communication services,such as universal messaging with voice mail,facsimile and email,and conference calling it failed to disclose that premiere was experiencing dramatic declines in revenue from its business relationship with two other entities digitec and amway corporation and it touted that premiere had a strategy to become the world leading provider of enhanced personal communication services,yet premiere lacked sufficient internal controls and management capability to manage its growth and integrate its acquisitions,as well as to properly assess customer credit risk.plaintiffs alleged that these misstatements and omissions were material and that they violated section of the securities act section 
the district court dismissed the contract claim and certain of plaintiffs securities act allegations,after which the parties engaged in discovery.thereafter,the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs remaining securities act claims concluding,inter alia,that plaintiffs lacked standing because they acquired the securities through a private offering,and on plaintiffs negligent misrepresentation claims concluding that plaintiffs could not establish that they reasonably relied on the alleged misrepresentations.this summary judgment ruling was appealed to this court and set the stage for the decision reached by the prior panel.
in the first appeal,we affirmed summary judgment in favor of defendants as to plaintiffs negligent misrepresentation claims,but we reversed as to the lack of standing on the securities act claims.see generally apa excelsior iii premiere technologies,wl,unpublished opinion.as for the negligent misrepresentation claims,we concluded that plaintiffs had failed to exercise reasonable due diligence despite the fact that they knew or should have known of the general problems of which they complained.id.at.we specifically stated that plaintiffs were on notice of the problems with premiere integrating new acquisitions,the possibility of difficulties in launching the orchestrate product,and premiere general business relationships with licensees,yet plaintiffs failed to adequately investigate these problem areas.id.we thus agreed with the district court that plaintiffs had failed to present sufficient evidence from which a fact finder could find that plaintiffs reasonably relied on the misrepresentations.however,as for the securities act claims,we concluded that plaintiffs did,in fact,have standing because the securities had been obtained via an integrated and thus public offering.id.at.we went on to observe,however,that although there was standing under the securities act,defendants do not make the related,seemingly more attractive argument that,due to the time of their investment decision,plaintiffs could not possibly have relied on the registration statement and therefore should not be entitled to maintain their claims under section.id.at.we noted several times that plaintiffs made their investment commitment before the issuance of the registration statement.id.at.therefore,it was conceivable that plaintiffs should not be permitted to recover under section since reliance on the registration statement was impossible.id.at.we stated that this impossibility of reliance concept might go to the actual merits of the section claim.id.at.because defendants had not directly raised the issue,rather addressed it only obliquely in a footnote contained in a supplemental letter did not decide the point.
the case was then remanded to the district court,where defendants filed a renewed motion for summary judgment on the basis of the seemingly more attractive argument alluded to in our prior opinion.the district court interpreted our discussion of the potential bar to plaintiffs section claim as a road map.the district court first rejected plaintiffs argument that our repeated references to the timing of plaintiffs investment decision were dicta instead,the court held that our conclusion that plaintiffs made their commitment decision before the registration statement was new law of the case.in light of the timing of plaintiffs commitment and their sophistication and access to inside information,coupled with their failure to conduct meaningful due diligence,the district court opined that t rying to fit these investors within the class of individuals intended to be protected by the securities act is like trying to fit a round peg into a square hole.relying primarily on guenther cooper life sciences,which we had also referenced in our opinion,the district court held that summary judgment was appropriate because reliance under section was impossible on the facts of the case.furthermore,even if impossibility of reliance was not a valid defense,the district court concluded that plaintiffs could not establish loss causation and damages.
this second summary judgment ruling is at issue in this appeal.we affirm,but on a slightly different rationale 
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same legal standards as the district court.mccormick city of fort lauderdale,cir.
iii.discussion 
this case involves application of the commitment theory to a claim brought under section.the commitment theory in securities law appears to have begun as a means of establishing commencement of the statute of limitations for rule claims,promulgated under the securities exchange act of b.see,radiation dynamics,goldmuntz,cir t he time of a purchase or sale of securities within the meaning of rule is to be determined as the time when the parties to the transaction are committed to one another.see also kahn kohlberg,kravis,roberts,cir explaining that the commitment theory provides that once plaintiff has committed itself to the transaction,the claim accrues and thus the statute begins to run.other courts have recognized that the commitment theory is not limited to the rule statute of limitations context,but rather it may apply to claims brought pursuant to the securities act as well.westinghouse int l holdings,see also pell weinstein,applying commitment theory to a section claim holding that because the plaintiffs claims were based on misrepresentations in a prospectus that was filed only after there was commitment to the sale of securities,the sale could not possibly have been made by means of the prospectus,aff,cir.in such a circumstance,the commitment theory is based on the rationale that once the decision is made and the parties are committed to the transaction,there is little justification for penalizing alleged omissions or misstatements which occur thereafter and which have no effect on the decision.sec student mktg.
in deciding this appeal,we recognize that the issue for determination is one of first impression.as both the prior panel and district court acknowledged,and as the parties agree,hours of research have not uncovered any case directly on point.but there is,of course,a governing statute section.in interpreting this statute,which counsel for plaintiffs fittingly described at oral argument as tough and nasty,we are guided by the general principle of statutory construction that statutory language must be read in the context of the purpose it was intended to serve.united states ballinger,cir.en banc,cert.denied,d see also chapman houston welfare rights organization,d.stated differently,the language of a statute should not be considered in a vacuum and divorced from its underlying purpose.see ballinger,at.because the legislature is presumed to act with sensible and reasonable purpose,a statute should,if at all possible,be read so as to avoid an unjust or absurd conclusion.id.quoting in re chapman.accord united states mikelberg,cir a basic principle of statutory construction enjoins us from imputing to the legislature an intent to produce an absurd result.citations omitted binding precedent under bonner prichard,cir en banc.thus,in applying section to the facts of this case,we must always keep before us the underlying purpose of,and legislative intent behind,the statute.
plaintiffs suggest in their initial brief that reference to the legislative history of the securities act is improper and unnecessary because the statute is unambiguous on its face.but,as indicated above,it is our responsibility to read and apply section in a manner that honors the legislative intent of congress.indeed,as plaintiffs themselves acknowledge elsewhere in their brief,t his appeal is fundamentally about the language and legislative intent of section.emphasis added.to the extent these materials will assist in that regard,we may refer to the legislative history.train colorado public interest research group,d expressly holding that legislative history may be considered to determine congressional intent even if a statute is unambiguous on its face see also united states elgersma,cir.in other words,and to be clear,we do not reference the legislative materials to contravene the clear and unambiguous will of congress instead,we use these materials as an additional resource to determine if congress intended section to apply to a factual scenario like this case.ernst ernst hochfelder,d looking to legislative history to support an interpretation of section b of the securities exchange act even though the statute was unambiguous.relatedly,to the extent that we believe it would lead to an unreasonable result for plaintiffs to obtain refuge under section on the facts as presented in this case,we may consider the legislative materials to ascertain statutory intent.see united states american trucking ass ns.courts may look beyond the plain meaning of an unambiguous statute when that meaning will lead to absurd or futile results,or an unreasonable one inconsistent with the policy of the legislation as a whole further,when legislative materials are available and assist in determining statutory intent and meaning,there certainly can be no rule of law which forbids its use,however clear the words may appear footnotes omitted see also alabama power,cir w here the plain meaning of a statute leads to results that are absurd or at variance with the policy of the enactment,a reviewing court may seek guidance wherever available.
timing of plaintiffs investment decision and commitment 
early in this case,defendants advanced a commitment theory argument by way of a motion to dismiss.the district court noted that under the terms of the merger agreement,the obligations of each party to effect the merger were subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions.the district court thus held that the commitment theory was inapplicable because plaintiffs did not irrevocably commit themselves to the acquisition of premiere stock by executing the stockholder agreements.in reaching this conclusion,the district court relied on three cases standing for the general proposition that,in order for the commitment theory to apply,the investment decision and commitment must be irrevocable.see westinghouse int l holdings,commitment theory applies once the investment decision is made and the parties are irrevocably committed to the transaction pell weinstein,applying commitment theory specifically because plaintiffs lacked the power or authority to back out of the merger,aff,cir sec student mktg,commitment theory inapplicable where merger agreement stated that obligations to proceed with merger were subject to performance of certain conditions and the parties had no expectation or duty to proceed with the sales if the merger was aborted.on summary judgment,defendants asked that the district court reconsider its prior ruling on this issue.the district court denied defendants request,reiterating in its first summary judgment order that plaintiffs were not irrevocably committed to acquiring the premiere stock before the merger.
but,we stated several times in our prior decision that plaintiffs had made their investment commitment before the filing of the registration statement and,therefore,reliance on the registration statement would have been impossible.the district court held on remand that these statements were not dicta instead,the court ruled that our comments called its prior holding into question and were new law of the case.in light of this reading of our decision,the district court expressly held that plaintiffs made their investment decision prior to the issuance of the registration statement and they committed to purchase their shares prior to the issuance of the registration statement.
in this appeal,plaintiffs did not challenge the above holding anywhere in their initial brief nor did they do so directly in their reply brief.rather,they argued repeatedly throughout both briefs that the timing of their commitment was irrelevant for section purposes and that impossibility of reliance is no bar to their claim.while plaintiffs counsel took a different approach at oral argument,and suggested that plaintiffs were not fully committed to the merger before the registration statement because their commitment was revocable,we do not consider claims not raised in a party initial brief and made for the first time at oral argument.see,united states nealy,cir softball country decatur federal sav.loan ass n,cir bigby united states immigration and naturalization,cir.accordingly,it is not necessary for us to decide if the district court was correct in holding that the timing of plaintiffs investment commitment was law of the case.rather,plaintiffs waived the issue by not challenging that clear and express holding.
perhaps anticipating this result,and recognizing that it may have a bearing on their case,plaintiffs counsel stated at oral argument his belief that plaintiffs did,in fact,argue in their initial brief that the commitment decision was revocable.counsel for plaintiffs suggested that resolution of this issue boils down to interpreting the words of the brief.turning to the language in the initial brief does not help plaintiffs,however.plaintiffs did not raise this issue anywhere in their statement of the issues.instead,they described the pertinent issues as whether the district court erred in holding that reliance is an element of a section claim and whether impossibility of reliance is a valid defense thereto.consistent with this framing of the issues,plaintiffs argued several times in their initial brief that the timing of their investment decision and commitment is irrelevant.as reflected in their answer brief,defendants understood this argument to mean that plaintiffs were no longer claiming that their commitment was revocable.defendants thus stated in their answer brief that plaintiffs now concede that they made their investment decision prior to the effective date of the registration statement,and,furthermore,their commitment was binding.plaintiffs responded directly to this claim in their reply brief,but they still did not argue that their commitment was revocable.to the contrary,they merely stated in response that plaintiffs position is,and always has been,that the timing of their investment decision is irrelevant to their section claims irrespective of when plaintiffs decided to invest,the district court was incorrect as a matter of law when it granted summary judgment based upon its ruling that that sic reliance was impossible.emphasis in original.
this irrelevance argument is to be contrasted with the argument that plaintiffs made in opposition to defendants renewed summary judgment motion in the district court.at that time,quoting from the district court prior order,plaintiffs argued that they had not irrevocably committed themselves to the acquisition of premiere stock by executing the stockholder agreements.they were not irrevocably committed,plaintiffs argued in the district court,because they could have invalidated the merger agreement and terminated the merger by a number of different means.by not clearly raising this or a argument in their initial brief before this court and making only passing,cryptic reference in their reply brief,we must conclude that plaintiffs abandoned the argument.see,marek singletary,cir issues not clearly raised in the briefs are considered abandoned.
in summary,we accept the prior panel conclusion and the district court express holding on remand that plaintiffs made a binding investment commitment prior to the registration statement.we now proceed to consider the effect that holding has on the disposition of this appeal.
impossibility of reliance under section 
we begin here,as we must,with the language of the statute.in relevant part,section provides 
in case any part of the registration statement,when such part became effective,contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,any person acquiring such security unless it is proved that at the time of such acquisition he knew of such untruth or omission may,either at law or in equity,in any court of competent jurisdiction,sue five categories of persons therein named.
a.the statute creates a presumption that any person acquiring such security was legally harmed by the defective registration statement.see,kirkwood taylor,section in effect presumes that those who purchased stock in the public offering relied upon the allegedly misleading documents,aff,cir.but,that presumption ends after an earnings statement which covers a period of at least twelve months after the effective date of the registration statement has become available.the statute then sets out the months earnings period requirements 
if such person acquired the security after the issuer has made generally available to its security holders an earning statement covering a period of at least twelve months beginning after the effective date of the registration statement,then the right of recovery under this subsection shall be conditioned on proof that such person acquired the security relying upon such untrue statement in the registration statement or relying upon the registration statement and not knowing of such omission,but such reliance may be established without proof of the reading of the registration statement by such person.
a.intentional or willful conduct is not required under section and liability will attach even for innocent misstatements.herman maclean huddleston,d see also barker henderson,franklin,starnes holt,cir noting that section imposes liability without fault.to recover under the statute,a plaintiff need only show a material misstatement omission in the registration statement and be able to trace the security he acquired to that defective statement.huddleston,at.barnes osofsky,cir.that is,he must show that the security was issued under,and was the direct subject of,the prospectus and registration statement being challenged.barnes,at.however,as noted,a section plaintiff does not need to show that he actually relied on the registration statement unless he acquired the security after the issuer has made generally available to its security holders an earning statement covering a period of at least twelve months beginning after the effective date of the registration statement.see a.to put it another way,there is a conclusive presumption of reliance for any person purchasing the security prior to the expiration of twelve months.thomas lee hazen,the law of securities regulation,at ed accord barnes,at see also unicorn field,cannon group.plaintiffs here did not acquire their premiere stock after the issuance of a earning statement.therefore,if the section presumption applies,that would mean reliance is conclusively presumed.
before considering whether the section presumption applies,we must address plaintiffs threshold argument.plaintiffs argue primarily that reliance is not an element of a section claim and,consequently,reliance is irrelevant to,and plays no role in,this case.that is only partly true.plaintiffs are correct to the extent that reliance does not need to be proven except statement.reliance is ordinarily presumed.see,barnes,at.the statute intended purpose as it concerns the presumption of reliance is.for example,various house and senate bills relating to the securities act explain that when there is a defect in a registration statement,the public shall be presumed to rely on the defect.see,sess.see also,sess.accord,sess.stating that if there is a defective registration statement,the buyer presumably relies on the statement.
the concept of reliance was obviously important to congress in drafting section.the house report accompanying the version of the bill that ultimately became the securities act explains that responsibility under section is enforced against those who purport to issue statements for the public reliance.see,sess.in fact,congress made clear that the nature of section is specifically based on the legal principle that if one of two innocent persons must bear a loss,he should bear it who has the opportunity to learn the truth and has allowed untruths to be published and relied upon.moreover,he should suffer the loss who occupies a position of trust in the issuing corporation toward the stockholders,rather than the buyer of a stock who must rely upon what he is told.at emphasis added.if reliance were irrelevant to the analysis,as plaintiffs suggest,then no presumption would be required at all.to say that reliance is presumed is simply not the same thing as saying that reliance is irrelevant.lewis mcgraw,cir observing that shareholder cases which presume reliance on material misrepresentations and omissions under section e of the williams act did not abolish it as an element of the cause of action.rather,they held that in cases in which reliance is possible,and even likely,but is unduly burdensome to prove,the resulting doubt would be resolved in favor of the class the statute was designed to protect.
the above discussion recognizes that the presumption of reliance was an important and relevant concern for congress in drafting and promulgating section.that much is clear.what must be decided in this case is whether congress intended this presumption to apply or whether a purchaser of security falls outside the reach and scope of the statute when reliance is rendered impossible by virtue of a commitment 
plaintiffs argue that section is the equivalent of a strict liability statute.because their premiere stock was eventually issued under a defective registration was not stock already in the open contend that they have established a prima facie case under section.although the supreme court of the united states has not gone so far as to hold that section imposes strict liability,the court has made clear that the statute imposes a stringent standard of liability that is virtually absolute.huddleston,at.footnotes omitted.plaintiffs interpret this language to mean that summary judgment was wrongly granted as to defendants because the section presumption is strict and irrebuttable.however,plaintiffs argument presupposes that the section presumption applies in the first place.it does not.
first,as a matter of common sense,plaintiffs are not entitled to the presumption in light of the timing of their investment decision and commitment.to hold otherwise would mean that an impossible fact will be presumed in plaintiffs favor.as to this issue,lewis mcgraw,cir,is analogous and instructive.that case involved a shareholder suit under section e of the williams act e.the plaintiff shareholders alleged that the defendant board of directors made false and improper comments regarding a friendly business combination proposal by american express.these comments allegedly frustrated a merger that would have resulted in a stock price increase of per share.although the plaintiffs conceded that no tender offer ever took place and that no shareholder was ever in the position to offer his shares to american express at the stated price,they nonetheless contended that if they had been provided accurate and truthful information,the merger would have been consummated.the district court dismissed the complaint,holding that although the plaintiffs alleged deception on the part of the defendants,they were unable to establish that anyone actually relied to their detriment on the deception.
on appeal,the plaintiffs in lewis admitted that they could not establish is a required element under section e because they were never given the opportunity to tender their shares however,they rested upon cases holding that reliance may be presumed from a showing of materiality.id.at.the second circuit disagreed,concluding that while reliance may be presumed in section e cases,that is only where it is logical to do so.id.thus,where no reliance was possible under any imaginable set of facts,such a presumption would be illogical in the extreme.see also,piper aircraft,cir a presumption of reliance is proper where it is logical to presume that reliance in fact existed.here,as in lewis,it would be illogical to cloak plaintiffs with a presumption of reliance.plaintiffs made their investment decision and were legally committed to the transaction and thus could not possibly have relied on the
