the present litigation concerns the conversion rights of certain holders of convertible notes issued by defendant maverick tube maverick or the company pursuant to an indenture agreement.plaintiff law debenture trust of new york,which succeeded original plaintiff bank of new york as the indenture trustee collectively the trustee,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,richard sullivan,judge,dismissing its claim against maverick for breach of contract in refusing to allow the noteholders to convert their notes to cash and stock following the acquisition of maverick by defendant tenaris tenaris,and dismissing its claims against tenaris for tortious interference with contract and unjust enrichment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on the ground that the conversion rights that would have arisen upon the acquisition of maverick by a company whose common stock is traded on a united states national securities exchange were not triggered by maverick acquisition by tenaris,which has only american depositary shares or adss traded on the new york stock exchange or nyse.on appeal,the trustee contends principally that the district court erred in ruling as a matter of law that the trading of tenaris adss is not the trading of its common stock within the meaning of the indenture.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
background 
the facts are largely undisputed.the following description is drawn principally from the parties statements of material facts filed pursuant to the district court local rule and from the contract documents wit,the notes and the language is not in dispute.
a.the maverick notes and indenture the tenaris acquisition 
in,maverick,a united states manufacturer of tubing used in the oil and gas industry,raised capital by issuing debt securities the notes.in,maverick solicited holders of the notes to exchange them for new convertible debt securities denominated convertible senior subordinated notes due the new notes or the convertible notes to be issued pursuant to an indenture agreement the indenture.the new notes provide that,s ubject to the procedures set forth in the indenture,a holder may convert notes into cash and,if applicable,shares of common stock after the occurrence of a public acquirer change of control.convertible notes g.the terms used in this provision are defined in the indenture.
common stock means the common stock,par value per share,of the company indenture,at,the company being defined as maverick id.public acquirer,to the extent pertinent here,
means a person who i acquires the company or all or substantially all of the company assets in a consolidation,merger,share exchange,sale of all or substantially all of the company assets or other similar transaction and ii has a class of common stock traded on a united states national securities exchange 
id.at emphasis added.the term public acquirer change of control is defined as any change of control involving a public acquirer.id.change of control is defined to include any merger,sale,or other transfer of all or substantially all of maverick assets in exchange for consideration other than common stock traded on a united states national securities exchange.id.at.after there has been a public acquirer change of control,any right that the noteholder had to convert his notes into cash and common stock of maverick becomes a right to convert the notes into cash and the acquirer common stock referred to in the public acquirer definition.see indenture f,at.
tenaris is a joint stock corporation organized under the laws of luxembourg.it issues ordinary shares,which are common stock.in,tenaris entered into an agreement with a united states bank bank or depositary bank pursuant to which tenaris deposited a number of its ordinary shares with the bank,and the bank issued american depositary receipts adrs,with each adr evidencing an american depositary share.that agreement provided that each ads represented the right to receive a specified number of ordinary tenaris shares and a pro rata share of any other property or securities deposited with the bank.tenaris adss are traded on the new york stock exchange.
in june,maverick and tenaris announced that they had entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which tenaris would acquire all of maverick common stock for per share in cash.with respect to whether the anticipated merger would trigger the conversion rights of holders of the convertible notes under the indenture public acquirer change of control provision pacc provision,maverick filed a report with the securities and exchange commission sec stating that maverick did not believe that tenaris qualifie d as a public acquirer for such purposes because tenaris common stock is not traded on a united states national securities exchange.following the october consummation of the merger,some holders of the convertible notes nonetheless tendered their notes for conversion pursuant to the pacc provision.although maverick notified noteholders that they were entitled,until the close of business on december,to convert their notes into cash at the rate of per principal amount pursuant to a different provision,it refused to convert notes under the pacc provision.
b.the present action 
in december,the trustee commenced the present action on behalf of holders of the convertible notes against maverick and tenaris,seeking a declaratory judgment that the acquisition constituted a public acquirer change of control,damages from maverick for breach of the indenture,and damages from tenaris for tortious interference with contract and unjust enrichment.the trustee moved for partial summary judgment with respect to its request for a declaratory judgment on its claim maverick and tenaris moved for,inter alia,summary judgment dismissing all of the trustee claims.
in a memorandum and order dated october,district court opinion,the district court denied the trustee motion for partial summary judgment and granted the motion of maverick and tenaris for summary judgment dismissing the complaint in its entirety.with respect to the contract claim,the court noted that t he parties have each moved for summary judgment on the declaratory judgment and breach of contract claims,and each contends that there are no material issues of fact.the court agrees that there are no material disputed issues of fact district court opinion at.
as to the merits of the contract claim,the court found the relevant terms of the indenture to be unambiguous and hence appropriate for interpretation as a matter of law,stating as follows 
the question before the court is whether tenaris is a public acquirer for purposes of the pacc provision in the indenture.in turn,the question of whether tenaris is a public acquirer turns on whether tenaris has a class of common stock traded on a united states national securities exchange defs.only if tenaris is deemed to be a public acquirer is the pacc provision triggered and the holders of the notes entitled to the benefits of that provision.plaintiffs argue that because tenaris trades its stock in the form of adss on the nyse,tenaris has a class of common stock listed on a united states stock exchange and is thus a public acquirer.defendants assert that tenaris is not a public acquirer precisely because it is not listed on the nyse but instead trades in the form of adss.
for purposes of background,the court notes that in order for a foreign corporation to trade on the american stock exchange without listing its ordinary shares on the exchange,the foreign corporation must issue and deposit american depositary shares or adss with an american financial institution.see kingdom,star cruises plc,civ.dlc et,wl,at.the depositary institution then issues american depositary receipts or adrs to the beneficial owners of the adss,who are then free to sell the adss on american securities exchanges.id.the listing of adss on an american exchange makes trading an adr simpler and more secure for american investors than trading in the underlying security in the foreign market.in re australia bank sec,civ.bsj,wl,at,quoting pinker roche holdings,cir.
adss share several of the same characteristics as ordinary shares.for example,adrs are tradeable in the same manner as any other registered american security,may be listed on any of the major exchanges in the united states or traded over the counter,and are subject to the federal securities laws,at.however,there are important differences between adss and ordinary shares.a holder of an ads is not the title owner of the underlying shares the title owner of those shares is either the depositary,the custodian,or their agent.id.similarly,an ads represents an ownership interest in a foreign deposited security,whereas a share of stock represents an ownership interest in a corporation,that has been deposited with a depository,such as a united states bank or trust company.in re vivendi universal,d,citing sec,american depositary receipts,wl,at may.
the court finds that the unambiguous terms of the contract demonstrate that adss are not included in the definition of common stock for purposes of the public acquirer definition.first,the court finds that the term common stock is unambiguous.the indenture defines common stock as the common stock,par value per share,of the company maverick tube and does not include adss.second,the court also finds that common stock means the same thing as ordinary shares in fact,plaintiff itself admits that tenaris ordinary shares are the same as common stock.pl.the indenture clearly differentiates between ordinary shares and adss.for example,the term capital stock is defined in the indenture to include any and all shares including ordinary shares or american depositary shares wheeler decl.ex.a.finally,it is clear that,had the drafters wanted to include adss in the definition of common stock,they could have.the definition of the term fundamental change in the indenture see id.includes the phrase capital stock traded on a national securities exchange,which suggests that the drafters understood the difference between the implications of that phrase,which would include adss,and the phrase common stock traded on a united states national securities exchange,which would not include adss.thus,while it may be true that adss are treated similarly to common stock as plaintiff contends,the court finds that,based on the unambiguous terms of the indenture,they are two different terms with different meanings,describing different types of securities.accordingly,the court finds that tenaris does not have a class of common stock traded on a united states national securities exchange,and is thus not a public acquirer for purposes of the indenture.
district court opinion at emphasis and brackets in original.accordingly,the court concluded that defendants were entitled to summary judgment dismissing the trustee claim.
the district court also dismissed the trustee claims against tenaris.with respect to the claim of tortious interference with contract,the court noted that in order to recover on such a claim a plaintiff must establish,inter alia,an actual breach of the contract.having ruled that maverick did not breach the indenture,the court concluded that the trustee could not prevail on its claim.see id.at.the court dismissed the trustee unjust enrichment claim against tenaris on the grounds a that a claim for unjust enrichment,even against a third party,can not proceed when there is an express agreement between two parties governing the subject matter of the dispute,and b that,there having been no breach by maverick,tenaris causing,aiding,or abetting maverick refusal to convert the new notes did not enrich tenaris unjustly.id.at.
judgment was entered in favor of defendants,and this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,the trustee contends the district court erred in dismissing its contract and claims.it makes no argument with regard to its claim for unjust enrichment,and we thus regard any challenge to the dismissal of that claim as waived.see generally otero bridgeport housing authority,cir day morgenthau,cir.as to the contract claim,the trustee contends that it was entitled to partial summary judgment,arguing principally that the undisputed evidence shows,and the district court found,that tenaris has a class of common stock traded on a united states national securities exchange trustee brief on appeal at,and that in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants the district court adopted an interpretation of the public acquirer definition that disregarded custom and usage evidence and was commercially unreasonable see,id.at.the trustee contention that the dismissal of its claim was erroneous rests,explicitly,on its premise that the dismissal of its contract claim was erroneous.see id.at.for the reasons that follow,we reject all of the trustee contentions.
contract and summary judgment principles 
under new york law,which the parties agree is controlling here,the initial question for the court on a motion for summary judgment with respect to a contract claim is whether the contract is unambiguous with respect to the question disputed by the parties.international multifoods commercial union insurance,cir international multifoods see,beth medrash eeyun hatalmud spellings,cir beth medrash medical centers,breuer capital,cir.the matter of whether the contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court.see,international multifoods,at bailey fish neave,bailey greenfield philles records,greenfield associates,giancontieri,associates.
an ambiguity exists where the terms of the contract could suggest more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs,practices,usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business.international multifoods,at internal quotation marks omitted.evidence as to such custom and usage is to be considered by the court where necessary to understand the context in which the parties have used terms that are specialized.see,fox film springer.when the parties have used contract terms which are in common use in a business or art and have a definite meaning understood by those who use them,but which convey no meaning to t hose who are not initiated into the mysteries of the craft,the parties,in order to have the court construe their contracts,must furnish the court with the dictionaries they have used.id.at,at.in such circumstances,the court must be informed of the meaning of the language as generally understood in that business,in the light of the customs and practices of the business.id.at,at.

where the parties dispute the meaning of particular contract clauses,the task of the court is to determine whether such clauses are ambiguous when read in the context of the entire agreement,sayers rochester telephone.supplemental management pension plan,cir quoting associates,at,at,and where consideration of the contract as a whole will remove the ambiguity created by a particular clause,there is no ambiguity,readco,marine midland bank,at see,ewen associates,kuo.for example,in associates,which involved a dispute as to whether a sales contract provision stating that either the purchaser or the seller could terminate the contract at a certain time conferred that right only on the purchaser,the new york court of appeals noted that the contract,negotiated by sophisticated businessmen,contained other provisions that expressly bestowed certain options on the purchaser alone.the court concluded that any ambiguity in the disputed provision was resolved by consideration of the contract in its entirety and recognition of the contrasting provisions adopted by the parties.see at,at.

b.the provisions of the maverick indenture 
within the above legal framework,we see no error in the district court determinations that the pacc provision of the indenture is unambiguous,and that,although the tenaris ordinary shares are,undisputedly,the same as common stock,tenaris was not a public acquirer within the meaning of the indenture because the tenaris securities that are traded on the new york stock exchange are not the tenaris ordinary shares.
preliminarily,we note that the trustee assertion that the district court found that tenaris has a class of common stock traded on a united states national securities exchange trustee brief on appeal at is squarely contradicted by the district court opinion itself.although the quoted language appears in passages of the court opinion that describe the public acquirer definition or the trustee contention,the trustee provides no citation for its assertion that the court so f ound.indeed,the court ruling stated quite plainly that the court finds that tenaris does not have a class of common stock traded on a united states national securities exchange,and is thus not a public acquirer for purposes of the indenture,district court opinion at emphasis added.
our de novo review of the record persuades us that the district court correctly determined that the phrase common stock traded on a united states national securities exchange in the indenture public acquirer definition,when read in the context of the indenture as a whole,unambiguously does not include american depositary shares traded on such an exchange.the indenture sole definition of common stock does not mention adss.it states only that common stock means the common stock,par value per share,of the company defined as maverick indenture,at.the indenture does not provide a definition of common stock in general.
the indenture does,however,contain direct and indirect references to american depositary shares in other provisions.the most pertinent provisions are those dealing with fundamental change s prior to june,that would entitle a noteholder to require maverick to purchase his notes for cash see id.a fundamental change is defined to include consummation of any merger of the company pursuant to which its common stock will be converted into cash,securities or other property id,at,but to exclude a merger in which at least of the consideration consists of shares of capital stock traded on a national securities exchange id.at emphasis added.the indenture definition of capital stock expressly includes adss,and indeed refers to adss and ordinary shares in the disjunctive 
capital stock of any person means any and all shares including ordinary shares or american depositary shares,interests,participations or other equivalents however designated of corporate stock or other equity participations of such person 
id.at emphases added.
the parties could easily have included in the indenture a definition of common stock in general with a parenthetical phrase expressly including adss,such as the parenthetical in the definition of capital stock or they could have included such a parenthetical after common stock in the a class of common stock traded on a united states national securities exchange clause of the public acquirer definition.they did neither.given that the parties defined more than terms in the indenture and made explici
