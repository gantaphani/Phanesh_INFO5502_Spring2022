background 
psinet owes holdback to appellees 
in,appellees founded zebranet,an internet service provider.zebranet connected customers to the internet for a monthly fee.in october,psinet,a much larger internet company,offered to buy zebranet.appellees accepted psinet offer and executed a merger agreement with psinet.among other things,the merger agreement obligated psinet to pay appellees in cash at closing and an additional in cash,plus interest,by april.the deal closed,and appellees received the.the remaining owed by psinet to appellees is known as the holdback the payment still owed by psinet to appellees but held back until the merger was complete.
the october merger agreement between psinet and appellees also included a clause governing assignment of the rights and obligations under the merger agreement.that clause stated that 
n either this agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned by a party hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties,except that psinet may assign this agreement to any subsidiary or affiliate prior to or after the closing,by prior written notice to the appellees.
in other words,the merger agreement required that psinet notify appellees in writing prior to transferring to a psinet subsidiary any of the rights or obligations arising under the merger agreement.it is undisputed that psinet never gave any notice to appellees that its holdback obligation under the merger agreement had been assigned to any subsidiary.rather,psinet has consistently taken the position that its holdback obligation always remained with psinet.
psinet transfers certain assets to 
although psinet contends that the holdback obligation was never assigned to a subsidiary,appellees assert that it was transferred by psinet to its subsidiaries,appellant in this case.thus,we review in detail psinet agreement with.
in march,psinet created two subsidiary companies,global and on april,psinet entered into two contracts,the first transferring assets to global and the second transferring those assets from global to.these contracts are referred to as the april contribution agreements.under the agreements,psinet transferred to a specific list of assets,in particular roughly internet service customers of psinet,which included the customers of the former zebranet.
on july,psinet transferred a second set of assets to through two additional contracts,known as the july contribution agreements.the assets transferred included specific assets formerly owned by zebranet,including things like office furniture.
the parties in this case do not dispute which assets psinet transferred to.instead,their dispute is over which liabilities were transferred to and assumed by.specifically,the parties dispute whether appellant agreed to assume psinet holdback obligation to appellees.
each of the four contribution agreements includes identical language under a contract clause entitled assumption of liabilities.this clause states that 
hereby does assume and agree to pay,perform and discharge all debts,obligations,contracts and liabilities of psinet properly allocable and attributable to or arising from the transferred assets of every kind,character or description,whether accrued,absolute,known or unknown,contingent or otherwise,including,without limitation but only insofar as they relate to the transferred assets,all obligations of psinet existing or arising under the contracts,agreements and arrangements described in schedule a hereto provided,however,that shall not assume any debt,obligation,contract or liability of psinet not specifically assumed as provided above.
emphasis added.thus,under the assumption of liabilities clause in the contribution agreements,assumed and agreed to pay all liabilities properly allocable and attributable to or arising from the transferred assets.this same clause also provided,however,that shall not assume any debt,obligation,contract or liability of psinet not specifically assumed as provided above.
the contribution agreements between psinet and contain no reference to the remaining holdback liability owed by psinet to appellees pursuant to the october merger agreement.moreover,as noted earlier,prior to executing the contribution agreements with,psinet did not provide written notice to appellees to inform them that psinet would be transferring to either the entire merger agreement or psinet remaining holdback liability to appellees.
after the april and july contribution agreements were executed,psinet continued to list the holdback obligation as an outstanding liability in its financial statements.financial statements never listed the holdback liability.
on march,psinet sold its subsidiaries to a number of individuals.the contract transferring to its new owners expressly stated that psinet retained all holdback obligations,including the zebranet holdback liability.
psinet files for bankruptcy 
the merger agreement april deadline passed without psinet paying appellees the holdback.due to the burst of the internet bubble,psinet filed for chapter bankruptcy on may.in psinet bankruptcy filing,psinet listed the zebranet holdback obligation as unsecured debt of psinet and did not mention in relation to the holdback.
on february,appellees filed proofs of claim for the holdback money in psinet bankruptcy proceeding.appellees eventually prevailed on their claims in psinet bankruptcy and received slightly less than from psinet trustee as an initial payment on their holdback claim.appellees also received notice that additional payments on their holdback claim might be forthcoming from psinet bankruptcy.
appellees sue to recover the holdback 
in the meantime,appellees also filed the instant lawsuit in alabama state court in december.removed the case to federal court in alabama southern district.appellees complaint raised five claims only one of which count five is at issue in this appeal.in count five,appellees claimed that,as successor to psinet,was liable for the holdback owed to appellees.specifically,appellees argued that when psinet transferred the assets formerly owned by zebranet to,psinet also necessarily transferred the remaining holdback liability owed under the original merger agreement between psinet and zebranet.
during the course of the pretrial proceedings,the district court ruled that under the contribution agreements,appellant had assumed psinet holdback liability,effectively granting partial summary judgment in favor of appellees and against as to count five.a jury trial was held on july.before appellees case was considered by the jury,the district court granted motion for judgment as a matter of law on all remaining counts.the district court then entered judgment against appellant and in appellees favor on count five,awarding appellees the holdback,plus interest,but minus any amount paid to appellees pursuant to psinet bankruptcy.
appellant now appeals the entry of judgment on count five appellees,arguing only that the district court erred in its computation of the prejudgment interest awarded under count five.
