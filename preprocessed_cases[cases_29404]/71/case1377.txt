introduction 
laurens offner laurens appeals a judgment entered against him in three consolidated actions involving disputes between him and his three siblings,robin offner robin,alexandra offner ponce de leon alexandra,and sylvia offner caira sylvia collectively siblings,and the estate of his father,franklin offner the estate the actions involved disputes over the ownership of a family company,platypus wear,and its subsidiary,industries platypus and laurens alleged conversion of platypus corporate assets for his personal use.
the trial court impaneled a jury in the consolidated actions.the jury rendered a special verdict finding that laurens owned certain shares of platypus common stock in dispute sylvia owned shares of platypus preferred stock,and laurens had converted worth of platypus corporate assets for his personal use.the jury also found that laurens had acted with malice,fraud,or oppression,and awarded punitive damages in the amount of.
the trial court determined that all of the actions were equitable claims and that the jury verdict was therefore merely advisory.the trial court entered a judgment consistent with the jury special verdict,with one exception.contrary to the jury verdict,the trial court found that the shares of platypus common stock in dispute were owned by the estate,not by laurens.
on appeal,laurens contends the trial court erred in denying him the right to a jury trial on the issue of the ownership of platypus common stock excluding from evidence,pursuant to evidence code section,an sent by robin to sylvia,alexandra and laurens during settlement negotiations,in which robin mentioned the possibility of repurchasing the shares of platypus preferred stock from a third party and entering an award of in punitive damages when the jury did not have sufficient evidence of laurens financial condition.we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural backgrounda.factual.the founding of platypus 
in the early,laurens and a friend,scott cermansky,founded platypus as a beachwear clothing company.in,laurens and cermansky incorporated platypus.initially,laurens owned percent of platypus and cermansky owned percent.about a year later,the siblings purchased cermansky share of platypus,with robin,alexandra,and sylvia each owning percent of the company.
the agreement 
in,laurens entered into an agreement agreement with his father,franklin offner offner,which provided in relevant part 
i,the undersigned laurens offner,as security for 
loans made to be made to him personally for the benefit of platypus by franklin offner 
loans made to platypus directly by franklin offner and 
loans made by others to platypus,and guaranteed by franklin offner,
do hereby transfer to franklin offner of the stock i presently hold in platypus 
unless said of the stock is disposed of earlier by franklin offner as a part of the restructuring or sale of the company,he agrees to return to laurens offner said stock when said loans,with accrued interest,have been repaid to franklin offner,and he has been released by lender or lenders from all guarantees under above.
the agreement 
in,laurens determined that it was necessary to reorganize platypus.as part of the reorganization plan,platypus entered into an agreement the agreement in which offner agreed to receive shares of preferred stock in platypus in exchange for platypus owed offner.
the period 
in,offner was diagnosed with alzheimer disease.in december,offner executed various family planning documents.he created a trust the trust and executed a power of attorney in favor of his wife,janine offner janine.in july,offner doctor determined that offner was no longer competent to manage his own affairs.
by,the siblings began to actively participate as shareholders of platypus.in october,a dispute arose with regard to shares of preferred stock.laurens claimed he owned the shares because offner had transferred the shares to him in september.the siblings claimed that offner was not competent to make such a transfer at that time.the platypus board of directors resolved the issue by reissuing the shares to the trust.in december,the trust sold of the shares of offner preferred stock to paula sandberg,a friend of alexandra.
offner died in may,and janine died in november.alexandra was named executor of the estate.the siblings learned the extent of offner investment in platypus only after their parents deaths.the siblings also became concerned that laurens may have been converting platypus corporate assets for his personal use.from june through october,the siblings and laurens exchanged numerous in an attempt to resolve various disputes regarding platypus.in april,sandberg transferred the shares of preferred shares to sylvia.
procedural summary 
the three actions 
this appeal stems from three consolidated actions buckley platypus wear,super.san diego county,no.gic the buckley action,platypus wear,offner super.san diego county,no.gic the platypus action,and ponce de leon platypus wear,super.san diego county,no.gic the corporations code action.
a.the buckley action 
in the buckley action,robert buckley,acting as trustee of the trust,brought a breach of contract claim and an action to recover collateral against laurens and platypus,in an attempt to collect on a note.the trial court granted summary judgment on those claims and they are not at issue in this appeal.in addition,sylvia brought shareholder derivative claims and claims for an accounting,and a constructive trust against laurens on behalf of platypus,based on allegations that laurens had converted platypus corporate funds for his personal use.
b.the platypus action 
the platypus action involved three complaints.platypus filed a declaratory relief action in which it claimed that there was a dispute between the siblings and laurens regarding the ownership of shares of its common stock and shares of its preferred stock.platypus sought a judicial determination of the ownership of the stock in dispute.
alexandra and sylvia filed a.the was styled as a request for declaratory relief,seeking a judicial determination of the ownership of the common and preferred stock referred to in platypus complaint.with regard to the common stock,alexandra and sylvia alleged that the agreement transferred the common stock to offner,that the transfer had not been reversed,and that the shares thus remained the property of the estate.alexandra and sylvia alleged that laurens claimed the agreement had never been formalized,and that any obligation to transfer stock had been discharged by the restructuring of platypus in,when offner was given preferred shares.
with regard to the shares of preferred stock,alexandra and sylvia alleged that in,the trust sold preferred shares to sandberg and that in,sandberg sold the shares to sylvia.alexandra and sylvia alleged that laurens claimed the shares had been previously transferred by offner to platypus and that therefore the shares had not been available for transfer to sandberg.
laurens brought a in which he alleged that the estate had breached the agreement by claiming ownership to certain of laurens platypus common stock.he requested monetary damages for this breach.laurens also brought similar claims and requests for damages with respect to the agreement and the shares of preferred stock.
laurens further alleged in his that there was a dispute between the estate and laurens regarding whether the agreement entitled offner to ownership of any of platypus common stock and,if so,whether any such entitlement had been extinguished by the agreement.in addition,laurens claimed that either he or platypus,and not sylvia,owned the disputed shares of the preferred stock.laurens requested declaratory relief as to the ownership of the disputed shares of common and preferred stock.
c.the corporations code action 
the siblings,including alexandra both in her individual capacity and as the executor of the estate,brought an action pursuant to corporations code section seeking an order directing platypus to register shares of common stock in the name of the estate and shares of preferred stock in sylvia name.the complaint also sought to resolve various other corporate governance issues involving platypus that are not relevant to this appeal.
evidentiary rulings 
prior to trial,the trial court granted motions in limine brought by both laurens and the siblings to exclude from evidence,under evidence code section,various sent among laurens and the siblings during settlement negotiations.laurens subsequently filed a motion to vacate the trial court ruling on the siblings motion,claiming that evidence code section did not preclude admission of an robin sent to sylvia,alexandra and laurens on october.the record does not indicate whether or not the trial court ruled on this motion.
the jury special verdict 
the jury rendered a special verdict,finding that laurens owned the disputed shares of platypus common stock,and that sylvia owned the disputed shares of platypus preferred stock.the jury also found that laurens had converted worth of platypus corporate assets for his personal use.in addition,the jury found that laurens had acted with malice,fraud,or oppression,and awarded punitive damages in the amount of.
the court consideration of the jury special verdict 
after dismissing the jury,the court stated 
we are in session now to work on those matters that were reserved to the court.and i know laurens counsel has previously expressed the view that the only issues for the jury were the common stock,that would be the issues concerning exhibit.and the jury has provided a verdict on that and the preferred stock and the jury has provided us with its decision on those issues,and that all the remaining issues are for the court,and the court sought some advisory verdicts from the jury in that regard,and we have a number of those.
so i like to hear from each counsel regarding those decisions in each counsel view which remain for the court to decide.
the siblings counsel argued that the court was to decide the issue of the ownership of the common stock.laurens counsel maintained that this issue was properly one for the jury.the next day the court heard further argument regarding the ownership of the common stock and whether the issue of ownership was for the court,or the jury,to decide.the court stated,i asked for advisory verdicts on a number of items.and this was one of the questions i asked by way of an advisory verdict.
the trial court judgment 
the court found that sylvia owned the shares of preferred stock.however,contrary to the jury advisory verdict,the court found that the estate owned the shares of common stock.the court agreed with the jury advisory verdict regarding sylvia shareholder derivative claims and the imposition of compensatory and punitive damages as to those claims.specifically,the court found laurens had abused his position of trust and confidence with platypus in converting a total of worth of corporate funds for his personal benefit.the court awarded compensatory damages in this amount and also awarded prejudgment interest in the amount of.the court further found that laurens had acted with fraud,oppression,and malice in converting platypus funds for his personal benefit,and awarded an additional in punitive damages against him on sylvia derivative complaint 
laurens motion for a new trial and appeal 
laurens filed a motion for a new trial.the trial court denied the motion in its entirety.laurens timely appeals.
discussiona.laurens did not have the right to a jury trial under the california constitution on the issue of the ownership of platypus common stock 
laurens claims he had the right,under the california constitution,to a jury trial on the issue of the ownership of platypus common stock.
standard of review 
the issue whether laurens was constitutionally entitled to a jury trial on the issue of the ownership of the common stock is a pure question of law that we review de novo.see ghirardo antonioli cal th,d,noting that questions of law not involving disputed facts are reviewed de novo.
the right to a jury trial under the california constitution 
article,section of the california constitution provides in relevant part 
trial by jury is an inviolate right and shall be secured to all 
in c k engineering contractors amber steel cal d,c k engineering contractors,the california supreme court outlined the basic parameters governing the right to a jury trial under the state constitution 
the right to a jury trial is guaranteed by our constitution.cal,art.i.we have long acknowledged that the right so guaranteed,however,is the right as it existed at common law in,when the constitution was first adopted,and what that right is,is a purely historical question,a fact which is to be ascertained like any other social,political or legal fact.citations.as a general proposition,the jury trial is a matter of right in a civil action at law,but not in equity.
the c k engineering contractors court also outlined the manner by which a court should determine whether an action is one at law or in equity 
if the action has to deal with ordinary rights cognizable in courts of law,it is to that extent an action at law.in determining whether the action was one triable by a jury at common law,the court is not bound by the form of the action but rather by the nature of the rights involved and the facts of the particular gist of the action.a jury trial must be granted where the gist of the action is legal,where the action is in reality cognizable at law.citation.on the other hand,if the action is essentially one in equity and the relief sought depends upon the application of equitable doctrines,the parties are not entitled to a jury trial.c k engineering contractors,supra,cal d at.
the c k engineering contractors court also explained that while the relief sought is among the most important factors in determining whether an action is legal or equitable,it is not necessarily determinative 
although we have said that the legal or equitable nature of a cause of action ordinarily is determined by the mode of relief to be afforded citation,the prayer for relief in a particular case is not conclusive citations.thus,the fact that damages is one of a full range of possible remedies does not guarantee the right to a jury c k engineering contractors,supra,cal d at.
declaratory relief and quiet title claims are generally equitable 
it is well established that a true action for declaratory relief is equitable 
an action for declaratory relief is an equitable proceeding and the powers of a court are as broad and extensive as those exercised by such court in any ordinary proceeding in equity citation.it is elementary that questions relating to the formation of a contract,its validity,its construction and effect,excuses for nonperformance,and termination are proper subjects for declaratory relief citation.fowler ross d.fowler.
declaratory relief is classified as equitable by reason of the type of relief offered.witkin,cal.procedure ed pleading.more specifically,a declaratory action to identify rights is distinct from a coercive action to enforce rights.state farm mut.auto.ins.superior court cal d,state farm.at common law,only the latter existed.tolle struve.thus,declaratory relief developed as an equitable form of relief to fill this gap.ibid.
an action to quiet title is akin to an action for declaratory relief in that the plaintiff seeks a judgment declaring his rights in relation to a piece of property.code civ,the court shall examine into and determine the plaintiff title against the claims of all the defendants witkin,supra,pleading,noting that an action to quiet title has a declaratory effect.as with declaratory relief in general,the action to quiet title evolved as an equitable remedy 
the action to quiet title,under our practice,is a development of the bill of peace of the court of chancery.the main purpose of this proceeding was to prevent repeated attempts to litigate a title,and to protect the real owner of the right against the annoyance and expense incidental to a multiplicity of suits.it was upon these considerations that the court of chancery has granted perpetual injunctions to restrain further litigation,and thus has in some degree put that restraint upon litigation which was the policy of the ancient law in real actions.pomeroy equity jurisprudence.brewer king d.
thus,it is also well established that actions to quiet title,like true declaratory relief actions,are generally equitable in nature.strauss summerhays d.strauss.
notwithstanding the foregoing,a party can not,merely by labeling his action declaratory,circumvent the other party right to a jury trial where a coercive claim sounding in law is involved.in state farm,supra,cal d at page,an insurance company commenced an action styled as a request for declaratory relief against its insured to determine whether its policy provided benefits in connection with an automobile accident involving the insured.while the declaratory relief action was pending,several personal injury suits were brought against the insured.ibid.the supreme court held that the trial court had properly granted a jury trial in the declaratory relief action 
i f the issues of fact arising would have been triable by a jury as of right in an action which might have been substituted for the declaratory judgment action by either party,then there is a right to jury trial on such issues.while kaliterna wright d,appears to hold that,regardless of the circumstances,the court in a declaratory relief action may dispose of all factual issues without a jury,such view fails to preserve the distinction between legal and equitable issues,and it must be disapproved.citation.in short,the courts will not permit the declaratory action to be used as a device to circumvent the right to a jury trial in cases where such right would be guaranteed if the proceeding were coercive rather than declaratory in nature.state farm,supra,cal d at.
in particular,where an action for declaratory relief is in effect used as a substitute for an action at law for breach of contract,a party is entitled to a jury trial as a matter of right.patterson insurance of north america d,italics added.that is because a suit to recover damages for breach of contract is an action at law in which a right to jury trial ordinarily exists.raedeke gibraltar sav.loan cal d.
the gist of the action pertaining to the common stock is an equitable claim for declaratory relief or to quiet title 
although,as noted ante,this is an appeal from a judgment in three consolidated buckley action,the platypus action,and the corporations code claim to a jury trial is premised primarily on the platypus action laurens acknowledges that platypus declaratory relief action to determine who properly owns the shares of common stock sounds exclusivity in equity.however,he asserts a right to the jury trial based on his and on alexandra and sylvia in the platypus action,and also on the fact that sylvia sought money damages on her shareholder derivative claims in the buckley action.
laurens advances three primary theories in support of his claim that the gist of the action to determine ownership of the common stock is legal,rather than equitable.first,he argues that alexandra and sylvia declaratory relief claim can not be used as a substitute for an action at law.to the extent laurens contends that alexandra and sylvia were using a declaratory action in the place of a breach of contract action for damages,we reject that argument.the gist of their action was one to declare their rights to the common stock,based on the agreement,and to quiet title in that stock.true declaratory relief actions and actions to quiet title are equitable in nature.fowler,supra,d at.strauss,supra,d at.
further,even if alexandra and sylvia were construed as coercive rather than declaratory in nature,the gist of their would not be one in which a right to a jury trial would be guaranteed.state farm,supra,cal d at.rather,the gist of their action would be for specific performance of the agreement.a claim for specific performance is an equitable one.nwosu uba th,d.therefore,we reject laurens argument that alexandra and sylvia were attempting to bring a breach of contract action for damages in the guise of a declaratory relief action.
laurens also maintains that alexandra and sylvia declaratory action can not be used to defeat his right to a jury trial of the breach of contract claims he alleges in his,citing state farm,supra,cal d at pages.we agree with the siblings that alexandra and sylvia did not bring their declaratory relief action in order to circumvent laurens right to a jury trial on his breach of contract claims,which are based on the premise that the estate breached those agreements by claiming rights under them.for the same reason,we reject laurens implicit argument,raised in reply,that while state farm precludes a party from using the declaratory judgment procedure to circumvent his opponent right to a jury trial,laurens may tack on a legal claim to the declaratory action and thereby manufacture a right to a jury trial on equitable issues.such a contention is contrary to the fundamental principle that,in determining the right to a jury,it is not the form of the action but rather the nature of the rights involved and the facts of the particular case,that determine whether an action is legal or equitable.c k engineering contractors,supra,cal d at.
we next consider laurens argument that he had a right to a jury trial because the gist of the action involving the common stock is one in which all of the parties seek possession of stock.italics added.laurens acknowledges that there is no right to a jury trial in an ordinary quiet title action,citing strauss,supra,d at page.however,he relies on cases involving real property that state that a quiet title action in which possession of the property is sought may be legal in nature,citing dills delira d,dills.
the possession exception to the equitable nature of a quiet title action does not apply in this case for three reasons.first,the possession exception is premised on the fact that such an action is,in part,in a case involving real property,an action for ejectment,which is legal in nature.comment,quieting title under civ,effect of on right to jury trial cal,i f the action to quiet title is brought by a party out of possession against one claiming title who is in possession,the action is in substance one of ejectment and the defendant is entitled to a jury as of right witkin,cal.procedure,supra,actions,noting that quiet title action is normally equitable,but becomes a legal action when it takes on the character of an ejectment proceeding,when the issue is the right to recover possession lost by recent ouster.this case,however,is an action involving intangible personal property.laurens has cited no authority suggesting that the possession exception applies in this context.further,assuming it is possible to maintain an action seeking to recover the possession of an intangible object,the gist of this action was a dispute over ownership of the stock,not possession of it.third,alexandra and sylvia did not seek possession of the stock in their complaint.i t is well settled that an action to establish title which does not include a prayer to obtain possession of the property is equitable in nature.dills,supra,d at.thus,we reject laurens argument that he was entitled to a jury trial because the gist of the action involved a quiet title dispute over possession of the common stock.
finally,we also reject laurens contention that he was entitled to a jury trial because the siblings were seeking damages.laurens argues the siblings sought damages in the buckley action in connection with breach of the security agreement,a demand for resulting damages,and possession of collateral the common stock based on breach of that agreement.laurens conceded in his reply brief that this citation was in error as the complaint references another dispute over a security agreement and not the agreement at issue here.
however,laurens continues to assert in his reply brief that the siblings complaint does request damages.this argument is unpersuasive.laurens only support for this argument is another citation to the prayer for relief in the buckley action that sought damages based on wholly distinct equitable derivative claims and a breach of contract cause of action that laurens acknowledges is not at issue in this appeal.clearly,these claims in the buckley action did not create a right to a jury trial in the platypus action on the issue of who owns the common stock.this is particularly true in view of the fact that the request for damages on the breach of contract claim in the buckley action had been dismissed by the time the trial in this case took place,and the damages sought in the derivative action were based on equitable,not legal,claims see part,post.
we conclude laurens was not entitled to a jury trial on the issue of ownership of the common stock of platypus 
b.the common stock did not belong to laurens as a matter of law 
laurens claims that even assuming he had no right to a jury trial on the issue of the ownership of the common stock,the shares belonged to him as a matter of law.we disagree.
laurens maintains he was entitled to the common stock as a matter of law based on recitals in a october interim agreement for appointment of directors agreement and the december interim shareholders agreement agreement.laurens claim is premised on the fact that the agreement states that he owns the common stock in dispute,and that the agreement does not list the estate as owning any common stock.he argues that the agreement was signed by robin and that the siblings were all parties to the agreement.in denying laurens motion for a new trial on this ground,the trial court found that neither of these agreements was binding on the estate because the estate was not a party to either agreement.
laurens concedes in his reply brief that he does not seek to have the recitals binding on the estate but rather binding on the plaintiffs in this siblings who brought this action in the name of the estate.italics added.whether or not the recitals are binding on the siblings is irrelevant to the issue of whether laurens owns the shares as a matter of law,because the trial court concluded that the common shares were owned by the estate.because laurens raises no claim that the siblings actions bound the estate,we conclude that laurens has not established that he owned the common stock as a matter of law 
c.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding an sent by robin during settlement negotiations in which he mentioned the possibility of repurchasing shares of preferred stock 
laurens claims the trial court erred in excluding from evidence an sent by robin to sylvia,alexandra and laurens on october,in which robin suggested that the siblings repurchase shares of platypus preferred stock that had previously been sold to paula sandberg.the court excluded the pursuant to evidence code section,which provides generally that offers to settle a claim,and negotiations pertaining to such offers,are inadmissible to prove liability on the claim.
relevant procedural 
laurens filed a motion in limine to preclude any evidence of or reference to between laurens and his siblings in october regarding settlement negotiations on the grounds that such evidence constitutes an attempt by his siblings to resolve their disputes and is thus inadmissible under california evidence code section.in his motion,laurens contended that the constituted attempts to negotiate a settlement of their disputes,including the dispute underlying this lawsuit 
the siblings filed an opposition to laurens motion in which they stated that although they agreed with laurens that all october settlement should be excluded,they opposed laurens attempt to selectively offer just one of the series of in evidence.the siblings also concurrently filed a separate motion in limine in which they noted that laurens was seeking to introduce a single isolated in which robin suggests shares of preferred stock and then retiring that stock.the siblings argued that robin october,was inadmissible because it was part of a larger series of negotiations encompassing all aspects of the siblings settlement negotiations.the trial court granted both laurens motion and the siblings motion.as a result of the rulings,all of the in question were excluded.
laurens subsequently filed a motion to vacate the trial court ruling on the siblings motion.in his motion,laurens claimed that evidence code section did not preclude admission of robin october.laurens further argued that this was critical to prove that at the time the shares of preferred stock were issued to sandberg,there was a tacit understanding among laurens and his siblings that platypus would later reacquire the shares and retire them.the record does not indicate whether or not the trial court ruled on this motion.
laurens later claimed in his motion for a new trial that the trial court exclusion of the october,was erroneous and prejudicial.in its order denying the motion for a new trial,the trial court ruled that the was properly excluded under evidence code section.
the siblings contend that laurens has waived this claim because the record does not contain a ruling on laurens motion to vacate the ruling excluding the october.
evidence code section provides generally that a ruling excluding evidence shall not serve as the basis for the reversal of a judgment unless the substance,purpose,and relevance of the excluded evidence was made known to the trial court,subd.a.however,this provision does not apply if the rulings of the trial court rendered compliance with this requirement futile,subd.b.
in the siblings motion in limine,they argued that the october,should be excluded along with the other at issue,pursuant to evidence code section.the trial court granted the siblings motion in limine.thus,the substance,purpose,and relevance of the was made known to the trial court before it excluded the evidence,subd.a.laurens further made the trial court aware of the relevance of the through his subsequent motion to vacate.in addition,laurens renewed his objection to the exclusion of the in his motion for a new trial,which the trial court denied.
under these circumstances,we conclude laurens adequately preserved his evidentiary objection to the exclusion of the october.accordingly,we reject the siblings contention that laurens has waived this claim because the record does not contain a ruling on laurens motion to vacate.
standard of review 
we have not found any california case law that specifically addresses the appropriate standard of review to apply in reviewing a trial court exclusion of evidence under evidence code section.however,it is well established in california that,a trial court ruling on the admissibility of evidence generally is reviewed for abuse of discretion.people griffin cal th,d.in addition,numerous courts have applied the abuse of discretion standard to the review of rulings pertaining to the admissibility of settlement offers,under analogous evidentiary provisions in other jurisdictions,athey farmers ins.exchange cir,alexander city of evansville,indiana cir,union river associates budman me.accordingly,we conclude that the trial court exclusion of robin,pursuant to evidence code section,is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.
evidence codes section broadly precludes the introduction of statements made in the context of settlement negotiations 
evidence code section,subdivision a provides 
evidence that a person has,in compromise or from humanitarian motives,furnished or offered or promised to furnish money or any other thing,act,or service to another who has sustained or will sustain or claims that he or she has sustained or will sustain loss or damage,as well as any conduct or statements made in negotiation thereof,is inadmissible to prove his or her liability for the loss or damage or any part of it.italics added.
the law revision commission comment accompanying the enactment of evidence code section specifically emphasized that the statute was drafted to include statements made in the context of settlement negotiations 
the words as well as any conduct or statements made in negotiation thereof make it clear that statements made by parties during negotiations for the settlement of a claim may not be used as admissions in later litigation.this language will change the existing law under which certain statements made during settlement negotiations may be used as admissions.people ex rel.public works forster cal d,forster.the rule excluding offers is based upon the public policy in favor of the settlement of disputes without litigation.the same public policy requires that admissions made during settlement negotiations also be excluded the rule of the forster case is changed by evidence code section because that rule prevents the complete candor between the parties that is most conducive to settlement.cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll.
in light of this legislative history,courts have recognized that the purpose of section is to promote candor in settlement negotiation in re marriage of schoettgen d,quoting warner constr.city of los angeles cal d,warner.evidence should be excluded under evidence code section where the strong public policy favoring settlement negotiations and the necessity of candor in conducting them combine to require exclusion c k engineering contractors,supra,cal d at.
in c k engineering contractors,the plaintiff contractor sued the defendant subcontractor on a promissory estoppel theory,based on the subcontractor failure to perform in accordance with its bid on a subcontract.c k engineering contractors,supra,cal d at.the subcontractor claimed that the promise was not enforceable because the contractor had known prior to submitting the bid that the defendant bid contained an error.ibid.the record contained conflicting testimony as to whether or not the contractor chief estimator potts had informed the subcontractor chief estimator bass during a telephone conversation that the subcontractor bid was far lower than the other bids the contractor had received.id.at.
the defendant sought to introduce additional testimony that,during settlement discussions,plaintiff agent admitted that potts recounted to him a version of the telephone conversation which was practically word for word the same as bass own version.c k engineering contractors,supra,cal d at.the supreme court noted that s uch testimony might have impeached potts direct testimony to the effect that he advised bass that defendant bid was a hell of a lot lower than the other bids.ibid.the c k engineering contractors court held that the trial court had properly excluded the evidence 
u nder evidence code section,subdivision a,conduct or statements made in negotiation of compromise are inadmissible to prove liability defendant relies on forster supra,cal d at pages,wherein we held that an independent and absolute admission of fact which is intended to admit liability is admissible even though it was made during the course of compromise negotiations.the forster case,however,was decided prior to the enactment of section,and the comment of the california law revision commission make s it clear that the current language of this section changed the prior law under the forster decision.according to the commission,t he rule of the forster case is changed by section because that rule prevents the complete candor between the parties that is most conducive to settlement.citations.in the present case,the excluded admission occurred during compromise negotiations in which both parties were discussing,and attempting to discover,the facts underlying their dispute.ibid.
in this case,robin sent an dated october,to sylvia,alexandra,laurens,and melody harris in which he stated 
as a reminder,in we sold shares of stock to paula sandberg.more than three years have gone by.we should repurchase those shares and retire them.
this was one of numerous sent among the siblings during september and october,while they were attempting to resolve several interrelated disputes regarding platypus.the disputes included the repayment of loans offner had made to laurens and platypus,laurens misappropriation of money from the company for his personal use,the composition of the platypus board of directors,and the siblings ownership stakes in the company.in some of the,the parties refer to various settlement positions,and in others,they refer to the possibility of litigation.for example,laurens sent an to the siblings on september,in which he attempted to resolve these disputes by requesting a number from you guys for all debt and stock that will permanently conclude our business together.
in considering whether robin october,was excludable under these circumstances,we note that the issue of the ownership of all of the shares of platypus,a closely held family company,would be critical information in evaluating laurens offer and resolving the parties many interrelated disputes.further,robin testified in a deposition that he sent the october,to rekindle faltering settlement negotiations.thus,robin was sent at a time during compromise negotiations in which both parties were discussing,and attempting to discover,the facts underlying their dispute.c k engineering contractors,supra,cal d at.therefore,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding this.
we reject all of laurens arguments to the contrary.laurens acknowledges that at the time robin sent the in question,the parties were in negotiations however,he argues that evidence code section does not apply to this particular because the ownership of the shares referenced in the was not in dispute at the time robin sent the,citing price wells fargo bank d,footnote.price and warner,supra,cal d.
in price,the court of appeal concluded that certain letters discussing the plaintiffs obligations under a contract were admissible,notwithstanding evidence code section,because there was nothing in the record to suggest that there was any dispute regarding such obligations at the time the letters were written.price,supra,d at,fn.however,unlike in this case,the parties in price were not negotiating any disputes at the time the letters were sent.
in warner,the supreme court held that certain letters discussing the parties interpretation of their duties under a contract were excludable pursuant to evidence code section because they were written after a controversy had arisen.warner,supra,cal d at.while the warner court suggested that evidence of the parties interpretation of their obligations under a contract that existed prior to a dispute arising would be admissible,the court did not consider the admissibility of statements made in negotiation of an existing dispute.id.at.in short,unlike in price and warner,the parties in this case were attempting to resolve multiple related disputes at the time robin sent the october.
further,even assuming that price and warner held that evidence code section applies only when there is a dispute regarding the particular issue referenced in the evidence in question,there is evidence that there was in fact such a dispute in this case.just two weeks after robin wrote the october,laurens sent an to the siblings and harris in which he broadly stated 
i have a long record of disputing how the preferred stock was handled.however,in the interest of repairing relationships and moving ahead,as previously stated,i am willing to negotiate all of this so everyone feels that they receive what was is sic fairly due them.
although laurens asserts in his reply brief that this statement referred to a separate block of preferred stock,the wording of his is not so limited.we also reject laurens contention that robin trial and deposition testimony and sylvia trial testimony establish that as of october there was no dispute regarding the block of preferred shares at issue.at most,robin testimony suggests that he was willing to support the idea of reacquiring the stock and retiring the shares at that time.neither robin nor sylvia testimony establishes that the parties had no dispute over the stock referenced in the october.
laurens also argues that that the rule which excludes offers of compromise does not apply to statements which are in nowise connected with any attempt of compromise or are statements of fact independent of an offer of compromise.moving picture machine operators union local glasgow theaters,d.moving picture.the moving picture court relied on cases decided prior to the enactment of section for this proposition.moving picture,supra,d at,citing smith whittier cal,kelly steinberg d,people ex rel.of public works glen arms estate,d.forster,supra,cal d.
although statements that are truly independent of an offer of compromise are still admissible in the wake of the enactment of section,the question which statements are connected and which statements are independent moving picture,supra,d at,must be answered in light of the strong policy in favor of promoting candor during settlement negotiations embodied in the statute.for the reasons stated above,robin was connected to an attempt to compromise and was not independent ibid.of an offer to compromise.
finally,laurens reliance on fieldson associates,whitecliff laboratories,d.fieldson,is also misplaced.fieldson involved a plaintiff claim for breach of contract for the supply of display cartons and a defendant for lost profits based on a separate alleged purchase order agreement for coffee makers.id.at.the plaintiff was allowed to introduce letters in which settlement of the contract claim was discussed,for the purpose of showing that the lack of discussion regarding the lost profits claim demonstrated the nonbonding nature of the purchase agreement for coffee makers.id.at.the fieldson court held that the letters were admissible for this limited purpose 
the letters were received for the sole purpose of showing the nonbinding nature of the purchase order in order to defeat appellant.when considered for that limited purpose,the letters had no bearing upon the primary validity of the claim asserted by respondent against appellant for the unused cartons.evidence code section provides that evidence that a party has offered to compromise a claim is inadmissible to prove liability for that claim.ibid.
thus,in fieldson,the letters were admitted to prove a claim that was wholly distinct from the claim discussed in the letters themselves.in this case,in contrast,laurens contends that the in question was the key corroborating evidence that there was a tacit agreement to retire the shares of preferred stock.in other words,laurens sought admission of the to prove a claim that was specifically discussed in the.fieldson is clearly distinguishable.
we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding robin october.
d.the trial court properly determined laurens financial condition before it awarded punitive damages 
laurens claims the punitive damages awarded on sylvia shareholder derivative claims must be reversed because she failed to present sufficient evidence of his financial condition to the jury.we conclude that there is no right to a jury trial on equitable shareholder derivative claims under california law,even where punitive damages are sought we further conclude that the trial court awarded the punitive damages in this case and that the trial court order directing laurens to produce a current financial statement before it awarded the punitive damages precludes laurens from claiming on appeal that the record contains insufficient evidence of his financial condition to support the award 
the record must contain meaningful evidence of a defendant financial condition in order to sustain an award of punitive damages 
in adams murakami cal d,the california supreme court outlined the standards an appellate court must employ when considering whether a punitive damages award is excessive as a matter of law or raises a presumption that it is the product of passion or prejudice.the adams court began by noting that the purpose of punitive damages is to punish wrongdoing and to deter future misconduct,either by the same defendant or other potential wrongdoers.id.at.in determining whether the amount of damages serves those interests,a reviewing court must consider the importance of the nature of the defendant wrongdoing,the amount of compensatory damages,and the defendant financial condition.ibid.accordingly,the adams court held,an award of punitive damages can not be sustained on appeal unless the trial record contains meaningful evidence of the defendant financial condition.id.at.
a trial court may order a defendant to produce his financial records in order to ensure that the record contains sufficient evidence of his financial condition to support an award of punitive damages.mike davidov issod th,d mike davidov.in mike davidov,the trial court held a bench trial on the plaintiff fraud claim.after finding the defendant liable for fraud,the court ordered defendant to produce all records regarding his net worth by the next day and to turn over all such records to plaintiff counsel.id.at,d.the defendant failed to comply with the order,and the trial court entered an award of punitive damages.ibid.on appeal,the defendant claimed that the lack of sufficient evidence of his financial condition required reversal of the punitive damage award.the mike davidov court rejected this contention 
d efendant was ordered to produce his financial records so that the trial court could make an evaluation of whether any particular punitive damage award would have the required deterrent effect without being overly burdensome.this order was never rescinded,nor has defendant argued on appeal that it was improper.therefore,by failing to bring in any records which would reflect his financial condition,despite being ordered to do so,and by failing to challenge that ruling on appeal,defendant has waived any right to complain of the lack of such evidence.id.at,d.
under california law,there is no right to a jury trial on equitable shareholder derivative claims even where punitive damages are sought on such claims 
california entertains no right to jury trial in stockholders derivative actions.rankin frebank d.reviewing california case law and declining to follow federal cases holding that the federal constitution guarantees a right to jury trial in shareholder derivative claims nelson anderson th,d a shareholder derivative suit is an action in equity.further,under california law,a trial court may impose punitive damages in an equitable action.rivero thomas d,noting that a s a general rule,courts of equity will not award exemplary damages,although this rule is not without exception,citation and affirming,as modified,punitive damages awarded by trial court in an equitable action.
laurens acknowledges that shareholder derivative actions are equitable in nature,but contends that he had a right to jury trial on punitive damages even though that claim was incidental to equitable claims.thus,laurens appears to be arguing that he was entitled to a jury trial on sylvia shareholder derivative claims because she sought punitive damages on those claims 
this argument is contrary to the rationale underlying the california supreme court decision in c k engineering contractors,supra,cal d at page,in which the court held,t he addition of a prayer for damages does not convert what is essentially an equitable action into a legal one for which a jury trial would be available.in c k engineering contractors,one of the issues was whether there was a right to a jury trial on a complaint that sought damages premised on the equitable theory of promissory estoppel.the supreme court held that the plaintiff had no right to a jury trial 
in the present case,the complaint purports to seek recovery of damages for breach of contract,in form an action at law in which a right to jury trial ordinarily would exist.citations.as we have seen,however,the complaint seeks relief which was available only in equity,namely,the enforcement of defendant gratuitous promise to perform its bid through application of the equitable doctrine of promissory estoppel the foregoing general principles do not alter our conclusion that the present action is,essentially,one recognized only in courts of equity and,despite plaintiff request for damages,is not an action at law c k engineering contractors,supra,cal d at.
similarly,in this case,sylvia request for punitive damages did not convert her equitable shareholder derivative claim into a legal claim on which laurens would be entitled to a jury trial.
laurens cites malone norwest financial california malone,in support of his argument that he had a right to a jury trial in this case,under the california constitution.in malone,the bankruptcy
