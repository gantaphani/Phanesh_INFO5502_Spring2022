this appeal requires us to examine a question that has created a split among our sister circuits the scope of the fiduciary duty imposed on advisers of mutual funds by b of the investment company act of ica,b.because we conclude that the district court construed too narrowly the extent of the defendants duty under b and gave insufficient weight to contested issues of material fact,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
the plaintiffs are shareholders of eleven mutual funds the funds that are registered investment companies under the ica.the funds are managed and distributed by affiliates of the defendants collectively,ameriprise.the plaintiffs filed this lawsuit on june,alleging that ameriprise had breached its fiduciary duty under b of the ica.the district court determined that the statutory damages period was restricted to the year preceding the filing date.after allowing limited discovery,the court granted ameriprise motion for summary judgment on all of the plaintiffs claims.the court based its decision on an analysis of the factors set out in gartenberg merrill lynch asset,cir.on appeal,the plaintiffs argue that the district court improperly interpreted b and overlooked important questions of material fact.

the fees paid to ameriprise for advising the funds are negotiated each year by the funds board of directors the board,whose primary responsibility is to represent the plaintiffs and other shareholders during the fee negotiation.according to the plaintiffs,ameriprise breached its statutory fiduciary duty by misleading the board during the negotiation and demanding excessive fees.the gravamen of the plaintiffs argument can be distilled into three claims the fee negotiation was inherently flawed because it was based not on ameriprise costs and profits but on external the fee agreements of similar mutual funds in the market ameriprise provided comparable advisory services to institutional,clients at substantially lower fees than it charged the plaintiffs,to whom it owed a fiduciary duty and ameriprise misled the board about its arrangements with clients to prevent the board from questioning the higher fees demanded by ameriprise.
the record reflects that the negotiation between the board and ameriprise focused on the advisory fees charged by peer mutual funds.ameriprise entered the negotiation with a pricing philosophy wherein it attempted to establish fees that were in the middle of the pack of funds with a similar size,objective and distribution model.see.the board acquiesced in this goal of tethering fees to the industry median.according to arne carlson,the chairman of the board,the negotiation was an externally driven process.id.at.notwithstanding this outward focus,it is undisputed that the board had access to a wide variety of information,including reports on the services provided to the funds,the personnel providing those services,the investment performance of the funds,and the profit ameriprise derived from the funds.additionally,the board requested data from a industry consultant,lipper.the lipper data provided a comparison between ameriprise fees and the fees charged by a pool of other mutual funds.both parties agree that the result of the negotiation was a fee arrangement that,broadly speaking,was comparable to the rates paid by shareholders of other mutual funds throughout the industry.
in addition to its mutual fund clients,however,ameriprise sells its investment advice to institutional,clients such as pension funds.there is significant dispute over both the relevance of any comparison between these two types of clients and the insights that such a comparison would yield.at first glance,the most striking difference between ameriprise mutual fund clients and its institutional clients is that the former pay an advisory fee that is substantially up to twice as much the latter the record is replete with expert testimony regarding the existence and reasonableness of the discrepancy.
professor charles murdock testified on behalf of the plaintiffs that the advisory service provided to the mutual funds was similar,if not identical,to the service ameriprise provided to its institutional clients.id.at.murdock explained,for example,that the growth spectrum iii institutional account on which the plaintiffs conducted discovery was a patterned portfolio to the new dimensions mutual that the two accounts had identical investment objectives and very similar stock holdings.the record indicates that growth spectrum iii and new dimensions were managed by the same individual,with the same decision to buy or sell stock shares frequently governing both accounts.id.at.murdock further explained that equalizing the fee structures of the two accounts would reduce the fees paid by mutual fund shareholders from million to roughly million,and he argued that the fee difference could not be substantively justified.id.at.expert testimony for ameriprise,however,indicated that the difference in fee was warranted by additional services provided for mutual funds,such as compliance with legal and regulatory requirements,shareholder communication,and more frequent board support.id.at.ameriprise also pointed out that fee discrepancies between mutual funds and institutional accounts were common throughout the industry.
at some point during the fee negotiation,the board became aware of the comparatively lower fees ameriprise charged its institutional clients and requested a report explaining the similarities and differences between the two types of accounts.even before the board request,there is some indication that ameriprise knew that a fee discrepancy between institutional accounts and mutual funds might concern the board.in response to a wall street journal article that discussed the disparity in fees,an internal email noted that this could come up in a board meeting and suggested that we should have a reply,though it may or may not be convincing.id.at.
to address the board concerns,ameriprise produced a report entitled the san diego office review,which compared the fee structures of mutual funds and institutional accounts.the veracity and completeness of that report is an important part of this dispute.the plaintiffs experts claim that the report omitted or obfuscated information to make the fee discrepancy seem smaller and more justifiable than it really was.according to one of the plaintiffs experts,the board did not notice the distortions,relied on the misrepresentations,and erroneously concluded exactly what the investment advisor mislead sic them into concluding that the fees for the mutual fund and institutional accounts were in line.id.at.the plaintiffs suggest that the board might not have ratified the fee agreement had it been given accurate information.although ameriprise objects to the plaintiffs characterization of the report as inaccurate and misleading,its main argument is that the contents of the report were irrelevant.according to ameriprise,a n inadequate negotiation that produces an objectively reasonable fee can not form the basis for liability under b.in effect,ameriprise contends that an adviser can not be liable for a breach of fiduciary duty as long as its fees are roughly in line with industry norms.
several unique features of the mutual fund industry have made it the focus of congressional regulation.see burks lasker,d.although mutual funds are technically owned by the individual shareholders who invest in the funds,most mutual funds are created,organized,and managed by external investment arrangement that gives the adviser a significant amount of control over the fund it serves.id.at.investment advisers are compensated for their administrative service and investment advice through agreements that they negotiate with their respective funds.in the nascent stages of a fund development,the adviser often has the ability to influence who will sit on the fund board of directors,though this power is limited by federal securities regulations on director independence.see william birdthistle,compensating power an analysis of rents and rewards in the mutual fund industry,tul,burks,at.explaining the responsibilities of disinterested directors.
experts have extensively debated the extent to which these industry characteristics interfere with robust competition and drive up fees.some studies have concluded that inherent conflicts of interest and a lack of meaningful competition between mutual funds have led to systematic overpricing of investment advice.see,birdthistle,supra john freeman,stewart brown steve pomerantz,mutual fund advisory fees new evidence and a fair fiduciary duty test.john freeman stewart brown,mutual fund advisory fees the cost of conflicts of interest,iowa.donald langevoort,private litigation to enforce fiduciary duties in mutual funds derivative suits,disinterested directors and the ideology of investor sovereignty.lyman johnson,a fresh look at director independence mutual fund fee litigation and gartenberg at,vand.see also lucian bebchuk jesse fried,pay without performance the unfulfilled promise of executive compensation ix the absence of effective arm length dealing under today system of corporate governance has been the primary source of problematic compensation arrangements.
the central component of this argument is that arm length bargaining does not occur between an adviser and a mutual fund because the fund can not sever its relationship with the adviser.critics claim that because this dynamic pervades the mutual fund industry,there is little competitive pressure to lower fees.this phenomenon may be exacerbated by the fact that the typical fee is established as a percentage of net asset allow an adviser compensation to skyrocket if the fee is not adjusted downward as a fund grows larger.
in response to these types of concerns,congress adopted the ica of.see daily income fund,fox,d explaining the history of the ica.the ica was amended in to add several new provisions,including b,which states,in relevant part 
for the purposes of this subsection,the investment adviser of a registered investment company shall be deemed to have a fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of compensation for services,or of payments of a material nature,paid by such registered investment company,or by the security holders thereof,to such investment adviser or any affiliated person of such investment adviser.an action may be brought under this subsection by the commission,or by a security holder of such registered investment company on behalf of such company,against such investment adviser with respect to any such action the following provisions shall apply 
it shall not be necessary to allege or prove that any defendant engaged in personal misconduct,and the plaintiff shall have the burden of proving a breach of fiduciary duty.
in any such action approval by the board of directors of such investment company of such compensation or payments,or of contracts or other arrangements providing for such compensation or payments,and ratification or approval of such compensation or payments,or of contracts or other arrangements providing for such compensation or payments,by the shareholders of such investment company,shall be given such consideration by the court as is deemed appropriate under all the circumstances.b.
in gartenberg,the second circuit analyzed b and created the framework that has served as the starting point for interpreting a fund adviser fiduciary duty.the plaintiffs in gartenberg argued that,because of their fund exponential growth,the adviser fee had become so disproportionately large that it constituted a breach of fiduciary duty.after reviewing what the court called the tortuous legislative history of b,the second circuit concluded that the purpose of the provision was to mitigate the competitive deficiencies of the mutual fund industry.see gartenberg,at.accordingly,the court held that the relevant test for a fee is whether it represents a charge within the range of what would have been negotiated at arm length in light of all the surrounding circumstances.id.at.the court then listed a number of factors that were germane to the analysis the nature and quality of the services provided by the adviser the profitability of the mutual fund to the adviser the extent to which benefits inured to the adviser the economies of scale realized by the adviser the fee structures of comparable funds and the independence and conscientiousness of the board of directors.id.at.in addition,the court offered some economic observations to assist the evaluation.for instance,the court noted that reliance on other fees throughout the industry will not satisfy b because of the competitive defects of the mutual fund market.see id.at.the court ultimately concluded that the adviser fee was not so excessive or unfair as to amount to a breach of fiduciary duty within the meaning of b.id.at.
a number of courts have indicated approval of the gartenberg framework in cases challenging adviser fees under b.see,krantz prudential invs.fund mgmt,cir following a fourth circuit analysis that was based on gartenberg migdal rowe int l,cir forsythe sun life,d sins janus capital,wl in re dreyfus mut.funds fee,d zucker aim advisors,d strigliabotti franklin,wl.
the seventh circuit eschewed the gartenberg approach in jones harris associates,cir.jones rejected the proposition that courts should evaluate the reasonableness of an adviser fee,holding that a fiduciary must make full disclosure and play no tricks but is not subject to a cap on compensation.id.at.the court based its conclusion on two fundamental premises the plain meaning of the word fiduciary and a rejection of the economic assumptions inherent in gartenberg.according to the court,the plain meaning of fiduciary is a requirement of candor in negotiation,and honesty in performance and nothing in the obscure legislative history of b alters that conclusion.id.at.furthermore,the court declared that the observations in gartenberg about the lack of competitiveness in the mutual fund industry were flawed.mutual funds,according to the court,come much closer to the model of atomistic competition than do most other markets.id.at.the court based this observation on the fact that there are thousands of mutual funds,and even if investors can not control the fees set by any particular fund,they can assert indirect pressure on an adviser compensation by choosing funds with lower fees.see id.at see also john coates glenn hubbard,competition in the mutual fund industry evidence and implications for policy,iowa,arguing that there is robust competition within the mutual fund industry,though concluding that gartenberg three principal holdings are sensible from legal and economic perspectives.
the jones opinion drew notable criticism within the court itself.four judges joined judge richard posner in a dissent from denial of rehearing en banc.see jones harris associates,cir posner,dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc.citing numerous academic studies,as well as articles,id.at,the dissent took issue with what it considered a tendentious economic analysis that was overly favorable to the mutual fund industry.see id.at.additionally,the dissent chided the panel opinion for improperly rejecting a comparison of the fees that the defendant charges independent funds with the much higher fees that it charges the funds it controls.id.at.overall,the dissent expressed the view that gartenberg should not be abandoned and that judicial oversight of investment advisers should not be relaxed.
the supreme court has granted certiorari in jones,d wl,leading some observers to suggest that the court may establish a standard of review that may result in lower management fees.see sam mamudi,decision could set standard on fees,wall,march,at.
our review of the cases,legislative history,and academic work surrounding b leads us to conclude that the gartenberg factors provide a useful framework for resolving claims of excessive fee
