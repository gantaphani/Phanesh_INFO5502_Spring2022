the principal question we address here is whether state law fraud claims relating to employee stock options are preempted by the securities litigation uniform standards act of slusa,f.we hold that they are preempted because the alleged fraud took place in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security under slusa.this case also involves contract claims based on multiple stock option agreements.unlike the district court,we conclude that these claims can not be resolved on a motion to dismiss.
background 
this class action litigation stems from a merger in which imation corporation,a publicly traded company,acquired,cemax,a closely held company in the medical information management business.are a group of former imation employees and contractors the employees who brought suit for breach of contract and fraud in connection with their employee stock options.
the employees were initially employed by cemax.as part of the merger,cemax stock options,which had been granted to the employees under three stock option plans,were amended to be options on imation stock.after the merger,imation also granted the employees a fourth set of options directly.
cemax time as an imation subsidiary was destined to be.about a year after completion of the merger,imation sold cemax to the eastman kodak company kodak.in connection with the sale,imation informed the employees that they were being transferred en masse to kodak without any interruption of their employment at imation subsidiary,cemax.they were also advised that they would have thirty days to exercise their options granted under the three cemax plans that had vested,and that any unvested cemax options and any new imation options were deemed forfeited.
unfortunately,it was not a propitious time to exercise the options that had vested.according to the complaint,imation was in financial distress before the merger and it announced a million earnings just months after the merger.later that year,imation became embroiled in trade secret litigation with kodak.
the employees claim that,because personnel were key to the value of cemax,imation placed a premium on retaining the employees through the merger and the closing of the sale to kodak.imation induced employees to remain with cemax by misrepresenting the value of imation stock and options.specifically,plaintiffs allege that defendants knew,or should have known,about the impending earnings at the time of the merger,and that they concealed it from the employees in order to make the options more attractive.they further allege that defendants fraudulently told them that they would have a long future with imation,thus misleading them as to the time frame over which they would be able to exercise the options.
the employees filed suit in california state court against imation and the chief executives of imation and cemax.the state complaint alleged seven contract counts,two counts for fraud fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation,and one count for violations of the california labor code.imation removed to federal court.the district court held that the fraud claims were completely preempted by slusa and thus removal was proper.the remaining claims were dismissed without leave to amend because,in the view of the district court,the contracts on their face foreclosed the breach of contract claims and the stock options were not wages under the california labor code.the employees effort to seek interlocutory appeal was unsuccessful.the employees then filed an amended complaint with five federal securities fraud claims,which the district court dismissed as.

b class action limitations 
no covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any state or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any state or federal court by any private party alleging 
an untrue statement or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security or 
that the defendant used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.
c removal of covered class actions 
any covered class action brought in any state court involving a covered security,as set forth in subsection b,shall be removable to the federal district court for the district in which the action is pending,and shall be subject to subsection b.

the parties agree that the state suit was a covered class action and that the complaint includes allegations of an untrue statement or omission of a material fact.the pivotal debate centers on whether the alleged statement or omission was in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.
slusa incorporates the definition of covered security found in the national securities markets improvement act of 
exclusive federal registration of nationally traded securities 
a security is a covered security if such security is 
a listed,or authorized for listing,on the new york stock exchange or the american stock exchange,or listed,or authorized for listing,on the national market system of the nasdaq stock market or any successor to such entities 
b listed,or authorized for listing,on a national securities exchange or tier or segment thereof that has listing standards that the commission determines by rule on its own initiative or on the basis of a petition are substantially similar to the listing standards applicable to securities described in subparagraph a or 
c is a security of the same issuer that is equal in seniority or that is a senior security to a security described in subparagraph a or b.

a security is a covered security if such security is a security issued by an investment company that is registered,or that has filed a registration statement,under the investment company act of.
b see f,f e.
because the stock options themselves are not listed on a national securities exchange,there is little dispute that the options do not meet the requirements of a covered security.imation stock,however,does fall squarely within the definition of a covered security.thus we must analyze whether the misrepresentations regarding the options can be characterized as having been in connection with the purchase or sale of imation stock.
slusa language is nearly identical to that of section b of the act,which prohibits securities fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.just as the supreme court observed that section b should be construed not technically and restrictively,but flexibly to effectuate
