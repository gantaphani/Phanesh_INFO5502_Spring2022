ellen rubke,as trustee of the rubke living trust,and jack ferguson,individually and on behalf of other similarly situated minority shareholders of napa community bank,appeal the district court dismissal of their first amended complaint,which alleges that capital bancorp,and its ceo and chairman joseph reid violated section of the securities act of and sections b and e of the securities exchange act of.they argue that the district court erred in dismissing their section claims for failure to meet the pleading standards of federal rule of civil procedure b and in dismissing their section b and e claims for failure to meet the pleading standards of the private securities litigation reform act of.for the reasons discussed below,we conclude that the district court did not commit reversible error in either regard and affirm the dismissal of the plaintiffs first amended complaint with prejudice.
capitol bancorp,capitol is a bank holding company that uses an unusual business model to create and control small community banks.capitol begins its process by soliciting investors in a proposed bank community to provide capital in exchange for common stock in the bank.in this initial stock offering,capitol informs potential investors that it will buy approximately of the community bank common stock and will thus be the controlling shareholder in the bank.it also warns these investors that there will likely be no public market for the bank stock.capitol does indicate,however,that it may buy out the investors around the third anniversary of the bank for a price equivalent to the book value of the common stock plus a premium.capitol provides administrative and other services to the bank albeit not necessarily at competitive prices,but community members comprise the bank board of directors and have general autonomy to set pricing and make other strategic decisions.
in november,consistent with this basic business model,capitol solicited investors in california napa region to purchase common shares of napa community bank ncb.capitol also formed a holding california primary function was to own a controlling share of ncb.capitol then solicited separate investors in first california northern and bought a controlling stake in that company.first california northern thereafter bought of ncb common stock,and community investors,including rubke and ferguson,purchased the remaining.ncb began operating in march,and was quite successful.
in may,capitol began a share exchange offering for first california northern.this exchange offer gave first california northern minority shareholders the opportunity to exchange their shares for shares of capitol at a ratio that translated to a payment of of the book value of first california northern shares.the offer was accompanied by a fairness opinion prepared by jmp financial jmp.as a result of this offering,capitol acquired of shares in first california northern.
thereafter,in early,capitol began its anticipated attempt to acquire the minority shares of ncb the exchange offer at issue in this case.it filed a registration statement with the sec in april,and amended that statement in may.on june,the effective date of the exchange offer,capitol sent all ncb shareholders the offer document.in the document,capitol offered to exchange shares of ncb common stock for shares of capitol which was publicly traded on the new york stock exchange at a ratio equal to approximately of the book value of the ncb common stock.specifically,because capitol estimated the book value of the ncb stock at approximately per share,it would issue worth of capitol shares for each ncb share tendered approximately capitol shares for every ncb share.the exchange offer was set to expire on june.the offer document was accompanied by two fairness by jmp,and the other by howe barnes investment,howe barnes.each concluded after analysis that the transaction was fair from a financial point of view.
several minority shareholders,believing that the exchange offer was unfair,formed a minority shareholders committee msc to combat the offer.the msc obtained competing fairness opinions from the findley group and hoefer arnett,each of which stated that the fair market value of the ncb common shares was approximately per share around higher than capitol was offering.
during this time period,some ncb minority shareholders reported receiving phone calls from members of the bank board of directors encouraging them to participate in the exchange offer and tender their shares to capitol.during these phone calls,ncb directors allegedly claimed that ncb shares would be worthless if they were not sold to capitol through the exchange offer,that the ncb shareholders were required to sell their shares,that the ncb shares would be illiquid if they were not sold to capitol,that of ncb shareholders had already tendered their shares to capitol,and that all members of ncb board of directors had already tendered their shares to capitol.
the exchange offer closed on june.capitol,through the offer,acquired approximately of ncb stock.several minority shareholders who tendered their stock to capitol,however,filed suit,claiming that capitol was able to purchase their shares at a price below fair market value because of misrepresentations made in the registration statement,the offer document,and the telephone calls.
the plaintiffs in this action filed their original complaint on november,in the northern district of california.the plaintiffs formulated their claims as actions under sections and of the securities act of securities act sections b,e,and a of the securities exchange act of exchange act and state law violations of the california corporations code.on june,the district court dismissed the original complaint,holding that the claims were subject to heightened pleading standards under federal rule of civil procedure b the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,and that the complaint failed to meet these heightened standards.although the state law claims were dismissed with prejudice,the court gave plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint remedying the federal claims.
the complaint at issue in this case was filed shortly thereafter,on july.this first amended complaint added a claim under section a of the securities act,but otherwise retained the same federal claims alleged in the original complaint.again,the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint,and the district court granted that motion on october.see rubke capitol bancorp,d.the district court held that the plaintiffs securities act claims failed to satisfy the pleading standards of federal rule of civil procedure b,that the plaintiffs exchange act claims failed to satisfy the pleading requirements of the pslra,and that plaintiffs control person liability claims failed because the plaintiffs had failed to adequately plead a primary violation under either act.see id.at.although the court dismissed only the securities act sections,e,and,and the exchange act section a claims with gave the plaintiffs leave to amend the securities act section a claim and the exchange act section b plaintiffs decided not to file a second amended complaint,and instead filed a notice of intention not to file an amended complaint.the district court entered judgment on this motion on december,by dismissing all the claims with prejudice,and the plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal to this court

the plaintiffs collectively,rubke first challenge the district court determination that their first amended complaint failed to allege with the particularity required by federal rule of civil procedure b that capitol registration statement in connection with the ncb exchange offer contained material misrepresentations in violation of section of the securities act.section of the securities act contains a private right of action for purchasers of a security if the issuer publishes a registration statement in connection with that security that contain s an untrue statement of a material fact or omit s to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.a.to prevail in such an action,a plaintiff must prove that the registration statement contained an omission or misrepresentation,and that the omission or misrepresentation was material,that is,it would have misled a reasonable investor about the nature of his or her investment.in re daou,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
although the heightened pleading requirements of the pslra do not apply to section claims,falkowski imation,cir,plaintiffs are required to allege their claims with increased particularity under federal rule of civil procedure b if their complaint sounds in fraud.see daou,at.to ascertain whether a complaint sounds in fraud,we must normally determine,after a close examination of the language and structure of the complaint,whether the complaint allege s a unified course of fraudulent conduct and rel ies entirely on that course of conduct as the basis of a claim.vess.usa,cir.where as here,however,a complaint employs the exact same factual allegations to allege violations of section as it uses to allege fraudulent conduct under section b of the exchange act,we can assume that it sounds in fraud.see daou,at.
because rule b thus applies to rubke section claims,her first amended complaint must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud fed.civ.b.in other words,the complaint must set forth what is false or misleading about a statement,and why it is false.yourish cal.amplifier,cir quoting in re glenfed sec,cir.this requirement can be satisfied by pointing to inconsistent contemporaneous statements or information such as internal reports which were made by or available to the defendants.id.quoting glenfed,at.
rubke first amended complaint alleges that six types of statements in capitol registration statement were either affirmatively misleading or were misleading by omission.first,according to the complaint,capitol registration statement misled the ncb minority shareholders by incorporating two fairness opinions by jmp and howe barnes concluding that the transaction was financially fair to the minority shareholders.
because these fairness determinations are alleged to be misleading opinions,not statements of fact,they can give rise to a claim under section only if the complaint alleges with particularity that the statements were both objectively and subjectively false or misleading.see.bankshares,sandberg,d in re mckesson hboc.sec,d.thus,the first amended complaint must allege with particularity that capitol directors and officers believed the exchange offer was unfair.
the first amended complaint fails to allege that either jmp,howe barnes,or capitol believed the deal offered the minority shareholders was unfair.although the complaint alleges that the msc competing findley group fairness opinion was circulated to members of capitol,and thus that capitol should have known that jmp opinion was unreliable,nothing in the complaint indicates that anyone at capitol actually saw or assessed the findley group fairness report.the complaint only alleges,b ased on information and belief,that copies of the findley group fairness opinion and the fairness memorandum,a written or oral summary of their terms,were delivered to capitol and reid,and or capitol and reid should have known about the substance of the report.the complaint does not indicate on what facts this belief is formed.similarly,rubke allegations that jmp prior relationship with capitol should have alerted capitol to the investment bank biases do not adequately allege subjective falsity.although the first amended complaint alleges that in of prior transactions,jmp financial,fairness opinions concluded that a valuation of of book value or very minor deviations from of book value were fair,and in the other four,the highest valuation was approximately of book value and the lowest approximately of book value,it fails to plead facts indicating that capitol believed these prior valuations were incorrect.
second,according to the first amended complaint,capitol registration statement was misleading because it failed to mention the fact that one year prior to the tender offer,capitol initiated a similar offer for shares of ncb holding company,first california northern,and paid approximately of book value for those shares.
a securities fraud complaint based on a purportedly misleading omission must specify the reason or reasons why the statements made by the defendant were misleading or untrue,not simply why the statements were incomplete.brody transitional hosps,cir.there is no indication that the omitted information about the first california northern share exchange made any statement in capitol registration documents false or misleading.the first amended complaint fails to detail any language in capitol registration statement that implies that capitol did not enter into a previous transaction with the minority shareholders of first california northern.it also fails to enumerate the specific language in the registration statement that allegedly was made misleading by its failure to mention the earlier transaction.
also,as the district court noted,information concerning the first california northern tender offer was publicly available.as many of our sister circuits have recognized,i t is pointless and costly to compel firms to reprint information already in the public domain.wielgos commonwealth edison,cir see also klein nutrition,cir seibert sperry rand,cir.section does not require the disclosure of all information a potential investor might take into account when making his decision for example,although an investor might weigh the general trends of the market when deciding whether to buy or hold,it would be unreasonable to require every firm making a tender offer to chronicle the historical performance of the new york stock exchange to avoid liability under securities disclosure laws.in many cases,this information will not only be extraneous,but may by its very volume confuse and mislead potential investors.the fact that capitol purchased a different security nearly a year earlier for a slightly higher price was simply extraneous to the exchange offer.
third,according to the first amended complaint,capitol materially misrepresented ncb future income projections in the registration statement.specifically,the complaint notes that page of the prospectus included in the registration statement stated that capitol believes that ncb profitability will increase.this projection,the complaint alleges,failed to adequately disclose the dramatic growth in ncb net income,retained earnings and book value in that capitol knew was occurring.essentially,rubke appears to argue that because the statement profitability will increase did not indicate the extraordinary nature of ncb growth,the prospectus should have included more expressive language such as capitol believes ncb profitability will dramatically increase.
in addition to the fact that capitol did disclose that ncb net income for the first quarter of was nearly four times as large as that for the first quarter of,this allegation clearly does not state a claim under section.this allegation merely squabbles about the adverbs used in the registration statement,and fails to indicate that the language used was false.furthermore,there is no duty to disclose income projections in a prospectus.see in re lyondell petrochemical.sec,cir.
fourth,according to the first amended complaint,several references in the offer document and elsewhere to a preconceived plan to sell ncb shares to capitol on the three year anniversary of ncb operations misled investors into believing that they had a moral or legal obligation to tender their shares to capitol.thus,rubke claims,capitol had an obligation to disabuse the shareholders of this notion by disclos ing in the registration statement that the ncb shareholders had no obligation,legal or moral,to participate,and that they were not bound by any plan.
as with the other omission allegations,the complaint fails to demonstrate that the failure to include this disclaimer was misleading.there is no allegation i
