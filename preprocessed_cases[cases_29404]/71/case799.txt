paul gianamore was a financial analyst at credit suisse first boston,an investment banking firm.he gave information to his friend,ryan evans,who traded on that information very lucratively.for their efforts,both men wound up being charged in an indictment with violations of the federal securities laws.the first time the case went to trial,the jury acquitted gianamore on all counts,including one that accused him of conspiring with evans to violate the provisions of the securities laws.the jury also found that evans was not guilty on the conspiracy charge,but it deadlocked on the substantive securities laws violations.the district court rejected evans motion for acquittal and retried him.the second time around,the jury convicted him on the seven substantive violations of federal securities laws,four of which involved insider trading and three of which charged fraud in connection with a tender offer.
on appeal,evans argues that as gianamore tippee he can not be convicted because gianamore the tipper was acquitted.he also asserts that the district court gave an erroneous jury instruction on the insider trading counts,that evidence was erroneously admitted,and that without the insider trading convictions his tender offer convictions can not stand.we conclude that his conviction must be affirmed gianamore acquittal did not foreclose evans own liability as a matter of law,and the district court acted within its discretion with respect to its evidentiary rulings and instructions.
following his graduation from college,gianamore worked at credit suisse first boston from october through october,first in chicago and later in san francisco.as a financial analyst,he had access not only to his own work but to that of other analysts.in this way,he was privy to information about tender offers and proposed mergers.tender offers are essentially offers to the shareholders of a targeted company to buy some or all of their stock at a particular price.credit suisse helped both buyers and targets to gather information,including nonpublic information,to determine either what price to offer or whether to accept the offered price.because gianamore began working at credit suisse in the month of october,which was not the company regular start time for new analysts,he received an abbreviated form of the orientation required for new analysts.as part of that process,he was shown a videotape that covered the topics of confidentiality and insider trading,and he signed statements on the day he started acknowledging that he had received and reviewed the credit suisse compliance policy manual.
gianamore and evans were friends.they met as college freshmen at depaul university in chicago,although gianamore moved to new york to attend cornell after his freshman year.when gianamore moved back to chicago,the two resumed their friendship they talked daily via email or phone and saw each other frequently.friends of both men testified that gianamore talked about work,but that his comments were of a general nature.during the first trial,gianamore former roommate mark hauber also testified that gianamore talked in detail about his work,including specific transactions,and even showed hauber confidential documents.at the government urging,the district court excluded hauber testimony from the second trial,finding it immaterial to how much information gianamore shared with evans and gianamore motive for his revelations.
while gianamore worked at credit suisse,evans traded on three tender offers and one merger in which credit suisse was involved between december and august.evans used his online brokerage account to make the trades.the first trade involved jostens,which hired credit suisse to help evaluate a merger offer from investcorp,sa,a privately held company.in december,gianamore was assigned to work on this potential transaction.a few days later,evans bought the maximum amount of jostens stock he could afford he raised the funds by selling all of the other securities in his brokerage account.six days first day of trading after the merger was sold the shares,making a profit of almost.this was the smallest of the four trades identified in the indictment,although all four followed the same pattern.
the second trade involved lincoln electric company,a longstanding client of credit suisse.during the spring of,lincoln electric made a cash tender offer for the outstanding shares of charter.although gianamore himself did not work on this transaction,the analyst on the deal recalled alerting gianamore to the date on which the press release announcing the tender offer would be issued.evans bought charter stock on the very day that the company board of directors approved the deal and sold it the next day,right after it was announced to the public.in total,evans made about in profit.in the third transaction,hussman international hired credit suisse in april to evaluate offer to buy hussman stock.again,an analyst other than gianamore had responsibility for the deal.again,evans bought his stock on the day the hussman board of directors met to approve the transaction,and sold it the next day,again following the public announcement.this time evans made nearly.finally,in july,burns international hired credit suisse to evaluate securitas tender offer.gianamore was assigned the project.as before,evans purchased burns stock on august,the day the board met and approved the transaction evans sold his stock the next day,making in profit.
as we noted,the jury at the first trial acquitted gianamore on all counts and acquitted evans of conspiracy but not of the substantive offenses.in light of this result,evans asked the district court to dismiss the insider trading charges against him as well,arguing that he was entitled to prevail as a matter of law in light of the jury conclusion that neither man had been engaged in a conspiracy.the district court denied that motion and tried evans a second time.during the second trial,in addition to excluding hauber testimony,the district court altered the jury instructions from the first trial,largely because gianamore was not a defendant in the second trial.the second jury found evans guilty of four counts of insider trading in violation of b of the securities exchange act of,b,and rule,and three counts of fraud in connection with a tender offer in violation of e of the exchange act,e the williams act,and rule.evans was sentenced to months in prison on each count,to run concurrently,as well as a fine of and a term of supervised release of three years.he appeals.
we begin with the insider trading violations.evans arguments here focus on the legal requirements for a conviction,and thus our review is de novo.we must consider what is necessary to convict a person who receives confidential,inside information from someone else and trades upon other words,a tippee.evans contends that following the acquittal of gianamore,the alleged tipper,and his own acquittal for conspiring with gianamore,he can not possibly be guilty as a tippee.in essence,he argues that the government is estopped from prosecuting him again because the first trial necessarily decided issues that preclude his convictions.he also contends that the jury instructions in his second trial are improper because they fail to require that the tipper have personally benefited from giving the tippee the information.
before turning to evans individual arguments,it is helpful to review the fundamentals of tippee liability.in dirks sec,d,the government prosecuted an officer of a new york firm who investigated and publicized allegations that equity funding of america,a diversified corporation,had vastly overstated its assets.neither dirks nor his firm traded on the information about equity funding,but others to whom dirks spoke during the course of his investigation did.the corporation stock price fell,leading to a complaint against equity funding by the sec.id.at.although dirks investigation had brought massive fraud to light and he himself had not traded on insider information,an administrative law judge nevertheless found that he had aided and abetted insider trading.id.at.because of his role in bringing far greater mi
