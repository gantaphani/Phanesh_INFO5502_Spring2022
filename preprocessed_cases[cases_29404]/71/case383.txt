in this case,we are asked to circumscribe the scope of the absolute immunity we have previously extended to organizations sros when they engage in conduct consistent with the powers delegated to them pursuant to the securities exchange act of and the regulations and rules promulgated thereunder.however,because we believe least in the circumstances just immunity must be absolute,we reject the calls,inter alia,to carve out a fraud exception to the absolute immunity doctrine or to distinguish between suits brought by public investors and suits brought by others such as sro members.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
defendant nasdaq stock market,nasdaq is a subsidiary of the national association of securities dealers,nasd,a organization sro registered with the sec as a national securities association pursuant to the maloney act amendments to the securities exchange act of.see et.
as an sro,the nasd is,like other sros such as the new york stock exchange nyse,authorized by congress to promulgate and enforce rules governing the conduct of its members.barbara new york stock exch,cir.in this and other respects,the nasd serves as a critical aid to the sec in implementing and effectuating compliance with the securities laws.indeed,this court has previously stated that sros effectively stand in the shoes of the sec because they perform regulatory functions that would otherwise be performed by the sec,new york stock exchange,cir and that sros are,as a result,rightly considered authorities.id.that is not to say,of course,that the sec,itself,is uninvolved with the affairs of the sros that assist them in the regulation of the securities markets.on the contrary,the sec has extensive involvement with,and broad oversight of,sros,including the responsibility to approve or reject any rule,practice,policy,or interpretation proposed by an sro.see.moreover,if an sro has violated,or is unable to comply with,inter alia,the provisions of the exchange act,its own rules,or the rules of the sec,the sec is authorized to suspend or even revoke an sro registration,as well as to impose lesser sanctions.see g.
the nasd has delegated some of its regulatory powers and responsibilities as an sro to nasdaq.generally speaking,the nasd has authorized nasdaq to develop,operate,and maintain the nasdaq stock market,to formulate regulatory policies and listing criteria for the nasdaq stock market,and to enforce those policies and rules,subject to the approval of the nasd and ultimately the sec.more specifically,we note for the purposes of this appeal that the nasd has in rule,a rule approved by the sec authorized nasdaq to cancel any nasdaq stock market transaction where such a transaction is clearly erroneous or cancellation is necessary for the maintenance of a fair and orderly market or for the protection of investors and the public interest.nasd manual cch,rule b.under the terms of rule,a transaction is considered to be clearly erroneous when there is an obvious error in any term,such as price,number of shares or other unit of trading,or identification of the security.id.at a.
the instant lawsuit arises out of nasdaq decision,pursuant to nasd rule,to cancel certain trades of corinthian colleges,coco stock on december.the pertinent facts,as alleged in the complaint,are as follows between approximately and,the market price of coco fell precipitously from to as low as.coco had not issued any statements that would explain the sudden price drop.nasdaq determined,however,that the extraordinary market activity resulted from multiple orders being routed to multiple market centers and electronic communications networks by a single customer thus,multiple sell orders had been placed erroneously for coco.at,nasdaq halted trading in coco,stating that the plunge was caused by misuse or malfunction of an electronic trading system.id.
nasdaq permitted trading to resume approximately one hour later,at id.approximately minutes approximately announced that it would cancel all trades made between and.the cancellation did not extend to transactions in other stock markets unless done through nasdaq super montage system.id.approximately million shares of coco were traded on december,far above its average daily volume of less than million shares.
plaintiff dl capital group alleges that it purchased shares of coco long between and and trading on coco had resumed but before nasdaq made its cancellation sold its shares of coco at a profit.because nasdaq ultimately canceled dl capital purchase of coco shares which occurred between and,but failed to cancel dl capital sale of coco shares because they occurred outside the window,namely at some point between and approximately,dl capital alleges that nasdaq effectively forced dl capital into an uncovered short sale,whereby dl capital was forced to purchase shares of coco at a price higher than the sale price in order to cover the short sale which nasdaq forced upon it.dl capital alleges it was thus injured by having to cover the forced short sale at a loss.id.
in december,the plaintiff filed the instant action,bringing two claims,one against nasdaq and one against robert greifeld,nasdaq president and chief executive officer at all times relevant to plaintiff suit.the first claim alleges,in effect,that nasdaq made materially misleading statements or is,committed failing to disclose sooner its intention,or final decision,to cancel coco trades that occurred between and.the second claim alleges that greifeld,as a controlling person of nasdaq,violated section a of the exchange act the section that establishes controlling person liability in connection with nasdaq general fraud.
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on three grounds nasdaq is absolutely immune from suits related to its sro activities the plaintiff did not exhaust its remedies before the sec which,defendants contended,were prerequisites to judicial action and the exchange act does not provide a right of action for money damages against sros.
on may,the district court granted the defendants motion on the first of these grounds and accordingly did not reach the others.see dl capital group llc nasdaq stock market,wl,at may,hereinafter district court opinion this appeal then followed.
ii.discussion 
there is no question that an sro and its officers are entitled to absolute immunity when they are,in effect,acting under the aegis of their regulatory duties.sparta surgical ass of sec.dealers,cir.this court held as such.first,in barbara new york stock exchange,we upheld a district court decision to accord absolute immunity to the nyse for claims arising out of the performance of its conduct of disciplinary proceedings,cir.we held that although immunity should be decided on a basis,it was appropriate to extend absolute immunity to the nyse because of the unique context of the of the national securities exchanges.id.at.we reasoned that because the nyse performs a variety of regulatory functions that would,in other circumstances,be performed by the sec an agency which is accorded sovereign immunity from all suits for money nyse should,in light of its special status and connection to the sec,out of fairness be accorded full immunity from suits for money damages,as well.id.
more recently,in new york stock exchange,the court considered a suit in which plaintiffs alleged claims predicated on the nyse improper performance of its interpretive,enforcement and referral claims,namely,claims alleging that the nyse incorrectly interpreted and applied section a of the exchange act and regulations and rules thereto interpretive function the nyse failed to monitor compliance with the exchange act and various rules of the nyse,and advise him that the commissions he earned in connection with flip trades violated those laws enforcement function and the nyse provided false information when it cooperated with and assisted the united states attorney office and the sec in their investigations into alleged violations of section a by and other floor brokers referral function.new york stock exchange,cir.we held,however,that because the alleged misconduct falls within the scope of powers delegate
