we hold today that by its express terms,the whistleblower provision of the sarbanes oxley act,a,protects employees of companies who disclose certain types of information only to the three categories of recipients specifically enumerated in the act federal regulatory and law enforcement agencies,congress,and employee supervisors.leaks to the media are not protected.
in january,plaintiffs matthew neumann and nicholas tides began working as auditors in boeing it sarbanes oxley sox audit group.tides worked in louis,and neumann was based in seattle.at the time,the it sox audit group was one of two departments housed within boeing corporate audit organization.it was charged with helping the company comply with sox requirement that it annually assess the effectiveness of its internal controls and procedures for financial reporting.see a.auditors in the it sox audit group performed audits and testing on information technology controls the group was staffed with about ten boeing employees,including tides and neumann,and supplemented by approximately seventy contract auditors from the accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers.deloitte touche served as boeing external auditor and was responsible for annually attesting to,and reporting on,the company assessments of its internal controls,as required by sox.see id.b.
tides and neumann claim that tensions were high in the it sox audit group upon their arrival in january because management feared that deloitte touche might declare a material weakness in the company internal controls.they allege that managers pressured it sox auditors to rate boeing internal controls as effective and fostered a generally hostile work environment.beginning in february,tides and neumann began separately expressing concerns about this perceived pressure and several deficiencies in boeing auditing practices that they viewed as potential violations of sox.their primary concern related to boeing use of pricewaterhousecoopers contractors in the internal auditing of the company it controls.tides and neumann repeatedly complained to management about the practice of giving the contractors managerial authority over boeing employees,as well as the involvement of the contractors in both the design and audit of boeing internal controls.they also expressed concerns about the integrity of data stored in the software system boeing used to record its it sox audit results.both auditors believed that the system permitted unauthorized users to alter the ratings given to the company internal controls.
at some point in late april,andrea james,a reporter with the seattle post intelligencer,left messages on tides and neumann work phones asking each of them to speak with her about an article she was writing on boeing compliance with sox.neither tides nor neumann immediately responded to her requests,hoping instead to resolve their concerns internally with the help of management and human resources.at the time,both were aware that boeing had in place a policy that restricted the release of company information to the news media.boeing policy,pro,required employees to refer i nquiries of any kind from the news media to the communications department and also prohibited the release of company information without prior review by that department.
in late may,james contacted neumann again,this time showing up uninvited at his home with another post intelligencer reporter.neumann agreed to speak with them about boeing compliance with sox.he described the pressure he felt to render positive audit results and detailed a recent meeting where he and other it sox auditors expressed concerns over the role of pricewaterhousecoopers contractors in audits of boeing internal controls.james asked neumann if he knew of any examples of significant deficiencies in boeing internal controls going unreported or of any auditors being instructed to change their findings,but he said he did know of any specifics.several days after their meeting,james emailed neumann an excerpt of a draft of her article.neumann responded that the excerpt looked good and sent james the text of an email that he and other it sox auditors recently received from a manager.the manager email reminded employees that boeing policy prohibited the release of information to the media without prior approval from the communications department.
tides contacted james in july after receiving what he viewed as a negative and unsubstantiated performance evaluation for the second quarter of the year.he forwarded her a series of emails from his boeing computer.most of the emails documented the concerns he previously raised with management and human resources regarding perceived problems with the it sox audit group auditing practices.tides also forwarded james several internal boeing documents,including copies of the company policies governing contract labor.
on july,the post intelligencer published the article computer security faults put boeing at risk,by james.the article reported that f or the past three years,the boeing has failed,in both internal and external audits,to prove it can properly protect its computer systems against manipulation,theft and fraud.it detailed,among other things,a threatening company culture perceived by employees involved in sox compliance,a record of poor internal audit results indicating that many of the company computer system controls were failing,and an internal allegation that audit results were being manipulated.
at some point prior to the publication of the post intelligencer article,boeing caught on that several employees were likely releasing company information to the media.as a result,it authorized an investigation that included the monitoring of both tides and neumann work computers and email accounts.the investigation revealed that the two auditors were communicating with james without permission.two months after the publication of the post intelligencer article,tides and neumann were interviewed separately by hr investigators about their communications with james.both admitted to speaking with her about boeing auditing practices and to providing her with company documents.after the interviews,boeing suspended tides and neumann indefinitely.their cases were then referred to an employee corrective action review board,a committee composed of five voting members and one ethics advisor to evaluate charges of employee misconduct.after reviewing the applicable boeing policies and the investigative reports detailing the two auditors contacts with the media,the board unanimously voted to terminate tides and neumann effective september,and october,respectively.both were later informed in writing that 
it has been determined that you created an unacceptable liability for the company.specifically,you violated pro,information protection,by disclosing boeing information to persons without following appropriate procedures,obtaining necessary approvals and putting in place appropriate safeguards.in addition,you violated pro by not referring inquiries from the news media to communications,and by releasing information without approval in accordance with the requirements of said pro.your actions are aggravated by the fact that the information had an adverse effect on the company reputation and its relations with its employees,customers,shareholders,suppliers and other important constituents,causing significant liability.the company deems your behavior in this incident as unacceptable and in violation of its expectations as defined in pro.
following their terminations,neumann and tides filed sox whistleblower complaints with the occupation safety and health on december,and december,respectively.after over nine months of delay,the agency issued letters acknowledging tides and neumann right to proceed de novo in federal court tides and neumann filed separate complaints in district court,alleging that they were terminated in violation of a for reporting violations of sox and other securities laws.their cases were later consolidated.boeing moved for summary judgment.on february,the district court granted boeing motion.this timely appeal followed.we have jurisdiction to hear this case under.
