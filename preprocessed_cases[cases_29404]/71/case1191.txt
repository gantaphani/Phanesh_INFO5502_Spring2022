appellants,thirteen individual claimants in the liquidation proceeding of a failed collectively,claimants,seek protection under the securities investor protection act sipa and payment of their claims from the insurance fund established by the securities investor protection corporation sipc.
the debtor,primeline securities corporation primeline,was a licensed securities registered with the securities exchange commission and a member of sipc claimants claims in the liquidation proceeding are based upon financial transactions with asif ameen,a registered broker employed by primeline.while employed by primeline,ameen operated a ponzi scheme inducing claimants and others to invest funds in fraudulent investment opportunities.
ameen and each of the claimants are from foreign countries,generally in south asia.ameen was extremely active in the south asian community in wichita,kansas.he regularly assisted members of the community with various personal and financial transactions,including the transfer of assets from south asia where stringent financial controls often restrict transfers to the united states.ameen also had a reputation for locating investment opportunities with high rates of return.although many of the claimants were residents of the united states,they had little or no experience investing in the united states securities markets.because of ameen involvement and reputation in the community,claimants entrusted their funds to ameen and relied on his investment advice.
ameen offered most participants in his scheme an opportunity to pool their funds with other investors to make a higher rate of return than they could achieve with an individual investment.the pooled investment provided a fixed rate of return over a specified period of time.ameen offered such participants a rate of return as high as seven to ten percent per month per annum.other investors purchased debentures in fictitious corporations.ameen touted the debentures as a low risk investment option.the debentures offered a more modest return,between twelve and fifteen percent per annum.in conjunction with the fraud schemes,ameen and his wife maintained a number of bank accounts in various company or trade names ameen typically instructed participants to make checks out to one of the trade name accounts and deposited the funds received directly into the account none of the funds at issue were deposited with primeline or its clearing broker.most of the funds were diverted for ameen personal use.
when ameen scheme collapsed,investor claims and the actions of the kansas securities commissioner prompted sipc to seek protection for primeline customers pursuant to sipa.see a and b a.on january,the district court entered a protective order against primeline.the order appointed a trustee and removed the proceeding to the bankruptcy court for the liquidation of primeline assets.see id.b and.
in the liquidation proceeding,the trustee denied claims for funds claimants deposited with ameen for investment in his fraudulent investment opportunities,asserting such claims were not covered under sipa claimants filed oppositions to the denial of their claims with the bankruptcy court,and the matter was the subject of an evidentiary hearing.at the hearing,claimants testified they believed they were investing with,through,or in primeline.ameen generally met with potential clients at primeline offices and requested new investors complete primeline new account forms.the claimants followed ameen instructions in delivering funds for investment.in some cases,ameen also delivered fraudulent statements on primeline letterhead confirming the investment or reflecting the promised return.
based on this evidence,the bankruptcy court entered a memorandum order concluding claimants were customers as defined by sipa and entitled to sipc payments.the trustee and sipc sought and received leave to file an interlocutory appeal.the district court reversed,finding claimants were not customers as defined by sipa because claimants did not entrust funds with the debtor as required under the act,and the interests claimants sought to purchase were not securities protected under the act.claimants filed a timely appeal with this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to d we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
where a district court acts in its capacity as a bankruptcy appellate court,we review the bankruptcy court decision independently.see eastland mortgage hart in re hart,cir.we review the bankruptcy court factual findings for clear error.see homestead golf club,pride stables,cir.we review de novo the bankruptcy court legal conclusions.id.whether the facts establish claimants were customers of primeline with respect to the claims at issue is a legal question we review de novo.focht heebner in re old naples,cir.
congress passed sipa to protect public investors against financial losses arising from the insolvency of registered brokers and dealers.see securities investor protection barbour,d.the statutory scheme facilitates the return of customer property held by the insolvent firm and reimburses customers for cash and securities mishandled or misappropriated by the brokerage firm or its agents.as the supreme court explained 
customers of failed firms found their cash and securities on deposit either dissipated or tied up in lengthy bankruptcy proceedings.in addition to its disastrous effects on customer assets and investor confidence,this situation also threatened a domino effect involving otherwise solvent brokers that had substantial open transactions with the firm that failed.congress enacted the sipa to arrest this process,restore investor confidence in the capital markets,and upgrade the financial responsibility requirements for registered brokers and dealers.
id.at.sipa created sipc,a corporation composed of registered brokers and dealers,to administer sipa.most securities brokers must be members of sipc and must contribute to the fund sipc maintains for investor protection.see id.not unlike the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic,sipc insures investors who deposit cash or securities with a broker against the risk of broker insolvency.pursuant to sipa,sipc oversees the liquidation of brokers and dealers.see id.in a liquidation proceeding,the sipc fund is available if the debtor general estate is insufficient to pay customer claims.see id.a.
sipa precisely delineates the category of investors entitled to protection under the act.specifically,only a customer of a registered is protected.sipa defines the term customer as 
any person who has a claim on account of securities received,acquired,or held by the debtor in the ordinary course of its business as a broker or dealer from or for the securities accounts of such person for safekeeping,with a view to sale,to cover consummated sales,pursuant to purchases,as collateral security,or for purposes of effecting transfer.the term customer includes any person who has a claim against the debtor arising out of sales or conversions of such securities,and any person who has deposited cash with the debtor for the purpose of purchasing securities.
emphasis added.
an investor is entitled to protection under sipa,and compensation from sipc,only if the investor entrusted cash or securities with the now insolvent.securities investor protection pepperdine university in re brentwood,cir.in addition,to qualify as a customer,an investor must demonstrate cash deposited with the debtor was deposited for the purpose of purchasing securities.sipa also expressly defines the term security
