factual and procedural background 
the securities claims and criminal investigation 
homestore,a publicly traded company,is an provider of residential real estate listings and related content.homestore appeared to be performing well during fiscal year and the first quarter of.however,in december homestore announced the audit committee of its board of directors had begun an inquiry into the company accounting methods and it would restate certain of its financial statements 
soon after homestore announcement shareholders began filing federal securities and derivative liability lawsuits against homestore and many of its current and former officers and directors.the plaintiffs alleged,among other things,homestore had materially overstated its revenues and its financial statements were materially inaccurate and misleading.
in september the united states attorney for the central district of california filed a criminal information alleging a scheme to commit securities fraud and naming homestore former chief financial officer,joseph shew,and two other former homestore officers.shew pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and admitted that from march through december he had conspired to overstate homestore advertising revenue and filed false form quarterly financial reports with the securities and exchange commission.
the insurance policies 
on august,shew signed a renewal application for a primary level d o liability policy with genesis insurance company for the policy year august through august.as part of the underwriting process genesis required homestore to submit its most recent form with the application.homestore provided the form it had filed for the quarter ended march.
genesis issued a million d o policy,which included coverage for securities claims.section viii general conditions,subparagraph c of the policy states,t he statements in the application and in any materials submitted therewith are the directors,officers and the company representations,that they shall be deemed material to the acceptance of the risk or hazard assumed by the insurer under this policy,and that this policy is issued in reliance upon the truth of such representations.subparagraph c,the language at issue in this appeal,provides,i n the event that the application,including materials submitted therewith,contains misrepresentations made with the actual intent to deceive,or contain misrepresentations which materially affect either the acceptance of the risk or the hazard assumed by the insurer under this policy,no coverage shall be afforded under this policy for any director or officer who did not sign the application but who knew on the inception date of this policy the facts that were so misrepresented,and this policy in its entirety shall be void and of no effect whatsoever if such misrepresentations were known to be untrue on the inception date of the policy by one or more of the individuals who signed the application.
the genesis application was also submitted on behalf of homestore to tig to obtain excess d o coverage.tig underwriter reviewed homestore form for the quarter ended march,as part of its own underwriting process.tig issued a million d o policy,which provided excess coverage in conformity with the terms of the genesis policy.
the state and federal court actions 
on february,tig filed a complaint in los angeles superior court for rescission,alleging it was entitled to rescind the d o policy as to homestore,the appellant insureds and other insured officers and directors who are not part of this action under state law and the policy terms because shew knew the form for the quarter ended march,upon which tig had relied in deciding to issue the policy,contained material misrepresentations regarding homestore financial condition in may the trial court granted tig motion for summary judgment the court finds that the application upon which the tig excess policy was issued contains factual misrepresentations which were made with the actual intent to deceive and which were material to the acceptance of the risk and the hazard assumed by tig,and the signatory of the application,homestore former chief financial officer,joseph shew,knew such misrepresentations to be untrue at the time he signed the application and as of the inception date of the tig excess policy accordingly,under the plain meaning of the applicable provisions of the tig excess policy,and pursuant to california law,the court finds that tig has the right to rescind the tig excess policy in its entirety so that it shall be null,void and of no effect whatsoever as to all insureds.
approximately months earlier,in a similar action filed by genesis in the united states district court for the central district of california to rescind the genesis policy,the district court had granted genesis motion for summary judgment.the ninth circuit affirmed the district court order in a consolidated appeal by genesis and several other insurers who had also issued d o policies to homestore and its officers and directors.federal ins.homestore,wl.the ninth circuit held the policy language was unambiguous and permitted genesis to rescind as to all insureds based on shew knowing submission of the materially false form in connection with the application.id.at.
contentions 
homestore and the appellant insureds contend section viii,subparagraph c is ambiguous as to whether tig may rescind the d o policy as to the appellant insureds,who did not sign the application and were unaware of the misrepresentations and triable issues of fact exist regarding whether section viii,subparagraph c elements for rescission have been met.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo and decide independently whether the facts not subject to triable dispute warrant judgment for the moving party as a matter of law.intel hamidi cal th,d,code civ,subd.c.
interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law and follows the general rules of contract interpretation.haynes farmers ins.exchange cal th,d,waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.the fundamental rules of contract interpretation are based on the premise that the interpretation of a contract must give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.under statutory rules of contract interpretation,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.waller,at,d.when interpreting a policy provision,we give its words their ordinary and popular sense except when they are used by the parties in a technical or other special sense.haynes,at,d.a policy provision will be considered ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions,both of which are reasonable.citation.but language in a contract must be interpreted as a whole,and in the circumstances of the case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.waller,at,d.w here the policy is clear and unequivocal,the only thing the insured may reasonably expect is the coverage afforded by the plain language of the mutually terms.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group,see vtn consolidated,northbrook ins.d.insurance policy must be construed from the language used and where its terms are plain and unambiguous,the courts have a duty to enforce the contract as agreed upon by the parties.
california law and the unambiguous policy language permit tig to rescind the policy as to the appellant insureds 
governing law permits an insurer to rescind a policy when the insured has misrepresented or concealed material information in connection with obtaining insurance,concealment,whether intentional or unintentional,entitles the injured party to rescind.if a representation is false in a material point,whether affirmative or promissory,the injured party is entitled to rescind the contract from the time the representation becomes false.the provisions of this chapter apply as well to a modification of a contract of insurance as to its original formation.insurance code section provides any such rescission shall apply to all insureds under the contract,including additional insureds,unless the contract provides otherwise.
the unambiguous language in section viii,subparagraph c is consistent with tig statutory right to rescind the contract of insurance with respect to the appellant insureds notwithstanding the fact they did not sign the application and were apparently unaware of the false financial information included in the form the policy provides that,if the application for insurance or information submitted with the application includes material misrepresentations and the person who signed the this case joseph of the misrepresentations,the policy is void in its entirety.to be sure,the policy also provides that,if the application or materials submitted with it include misrepresentations made with the actual intent to deceive or material to the risk assumed by tig,coverage will be denied for any director or officer who knew on the policy inception date of the misrepresentations.this distinct right to rescind as to individuals with actual knowledge of the application false representations of fact,however,does not,under any reasonable interpretation of the policy language,restrict tig broader right consistent with insurance code section to rescind the contract as to all insureds in the case of an application actually signed by an officer who had knowledge of the false statements.the clause simply does not provide that the policy will be void only as to the particular signer who had knowledge of the misrepresented facts.
homestore and the appellant insureds dispute this conclusion,asserting section viii,paragraph c is reasonably subject to the interpretation that a misrepresentation known by one or more of the individuals who signed the application renders the policy voidable only as to the signers and not innocent.that argument relies on a distorted dissection of the provision grammar and sentence structure and would render the distinction between signers and essentially meaningless anyone who knew of a misrepresentation would not be covered anyone who did not know would be covered.homestore and the appellant insureds strained interpretation would also require us to disregard the provision clear admonition this policy in its entirety shall be void and of no effect whatsoever if one or more of the individuals signing the application knew of the false statement.boghos certain underwriters at lloyd of london cal th,d,constructions of contractual provisions that would render other provisions surplusage are disfavored farmers ins.exchange knopp th,d contracts,including insurance contracts,are to be construed to avoid rendering terms surplusage.
relying on watts farmers ins.exchange th,d,homestore and the appellant insureds also assert policy language similar to the language at issue that the entire policy shall be void was interpreted to permit rescission of an insurance policy only as to the insured who made a misrepresentation.in watts,however,division four of this court was addressing whether the concealment and fraud clause in the standard form fire insurance policy,set forth in insurance code section,barred recovery by an innocent when the other made a misrepresentation in connection with a claim insurance code section does not create a statutory right to apply rescission to all insureds in the event of a misrepresentation by any one of the individual insureds.accordingly,the watts court held,s ince the language adopted by the legislature for the standard form does not specifically state that the act of any insured will be attributed to all insureds,the intent is that coverage be severable and that an innocent be able to recover for his or her proportionate share of the damaged property.id.at,d.in contrast to insurance code section,insurance code section,which applies to d o policies,specifically states,whenever a right to rescind a policy is authorized by that portion of the insurance code,including for concealment or misrepresentations in the application,the right to rescind applies to all insureds,thereby permitting attribution of culpable conduct unless the policy provides otherwise.the question of contract interpretation in watts,therefore,was quite different from the issue presented by the case at bar 
insurance code section also belies homestore and the appellant insureds public policy argument that permitting rescission as to the appellant insureds is contrary to their reasonable expectations and renders the securities coverage illusory.a contractual provision consistent with the insurance code can not be contrary to public policy.
indeed,the severability of d o coverage has been litigated for more than years and the need for companies and their officers and directors to ensure they obtain coverage with unambiguous severability provisions to protect against exactly what happened in this case has long been identified.such severability provisions have become more common.their effect is that misrepresentations or nondisclosures in the insurance application are not imputed from one officer or director to another.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra,shapiro american home assur,policy here did not bar recovery by innocent on basis of fraudulent acts in procurement of insurance because it had a clear severability provision.since homestore a company with million in restated revenue for the quarter ended march,and the appellant insureds could have purchased a policy with a severability provision,their decision to purchase a policy without such a provision does not offend public policy.
the rescission provision is not subject to the heightened standard applied to exclusions and termination provisions 
as an alternative to their argument section viii,subparagraph c is ambiguous regarding tig right to rescind the policy as to innocent insureds,homestore and the appellant insureds assert the provision is unenforceable because it was not conspicuous,plain and clear,relying on cases dealing with provisions in the insurance contract that purport to exclude or limit coverage.in general,provisions relating to exclusions from coverage must be conspicuous placed and printed so that they will attract the reader attention and plain and clear stated precisely and understandably,in words that are part of the working vocabulary of the average layperson.haynes farmers ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d,see paramount properties transamerica title ins.cal d,termination provisions which purport to curtail the insurer liability in a manner inconsistent with the insured reasonable expectations are closely analogous to exclusionary provisions in interpreting such termination provisions,we believe that the principles of construction for exclusionary provisions are applicable.
there is a significant distinction between the rescission provision at issue here and policy exclusions or the termination provision in paramount properties transamerica title ins,supra,cal d at page.most exclusions limit the scope of coverage an insured would reasonably expect the requirement they be conspicuous and clear is intended to protect the insureds from unexpected and unreasonable denials of coverage.see,haynes farmers ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d.section viii,subparagraph c,however,essentially confirms the provisions of insurance code section an insurer may rescind a policy as to all insureds when material information has been misrepresented or concealed in the application process.as such,there is nothing about the provision that takes away or limits coverage reasonably expected by the insured and therefore nothing to trigger the requirements for a conspicuous,plain and clear statement.see steven fidelity casualty cal d,haynes,at,d.
