parkcentral global,refused brown investment management.request for its list of limited partners.parkcentral asserts that the vice chancellor erred by requiring parkcentral to provide the list to brown,because the partnership agreement allows parkcentral to restrict access to that information,and federal law prohibits disclosure of agreements with third parties.because brown complied with the partnership agreement,and limited partners are not third parties to the partnership,we affirm the judgment of the court of chancery.
factual and procedural background 
parkcentral provided investors with information about privacy policies.
parkcentral is a hedge fund,incorporated as a delaware limited partnership in june with parkcentral capital management,as its general partner.parkcentral invested all of its capital in an affiliated fund known as parkcentral global hub limited,a bermuda corporation.
parkcentral informs all prospective investors,in a private placement memorandum ppm,that confidentiality concerns will limit their access to partnership information.in,the general partner informed investors that federal regulations obligated it to provide annual notice of its privacy policies.parkcentral annual privacy notice stated,w e generally do not disclose any personal information about our current or former investors that we obtain during the course of our relationship to unaffiliated third parties,except as permitted by law.
the ppm included a section entitled privacy policy with language that mirrored the privacy notice language.it states,with respect to the general partner individual,investors,the general partner does not disclose personal information about such or former to third parties other than described below.the section also included a general policy that stated,the general partner does not otherwise provide any personal information about investors to outside firms,organizations or individuals,except as required by law.
beginning in,parkcentral subscription documents required all investors to agree that they have reviewed the general partner privacy policy contained in the memorandum ppm.
disclosure under the partnership agreement.
section of parkcentral second amended and restated limited partnership agreement,entitled partnership records,mirrors the language of of the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act section b allows each partner,subject to c and reasonable standards established by the general partner,to obtain records,including a current list of partners names and addresses,upon reasonable demand section c provides that the general partner may keep information confidential if it believes in good faith that disclosure is not in the best interest of the partnership or if the general partner is bound by law or agreement with a third party to keep the information confidential 
parkcentral ceased operation and investors brought suit in texas.
in august,brown signed subscription documents and became a limited partner in parkcentral.in the subscription documents,brown represented that it had reviewed the ppm and the partnership agreement.
in november,parkcentral suffered large losses that wiped out investors capital.as a result,brown lost its entire investment.the global hub fund ceased trading,terminated substantially all of its positions,and was liquidated.now,parkcentral only activity is to defend lawsuits against it,and has no plans to raise new capital for future investment operations.
in spring,certain parkcentral investors brought a class action claim in a texas federal court against individuals and entities affiliated with parkcentral.the lawsuit alleged mismanagement of the fund and breaches of fiduciary duty,among other claims.brown is not involved in the texas litigation,except as an absent member of the purported class.
brown requested a list of limited partners.
on december,brown wrote to the general partner and requested a current list of the name and last known business,residence or mailing address of each partner in parkcentral.brown wrote again to reiterate its demand on january.the general partner responded that the demand failed to state a proper purpose for the request,as required by b of the partnership agreement.the general partner also denied the request because applicable law and parkcentral privacy policies purportedly prohibited the disclosure of nonpublic information.
on january,brown submitted a third request for a list of names and addresses of parkcentral partners.brown stated that it sought the information to a contact other limited partners in order to investigate claims of the general partner mismanagement or breaches of fiduciary duty b contact other limited partners to investigate the allegations made in the texas litigation c contact other limited partners to bring their attention to the texas litigation and ascertain their desire to become associated with it or pursue similar actions d contact other limited partners to investigate potential direct and derivative claims against the partnership auditors and e contact other limited partners to discuss whether any of them would desire to pursue a derivative direct claim against the partnership auditors.brown further stated that it was investigating the allegations raised in the texas litigation.
on january,the general partner counsel responded that parkcentral privacy obligations limited the general partner ability to disclose information and suggested brown counsel contact them regarding the request.
the vice chancellor ordered parkcentral to produce the list.
on february,brown filed a complaint in the court of chancery under.seeking an order that parkcentral provide brown with the name and address of each partner.the vice chancellor conducted a trial on may,and ordered parkcentral to produce the list,pursuant to the partnership agreement and.he noted that brown met both the procedural and substantive requirements for access,and that parkcentral had not placed restrictions to limited partners rights in the partnership agreement.the vice chancellor ordered parkcentral to produce a list of each of its partners name and last known business,residence,or mailing address.the order directed brown to keep the list confidential and to use it only for the purposes set forth in its january letter.
on may,parkcentral appealed the vice chancellor order and requested that the vice chancellor stay the order pending appeal.the vice chancellor denied the stay,but this court granted a stay on may.
standard of review 
we review the vice chancellor interpretation of written agreements and delaware law de novo we also review de novo the vice chancellor statutory interpretation that federal law does not preempt disclosure of the partnership list

title six,section of the delaware code entitles limited partners to access partnership information and records if they make a reasonable demand for a purpose reasonably related to their interest as a limited partner subsection a allows the general partner to establish reasonable standards governing the right to access information in the partnership agreement or otherwise subsection f allows the general partner to restrict the rights of a limited partner to obtain information under in the partnership agreement 
parkcentral asserts that the partnership agreement and a authorizes the general partners to establish reasonable standards governing access to information parkcentral claims that the annual privacy notices constitute reasonably restrictive standards that permitted it to deny brown request 
parkcentral can not deny brown request based on its privacy notices.the partnership agreement expressly grants limited partners the right to access a list of the names and addresses of each partner.brown complied with all the procedural requirements of b,which entitles brown to the list of names and addresses the general partner may not eli
