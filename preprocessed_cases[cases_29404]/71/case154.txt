plaintiff appellant donna ann gabriele chechele appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york paul crotty,judge granting insider defendants appellees motion to dismiss her trading complaint.specifically,the district court found that the requirements of a claim under section b of the securities exchange act of exchange act,mandating disgorgement of profits by statutory insiders,had not been satisfied.we agree and affirm the district court judgment.
background 
appellant chechele is a shareholder of apollo group,apollo.appellees john and peter sperling,father and son,are the executive chairman and vice chairman of apollo board of directors,respectively.chechele sued the sperlings under section b of the exchange act,b,seeking disgorgement of alleged profits.profits are realized under section b when an insider buys and sells stock of his company within a period.it is undisputed that the sperlings are insiders for the purposes of section b.
as insiders,john and peter sperling had considerable holdings of apollo stock.in order to convert some of their shares of apollo class a common stock into cash,in and,john sperling entered into two prepaid variable forward contracts pvfcs and peter sperling entered into three pvfcs.the terms of each pvfc were contained in three documents a master agreement,a pledge agreement,and a transaction confirmation.
the master agreements provided the general framework for the pvfc transactions on the payment date,the banks would pay john and peter an amount of cash.in exchange,the sperlings promised to deliver to the banks,on a settlement date,some number of apollo shares,or their cash equivalent.the number of shares to be delivered varied with the market closing price of apollo stock three days prior to the settlement date according to a formula provided in each agreement.
additionally,on the payment date,the sperlings pledged as collateral the maximum number of shares that could be delivered under the agreement to secure the banks interest in the shares.in the meantime,however,the sperlings retained ownership of the shares until delivery on the settlement date they continued to have the right to exercise the shares voting rights and receive cash dividends.
the particulars of each pvfc transaction,including the payment date,upfront cash payment amount,number of pledged shares,settlement date,and settlement formula,were all set forth in the transaction confirmation.for example,john sperling july,transaction confirmation called for him to pledge one million shares on july,the payment date in return for approximately million from bank of america.the settlement date occurred approximately eighteen months later,on january.
under the settlement formula in this transaction,if the share price three trading days prior to settlement the maturity date fell below the floor price,john was required to deliver all of the pledged shares or a cash equivalent.the floor price protected john from a decline in the stock price because he was required to deliver one million shares or the cash equivalent regardless of how much below the floor price the share price fell.
but if the share price at the maturity date was between the floor price and the ceiling price,the number of shares to be delivered would decline as the share price rose above the floor price according to a formula that maintained a constant cash equivalent value.john would keep any undelivered shares.
if the share price at the maturity date was above the ceiling price,however,the number of shares to be delivered would increase according to a formula under which john had to deliver more shares as the stock price rose.but,no matter how high the stock price climbed,john never had to deliver more than the one million originally pledged shares 
the transaction could be viewed as a bet on whether the share price would be above the ceiling price bank bet or below the floor price john bet on the maturity date.john would win the bet if the settlement price was below the floor,because he would be satisfying his obligation to the bank with relatively inexpensive shares.the bank would win the bet if the settlement price was above the ceiling,because it would receive an increasing number of shares of increasing value.for settlement prices in between the floor and ceiling,the transaction resembled a loan john borrowed million from the bank on the payment date and was obligated to pay the bank back approximately million the million he borrowed plus the implied financing cost of the loan.
on january,the share price was above the ceiling so the bank won the bet and john had to deliver some,but not all,of the pledged shares on january.
all five pvfc transactions were settled by delivery of shares rather than the cash equivalent.the following charts summarize their terms.

the claim in the district court 
within six months of the settlement of the pvfc transactions at issue,the sperlings sold some of their apollo stock on the open market.chechele alleges that those sales,in light of the pvfc settlement,violated section b.according to her theory of the case,the sperlings sold the shares they pledged to the banks on the payment dates of the pvfcs,but then repurchased the undelivered shares on the settlement dates.she claims that their subsequent sales of company stock on the open market less than six months after the pvfc settled can be matched to the purchase that occurred at settlement.if she is correct,any profits made from the later sales must be disgorged as profits under section b.
the district court concluded that because the sperlings rights became fixed and irrevocable at the time they entered into the pvfcs the repurchases of the sperlings retained shares on the settlement date did not constitute a purchase under section b.chechele sperling,civ,wl,at.
discussion 
chechele raises only one issue on appeal whether the sperlings retention of a portion of the shares that were pledged but not delivered to the banks constituted a purchase of company stock within the meaning of section b of the securities exchange act.we review de novo the district court grant of a motion to dismiss under federal rule of procedure b,anschutz merrill lynch,cir,and conclude that the sperlings ultimate retention of shares pledged to the banks in the various pvfc transactions did not constitute purchases under section b.
in relevant part,section b states 
a ny profit realized by a corporate insider from any purchase and sale,or any sale and purchase,of any equity security within any period of less than six months shall inure to and be recoverable by the issuer,irrespective of any intention on the part of the insider.
b.we have explained that liability under section b does not attach unless the plaintiff proves that there was a purchase and a sale of securities by an insider within a period.gwozdzinsky fund,cir the only element at issue here is element one whether a purchase occurred when the pvfcs settled and the sperlings retained some of their pledged shares 
pvfcs are a form of complex derivatives 
the pvfcs at issue here are complex derivatives on the day the contracts were written,the sperlings obtained the equivalent of a right to sell a maximum number of shares to the banks,which they would exercise if the share price fell below a floor.because the value of the sperlings right to sell shares would increase as the price of the stock decreased,the right is a put equivalent position.a h in exchange for this put equivalent position,the sperlings granted the banks a right to receive additional shares as the apollo stock price rose above the pvfc ceiling price.because the value of the banks right to receive the pledged shares would increase as the stock price increased,the right is a call equivalent position.a b 
for purposes of our analysis,the initial pledge of shares as collateral is irrelevant the pledge agreement merely protected the bank against the sale or encumbrance of the shares at risk in the pvfc until the settlement date.and the fact that the transaction resembled a loan at settlement prices between the floor and t
