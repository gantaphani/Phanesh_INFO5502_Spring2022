opinion of the court 
the appellant,aron rosenberg,is a shareholder of motient corporation.he has appealed from a district court judgment dismissing,with prejudice,his shareholder derivative action against xm ventures for failing to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.the complaint asserted a violation of section b of the securities and exchange act of resulting from xm ventures sale of motient stock.
the issue on this appeal requires us to determine whether beneficial ownership of a subject issuer equity securities is a necessary element of group membership within the meaning of section d of the securities and exchange act of.we conclude that it is.we have carefully considered the other issues presented by the appellant and conclude that no extended discussion is necessary.as a result,we will affirm the order of the district court dismissing rosenberg complaint 
the specific question before us is whether beneficial ownership of the equity securities of a corporate issuer by each group member is a necessary element for entrance in a section d group.put another way,may an individual without beneficial ownership of the equity securities of an issuer become a member of a group consisting of individuals who are beneficial owners of the issuer equity securities for the purpose of determining whether the group members are statutory insiders subject to section b of the securities and exchange act of 
plaintiff appellant aron rosenberg appeals from the district court grant of defendant appellee xm ventures motion to dismiss pursuant to fed.civ.b.we note from the outset that this case takes many twists and turns through the thicket of federal securities law.therefore,we begin our trek,compass in hand,with the salient facts.rosenberg is a shareholder of motient,motient,a public company registered under section of the securities and exchange act of.motient owned percent of the outstanding shares of xm satellite radio holdings.another company,worldspace,owned the remaining shares of xm holdings.
rosenberg alleges that in or about mid,motient,its significant shareholders,and worldspace agreed that motient would purchase worldspace interest in amrc xm holdings.see app.at.further,rosenberg alleges that various agreements,formal and informal,entered into by and between,motient,xm,worldspace and motient significant shareholders,created a group which acted together for the purpose of acquiring,holding or voting the company motient equity securities and at all relevant times,that group included xm and owned more than percent of the company motient outstanding common stock.id.at.
on june,motient,xm holdings,and worldspace entered into a formal share exchange agreement.at bottom,the agreement provided that worldspace would transfer all of its shares of xm holdings to motient in exchange for motient issuance of,shares of its own stock to an irrevocable grantor trust xm ventures to be created by worldspace.the agreement further provided that xm ventures would transfer its xm holdings stock to motient thereafter,motient would issue its own stock to xm ventures in two distributions.the transaction would result in xm holdings being a wholly owned subsidiary of motient,and xm ventures,with the ceo of worldspace acting as trustee,would be a substantial shareholder of motient.
according to rosenberg,between september and february,xm sold a portion of the motient shares that it acquired under the agreement.rosenberg filed the present action,contending that xm must disgorge the profits it realized on these trades to motient pursuant to section b of the securities and exchange act of.see b.in response to rosenberg complaint,xm filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to fed.civ.b.
the district court granted xm motion to dismiss,with prejudice,partially on the ground that xm was not a member of a group that owned more than a percent beneficial interest in motient equity securities prior to xm acquisition of motient stock.app.at.in opposing xm motion to dismiss,rosenberg argued,among other things,that worldspace acted as xm agent because it is reasonable to infer that xm specifically requested that the group be formed to insure xm acquisition of the additional shares.app.at.the district court rejected this argument,concluding that a critical flaw in this argument is the fact that worldspace,whether as principal or agent,could not have been a member of an ownership group prior to the purchase because it never owned any motient stock prior to the transaction in question.id.we write to clarify the district court conclusion on this point because it could be interpreted as requiring record ownership of an equity security as a prerequisite to membership in a section d group.
to answer the question before us on this appeal properly,we are required to interpret provisions of the securities and exchange act of,et.therefore,we begin by briefly setting forth the general analytical framework underlying our construction of the provision at issue.the role of the courts in interpreting a statute is to give effect to congress intent.see idahoan fresh advantage produce,cir,citing negonsott samuels,d.because it is presumed that congress expresses its intent through the ordinary meaning of its language,every exercise of statutory interpretation begins with an examination of the plain language of the statute.see id.at,citing,santa fe med,segal in re segal,cir citing mansell mansell,d united states pelullo,cir.where the statutory language is plain and unambiguous,further inquiry is not required.see in re segal,at.to determine whether the statutory language is ambiguous,we must examine the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.see marshak treadwell,cir,quoting,robinson shell oil,d.in addition,when interpreting a statute,courts should endeavor to give meaning to every word which congress used and therefore should avoid an interpretation which renders an element of the language superfluous.see united states state of alaska,d,reh g denied,d united food commercial workers union local brown group,d reading which gives effect to all of a statute provisions prevails over one which disregards a provision as legislative oversight first bank ass fdic,cir.this precept of statutory construction applies to the interpretation of regulations as well.see silverman eastrich multiple investor fund,lp,cir court construction should give effect to all provisions lavallee northside civic ass virgin islands coastal zone management comm n,cir court should endeavor to reconcile conflicting statute and regulation.thus,the preferred construction of a statute and its regulations is one that gives meaning to all provisions.see united states higgins,cir.with these principles in mind,we turn our attention to the act.
section b of the securities and exchange act of.
before we begin our analysis,however,we will provide context by setting forth the statutory provision that gives rise to liability in this case.section b of the securities and exchange act of provides that any profit realized by a corporation principal stockholders arising from the purchase and sale of a corporation equity securities within a period of less than six months must be disgorged to the corporation.see b,provident sec,d.we mention in passing that we are not concerned with section b liability as it applies to corporate officers and directors.here,we address section b liability specifically as it relates to the principal stockholders of a corporation in a sequence.
the principal stockholders of a corporation are those shareholders who directly or indirectly beneficially own more than ten percent of the corporation equity securities.gollust mendell,d.from these precepts,it is clear that liability will attach under section b when an individual having beneficial ownership of more than percent of any one class of the issuer equity securities both purchases and sells shares of the issuer within six months.see,feder frost,cir quoting gwozdzinsky fund,cir.in other words,an individual will not be liable as a principal stockholder under section b for buying and selling stock within six months of each other unless prior to the purchase he beneficially owns more than ten percent of the equity securities of a corporation.having explained when liability will attach to a beneficial owner of securities under section b for certain trading activity,we now turn to a discussion of exactly who can be a beneficial owner,within the meaning of section,of equity securities.
beneficial ownership of equity securities.
section of the securities and exchange act of does not specifically define beneficial ownership with respect to determining the principal stockholders of a subject issuer.see a.rather,the securities and exchange commission sec,the agency authorized by congress to implement the statute,promulgated rules in prescribing the contours of beneficial ownership under section for the purpose of determining whether a person is a beneficial owner of more than percent of a class of equity security.see feder,at,see also ownership reports and trading by officers,directors and principal security holders,exchange act release.the relevant rule states that the term beneficial owner for purposes of section b shall mean any person who is deemed a beneficial owner pursuant to section d of the securities and exchange act of and the rules thereunder.a.in substance,the sec merely engrafted section d definition of beneficial ownership onto section.we note here,however,that the term beneficial owner has another definition under rule a that is used to determine the particular securities held by a beneficial owner after it has been determined that the beneficial owner is an insider subject to short swing recovery.see a.here,we do not pass upon this rule.because,as we have already noted,section defines beneficial ownership,for the purpose of determining who is a principal shareholder,by reference to section d of the act,we turn now,as we must,to an examination of beneficial ownership under section d.
section d is essentially a reporting provision that requires the disclosure of certain information to the sec,the issuing entity,and the exchanges where the stock is traded.see d d.it provides as follows 
d reports by persons acquiring more than five per centum of certain classes of securities.
any person who,after acquiring directly or indirectly the beneficial ownership of any equity security shall,within ten days after such acquisition,send to the issuer of the security at its principal executive office,by registered or certified mail,send to each exchange where the security is traded,and filed with the commission,a statement containing such of the following information,and such additional information,as the commission may by rules and regulations,prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors a the background,and identity,residence,and citizenship of,and the nature of such beneficial ownership by,such person and all other persons by whom or on whose behalf the purchases have been or are to be effected 
d.the text of this provision is clear on its face.after a person has acquired beneficial ownership of the relevant security,the person is required to file a report with various entities within days.we observe that the heading of the subsection speaks in terms of a person who acquires beneficial ownership of a security.next,we turn to the regulation promulgated by the sec to implement this provision.sec rule provides in pertinent part 
a for the purposes of sections d of the act a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who,directly or indirectly,through any contract,arrangement,understanding,relationship,or otherwise has or shares voting power which includes the power to vote,or to direct the voting of,such security,investment power which includes the power to dispose,or to direct the disposition of,such security.
emphasis added.clearly,rule casts a wide net in prescribing the sorts of activity that will qualify one as a beneficial owner of an equity security.indeed,our sister circuits and various commentators have noted that in determining who is a beneficial owner of securities section focuses on the person who can actually vote the shares,rather than the record owner of the stock.see,calvary holdings,chandler,cir holding that record owner of stock was not a beneficial owner of the stock because he did not have the power to vote or dispose of the stock without the permission of others gaf milstein,cir,cert.denied,d noting that voting control of stock is the only relevant element of beneficial ownership bath,blot,cir noting that legal title is irrelevant for the purpose of the statute if someone else can guarantee a block of votes.the rule,textually at least,like the statute it implements,is clear with respect to the type of activity that will qualify one as a beneficial owner of securities.further,in casting its net,the rule defines a beneficial owner as a person with certain attributes.
group beneficial ownership.
finally,we come to the crux of the matter before an entity can be a member of a group of beneficial owners without first beneficially owning stock itself.to answer that question,we direct our attention to section d of the securities and exchange act of,which outlines the contours of a group.see d morales freund.it has been noted by the only other court specifically addressing the issue before us that neither section d,its regulations,nor its congressional commentary provides a clear answer with respect to the question before us.see transcon lines becker.we agree.after considering the text and its contextual relevance,both narrowly and in relation to the statute as a whole,we believe that the statute,the regulations,and the accompanying legislative history are ambiguous with respect to the specific question before us.it is true that elements of the language of the various statutes and regulations may,when read in isolation,support each party position.in fact,in the case sub judice each party has cited to particular snippets of text from the statute,regulations,or legislative history that tends to support each side respective construction.as we have previously stated,however,we do not base our construction of a statute,complex or not,on a sentence or two taken from volumes of statutory text,regulations,and legislative history.
the relevant text of section d provides that when two or more persons act as a partnership,limited partnership,syndicate,or other group for the purpose of acquiring,holding,or disposing of securities of an issuer,such syndicate or group shall be deemed a person for the purposes of this subsection.d emphasis added.this provision has the effect of aggregating the individual stock beneficially owned by each group member and attributing to each member the total holdings of the group.see,morales quintel entertainment,cir.for example,if a group has three members each owning ten shares of stock,then each member will be treated as beneficially owning thirty shares of stock.here,when defining a group,congress chose to speak in terms of a person or persons acting for an enumerated purpose.
the implication of using the term person in subsection d after its use in subsection d,which defines beneficial ownership,indicates to us that congress intended to attribute the same meaning to person as it had in the preceding subsection defining beneficial ownership.in other words,the persons that subsection d refers to are the same persons that congress set forth in subsection d beneficial owners.we simply fail to see why congress would specifically state that the group shall be deemed a person if congress did not intend to refer to persons as that term is used throughout the section.
moreover,the rule promulgated by the sec to implement section d provides support for this construction.rule defines group beneficial ownership in pertinent part 
when two or more persons agree to act together for the purpose of acquiring,holding,voting or disposing of equity securities of an issuer,the group formed thereby shall be deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership for purposes of sections d of the act,as of the date of such agreement,of all equity securities of that issuer benefi
