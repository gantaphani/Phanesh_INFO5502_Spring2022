we must decide whether the national education association established or maintained an employee pension benefit plan under the employee retirement income security act of by endorsing and aggressively marketing certain annuities.
both jerre and david hamblen collectively,plaintiffs are members of the national education association nea and employees of local public school districts.is an employee of the south kitsap school district in washington,and hamblen is an employee of el dorado union high school district in california.
the nea is a public employee labor union,consisting of over million teachers,administrators,and other educators in public schools throughout the united states.the nea provides numerous benefits to its members,including insurance coverage,discounts,and other services.many of those benefits are provided through nea member benefits corporation neambc,a wholly owned subsidiary of the nea.
according to the complaint,in the,the nea,through the neambc,worked with defendant nationwide life insurance nationwide and,after,with defendant security benefit life insurance company and its subsidiaries collectively,security benefit to offer the nea valuebuilder plan the plan to its members the plan is purported to be a section b retirement plan.the nea selected nationwide,and then security benefit as the exclusively endorsed providers of the plan.after selecting nationwide and security benefit,nea designed certain annuities in conjunction with them.these annuities were called valuebuilder annuities.nea negotiated the terms of the valuebuilder annuities,exclusively endorsed the valuebuilder annuities as favorable retirement savings vehicles,and aggressively marketed the valuebuilder annuities to nea members.nea also monitored and managed the valuebuilder annuities for its participants.
in exchange for the nea role in marketing the valuebuilder annuities,nationwide and security benefit paid royalties and annual fees to the nea,took on the salaries of neambc representatives,and contributed to nea charitable foundations.nea royalty income from security benefit alone amounted to approximately million per year.nationwide and security benefit,in turn,received fees from investment companies whose mutual funds were made available through the valuebuilder annuities.
the nea did not fully disclose to its members the nature or amount of the payments it received from nationwide and security benefit,or the fact that nationwide and security benefit received payments from investment companies whose mutual funds were included in the valuebuilder annuities.instead,the nea marketed the valuebuilder annuities provided by nationwide and security benefit as the most favorable retirement option for its members,despite the fact that valuebuilder annuities charged fees that were as much as ten times those charged on comparable annuity contracts.plaintiffs participated in their school district employers section b retirement plans,and selected valuebuilder of other annuities made available by their of the nea enthusiastic endorsement.
in essence,plaintiffs allege that the nea knowingly duped them into purchasing unattractive annuities by creating an atmosphere of trust and confidence that was exploited by defendants for their financial gain.plaintiffs purport to represent a class of more than similarly situated nea members on whose behalf public school district employers across the country purchased valuebuilder annuities totaling over billion.
plaintiffs theory of the case is that by negotiating,endorsing,marketing,and promoting the nea valuebuilder annuities,the nea established or maintained an employee pension benefit plan within the coverage of title i of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.see a.plaintiffs contend that the nea and neambc are plan fiduciaries under erisa,and that by,inter alia,failing to ensure that the fees charged by nationwide and security benefit in connection with the annuity contracts were reasonable,nea and neambc breached their fiduciary duties.plaintiffs allege that nationwide and security benefit were plan fiduciaries as well,and that they also breached their duties by,inter alia,selecting unreasonably mutual funds for inclusion in the valuebuilder annuities.plaintiffs brought this action for breach of fiduciary duties,and other violations of erisa,against nea,neambc,neambc directors,nationwide,security benefit,and security benefit involved subsidiaries collectively,defendants,seeking damages,equitable relief,costs,and fees.
in their motions to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b,defendants argued that erisa does not cover section b retirement plans that public school systems provide for their employees.more specifically,defendants argued that,as a matter of law,section b plans can not be established or maintained by employee organizations such as the nea.
the district court was convinced that if the nea could legally establish or maintain b annuity plans,then plaintiffs would have demonstrat ed that it did so as a factual matter.but the court then explained that employee organizations simply can not,as a matter of law,establish or maintain b annuity plans.the court concluded that since the b annuities were not plans under erisa,the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claim arising out of those annuities.on may,the court dismissed plaintiffs claims pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.plaintiffs timely appealed 
before addressing the merits,we must express a disagreement with the district court analysis of jurisdiction.it dismissed plaintiffs claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because it concluded that the valuebuilder plan was not an employee benefit pension plan subject to erisa.but to ask whether the alleged plan is subject to erisa is a merits question.jurisdiction,by contrast,refers to a tribunal power to hear a case.morrison austl.bank,internal quotation marks omitted holding that the scope of federal securities law raises a question on the merits,not an issue of jurisdiction.whether a particular plan is an employee benefit pension plan,and thus whether a particular defendant is subject to erisa,is therefore a question on the merits of the claim,not an issue of subject matter jurisdiction.trs.of the screen actors pension health plans nyca,cir see also morrison.at.because plaintiffs alleged a cause of action arising under erisa,it is clear that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.
however,we need not remand because of the district court error.since nothing in the analysis of the court below turned on the mistake,a remand would only require a new rule b label for the same rule b conclusion.morrison.at.instead,we proceed to address whether plaintiff s allegations state a claim.id.

although generally the scope of review on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is limited to the complaint,a court may consider evidence on which the complaint necessarily relies if the complaint refers to the document the document is central to the plaintiff claim and no party questions the authenticity of the copy attached to the b motion.marder lopez,cir quoting branch tunnell,cir.the court may treat such a document as part of the complaint,and thus may assume that its contents are true for purposes of a motion to dismiss under rule b.id.quoting united states ritchie,cir.
in addition to the complaint itself,we have taken into consideration two documents on which the complaint necessarily relies.first,we have taken into consideration the prospectus for the nea valuebuilder variable annuity distributed by security benefit on may.plaintiffs quoted this prospectus in their complaint and provided the web address where the prospectus could be found online.plaintiffs thereby incorporated the prospectus into the complaint by reference.see tellabs,makor issues rights,explaining that courts ruling on b motions to dismiss may take into consideration documents incorporated into the complaint by reference.second,we take into consideration information posted on certain nea and neambc web pages that plaintiffs referenced in the complaint and included in the record on appeal.plaintiffs directly quoted the material posted on these web pages,thereby incorporating them into the complaint.id.
we also have taken into consideration the list of approved b vendors displayed publicly on the respective web sites of the south kitsap and el dorado school districts.it is appropriate to take judicial notice of this information,as it was made publicly available by government entities the school districts,and neither party disputes the authenticity of the web sites or the accuracy of the information displayed therein.see.allowing a court to take judicial notice of a fact not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy can not reasonably be questioned tellabs,at noting that courts ruling on b motions to dismiss may take into consideration matters of which a court may take judicial notice see also in re amgen.sec,d,taking judicial notice of drug labels taken from the fda website county of santa clara astra usa,d,taking judicial notice of information posted on a department of health and human services web site.
erisa was enacted to protect,inter alia,the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries.b.erisa applies to any employee benefit plan if it is established or maintained by any employer or by any employee organization or by both.id.a employee benefit plans covered by erisa come in two types.id.the first type,the employee welfare benefit plan,provides medical benefits and any benefits other than pensions on retirement or death.id.by contrast,the second type,the employee pension benefit plan,provides retirement income or results in a deferral of income until retirement.id.a i ii.the second type of benefit plan is at issue in this case.
an employee pension benefit plan is 
any plan,fund,or program which was heretofore or is hereafter established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization,or by both,to the extent that by its express terms or as a result of surrounding circumstances such plan,fund,or program 
i provides retirement income to employees,or 
ii results in a deferral of income by employees 
id erisa imposes strict fiduciary duties on persons who administer employee pension benefit plans.see,id.a defining persons qualifying as plan fiduciaries see also id.et establishing specific fiduciary duties and liability for breaches of these duties.
although erisa definition of employee pension benefit plan is quite broad,there are several important exceptions.section b,for example,exempts governmental plans from erisa regulatory sphere.id.b the provisions of title i shall not apply to any employee benefit plan plan is a governmental plan.erisa defines a governmental plan as a plan established or maintained for its employees by the government of the united states,by the government of any state or political subdivision thereof,or by any agency or instrumentality of the foregoing.id.emphasis added.
the department of labor dol has created a separate regulatory safe harbor that exempts certain section b retirement plans from erisa requirements.this safe harbor provides that a program for the purchase of an annuity contract or the establishment of a custodial account described in section b of the internal revenue code of the code,pursuant to salary reduction agreements which meets the requirements of b b shall not be established or maintained by an employer as that phrase is used in title i.f emphasis added.employers wishing to take advantage of the safe harbor must ensure that participation in the plan is completely voluntary for employees,and must comply with the various requirements set forth in f.id 
plaintiffs allege in the first sentence of their complaint that they are participants and beneficiaries of the nea valuebuilder plan,an internal revenue code section b tax deferred annuity program established and maintained by defendants nea and neambc.plaintiffs urge us to find that this valuebuilder plan is an employee pension benefit plan subject to erisa.but before we can make any determination about whether this plan is a employee pension benefit plan,we must figure out exactly what the plan is.and the central difficulty in this case is plaintiffs inability to explain what they mean by valuebuilder plan.although the complaint repeatedly refers to the plan as if it were a discrete entity,the complaint never defines the plan in any detail.
rather than describing what the plan is,the complaint describes what the plan allegedly does the plan provides retirement income to employees and results in a deferral of income by employees for a period extending to the termination of covered employment or beyond.but this recital simply parrots erisa definition of an employee pension benefit plan.see a i ii.and instead of describing the contours of the plan,the complaint alleges who is behind the nea and neambc.in short,although the complaint alleges that the nea and neambc communicated extensively with plan participants regarding the plan,plan assets,and plan benefits,endorsed the plan,and aggressively marketed and promoted the plan,it utterly fails to explain what the valuebuilder plan is.
nevertheless,if there is any interpretation of the term valuebuilder plan that would render the plan an employee pension benefit plan,plaintiffs would have successfully stated a claim capable of surviving a b motion.looking at the facts alleged in the complaint,we conclude that the valuebuilder plan could refer to three entirely different entities it could refer to the valuebuilder program launched by the nea to help its members save for retirement,the section b retirement plans administered by various school districts,or the specific valuebuilder annuities offered by nationwide and security benefit.we address each of these possibilities in turn.
the first possible interpretation of the complaint is that the valuebuilder plan refers to nea valuebuilder program.according to its website,nea established the nea valuebuilder program to encourage its members to save for retirement.and in their opening brief,plaintiffs explain that according to webster third new international dictionary program refers somewhat circularly to plan,and is generally defined as a plan of procedure a schedule or a system under which action may be taken toward a desired goal a proposed project or scheme.however,the valuebuilder program referenced in the nea website is not a retirement plan.the valuebuilder program appears to be the name of a comprehensive marketing campaign launched by the nea and neambc this marketing plan was apparently designed to convince thousands of nea members to invest in section b annuities sold by nationwide and security benefit.pursuant to their agreements with the nea and neambc,nationwide and security benefit labeled these annuities valuebuilder annuities and marketed them as part of the valuebuilder program.the nea,for its part,trademarked the name valuebuilder.the nea apparently intended to establish valuebuilder as a popular brand name with its members.the nea could then sell this brand to such as nationwide and security benefit.after purchasing the brand from nea,nationwide and security benefit could sell annuities with names like the nea valuebuilder variable annuity to nea members.
in any event,a marketing plan designed to build brand loyalty is not,under any reasonable definition of the term,a retirement plan.the valuebuilder program certainly promotes various retirement plans,but the valuebuilder program itself does not provide retirement income or result in a deferral of income.a i ii.the valuebuilder program is not,therefore,an employee pension benefit plan.accordingly,insofar as the plan refers to the nea valuebuilder program,plaintiffs fail to state an erisa claim.
given the language of the complaint,it seems more likely that plaintiffs used the term valuebuilder plan to refer to the section b annuity plans offered by plaintiffs school district employers.the complaint describes the valuebuilder plan as an internal revenue code section b tax deferred annuity program.the complaint also states that t he plan is purported to be a section b retirement plan.the lengthy discussion in the district court opinion about whether the section b annuity plans were governmental plans indicates that the district court read the valuebuilder plan to refer to the school districts section b annuity plans.this construction of the term is also more promising for plaintiffs,since,unlike the valuebuilder program,the school districts various section b plans are retirement plans.we must determine whether they are employee pension benefit plans subject to erisa,and whether they were established or maintained by an employee,the nea.
section b of the internal revenue code provides employees of public schools,churches,and section c organizations with the ability to invest in annuities.b a employees make contributions toward the purchase of these annuities through agreements,see id.b e,but in order to obtain preferential tax treatment for those contributions,the employer must purchase the selected annuities for its employees,id.b a ii.employers can also choose to make voluntary contributions to these plans.see id.b b a as with optional retirement savings plans established by private employers pursuant to k,each public school district devises its own section b plan,presenting its employees with a menu of different vendors offering various individual annuity contracts or custodial accounts for the purchase of mutual funds see b.each school district determines which vendors and annuity contracts to include in its menu of options,and provides the list of approved vendors to its employees employees then choose the vendor with whom they want to invest and sign individual annuity contracts with the vendor.
however,while a section b plan is clearly a retirement plan,and would be considered an employee pension benefit plan if established or maintained by a c employer,section b plans established by school districts are exempted from erisa by the governmental plan exception.b.as noted earlier,erisa defines governmental plans as plans established or maintained for its employees by the government of any state or political subdivision thereof.id.it is undisputed that public school districts are political subdivisions of the various states and are therefore governmental entities.the only issue is whether the school districts established or maintained the plans,thus bringing the plans within the governmental plan exception.
plaintiffs make two separate arguments that the school district employers did not establish or maintain the plans.first,plaintiffs allege that the school districts did not make any contributions to their annuity accounts,and suggest that the lack of direct governmental funding precludes a finding that their employers section b plans are governmental plans.however,the structure of a section b plan necessarily implicates governmental action,regardless of the presence of direct governmental funding.the creation of a governmental employer section b plan generally begins,as here,with a state law requiring the creation of such plans by a public school district or some other state or local governmental agency.see.cal.even if funded entirely by employee salary reduction contributions,the school district must agree to create the plan,and must set up a system for purchasing the annuities chosen by each employee,making salary deductions to pay for the public school employees investments in their choice of section b annuities and transmitting payments to the chosen vendor.see,cal.b.some states require the public school district employer to decide which vendors it wants to include in its plan and to provide this information to its employees.see cal.b.a state might also make determinations about how and when the marketing of these products will be allowed.see.finally,in some instances the school district employer can terminate the offering of an annuity.see cal.the lack of governmental funding,when considered in light of the necessary governmental involvement in establishing and maintaining section b plans,does not prevent these plans from falling within the governmental plan exemption.plaintiffs second argument is more creative.plaintiffs contend the school district employers did not establish or maintain the section b that the plans are therefore not governmental the plans are exempted from erisa under a different exemption.specifically,plaintiffs allege that the section b plans fall within the safe harbor provided in f,which provides that in certain situations,section b plans are not,as a matter of law,established or maintained by the employer.id.the district court was persuaded by this argument,and held that the section b plans were not governmental plans because they fell within the safe harbor.
the safe harbor provision applicable to employee pension benefit plans,is part of a dol regulation intended to clarif y the limits of the defined terms employee pension benefit plan and pension plan for purposes of title i of the act by identifying specific plans,funds and programs which do not constitute employee pension benefit plans for those purposes.id.a.as explained in part ii,an employer that qualifies for the f safe harbor is considered not to have established or maintained an employee pension benefit plan under erisa.such a plan would therefore not be considered an employee pension benefit plan for purposes of title 
it is clear,however,from the dol regulations and opinions that the regulatory safe harbor for employee pension benefit plans was designed for only one subset of employers namely,private employers organized pursuant to c other than would otherwise be subject to the requirements of title i.it was never intended to apply to section b plans provided by public school districts,which are governmental plans and,thus,already exempt from title i of erisa.for example,the preamble to f provides that c ertain governmental plans defined in section of the act,and church plans defined in section of the act are not affected by the safe harbor regulation because they are excepted from the requirements of title i of the act by virtue of section b and of the act.definitions and coverage under the employee retirement income security act of,april,emphasis added.importantly,this dol interpretation of its own regulation is afforded even more deference than that which courts normally give agency interpretations of statutes.see udall tallman,when the construction of an administrative regulation rather than a statute is in issue,deference is even more clearly in order.see also auer robbins,kraus presidio trust facilities div.residential mgmt.branch,cir 
the irs came to the same conclusion in,after consulting with the dol on the interaction between title i of erisa and section b of the irc.see revised regulations concerning section b annuity contracts,july.the consultation focused on whether the requirements imposed on employers in these regulations would exceed the scope of the department of labor safe harbor regulation at f and result in all section b programs sponsored by employers other than governmental plans and certain church plans falling under the purview of erisa.id.emphasis added see also montoya ing life ins.and annuity,d,holding that the dol safe harbor provided in f does n
