facts and proceedings 
in october,rotunda,an enforcement attorney with the texas state securities board the board,observed an advertisement for an investment opportunity placed by disraeli in the austin american statesman.rotunda suspected that the advertisement indicated possible violations of texas securities laws.rotunda then began an investigation of disraeli and concluded that disraeli might be misrepresenting himself as a licensed investment adviser,when in fact he was not.rotunda also discovered that the advertised investment opportunity was neither registered nor permitted for sale in texas.when rotunda contacted disraeli in the course of the investigation,disraeli represented that he had not sent any materials relating to the investment to any potential investors,though rotunda knew the opposite to be true.consequently,rotunda concluded that disraeli was actively misrepresenting the nature of the investment.rotunda presented his findings and conclusions to grauer,the director of the enforcement division of the board,who agreed with rotunda that an enforcement cease and desist order was necessary to protect the public.grauer and rotunda drafted an order and presented it to morgan,the acting securities commissioner at the time,who agreed that such an order was necessary.on november,morgan signed and executed the emergency cease and desist order emergency order,ordering disraeli to immediately cease and desist from offering the securities at issue in the investigation in texas until the securities could be registered,using misleading or fraudulent offers in connection with the securities,and rendering services as an investment adviser without a license to do so.see.stat.ann.establishing statutory requirements for advertising securities.the order notified disraeli of his right to request a hearing from the securities commissioner.disraeli ultimately waived his right to a hearing and consented to entry of a cease and desist order consent order that prohibited the same activities named and prohibited in the emergency order.
on november,disraeli filed suit under and,as well as,alleging that rotunda,grauer,and morgan were liable for violating his right to due process by issuing the emergency order.he further asserted that the defendants violated federal trademark law by publishing his name in a disparaging manner without his consent.defendants asserted absolute immunity from suit and moved to dismiss under rule b the district court converted their motion into one for summary judgment under rule.the district court ordered limited discovery on the question of defendants actions with respect to the emergency order.following discovery,defendants moved formally for summary judgment,again asserting that they were entitled to absolute immunity or,in the alternative,qualified immunity.the magistrate judge recommended dismissing disraeli claims and the district court did so,specifically finding that the named defendants are entitled to absolute immunity in this cause,that the defendants were within their jurisdiction to issue the emergency order,and that disraeli had abandoned his claims against the john does.disraeli now appeals this decision.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court grant or denial of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.gowesky singing river hosp,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.any reasonable inferences are to be drawn in favor of the party.gowesky,at.
if a party moves for summary judgment and asserts a defense of absolute or qualified immunity in good faith,the burden shifts to the other party to rebut it.beck.state bd.of dental exam rs,cir.the movant can support its motion by relying on the pleadings alone.id.at.
absolute immunity 
absolute immunity denies all remedies to an individual,like disraeli,who asserts that his rights have been violated.bd.of nursing,cir.consequently,the supreme court has been quite sparing in broadening its scope.id.quoting forrester white,d.judges and prosecutors are generally entitled to absolute immunity.beck,at.absolute immunity is also available to certain officers and agencies.butz economou,d beck,at noting that immunity may extend to state agencies as well.agency officials performing certain functions analogous to those of a prosecutor are immune from civil liability resulting from such acts.butz,at.this court applies a nonexhaustive list of factors from butz to determine whether an administrative employee or agency is entitled to absolute immunity 
the need to assure that the individual can perform his functions without harassment or intimidation 
the presence of safeguards that reduce the need for private damages actions as a means of controlling unconstitutional conduct 
insulation from political influence 
the importance of precedent 
the adversary nature of the process and 
the correctability of error on appeal.
beck,at citing butz,at.no one factor is controlling.id.applying these factors,this court has found that members of a state nursing board,at,members of a state dental board,beck,at,and members of the disciplinary board of the national association of securities dealers,austin mun,ass of secs.dealers,cir,are entitled to absolute immunity from suit in the performance of their functions.in beck,the court held that while the board was entitled to absolute immunity,an investigator employed by the board was not,as he performed investigative,not adjudicative nor prosecutorial functions.beck,at.the beck court pointed out that the investigator neither initiated nor pursued prosecution of the complaint against the plaintiff,and his work was thus not at the heart of the adjudicative process.id.at.
applying butz 
disraeli primarily challenges the issuance of the emergency order,which he contends acted as a de facto disbarment.he asserts that because of the nature of the process by which an emergency order is issued,the defendants should not be protected by absolute immunity.
it is clear from the facts that the actions of the three named defendants in drafting and issuing the emergency order were prosecutorial or adjudicative in nature and were at the heart of the adjudicative process established by the texas state securities board.see beck,at.more specifically,by applying the butz factors we hold that the district court correctly granted absolute immunity to the defendants.
need to protect against harassment or intimidation 
disraeli concedes that both rotunda and grauer must be free from harassment or intimidation to carry out their duties.we agree and point out that the attorneys here perform a disciplinary function in their work for the board,which this court has noted makes individuals likely targets for suit.austin mun,at see also,at.the texas securities commissioner is charged with tak ing such measures and making such investigations as will prevent or detect the violation of any provision of texas securities laws.stat.ann.further,the commissioner must present any evidence of wrongdoing to the proper district or county attorney.id.here,the defendants actions were all in furtherance of these statutory duties,which by their nature are both prosecutorial and likely to arouse the ire of targeted individuals.
