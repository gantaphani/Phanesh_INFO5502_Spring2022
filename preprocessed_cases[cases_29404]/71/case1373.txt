introduction 
plaintiffs and appellants joseph deveny et appeal from judgment following the trial court granting of defendants motion for summary judgment on the basis of the affirmative defense of the statute of limitations in plaintiffs class action alleging securities violations.plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in applying the doctrine of inquiry notice and in ignoring plaintiffs amended pleadings and related evidence under the sham pleading doctrine.although we agree with the trial court conclusion that inquiry notice rather than actual knowledge triggers the running of the applicable statute of limitations,we conclude that triable issues of material fact exist as to whether plaintiffs had constructive notice of the facts underlying their complaint.we therefore reverse.
ii.facts and procedural background 
plaintiffs are a class of about individuals who invested in securities issued by defendant entropin,entropin.during the class period august to september,entropin was a pharmaceutical company whose sole business was to develop and market esterom,a topical solution intended to treat impaired range of motion associated with shoulder and back injuries.
entropin evaluated the safety and efficacy of esterom in a series of clinical trials approved by the food and drug administration fda in its august,registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission sec registering all of the outstanding shares of entropin common stock,entropin summarized the phase i and phase ii findings as follows 
based on its clinical studies,the company believes that esterom may involve a new and unique mechanism of action.the phase i study demonstrated that the product does not cause detectable systemic effects including no effect on the cardiovascular system.during the study,esterom caused no significant adverse events and was observed to be safe.the company confirmed that in phase i and phase ii trials,no anesthetic activity or vasoconstrictive activity was observed.
although the precise function of esterom is not known,the medicinal preparation is neither a local anesthetic nor analgesic.an anesthetic relieves pain at rest and pain with movement.an analgesic relieves major pain at rest and provides minor pain relief with movement.in comparison and according to patient evaluations,esterom provides minor relief of pain at rest and major relief of pain during movement.
on march,entropin filed its form annual report for fiscal year with the sec.the report stated,among other things,that the phase ii clinical study had been completed and had shown that o verall,esterom provided relief in both the back and shoulders which was sustained for seven days.there was no clinically observed local anesthetic or analgesic effect.the range of motion for each condition was improved significantly when compared with patients receiving a placebo.
in a series of press releases issued in may and june,entropin stated a successful phase ii clinical trial was completed showing both safety and efficacy in the treatment of acute lower back sprain,and acute painful shoulder.entropin also stated that the results of the phase ii study had been accepted by the fda,which had allowed the company to begin the phase iii clinical study.in press releases issued in august and november,entropin stated that the phase ii study of esterom had shown high efficacy in the treatment of acute lower back sprain and acute painful shoulder.
in december,entropin began a phase iiia clinical trial for esterom.a press release announcing the commencement of the phase iiia clinical trial stated,in placebo controlled phase ii clinical trials,esterom solution demonstrated effectiveness in the improvement of range of motion rom associated with impaired shoulder function and acute lower back sprain.upon successful completion of the phase iii trials,a new drug application will be filed with the fda.
on february,entropin issued a press release announcing a planned public offering of stock.the release stated that the rom of patients suffering from shoulder and back conditions was improved significantly when compared with patients receiving a placebo.the phase iii trials for treatment of impaired rom due to shoulder injuries and functionality started in december.it is expected that the phase iii trials will be completed and a nda filed with the fda in.
on march,entropin sold shares of common stock and warrants to the public under a prospectus and registration statement filed with the sec for gross proceeds of million.the registration statement filed with the fda stated that the phase i and ii clinical trials had shown that esterom was well tolerated at the dose used and the range of motion of patients was improved significantly as compared to patients receiving a placebo.
throughout and,entropin issued press releases concerning the progress of the phase iiia clinical trial.the press releases described esterom as having quick efficacy on shoulder and back problems,and as having the demonstrated ability to rapidly restore range of motion.a press release issued in october,stated that the results of the phase iiia study showed a positive dose response in treated patients and a trend toward efficacy in the study primary endpoint at the dose,although statistical significance was not achieved.
a press release issued in april stated that despite problems with the phase iiia clinical trial,the study still showed a clear efficiency trend in the high dose solution.
press releases issued in february through june stated,the prior phase ii study demonstrated that esterom provided statistically significant improvement for soft tissue afflictions for both the shoulders and the lower back.
in september,however,entropin issued a press release stating that its clinical trials had been a failure esterom was ineffective and entropin was abandoning the drug and any phase iii trials.thereafter,the market price of entropin securities collapsed.
on january,plaintiffs filed a complaint in a securities fraud class action alleging that defendants fraudulently concealed from the plaintiff investors negative clinical data that revealed that esterom,a drug under development,was ineffective.plaintiffs first cause of action alleged that defendants had violated corporations code sections,and,and their second cause of action alleged that defendants had violated section of the securities act of.
plaintiffs alleged that they purchased shares in reliance on entropin positive representations concerning the outcome of clinical trials.specifically,plaintiffs alleged that defendants misrepresented in the private placement memorandum and in the march,registration statement that esterom demonstrated statistically significant improvement for patients as compared to a placebo in the phase ii clinical trials.defendants allegedly failed to disclose to potential investors that the statistical analysis of the phase ii study did not conform to acceptable statistical practice or that the phase ii study was knowingly defective and would have to be repeated.defendants allegedly failed to disclose that entropin had not performed pharmacokinetics tests pk tests essential for determining how esterom is absorbed,metabolized,and excreted by the body,even though the fda had repeatedly requested such tests,and defendant could not develop esterom as a commercially viable product without such tests.defendants allegedly misrepresented that entropin would file a new drug application nda with the fda in,when in fact entropin could not file an nda without first performing the pk tests,which did not take place until.defendants allegedly misrepresented repeatedly that the phase ii study had shown that esterom was effective and that entropin was close to achieving fda approval of the product.
on september,entropin issued a press release admitting that the phase ii and iii clinical trials of esterom had been a failure,that esterom was clinically ineffective,and entropin board of directors had decided to forgo further development of the product.the market price of entropin securities collapsed following the announcement.
plaintiffs alleged that the september announcement was the first indication that defendants had misled them about the efficacy of esterom,the progress of the clinical trials,and the prospects for fda approval of esterom and its commercial potential.defendants generally denied the allegations of the complaint.
in july,defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground of the statute of limitations.however,in october,plaintiffs moved to file a first amended complaint.defendants did not oppose the motion,and plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint on december.the first amended complaint alleged claims under corporations code sections,and,and under sections and a of the securities act of.defendants generally denied the allegations of the first amended complaint.
defendants filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to the first amended complaint on february,the basis for the motion was that plaintiffs claims were barred by the applicable statutes of limitation.defendants separate statement of undisputed material facts filed in support of the motion listed only purportedly undisputed material facts,including the following before,entropin had distributed an abstract to potential investors regarding the results of esterom phase ii testing,which disclosed that esterom was detected in the urine of percent of clinical trial participants,but was not detected in their blood.in december,the report of the phase ii clinical trial was posted on entropin website that report,in a column entitled summary of findings,stated in fashion,no drug detected in blood and of subjects tested positive for drug in urine.the report remained posted on entropin website at least until june.
defendants separate statement of undisputed facts further stated that entropin,in an october,press release,expressly invited those in the public seeking information about esterom to visit entropin website at www.entropin.com,where the above described report was available.in addition,entropin december,and march,registration statements explicitly disclosed to investors the uniform resource locator url of entropin website,and an october,press release invited investors to visit the website.
plaintiffs moved for leave to file a second amended complaint on april.the trial court granted the motion on may.
on may,plaintiffs filed an opposition to defendants motion for summary judgment.in the separate statement of material facts,plaintiffs contended that the blood and urine data set forth in the phase ii report did not provide plaintiffs or other investors with any reason to believe that esterom was not absorbed or was not effective.plaintiffs stated that both higgins bailey and thomas tachovsky had each stated in their depositions that the phase ii report indicated that esterom was absorbed and was effective,and bailey stated that the blood and urine data in the phase ii report indicated encouraging results.
plaintiffs separate statement of material facts also stated that the food and drug administration fda required entropin to conduct pharmacokinetic pk studies on esterom,but entropin never conducted such studies,although it falsely told investors it was complying with fda requirements for such studies and identified scientists who were assisting entropin in carrying out such studies.
plaintiffs separate statement of material facts stated that they took entropin october,press release to mean what it stated in its title,that the results were encouraging.plaintiffs stated that from to september,defendants represented to investors in press releases and shareholder letters,at shareholder meetings and in telephone conversations,that esterom was effective,the clinical trials were on track,and an nda would be filed shortly.
plaintiffs further stated that none of them had actual notice of the blood and urine data until after november,when their attorney initiated an investigation,and none of them had any knowledge or suspicion of defendants wrongdoing or of potential claims against defendants before september.they stated that an average investor would not have interpreted the phase ii report as indicating that esterom was not absorbed and was thus ineffective,and thus they could not be charged with inquiry notice or constructive notice of their claims.
on june,defendants filed a reply brief in support of the motion for summary judgment.at the hearing on the motion on june,the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment.the trial court order granting the motion was filed on july.judgment was entered on august.
iii.discussion 
request for judicial notice 
plaintiffs have requested this court to take judicial notice of certain court records in the action entitled in re entropin.securities litigation,case no.rswl cwx,pending in the united states district court for the central district of california.in particular,plaintiffs have requested us to take judicial notice that the defendants in that action,who are the same defendants in the current action,moved for summary judgment on the defense of the statute of limitations based on the same evidence offered in the current action.the court denied that motion,holding that a material issue of fact exists concerning when plaintiffs had either actual or inquiry notice of facts constituting the alleged fraud upon which their claims are based.
this court may take judicial notice of court records outside the record on appeal,including unpublished orders and decisions in a related federal proceeding,subd.a,subd.d schifando city of los angeles cal th,fn,d,truck plaza,union oil th,fn,d.however,a litigant must demonstrate that the matter as to which judicial notice is sought is both relevant to and helpful toward resolving the matters before this court.jordache enterprises,brobeck,phleger harrison cal th,fn,d.in reviewing the trial court ruling on a motion for summary judgment,we conduct de novo review of the record,as discussed below.we therefore do not consider the ruling of another court on a related matter to be relevant to or helpful toward this task,and we deny the request for judicial notice.
standard of review 
after a motion for summary judgment has been granted,this court examine s the record de novo and independently determine s whether the decision is correct.citation.colarossi coty th,d.in doing so,we use the same process employed by the trial court.first,we identify the issues raised by the pleadings.second,we determine whether the moving party showing establishes facts sufficient to negate the opposing party claims,and to justify judgment in the moving party favor.if so,third,we determine whether the opposing party has raised a triable material issue of fact.dawson toledano th,d.
in reviewing an order granting summary judgment,t he declarations of the party opposing summary judgment are liberally construed to determine the existence of triable issues of fact.all doubts as to whether any material,triable,issues of fact exist are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.cochran cochran th,d.
here,defendants sought summary judgment on the basis of the statute of limitations.while resolution of the statute of limitations issue is normally a question of fact,where the uncontradicted facts established through discovery are susceptible of only one legitimate inference,summary judgment is proper.jolly eli lilly cal d.
inquiry notice 
the trial court held that defendants had established the statute of limitations defense because plaintiffs were on inquiry notice of the facts underlying their complaint more than a year before the complaint was filed.plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred in holding that inquiry notice rather than actual notice applied to plaintiffs claims.
state claims 
plaintiffs complaint alleged claims under corporations code sections,and,among other claims.those claims are governed by the statute of limitations in corporations code section,which requires,in relevant part,that an action be brought before the expiration of one year after the discovery by the plaintiff of the facts constituting the violation,
the parties agree that no published california case has yet addressed whether corporations code section requires actual notice or inquiry notice to trigger the running of the statute of limitations,and our own research has not revealed any such case.several federal courts,however,have held that inquiry notice is sufficient to trigger the limitations period under section.kramas security gas oil,cir,holding that the plaintiff should have been aware of alleged violations of securities laws more than one year before filing suit,and claims based on those violations were therefore time barred rochambeau brent exploration,plaintiff claim that he discovered facts constituting violation within one year of filing suit created an issue of fact precluding summary judgment levine diamanthuset,reversed on other grounds cir.
following these federal cases,the trial court held that inquiry notice had triggered the running of the statute of limitations more than one year before plaintiffs filed their complaint,and the complaint was therefore time barred.
plaintiffs note that corporations code section,setting the statute of limitations for actions brought under section,contains language identical to that of section.such an action must be brought within one year after the discovery by the plaintiff of the facts constituting such violation,subd.a.one california court has held that the statute of limitations under section does not begin to run until the plaintiff has actual knowledge of the facts that are the bases for the suit,and mere inquiry notice is not enough.see eisenbaum western energy resources,d.plaintiffs urge us to follow eisenbaum rather than the federal cases applying section.
the standards we employ in interpreting statutes of limitation are well established.our function,as with the construction of any statute,is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.in the first instance,we look to the plain meaning of the statutory language.if further analysis is necessary,we apply a reasonable and commonsense interpretation,avoiding absurdity.citations.we also consider the legislative purpose and public policy particularly relevant to statutes of limitation.in general,the legislative purpose behind such statutes is to prevent plaintiffs from asserting stale claims.at the same time,public policy favors the resolution of claims on the merits.therefore,in ascertaining a limitations period,we must strike a balance between the public policy favoring extinction of stale claims and that favoring resolution of disputes on their merits.citation.debro los angeles raiders th,d debro.
the issue in debro,supra,th,d,was the meaning of the word discovery in the context of government code section,subdivision a,a civil action under section may not be filed more than three years after the date of discovery by the official of the state or political subdivision charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances.debro,supra,th at,d the court noted,the term discovery is not foreign to california statutes of limitation.long before the legislature used that term in government code section,it was interpreted by california connection with the limitations period for causes of action based on common law fraud and mistake.code civ,subd.d.id.at,d.
code of civil procedure section,subdivision d,includes common law fraud among the causes of action that must be asserted within three years.under that provision,the cause of action for fraud does not thus the limitations period does not start to run until the discovery,by the aggrieved party,of the facts constituting the fraud.code civ,subd.d.the purpose of this provision is to promote the resolution of claims on the merits.since fraud by its nature is often concealed from the victim,the provision protects fraud victims from having the limitations period run before they are even aware of the fraud.on the other hand,if the term discovery were viewed too literally,requiring awareness of every fact necessary for a fraud claim,a plaintiff could unduly delay the commencement of litigation by asserting ignorance of the ultimate fact of fraud.accordingly,we have long interpreted code of civil procedure section to commence upon the discovery by the aggrieved party of the fraud or facts that would lead a reasonably prudent person to suspect fraud.miller bechtel cal d,miller.
we conclude it is appropriate to ascribe the same meaning to the term discovery in the context of government code section,subdivision a.as with fraud claims under code of civil procedure section,this interpretation balances the policy of avoiding stale lawsuits with the policy of providing a reasonable time for a plaintiff to discover a false claim.furthermore,our interpretation is consistent with the tenets of civil code section,which reads every person who has actual notice of circumstances sufficient to put a prudent man upon inquiry as to a particular fact,has constructive notice of the fact itself in all cases in which,by prosecuting such inquiry,he might have learned such fact.italics added.consequently,circumstances which put a reasonable person on inquiry of a false claim are constructive notice of the false claim itself.debro,supra,th at,d.
the court in eisenbaum,supra,d,held that actual notice was required to trigger the limitations period under corporations code section for two reasons.first,the case involved claims against a fiduciary.the court noted,where a fiduciary obligation is present,the courts have recognized a postponement of the accrual of the cause of action until the beneficiary has knowledge or notice of the act constituting a breach of fidelity.citations.eisenbaum,supra,d at.however,the court also based its ruling on the language of the statute.the court explained the critical focus here is found in the language of the section,subdivision a,which requires discovery of the facts.italics added.the statute requires eisenbaum actual knowledge of the facts before the statute commences to run fn.omitted.by its plain language,the statute requires actual knowledge,not just inquiry notice.this conclusion is buttressed by a comparison of the language of section which establishes a statute of limitations for fraud liability imposed upon certain persons who expertise a prospectus.this latter section expressly mandates a limitation after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence,italics added.here the statute of limitations requires the party wronged to have actual notice of the illegality before the one year begins to run eisenbaum,supra,d at.as the court recognized in grace,dna plant technology cir holding that under section,the clock starts running on the statute of limitations when the plaintiff has inquiry notice of the alleged misconduct,the eisenbaum court discussion of inquiry notice was dicta.grace,dna plant technology,supra,at,fn.
plaintiffs argue that no rationale exists for treating the identical language of corporations code sections and differently because w hen legislation has been judicially construed and a subsequent statute on a similar subject uses identical or substantially similar language,the usual presumption is that the legislature intended the same construction people lopez cal th,d.although we agree with this general statement of the law,we find it does not apply to the issue before us in the way plaintiffs request.
the principle stated in lopez,supra,cal th,d,applies when the legislature has enacted a subsequent statute using the same or substantially similar language.corporations code sections and,however,were both enacted as part of the same legislation.stats.both statutes,however,postdated other statutes of limitations that included the term discovery and that had been judicially construed as establishing an inquiry notice standard,code civ,subd.d,subd.c.as the court stated in debro los angeles raiders,supra,th at,d,given the legislature presumed understanding of the judicial interpretation of the term discovery in other statutes of limitation,it is reasonable to assume that it would have used a word other than discovery if it intended for the limitations period to commence only upon actual knowledge of a violation.citation.we conclude that inquiry notice is sufficient to trigger the running of the limitations period under section.
federal claims 
plaintiffs claims under the securities act of are governed by the statute of limitations set forth in one year after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission,or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence and i n no event more than three years after the sale.that statute by its terms incorporates an inquiry notice standard.
sham pleading doctrine 
allegations in the original and amended complaints 
plaintiffs original complaint alleged in paragraphs and that d efendants withheld scientific and clinical knowledge that esterom was not detected in the blood or urine of patients and that w hen plaintiffs discovered that entropin had omitted to disclose material information concerning the absorption of esterom,plaintiffs contacted counsel and began an investigation.other paragraphs of the complaint contained similar statements.
defendants argued that these allegations constituted binding admissions that,when connected to each other and the undisputed fact of the website abstract,established an absolute defense.in granting defendants motion for summary judgment,the trial court ruled that plaintiffs intent in filing their first amended complaint was to avoid defendants earlier summary judgment motion by omitting harmful material allegations.the trial court therefore considered the allegations of the original complaint in ruling on the motion for summary judgment.
plaintiffs now contend that the trial court erred in applying the sham pleading doctrine for two reasons.plaintiffs claim that those allegations were the result of incomplete information at the inception of their lawsuit and were inartful conclusions of their attorney,as to which their attorney later provided a satisfactory explanation.plaintiffs also claim that the allegations of the original complaint were ambiguous and inconclusive,and the trial court erred in treating them as binding admissions.because,as we discuss below,we find plaintiffs first argument persuasive,we need not address the second argument that the original pleading was ambiguous.
declaration in support of amended complaint 
plaintiffs attorney,laurence rosen,provided a declaration in support of the amended complaint explaining the allegations of the original complaint and the reasons for the amendment.
specifically,rosen declaration stated 
ever since the filing of the original complaint in connection with the matter on january,i have maintained an ongoing investigation of the facts and circumstances of this case,in order to better comprehend the volume and complexity of the issues involved.
understanding this case entailed highly technical inquiries into the nature and structure of the drug esterom,the methodology of the preclinical and clinical trials,the validity of the ways in which the conclusions were drawn regarding the clinical trials,the statistical significance of the findings,the problems associated with the phase iiia and phase trials,and other matters.i was able to gather much of the needed information through the careful review of documents produced in discovery as well as through interviews of third parties and working closely with an expert on drug development and commercialization.
from my investigation,i have come to the realization that certain facts and allegations contained in the original complaint would need to be supplemented and clarified with additional facts and supporting bases,such that the plaintiff class may properly present the full gamut of their claims.
rosen stated that his investigation had revealed,among other things,that defendants had failed to conduct pharmacokinetic tests,in contravention of fda instructions,and that defendants claims in their reports of the results of phase ii trials were false and misleading.moreover,rosen had learned that the phase iii trials had suffered from a series of setbacks such that defendants knew that the study results might be seriously compromised and the phase iiia study would likely not be able to serve as one of the two adequate and well controlled studies needed to support a new drug application.in addition,rosen stated that he had learned that defendants misrepresented the current stage of development of esterom.the amended complaint incorporated this new information as the basis for the claims.
both the original complaint and the amended complaints alleged that plaintiffs were completely unaware of defendants wrongdoing during the entire class period from august,through september,and that they diligently filed this complaint less than one year after discovery of defendants violations.
moreover,in response to defendants motion for summary judgment,rosen provided an additional declaration.rosen stated that he was first contacted by an investor in november.in december,rosen discovered through his investigation that only about of test subjects tested positive for esterom in their blood and urine in the phase ii clinical trials.the source of his information was an individual with personal knowledge of the phase ii clinical trial.he stated that he initially believed this fact was evidence that entropin management knew that esterom was not absorbed,and he therefore included paragraphs and in the complaint to establish defendants scienter.italics omitted.
rosen stated that after filing the original complaint in january,he engaged a drug development expert.the expert reviewed the website abstract and advised rosen that the blood and urine data were inconclusive.rosen accordingly moved to amend the complaint to include broader allegations in place of the original language.the amended complaint stated,defendants withheld facts evidencing that their claims of esterom efficacy in the phase ii trials was misleading,and added a list of specific wrongful acts and omissions,including the fact that defendants had withheld the significance of and precise details concerning the blood and urine data.
the sham pleading doctrine 
under the sham pleading doctrine,plaintiffs are precluded from amending complaints to omit harmful allegations,without explanation,from previous complaints to avoid attacks raised in demurrers or motions for summary judgment.see hendy losse cal d,d,affirming an order sustaining defendants demurrer without leave to amend when the plaintiff filed an amended complaint omitting harmful allegations from the original unverified complaint see also colapinto county of riverside d.colapinto if a party files an amended complaint and attempts to avoid the defects of the original complaint by either omitting facts which made the previous complaint defective or by adding facts inconsistent with those of previous pleadings,the court may take judicial notice of prior pleadings and may disregard any inconsistent allegations.a noted commentator has explained,allegations in the original pleading that rendered it vulnerable to demurrer or other attack can not simply be omitted without explanation in the amended pleading.the policy against sham pleadings requires the pleader to explain satisfactorily any such omission.weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group.
thus,superseded pleadings may be used at trial as admissions against interest however,the party who made the pleadings must be allowed to explain the changes.see city of pleasant hill first baptist church d.this general rule usually precludes summary judgment that relies on a superseded pleading.see kirby albert seeno construction th,d see also blain doctor d.a n unexplained suppression of the original destructive allegation will not,in the words of lady macbeth,wash out the damned spot.the sham pleading doctrine is not intended to prevent honest complainants from correcting erroneous allegations or to prevent correction of ambiguous facts.witkin,cal.procedure ed.amendment of pleadings.instead,it is intended to enable courts to prevent an abuse of process.amid hawthorne community medical group,supra,d at.
the sham pleading doctrine does not apply 
here,the sham pleading doctrine does not apply because rosen offered a plausible explanation for the amendment,that he had erred in relying on the failure to disclose the blood and urine data as the basis for the complaint because further discovery and consultation with experts had shown that such data was inconclusive.even entropin chairman and former chief executive officer,higgins bailey,testified in a deposition that he drew no conclusions from the data showing that esterom was not detected in the blood or urine of the clinical subjects.moreover,the thrust of both the original and amended pleadings was that defendants wrongful conduct was intended to promote the sale of entropin securities,and that such conduct continued until september.the complaint was not based solely on the concealment of the blood and urine data,but also included allegations that,among other things,defendants had misrepresented that esterom demonstrated statistically significant improvement for patients as compared to a placebo in the phase ii clinical trials defendants failed to disclose to potential investors that the statistical analysis of the phase ii study did not conform to acceptable statistical practice or that the phase ii study was knowingly defective and would have to be repeated defendants failed to disclose that entropin had not performed the pk tests essential for determining how esterom is absorbed,metabolized,and excreted by the body,even though the fda had repeatedly requested such tests,and defendant could not develop esterom as a commercially viable product without such tests defendants misrepresented that entropin would file an nda with the fda in,when in fact entropin could not file an nda without first performing the pk tests,which did not take place until and defendants misrepresented repeatedly that the phase ii study had shown that esterom was effective and that entropin was close to achieving fda approval of the product.in summary,plaintiffs alleged that defendants fraudulently sold securities although they knew or should have known that entropin would never complete the phase iii trials or obtain fda approval to market esterom.
in kirby albert seeno construction,supra,th,d,the court stated,s ummary judgment should not be based on tacit admissions or fragmentary and equivocal concessions,which are contradicted by other credible evidence.citation.defendant asks us to give conclusive effect to an ambiguous statement in an unverified complaint and to ignore the explanation of the statement contained in deposition testimony taken under oath when the facts submitted in opposition to a summary judgment motion indicate the existence of a material factual issue,summary judgment should not be entered based on mistaken legal conclusions in the complaint.citation.summary judgment is also inappropriate where the opposing party submits evidence indicating that a mistake was made.citation.id.at,d 
here,plaintiffs have provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that a mistake was made in drafting the original pleading.we therefore conclude that the trial court erred in disregarding the allegations of the amended complaint and granting summary judgment on the basis of the sham pleading doctrine.
website posting as basis for inquiry notice 
the trial court ruled that entropin disclosure of the blood and urine data on its website in was sufficient to put plaintiffs on inquiry notice of their claims against defendants,and the statute of limitations therefore began to run more than two years before plaintiffs filed their original complaint.
inquiry notice arises in a securities action when circumstances suggest to an investor of ordinary intelligence the possibility that he has been defrauded.dodds cigna securities,cir.in the vernacular of the securities laws,s uch circumstances are often analogized to storm warnings,citing cook avien,cir.storm warnings may be found whenever there are any financial,legal,or other data,such as public disclosures in the media about the financial condition of the corporation that would tend to alert a reasonable person to the likelihood of fraud.in re infonet services.securities litigation d.

the ninth circuit generally views the question of when a reasonably diligent investor should have discovered a claim as one appropriate for the factfinder to determine after trial rather than one for a judge to decide as a matter of law on summary judgment.luksch latham,see also mosesian peat,marwick,mitchell cir,the question of what a reasonably prudent investor should have known is particularly suited to a jury determination.courts in other circuits have stated similar views.see,young lepone cir,whether storm warnings were sufficient to place an investor on inquiry notice should be determined as a matter of law only when the underlying facts are either admitted or undisputed in re lupron marketing and sales practices lit.d,whether a plaintiff knew or should have known of an injury so as to trigger the running of a statute of limitations is,with rare exception,a jury issue.
the defendants bear the initial burden of showing the existence of storm warnings.citation.once the defendants establish the existence of storm warnings,the burden shifts to the plaintiffs to show that they exercised reasonable diligence,but were unable to discover their injuries.citation.if the plaintiffs duty to exercise due diligence is triggered,the plaintiffs are held to have constructive notice of all facts that could have been learned through diligent investigation during the limitations period.citations.in re exxon mobil.securities litigation,d.
california law takes a very similar view of the requirement of reasonable diligence,see,hobart hobart estate cal d,when the facts are susceptible to opposing inferences,whether a party has notice of circumstances sufficient to put a prudent man upon inquiry as to a particular fact,and whether by prosecuting such inquiry,he might have learned such fact,are themselves questions of fact to be determined by the jury or the trial court,and california courts similarly view determination of the issue as a question of fact usually to be decided by the trier of fact.see,april enterprises,kttv d.w hether the plaintiff exercised reasonable diligence is a question of fact for the court or jury to decide.
here,the trial court ruled in effect that posting information on the company website and referring potential investors to that website for general information was sufficient,as a matter of law,to establish inquiry notice.
whether merely referring investors to a company website for general information is sufficient to establish inquiry notice as a matter of law as to all information available on that website is a question of first impression in this state.indeed,our research revealed only one federal case that addressed a similar contention,and that case concluded that issues of fact precluded summary judgment on the issue of notice.medimatch,lucent technologies d medimatch.
