the securities and exchange commission permanently barred gary kornman from association with any broker,dealer,or investment adviser pursuant to section b of the securities and exchange act of and section f of the investment advisers act of.kornman challenges the commission decision to bar his association as an investment adviser on two principal grounds first,there was not substantial evidence in the record to support the finding that he was an investment adviser at the time of the alleged misconduct,and,second,the commission abused its discretion by giving inadequate consideration to mitigating factors and to whether lesser sanctions would serve the public interest.the court review of the commission remedial decisions is deferential,see horning sec,and we deny the petition.
in december,kornman was indicted in the northern district of texas,on two counts of securities fraud involving alleged insider trading,one count of providing false statements to the commission,and one count of obstruction of justice.he entered a plea to one count of making a false statement in violation of,for which he could have been sentenced to five years imprisonment,followed by three years supervised release,and ordered to pay a fine,to make restitution,and to pay any costs of incarceration and supervision.as part of his plea agreement kornman stipulated in a factual resume that during a telephone conversation with commission investigators on october,he falsely stated that he did not know who possessed trading authority over the brokerage account for a hedge fund through which he conducted trading activity in publicly traded stock.he further stipulated that he knew that he personally possessed that authority.factual resume.his stipulation continued in addition,the defendant made the statement intentionally,knowing that it was false.further,the statement was material.finally,the defendant made the false statement for the purpose of misleading the securities and exchange commission in its investigation into his trading activity.id.
on july,the district court sentenced kornman to two years supervised probation and ordered him to pay a fine of,the amount the government claimed was unjust enrichment from insider trading,along with a special assessment.the district court dismissed the remaining counts upon motion of the united states.
on july,the commission instituted administrative proceedings based on three allegations by the division of enforcement division in response,kornman admitted he owned an ownership interest in heritage security corporation and was a registered representative of it he held series and securities licenses and he controlled a limited liability company and had participated in trades for two funds.answer to corrected order instituting administrative proceedings.he also admitted pleading guilty to making a single false statement,and that a factual resume accompanied his plea agreement,the content of which speaks for itself.id.at.he denied,however,any implication that his statement to the commission attorneys during the october,telephone call interfered with their investigation or otherwise affected any investor.id.additionally,he argued that mitigating factors required rejection in whole or in part of the request for relief and raised various affirmative defenses,including double jeopardy.
the division moved for summary disposition pursuant to rule of the commission rules of practice.it attached eleven exhibits to the motion relating to kornman business associations and his criminal conviction citing commission precedent that summary disposition was well suited to proceedings based on a respondent criminal conviction particularly in light of commission precedent not permit ting criminal convictions to be collaterally attacked in its administrative proceedings,jose zollino,release,wl at,the division argued that a permanent bar on association should be imposed in light of kornman admissions of his association with the heritage security corporation,a,and of his control of heritage advisory group,a limited liability company that managed two funds,and the evidence the hedge funds were in good standing through at least june.the division argued that the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the evidence was that kornman continued to act as a through the heritage security corporation and as an investment adviser,for compensation,through his association with the heritage advisory group at the time of the october,telephone conversation with commission investigators when he falsely denied knowing who managed one of the hedge fund portfolios.consistent with the factors set forth in steadman sec,cir,the division argued that in view of his conviction it was in the public interest to impose a permanent bar.
kornman filed an opposition.he argued that he had a statutory right to a hearing and that discovery was necessary regarding the conduct of the commission staff involved in the october,telephone call he asserted that he was no longer associated with a broker or dealer at the time of his conviction and that he was no longer acting as or associated with an investment adviser for compensation at the time of the telephone conversation.he also argued,in view of evidence in mitigation,that the division had failed to show that no lesser sanction than a permanent bar would satisfy the public interest.kornman attached various documents to his opposition,including a partial transcript of the october,telephone call and letters attesting to his good character he also attached his affidavit admitting the underlying conduct,expressing regret for his conduct,accepting full responsibility for the misconduct during the telephone call,and promising not to repeat anything of the sort in the future,kornman aff.the division responded that kornman requests for discovery to present mitigating circumstances were irrelevant and sought to relitigate facts previously established in the criminal record,and that his ethical attacks on the commission investigators were baseless and inaccurate,as evidenced in the complete transcript of the telephone call,which the division attached as exhibit 
an administrative law judge alj granted the division motion for summary disposition and permanently barred kornman from association with any or investment adviser,based on his conviction for violating.gary kornman,release,sec docket,initial decision.the alj found the evidence showed that kornman was associated with heritage securities corporation,a registered from to october,and that he was associated with the heritage advisory group,a limited liability company that was the general partner of two hedge capital partners i,and heritage capital opportunities fund i,see supra note,exs.at,at.the alj also found that the hedge funds respective and private offering memoranda included provisions for payment of fees for managing the hedge funds portfolios.see,exs.at,at.further,the alj found that the certificates by the secretary of the state of delaware showed the hedge funds were still in existence as of june.see,exs.the alj noted kornman does not take issue with this material fact.in fact,he avoids doing so by stating obliquely,nothing in the record suggests that trades of heritage advisory services in the open market did not cease before the telephone call at issue.opposition at.initial decision at.the alj rejected kornman legal defenses,including double jeopardy,and concluded that a permanent bar was required because kornman conviction involved dishonesty and opportunities for dishonesty recur constantly in the securities industry.id.at.
kornman petitioned for review by the commission on several grounds,including he had been denied his statutory right to a hearing because the alj had failed to take as true all the facts in his pleadings,specifically his vow not to repeat his misconduct the alj had failed to review the sufficiency of evidence supposedly reflecting that,at the time of the october,telephone call at issue,kornman or any entity with which he was associated was actually for compensation engage ing sic in the business of advising others regarding securities investments,pet.for review at and a permanent bar was inappropriate in view of the evidence in mitigation,including that this was a solitary blemish on his business activities over three decades.the division opposed the petition and attached the twelve exhibits that were before the alj.
upon independent review of the disputed record evidence,the commission concluded it was in the public interest to permanently bar kornman from association with any broker,dealer,or investment adviser.gary kornman,release at,wl,decision.the commission affirmed that under section b a of the exchange act and section f of the advisers act,the relevant date for purposes of its jurisdiction with regard to the time of the alleged misconduct was october,the day on which kornman provided his false statement to commission investigators.id.at.the commission found there was undisputed evidence of kornman status as a and investment adviser,by virtue of his association with the heritage advisory group,when he made the false statement,and thus it had jurisdiction to sanction him upon determining it was in the public interest to do so.the commission noted that t he record,including private offering memoranda from the h edge f unds,reflects that the heritage advisory group served as the general partner to the h edge f unds,managing their investment portfolios and earning fees and other compensation for such services.id.at.referencing the hedge funds quarterly and annual fees that kornman received for managing their portfolios,the commission observed,in responding to kornman challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence that the heritage advisory group was an investment adviser for compensation on october,
kornman provides no evidence for his claim that the h edge f unds ceased operating or receiving these fees by october.to the contrary,certificates from delaware secretary of state show that the hedge funds remained active and in good standing in that state through at least june,and that heritage advisory group remained manager of the h edge f unds as their general partner.
id.at internal quotations omitted.addressing the factors set forth in steadman.at,while noting that its inquiry is a flexible one,and no one factor is dispositive,decision at,the commission concluded 
the conduct underlying kornman conviction was egregious.his conviction was for making a material false statement to a federal official,and he admitted he did so intentionally and for the purpose of misleading our investigation.as we have stated the securities industry presents a great many opportunities for abuse and overreaching,and depends very heavily on the integrity of its participants.indeed,the importance of honesty for a securities professional is so paramount that we have barred individuals even when the conviction was based on dishonest conduct unrelated to securities transactions or securities business.here,the egregiousness of kornman dishonest behavior is compounded because he made his false statement to commission staff during an ongoing investigation into possible insider trading violations.providing information to investigators is important to the effectiveness of the regulatory system,and the information provided must be truthful.we have consistently held that deliberate deception of regulatory authorities justifies the severest of sanctions.
id.at internal citations omitted.the commission also noted his conduct exhibited a high degree of scienter,id.at,referencing his stipulation in the factual resume accompanying his plea.the commission rejected kornman other legal challenges and found inapposite the cases he cited in urging that only a censure should be imposed.kornman petitions for review.
kornman contentions about his right to a hearing and the lack of substantial evidence to support the commission finding that he was an investment adviser at the time of the alleged misconduct present two issues of statutory interpretation.we address them first,before turning to his challenge to the sufficiency of the record evidence before the commission.
section f of the investment advisers act limits the jurisdiction for the commission to issue sanctions related to a party future association as an investment adviser.it provides,in relevant part 
the commission,by order,shall censure or place limitations on the activities of any person associated,seeking to become associated,or,at the time of the alleged misconduct,associated or seeking to become associated with an investment adviser,or suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months or bar any such person from being associated with an investment adviser,if the commission finds,on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing,that such censure,placing of limitations,suspension,or bar is in the public interest 
f emphasis added.an investment adviser is defined as 
any person who,for compensation,engages in the business of advising others,either directly or through publications or writings,as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in,purchasing,or selling securities,or who,for compensation and as part of a regular business,issues or promulgates analyses or reports concerning securities 
the commission interpretation of its authorizing statutes is entitled to deference under the familiar test set forth in chevron,natural res.def.council.where congress has made its intent clear,that is the end of the matter,but if the statute is ambiguous,the court must determine whether the agency interpretation is permissible.id.at see also sec zandford.similarly,the court will defer to an agency reasonable interpretation of its regulations.see auer robbins.
the commission interpreted the phrase on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing in section f of the advisers act,f,to allow summary proceedings.decision at.this is at least a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.rule of the commission rules of practice provides for summary disposition in the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.under rule,a motion for summary disposition may be granted where there is no genuine issue with regard to any material fact and the party making the motion is entitled to a summary disposition as a matter of law.b.the rule also provides that t he facts of the pleadings of the party against whom the motion is made shall be taken as true,except as modified by stipulations or admissions made by that party,by uncontested affidavits,or by facts officially noted.id.a.further,the hearing officer shall deny or defer the motion if it appears that a party,for good cause shown,can not present by affidavit prior to hearing facts essential to justify opposition to the motion.id.b.the commission modeled rule on rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.see jeffrey gibson,rel,sec docket at.
the plain text of section f requires the opportunity for hearing without defining the word hearing.the commission rule reflects a distinction between a hearing on the pleadings and an evidentiary hearing at which witnesses testify and are subject to.see,costle pac.legal,united states storer broad.for example,in weinberger hynson,westcott dunning,the supreme court construed text virtually identical to the advisers act in concluding that the phrase notice and opportunity for hearing to the applicant did not always require an evidentiary hearing because w e can not impute to congress the design of requiring,nor does due process demand,a hearing when it appears conclusively from the applicant pleadings that the application can not succeed.although this court has not previously decided whether the advisers act requires an evidentiary hearing in all cases,seghers sec,it has interpreted similar language in the food drug and cosmetic act,e,not to require an evidentiary hearing where there is no genuine and substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing.john copanos sons,food drug.cir see also crestview parke care ctr.thompson,f d,cir puerto rico aqueduct sewer auth.epa,cir,cert.denied.richard pierce,administrative law treatise,ed.
for these reasons,kornman contention that the plain language requires an evidentiary hearing in all cases is not supportable.in promulgating rule the commission explained that summary disposition would be available in disciplinary cases,although noting that such cases are likely to be less common than in regulatory proceedings because t ypically,enforcement and disciplinary proceedings that reach litigation involve genuine disagreement between the parties as to material facts.rules of practice.however,in later amending rule,the commission acknowledged that in practice m otions for summary dispositions are often made in cases where a respondent has been criminally convicted.adoption of amendments to rules of practice.for example,in john brownson,release,sec docket,wl at july,pet.denied,brownson sec,fed.appx.cir,the commission had stated that s ummary disposition is particularly appropriate where,as here,a respondent has pled guilty to securities fraud.see also supra note.presumably this is so because in most instances the criminal proceeding has resolved the central issue concerning the nature of the alleged misconduct and only the question of the appropriate sanction remains.for certain types of criminal conduct,the commission has warned that only extraordinary mitigating circumstances are likely to affect its determination of the sanction required in the public interest.brownson,sec docket,wl at.
kornman can not successfully deny that he was afforded the opportunity for hearing.the commission informed him in writing of the allegations against him,and he filed a written response to the allegations.he also had the opportunity to challenge the arguments and evidence proffered by the division in moving for summary disposition pursuant to rule,and he did so by filing an opposition and attaching documents.kornman does not suggest he was denied an opportunity to set forth all of his evidence,challenges,and defenses in his pleadings before the alj initial decision and the commission subsequent decision.because the commission proceedings against kornman were based on the record in his criminal case that disposed of the central issue regarding the nature of his alleged misconduct for administrative enforcement purposes,a summary proceeding was appropriate under commission precedent see,brownson,sec docket,wl at capillari,sec docket,wl at.
the commission interpreted the phrase at the time of the alleged misconduct in section f of the advisers act,f,to refer not to kornman conviction,as kornman urged,but to his false statement to commission investigators during the october,telephone call on which his conviction under was based.decision at.this interpretation reflects the plain text of the statute,id.at,and is,in any event,reasonable even if the text is ambiguous,teicher sec.the commission noted that section f refers to the alleged misconduct,not the alleged event as kornman interpretation implied.decision at.the commission also relied on legislative history indicating that congress had enacted the current text to make clear its original intent that misconduct during a past association as well as during a present occasion subjects a person to administrative proceedings and sanctions under the exchange and advisers acts.id.at citing,at the commission pointed to its precedent explaining that to hold otherwise would allow persons who violate the law while employed in the securities business to avoid administrative sanctions simply by leaving the business.john kilpatrick,release,sec docket,wl at may.
the commission properly relied on the ordinary meaning of alleged misconduct,which refers to allegedly unlawful or improper behavior,black law dictionary ed.see limtiaco comacho,gonzales.oregon.so too,it could properly rely on the legislative history,see chevron,at,and on its own precedent interpreting congressional intent.
kornman contention that after his conviction his misconduct was no longer alleged misconduct is nonsensical.resp t br.it would mean no conviction that establishes the central issues regarding the alleged misconduct as violations of law would ever satisfy the statutory text.yet,as the commission noted,congress has authorized the commission to discipline persons who have been convicted of crimes that suggest a lack of fitness to remain in the securities industry.decision at and see e a f.the misconduct thus remains alleged for purposes of the commission enforcement proceedings even after a criminal conviction based on the same underlying conduct.kornman contrary interpretation would undermine congress intent to ensure that past associations are subject to commission authority.
turning to kornman challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,the court not only must uphold the commission legal determinations unless they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,horning,at internal quotations omitted,but it must also treat the commission findings of fact as final if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record,id.substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.consolidated edison nlrb,see steadman sec.
the commission finding that on october,kornman was associated with an investment adviser as the organizer of the heritage advisory group,which managed the portfolios of two hedge funds,is supported by substantial evidence in the record.in responding to the division allegations,kornman admitted that he controlled a limited liability company and had traded for two funds.in opposing summary disposition,he proffered no evidence to contradict either his admissions or the division evidence.the undisputed record evidence before the commission showed that kornman organized the heritage advisory group as a limited liability company,which served as the general partner of the two hedge funds,see supra note,exs,and according to official state records,the two hedge funds remained in good standing at least through june,see id.exs.a status in part dependent upon the funds having paid any state taxes that were due.code ann.tit.the hedge funds private offering memoranda required the payment of quarterly and annual fees for management of the funds portfolios.see supra note,exs.at at.cory childs,a former employee of the heritage advisory group,provided sworn statements describing how kornman managed the portfolios of the two hedge funds at least until june when childs left his job.see,exs.and.
it is true,as kornman points out,that there was no record evidence that either of the hedge funds were still engaged in trading in october.but under rule,which the commission modeled on federal rule of civil procedure,the burden on the division was to proffer evidence to demonstrate why summary disposition was appropriate.to do so the division did not have to proffer evidence of actual trades in october if the evidence proffered sufficed to raise a reasonable inference that kornman continued,for compensation,to manage the funds portfolios.celotex catrett.c.the hedge funds private offering memoranda did not establish a trading schedule.see supra note,exs a.the absence of trading around the time of the october,telephone call would,moreover,be consistent with childs deposition about how kornman managed the hedge funds portfolios kornman would call childs from time to time to make trades for whichever fund had the money at the time there was no set schedule for trading.ex.at,supra note.because the evidence proffered by the division sufficed to support the reasonable inference that the hedge funds remained active until at least june,the burden under rule,as under civil rule,shifted to kornman to proffer evidence that trading had ceased before the october,telephone call.anderson liberty lobby.e.
contrary to kornman contention on brief,there was no record evidence that the heritage advisory group ceased to function for compensation as an investment adviser for the two hedge funds after june.childs described kornman active involvement in managing their portfolios during childs employment,which began in march and ended in june.see supra note,ex.at.nothing in childs sworn statements,or other evidence before the commission,suggested that childs leaving his job was related to the end of kornman active management of the hedge funds portfolios.instead,childs sworn statements indicated that when he left to pursue other interests,he was leaving an ongoing trading operation managed by kornman.the state certificates showing that the hedge funds remained in good standing as of june supported the inference from childs sworn statements that trading continued and kornman continued in his role as the heritage advisory group manager of the funds portfolios.see,exs.in addition,kornman did not deny the ongoing existence of the two hedge funds in his response to the division allegations.similarly,in his affidavit submitted in opposing the division rule motion he did not state that the hedge funds ceased paying him management fees prior to october,or that the funds had ceased to trade by then.the record of the criminal proceedings also did not indicate that he was no longer associated with the heritage advisory group or did not provide,for compensation,investment advice to the hedge funds in october.see,exs.indeed,kornman sworn deposition in confirmed that at least one of the funds was still in existence one of those funds has assets and one basically nothing,ex.at,supra note,and did not state the funds had ceased trading by october.at most,kornman unsworn statement during the october,telephone call indicated that heritage capital partners i,was not in business,but he did not mention,much less resolve,the status of heritage capital opportunities fund i,see,ex.at.
the commission,and the alj,noted that kornman had made assertions that the two hedge funds had ceased trading prior to october but had proffered no evidence to support his assertions.for example,he proffered neither certificates of dissolution of the hedge funds nor evidence of cancellation of the contractual fees,much less quarterly or annual statements documenting the absence of any trades by the hedge funds.moreover,he never claimed that he would be unable to produce documentation to show there was no trading activity by the hedge funds in october until an evidentiary hearing was held.see rule b.given the record evidence,the commission could reasonably find that kornman continued to be associated with an entity that provided investment advice for compensation at the time he made a false statement to commission investigators on october.
kornman contention,then,that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing even in the absence of evidence of a material issue of disputed fact is flawed as a matter of statutory interpretation,as is his interpretation of at the time of the alleged misconduct,and reflects a misunderstanding of the record evidence before the commission.although there may be circumstances when the commission would be required to hold an evidentiary hearing even where there is a criminal conviction involving a willful intent to mislead commission investigators,kornman admissions and the undisputed record evidence allowed the commission to proceed pursuant to rule.kornman,in turn,fails to show that there is not substantial record evidence to support the commission finding that he was an investment adviser on october.
it is a fundamental principle that where congress has entrusted an administrative agency with the responsibility of selecting the means of achieving the statutory policy the relation of remedy to policy is peculiarly a matter for administrative competence.am.power light sec,internal quotations omitted.because of the commission accumulated experience and knowledge,i ts judgment is entitled to the greatest weight.while recognizing that the commission discretion must square with its responsibility,only if the remedy chosen is unwarranted in law or is without justification in fact should a court attempt to intervene.id.at see also horning,at.moreover,the commission is not required to follow any mechanistic formula in determining an appropriate sanction.paz,sec.
the commission concluded that kornman deliberate attempt to deceive commission investigators during an investigation into insider trading indicates a lack of honesty and integrity,as well as a fundamental unfitness to transact business associated with a broker or dealer and to advise clients as a fiduciary.decision at.kornman contends the commission failed to appreciate that not every conviction involving dishonesty requires a permanent bar.he maintains the commission imposed an automatic bar without show ing with particularity the facts and policies that support those sanctions and why less severe action would not serve to protect investors.pet r br.at citing steadman,at emphasis in original.he also faults the commission for not allowing him to present testimony at an evidentiary hearing to rebut the assertion by the division that a less severe sanction would not protect the public.we conclude kornman fails to show either reversal or remand is required.
the commission explained why,as a matter of policy,kornman particular misconduct warranted a bar his conviction indicated his dishonesty was egregious because he admitted it was knowing and intentional,and,moreover,his false statement was made in the course of the commission investigation of wrongdoing in the industry.the commission observed that the importance of honesty for a securities professional is so paramount that the commission has barred individuals even when the conviction was based on dishonest conduct unrelated to securities transactions or securities business.decision at further,the commission noted it has consistently held that deliberate deception of regulatory authorities justifies the severest of sanctions.id the commission acknowledged kornman prior unblemished business record,his regret about making the false statement,his vow not to do so again,and even that he was personally convinced he would not repeat his misconduct.however the commission emphasized that t he securities industry presents a great many opportunities for abuse and overreaching,and depends very heavily on the integrity of its participants.id.at internal quotations omitted.
insofar as kornman contends the commission abused its discretion by imposing an automatic bar because the alj found that a conviction involving dishonesty requires a bar,initial decision at,the commission did not embrace this portion of the alj analysis.instead the commission imposed the bar only after considering the mitigating factors pursuant to an analysis of the steadman factors,at.observing,however,that kornman mitigation arguments were essentially collateral attacks on his conviction,decision at,the commission ruled he was estopped from doing so because the validity of kornman plea was not at issue and he had admitted the materiality of his false statement,a legal ruling kornman does not challenge by pleading guilty to violating,kornman admitted to knowingly and willfully falsif ying a material fact mak ing a materially false statement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the government of the united states.id.a.the commission concluded that because willfulness was not at issue,the exculpatory no doctrine,see united states wiener,cir,was inapplicable,noting as well rejection of the doctrine in brogan.united states,see also id.at ginsburg,concurring.it also could reasonably reject,in view of the criminal record,kornman attempts to minimize the gravity of his false statement as trivial or dilatory in nature and his mental state as less than intentional.
as to other mitigation kornman was years old,winding down his professional career,and had no prior criminal or disciplinary commission explained they did not alleviate its concern that his occupation presented opportunities for future misconduct.the commission was also unpersuaded that,as kornman argued,neither the commission nor the public suffered any harm as a result of his misconduct,given the importance of integrity to the regulatory process.neither,in the commission view,did kornman substantial financial losses mitigate the gravity of his conduct,particularly because the district court in sentencing him had taken into account that a permanent bar would likely be sought in the adm
