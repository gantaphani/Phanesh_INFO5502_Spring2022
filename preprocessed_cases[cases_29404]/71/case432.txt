this appeal involves investors who by purchasing securities took a risk for the purpose of securing an economic advantage but,failing to exercise prudence,instead suffered a loss.plaintiffs claim defendants,sellers of the securities,defrauded them when in fact what plaintiffs had done was to make a bad investment.plaintiffs michael halperin,and donald kern,appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york martin,entered march,granting defendants motion to dismiss their complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
although the district court dismissed the securities fraud complaint in its entirety,plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of only eight of their claims.in a separate summary order filed today,we affirm the dismissal of seven of these eight counts.we write to address an issue in the remaining eighth count that warrants more detailed analysis whether plaintiffs stated a claim that defendants fraudulently misrepresented the future registration of certain securities with the securities and exchange commission sec.
background 
this is a class action suit against three corporations and several individuals who served as officers directors of those corporations.plaintiffs,representing four subclasses of purchasers of stock from defendants,filed their complaint alleging fraud and other wrongful conduct under both state and federal law.
the relationship between the three defendant companies is as follows evision,evision is a public holding company american fronteer financial corporation american fronteer,a subsidiary of evision,is a private corporation engaged in stock brokerage activities and ebanker,ebanker,is a private corporation run by american fronteer under a management agreement.since april evision has owned enough preferred stock in ebanker to cast percent of the votes in the election of ebanker directors,giving evision effective control over ebanker.
plaintiffs claim of fraudulent misrepresentation stems from the issuance by defendants of two offering memoranda for the sale of ebanker securities.on may,fronteer development now ebanker issued a confidential private offering memorandum offering memorandum advertising the sale of debentures,common stock,and warrants exercisable for the purchase of common stock in the future.the offering memorandum acknowledged on the first page and elsewhere that the offered units had not been registered with the sec under the securities act of or with any state securities commission under state securities laws.without such registration,the memo noted,transfer of the shares were subject to restrictions.thus,the memo stated that t here is no public or other market for the units and so investors must expect to retain ownership of the units and bear the economic risks of their investment for an indefinite period.similar warnings appeared throughout the memo.
however,with respect to ebanker future plans,the offering memorandum also stated that 
t he company intends to endeavor to file registration statements with the sec to register the convertible debentures and common stock for resale under the act and under the securities exchange act of as soon as practicable,but in no event sooner than months following the final closing date,and may submit an application to list the convertible debentures and common stock on a national securities exchange.however,there can be no assurance that the company will file a registration statement with the sec or that the sec will declare the registration statement effective or that any listing on a national securities exchange will occur at any time.
on march,the ebanker board of directors authorized another private offering.according to the accompanying memorandum offering memorandum,the units for sale each consisted of one share of common stock and one detachable warrant.in its first few pages,the offering memorandum warned in bold lettering that the units had not been registered with the sec or any state securities commission.this memo contained language virtually identical to the offering memorandum regarding the company intent to endeavor to register its securities for resale under the federal securities laws,observing that there could be no assurance that such registrations will occur.both memos advised potential investors that the units should only be purchased by persons of substantial means who are not dependent upon liquidity in their investment and who could bear its entire loss.
although both memos stated that there could be no assurance that the securities would be registered with the sec,plaintiffs assert,first,that the cautionary language was mere boilerplate and that ebanker viewed registration of its shares as impractical without an initial public offering ipo and that it had no intention of commencing a registration in the absence of an ipo.hence,plaintiffs contend that defendants failure to state unequivocally in the and offering memoranda that registration was contingent on an ipo constituted a material omission and rendered the documents untruthful.
second,plaintiffs declare that ebanker knew an ipo was unlikely,which in turn made registration unlikely.in support of this allegation,they point to a memo addressed to ebanker board of directors that spells out the following obstacles to an ipo of ebanker stock overhang on the market for ebanker shares caused by the number of outstanding warrants the need to register as an investment company under the investment company act of in order to conduct an ipo,which would be a disincentive to institutional investors ebanker investments in foreign securities,which would also be a disincentive to institutional investors overlap of employees between ebanker and american fronteer,another disincentive to institutional investors and difficulty in valuation of ebanker.plaintiffs maintain that ebanker failure to mention these substantial impediments in the and offering memoranda constituted fraud.
