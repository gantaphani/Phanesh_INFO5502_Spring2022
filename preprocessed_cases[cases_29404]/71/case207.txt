in these two civil enforcement actions for securities fraud brought,respectively,by the commodity futures trading commission cftc and the securities exchange commission sec against defendants stephen walsh and paul greenwood,et,and consolidated by this court for appeal various entities that were defrauded by the defendants appeal from a march,order order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,george daniels,judge,approving initial pro rata distributions on april,totaling recovered from defendants and associated entities by receiver robb evans associates llc robb evans or the receiver,in accordance with the plan proposed by the receiver plan or receiver proposed initial distribution plan.interested parties appellants cross appellees employee welfare benefit association trusts i,ii,and iii,et collectively,the benefits group or group,contend principally that the district court should have rejected the proposed pro rata distributions because under the plan,fraud victims who chose allegedly safer investments fare no better than victims whose investments were riskier.interested party appellee cross appellant kern county employees retirement association kcera contends that the district court should have rejected the proposed plan because it did not provide an adjustment for inflation to compensate investors.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in approving the receiver plan,and we therefore affirm the order.
background 
the factual background,for purposes of these appeals,is undisputed.for more than years,beginning prior to,defendants conducted their business which offered various investment vehicles for pursuing an index arbitrage strategy as a ponzi scheme.defendants issued fraudulent account statements to their investors,withdrew invested moneys in order to spend lavishly on themselves,and funded investor withdrawals with moneys received from other investors when there were no earnings.see united states greenwood,cr,transcript of guilty plea of paul greenwood,july,greenwood plea allocution tr,at.in pleading guilty to securities fraud,wire fraud,conspiracy to commit those offenses,commodities fraud,and money laundering see id.at,greenwood admitted,inter alia,as follows 
q w hat is it that you cheated the investors in w hat is it that you did make return on 
on all the money that was lost in investments that were made and did produce the returns that we expected them to produce and in money that we took out personally for basically our own use.
q.that is,you treated these partnerships as your own personal bank account 
and you drew as you wished 
q.what is it that you reported to your investors 
well,we treated the money that we took out as a loan so we would 
on your own books,you mean 
on the books of yes,yes.so we would report to the investors the same rate of return that we earned on the index arbitrage trading.
and that was simply flatly untrue 
q.that is,you did not make that money that you reported to investors that you made 
that correct.
and none of your investors asked for the money 
a.when they asked for the money we would give them money back so in some sense 
q.so this was a ponzi scheme,as it is loosely called 
well,sort of,because we actually had 
q.you were using other monies to make up for what you could give 
that correct.
but,of course,you never could make it up entirely 
well,initially we thought we could and as time went on the hole got bigger and bigger and at a point we could.
well,if you were taking money out for yourselves,you could never make it up,right,unless you made huge profits 
that correct.
and you knew that from the beginning,if you were taking it for personal use 
early on after the partnership was established and the investors had given us the money,it became apparent we could give back the money we were taking out.
greenwood plea allocution tr.
on february,the cftc and the sec commenced the present civil enforcement actions against greenwood,walsh,and their related entities,alleging violations of various federal securities laws,seeking disgorgement of the proceeds of the frauds and restitution for the fraud victims,and obtaining a preliminary injunction enjoining any diversion of defendants assets.the court appointed robb evans as temporary receiver of the defendants assets on that date and continued its appointment as receiver in an order entered in may.the following descriptions of the fraudulent scheme are taken largely from reports to the district court by robb evans in may report or receiver report and june report or receiver report,which the parties to these appeals have not disputed.
details of the fraud 
greenwood and walsh created several entities to offer investment vehicles to the pension funds or investment arms of governmental entities and other large institutions.the greenwood and walsh entities included defendant westridge capital management,westridge,a delaware corporation defendant wg trading company lp wgtc,a delaware limited partnership and defendant wg trading investors,lp wgti,a delaware limited partnership that was itself a limited partner in wgtc.greenwood and walsh were the managing general partners of wgtc and wgti.
greenwood and walsh represented to potential investors that westridge,a registered investment adviser regulated by the sec,provided various investment vehicles for pursuing an s p index arbitrage strategy that they called an enhanced equity index program,and which they described as having outperformed the s p.see receiver report at.westridge was to hold approximately of each investor cash investment in reserve to support a leveraged futures position and the investor would direct the remaining of its cash investment to another affiliated entity,usually either wgtc or wgti.id.at.by choosing the former,the investor would become a limited partner in wgtc,a that was subject to independent audits and was regulated by,inter alia,the sec,the financial industry regulatory authority finra,and the cftc.see id.wgtc was engaged primarily in index arbitrage trading strategies seeking profit opportunities by exploring relationships among stock index futures contracts,stock market indexes upon which the futures contracts were based,the stocks included in the indexes,and the cost interest expense and benefits dividend income of carrying the instruments.id.at.
alternatively,the investor could direct the of its cash investment to wgti,a nonpublic entity that was not subject to either independent audits or government regulation,and that issued senior promissory notes.see report at.an investor could become a wgti noteholder either directly by purchasing those notes or indirectly by purchasing shares in westridge capital management enhancement funds,a british virgin islands company that would purchase the wgti promissory notes.see id.prospective wgti investors were told that the only business of wgti is to invest in wgtc id.at,and that the proceeds of the senior promissory notes issued by wgti would be sent to wgtc id.further,prospective investors in wgti were told that their returns would be indexed to the returns of the limited partners of wgtc 
for purposes of determining the interest accruing and payable on the promissory notes,the index was the performance of a hypothetical investment equal in amounts to the principal of the promissory notes invested in the limited partnership interest of wgtc.
id.at.thus,wgti was to earn money when wgtc trading strategies were successful,and investors in wgti were told they would profit as wgtc did.consistent with these representations as to the calculation of earnings,the returns of investments in wgti were computed exactly the same as that in wgtc.id.
nonetheless,wgti investors were also assured that,as senior promissory note holders,their returns would not match those of the wgtc limited partners if wgtc returns were negative.the wgti promissory notes,after describing the indexing process as indicated above,
provided that,notwithstanding the actual performance of an investment in a limited partnership interest in the partnership,the index shall not be less than zero.
benefits group objection to the receiver motion for approval of receiver proposed initial distribution plan objection to receiver plan,exhibit b emphasis ours.in other words,the return that was promised to the wgti noteholders would reflect any positive returns generated by wgtc,but would not reflect any negative returns group brief on appeal at,i,the wgti noteholders would not lose their investments even if wgtc lost money.
although wgtc and wgti had been created as two separate limited partnerships and were presented to their investors as two entities receiver report at,wgtc and wgti in reality were financially inseparable id.the receiver noted,inter alia,that 
wgtc received funds from wgti investors.
wgtc made payments to or for wgti investors.
wgtc investors received funds from wgti.
wgtc investors made payments to wgti.
id.at.ironically,wgtc and wgti had to be operated as a single entity to support the myth that they were entities id.at,because from january,onward,neither entity could have survived without the financial support of investor funds raised by the other id.at see,id.at when wgtc was short of funds,wgti advanced the funds to wgtc receiver report at wgti paid million to a limited partner of wgtc on july,as the wgtc balance of funds available for immediate use at july,was only approximately million.the receiver reported that wgtc and wgti had 
a long history of com m ingling funds,operating with utter disregard for corporate governance,and employing fraudulent accounting practices in an apparent attempt to conceal the true financial condition of the entities from investors,potential investors and,in the case of wgtc,its regulators.
report at see also report at charting hundreds of millions of dollars that investors had directed to wgtc that were in fact received by wgti and were only later sent on to wgtc,and charting hundreds of millions of dollars that wgti paid to wgtc investors,which wgtc did not repay to wgti for many weeks.
while greenwood and walsh,over the life of the fraud,consistently reported to investors that their investments had made gains,the investment entities did not have the earnings they reported see,greenwood plea allocution tr.and were in fact undercapitalized as capital accounts were debited for ordinary losses or expenses see,report at.for example,when wgtc lost approximately million from its investments in and financing of a company called signal apparel company of which greenwood and walsh were the directors see id.at,wgtc charged that loss against wgti capital account in wgtc see report at.when wgtc made employee advances to or for greenwood and walsh id,wgtc also charged those sums to wgti capital account,thereby reducing wgti investment in wgtc see id.at.
between january,and october,wgtc advances to greenwood and walsh totaled approximately million.see report at.in addition,wgti,from,paid a company owned by greenwood wife an estimated million for the maintenance of the company acre horse farm in brewster,new york,and its hunter ponies.see exhibit tab to report.in addition,greenwood and walsh had a wgtc employee transfer money ultimately totaling hundreds of millions of dollars directly from wgti to the personal bank accounts of greenwood and walsh and to third parties to cover their personal expenditures.the personal expenses funded by these transfers included payments to walsh totaling nearly million see report at more than million for greenwood wife farm see exhibit tab to report and greenwood purchase,for more than million,of a collection of teddy bears see report at.
greenwood and walsh eventually signed promissory notes to reflect the moneys transferred from wgti to their personal bank accounts.see report at.at the time of the receiver first report to the district court,the outstanding notes receivable due from greenwood and walsh to wgti totaled more than a half billion dollars.id.
given the entities investment losses and the diversion of investment funds to the personal accounts of greenwood and walsh,defendants,in order to report to investors that there were gains,used newly invested money to meet other investors withdrawal requests.for example,between january,and february,wgti had income of million but paid interest,distributions,operating expenses,and other payments totaling to million during that same time period t he cash shortfall during this period was financed by either wgtc or wgti current investors.receiver report at.the shortfall of net earnings allocations to wgtc and wgti investors totaled approximately million as of,and could not have been paid without raising additional capital from investors.receiver report at.
when the fraudulent scheme unraveled,defrauded investors asserted claims totaling some billion.see report at.by the time of the proposed initial distribution,the claims total reflecting investors investments minus their withdrawals had been reduced to approximately million.
b.the receiver plan for initial distributions 
the district court approved a claims administration procedure in which a investors and other interested persons would be invited to submit to the court proposals for the distribution of money collected by the receiver from defendants and their associated entities b the cftc and the sec would then be allowed to express their views as to an appropriate distribution plan and c the receiver would then submit its distribution plan.the receiver gave investors and other interested persons notice of this procedure.in october,distribution proposals were received from numerous defrauded investors only two investor proposals are at issue on these appeals.
the benefits group,comprising the limited partners in wgtc who were not associated with greenwood and walsh,proposed that since the group members capital accounts,as shown in wgtc records when the receiver was appointed,totaled some million,it would be fair and reasonable for the receiver to distribute that sum to the group see group objection to receiver plan at describing group october proposal leaving only some million for the wgti investors.alternatively,the group argued that the distributions should not be pro rata and that larger shares should be distributed to the group than to investors in the unregulated wgti,in order to reward the group for its prudence in investing in a regulated entity referred to as the requested prudence premium and in order not to encourage those who invested in unregulated entities by compensating them the same as investors who sought safer investments described as avoiding the moral hazard of causing persons who deliberately minimize their risks to subsidize persons who deliberately take risks.id.at.
kcera proposed that the receiver use a constant dollar approach,which would distribute larger shares to earlier investors than to more recent investors in order to account for inflation.
in december,the cftc and the sec jointly submitted a recommendation to the district court,urging it to adopt at least for the initial distribution of a net investment pro rata distribution plan.commodity futures trading commission and securities and exchange commission joint notice of recommendation for a distribution plan recommendation or joint recommendation at.after quoting some of greenwood plea allocution admissions see recommendation at,the joint recommendation stated that 
a qualitative analysis of the totality of the circumstances shows that greenwood and walsh fraud had the elements of a ponzi scheme.thus,the use of a net investment,distribution plan is especially appropriate under such circumstances.see sec credit bancorp,cir affirming use of pro rata distribution plan where earlier investors returns are generated by the influx of fresh capital from unwitting newcomers rather than through legitimate investment activity.
a net investment approach looks solely at dollars in and dollars out and makes distribution to the victims based on their net contributions.it also demands a return of funds from those investors who received more funds than they contributed,ponzi winners,either by offsets or clawback actions against fully redeemed investors.
recommendation at see also id.at.noting that the receiver had initiated clawback actions against alleged ponzi winners.
the cftc and the sec stated that their own investigations had confirmed the accuracy of the receiver and reports to the court analyzing the evidence as to defendants fraud.see recommendation at.noting that the fraud was massive in scope id.at and involved commingling of the accounts and assets of wgtc and wgti that could not be reliably unraveled see id.at the defendants records are unreliable to substantiate customer claims for profits and inadequate to identify the owners of contracts with losses due to the massive fraud,improper commingling,and intentionally deceptive accounting employed by walsh and greenwood,the agencies opposed giving distributional preferences to investors in wgtc over investors in wgti 
the evidence in the record shows that substantial commingling occurred and that the funds held in the various entities were transferred,dissipated,diverted,misappropriated and then other investor funds were used to cover up the fraud.these commingled investor funds were dispersed without regard for corporate formalities or distinctions.this scheme resulted in clients not having their funds held or invested where defendants represented they would be held or invested.in fact,the government and receiver investigations uncovered that even as the defendants represented to a client that his or her particular funds would be deposited in wgti account,it was actually deposited in wgtc accounts and.further,it is clear that transactions were run through wgti accounts that were not transactions on behalf of wgti investors and similarly transactions were run through wgtc accounts that are not transactions on behalf of wgtc investors.defendants used both wgti accounts and wgtc accounts as if they were interchangeable.this commingling of funds was part and parcel of the mechanism by which the ponzi scheme to misappropriate clients funds worked.this evidence of substantial commingling militates against any claim that the assets of any entity,including wgtc or wgti,are wholly or substantially intact or that any asset is exclusively an asset of either company.
recommendation at emphases added.
the cftc and the sec also opposed any suggestion that the receiver initial distribution increase investors shares to account for inflation 
the civil agencies believe net investment dollar in,dollar out pro rata distribution plan is the best and most fair approach under the circumstances of this case because it yields a substantial recovery for all investors.some investors have advocated that rather than employing a net investment model,the court should instead implement a constant dollar approach adding an inflation adjuster when calculating an investor distribution.although the use of a constant dollar approach may be appropriate in certain instances,the facts of this matter do not,at the outset,warrant its use here.currently,the receiver has marshaled sufficient assets so that under a pro rata distribution method,it will distribute to each investor approximately of their net contributions or investment.the cftc and sec believe that these funds should be distributed without an inflation adjustment.
the sec and cftc hope,however,that the receiver will be able to obtain additional funds through the liquidation of various assets owned by the defendants and relief defendants,as well as through several clawback actions the receiver has filed.in the event that the receiver acquires funds to distribute in excess of of the net contributions of investors,the court may wish to consider ordering a hybrid approach where future distributions in excess of of the net contributions be sic calculated on a pro rata basis and adjusted to give effect to inflation.
recommendation at footnote omitted.
in january,the receiver submitted its plan to the district court,moving for approval of an initial pro rata distribution of to current wgtc and wgti investors based on each investor net investment at the time the fraud was discovered the motion.these distributions were not to include any interest,earnings,or other compensation based on the time value of money.in this initial distribution,each investor would receive approximately of its net investment.
consistent with the joint recommendation submitted earlier,the cftc and the sec,which noted their duty in these civil enforcement actions to proceed in the best interests of the public and the defrauded investors and to ensure a fair and equitable return of funds to all investors commodity futures trading commission and securities and exchange commission brief in support of receiver proposed initial distribution plan endorsement of receiver plan or endorsement at,supported the receiver proposal 
as set forth in the sec and cftc joint notice of recommendation for a distribution plan,the agencies believe that the most fair and equitable method of distribution of the assets held by the receiver is a net investment pro rata distribution plan.
id.at emphasis added.stating that the receiver proposed distribution squarely meets the agencies goals of distributions that will most closely afford complete relief and would further the salutary purposes of the commodity exchange act and the federal securities laws id,the endorsement stated 
the receiver motion sets forth detailed findings,in pertinent part,that i there was significant and extensive commingling of funds between wgtc and wgti,entities under the control of defendants paul greenwood and stephen walsh and through which the various investors invested funds,and that neither company could have continued to operate without the other ii the investors of wgtc and wgti were similarly situated with respect to their relationship with greenwood and walsh and iii that wgtc and wgti were operated as a ponzi scheme.
id.while reiterating the view that the court might wish to consider having a subsequent distribution make some adjustment for inflation in the event that the total funds recovered by the receiver reached a level exceeding the defrauded investors total net contributions see id.at,the endorsement concluded that the receiver proposal for the initial pro rata distribution without any adjustment for inflation was t he fairest and most reasonable approach id.at.
c.the decision of the district court 
in march,the district court held a hearing at which the receiver,the sec and cftc,and persons interested in the proposed distributions orally presented their views.see hearing transcript,march,hearing tr.the benefits group pursued its contention that persons who invested in regulated entities were entitled to a prudence premium above any pro rata amounts to be distributed to persons who invested in entities that were unaudited and unregulated.see,id.at.the group contended that investors in wgtc were not situated similarly to investors in wgti because wgtc was regulated and wgti was not that wgtc had been managed largely as greenwood and walsh had promised that the vast majority of the investor funds pilfered and misappropriated by greenwood and walsh had been taken from wgti and that when the receivership began,the receiver found much more money at wgtc than at wgti.see id.at.the group argued that i f the wgti noteholders had not chosen th e indirect manner of investing with walsh and greenwood,but had insisted on investing in the audited,regulated entity,this fraud could not have occurred in the way it did id.at,and that it was the wgti investors conscious choice to go and put their money at greater risk that permitted walsh and greenwood to steal their money id.at.despite stating that of course we were defrauded id.at,counsel for the group argued that the looting here did not occur principally out of wgtc id.at,that the looting occurred in the unregulated,un audited entity id.at,and that greenwood and walsh did really steal our money id.at emphasis added.counsel stated that when the receiver was appointed,wgtc records revealed a total of million in the group accounts.see id.at.
the group argued that it was only because wgtc was a regulated and audited entity that there was any money to be distributed to investors.hearing tr.the district court,however,pointed out that 
regardless of what the investment vehicle was,e veryone was defrauded b oth groups of investors lost money because you were defrauded by the same individual who stole your money,and neither one of you could find out for a decade your funds were not segregated in a way that i can examine this record and determine that your funds were untouched and the other people fungible dollars were stolen.
id.at.the group persisted that it would be unfair and inequitable where people took greater risk and consciously chose to avoid and isolate themselves and distanced themselves from the outfit that actually really did legitimate things,to have them share and share alike with those who sought to avoid risk.id.at.
when pressed for specificity as to the amount of its desired premium,the group suggested that it should receive more than the amount proposed in the receiver plan,both to vindicate the public policy in favor of regulation and independent auditing hearing tr.and to avoid the moral hazard of telling the world of investing fiduciaries that it does matter if they explicitly go out of their way to go offshore and put their money in an unregulated entity id.at.the proposed premium would have given the group approximately million more in the initial distribution than the million it was to receive under the receiver plan see id.at the figure was randomly chosen,not tied to any identifiable basis see id.at.alternatively,on the hypothesis that only percent of the wgti investors money actually ended up being managed in the legitimate side of walsh and greenwood business,wgtc id.at,the group proposed that only of the funds collected by the receiver should be distributed to the wgti investors,with being distributed to the wgtc investors.this alternative would have given the group some million more than it was to receive under the receiver plan.see id.at.as its least preferred alternative,the group proposed that,t o vindicate the importance in the capital markets of regulation and auditing,the group should be granted a premium of of the total funds recovered by the receiver,million,on top of whatever the pro rata would be.id.at.the group conceded that the figure was equally random to the percent increment.id.at.although counsel for the group stated that w e are not seeking a penny of earnings id.at,he acknowledged that he did not mean that the ceiling should be the amount the group members contributed id.at.
also at the hearing,kcera pressed its contention that the receiver initial distribution should use a approach in order to account for inflation,weighting the distribution in favor of those who had investments than others.kcera counsel opposed the prudence premium requested by the group,stating,inter alia,we do as a factual matter know whose money was stolen when,and that is a part of the whole consideration here.hearing tr.see id.at as to whose money was taken when and how,nobody really knows.
however,counsel argued,t hat money was stolen all along.and people who were in this investment at an earlier stage,there was more opportunity to steal their funds id.at.reasoning that the real value of a dollar invested long ago is greater than the value of a dollar invested more recently,kcera argued that the distribution must include an inflation adjustment in order not to treat the investors dissimilarly from the investors because they have been in longer.id.at.
most of the greenwood and walsh victims opposed both kcera and the group distribution proposals.see,hearing tr.counsel for carnegie mellon university carnegie mellon an indirect wgti noteholder speak ing also on behalf of the other investors that favored the receiver plan id.at,objected to kcera proposal on the ground that such an adjustment would,before other victims had recovered their net investments,result in a distribution to kcera of more money than it had invested see id.at.as to the group prudence premium proposal,counsel disputed the supposition that the wgti noteholders had sought to distance themselves from regulation,pointing out,inter alia,that the noteholders had invested in a fund that was advised by westridge capital management,which is a registered investment adviser under the investment advisers act of and is in fact regulated by the securities and exchange commission.id.at.carnegie mellon argued in favor of the receiver proposed pro rata distribution on the ground that the wgti and wgtc assets had been commingled and the fraud victims were similarly situated.see id.at.
similarly,counsel for the university of pittsburgh a direct wgti noteholder argued that 
t he investors are,in fact,similarly situated with respect to this fraud,and the distinctions that z ie gler counsel for the group urges upon the court,quite frankly,are cosmetic for purposes of this proceeding.
all of the investors were defrauded in the same way,and z ie gler group ignores all of the connections among the westridge defendants and ignores how they were intertwined and how they operated.
all of the investors,including all of the clients that z ie gler represents and my client,had investment management agreements with westridge capital management.they were all invested in the same enhanced equity index strategy.they were all sold by the same folks.they were all operated by the same folks.the entities had the same offices and the same personnel.
the group seem s to somehow assume the integrity of the organizational boundaries between westridge trading and westridge trading investors.in fact,we know that not true.
they asked the court to give weight to the account statements that we know are demonstrably false,and they ignore the unified scheme to defraud that was perpetrated on all of the investors in this room.
hearing tr.see id.at,stating that the group arguments that only investors who were not members of the group lost money are based on investor statements that we know are fictitious,that in the words of the sec and the cftc are demonstrably false.
after hearing all of the arguments,the district court rejected all of the proposals that differed from that of the receiver.see hearing tr.referring to the issues that we discussed with regard to both the constant dollar adjustment advocated by kcera and the prudence premium issues advocated by the benefits group,the district court stated that neither adjustment would result in a fairer distribution for either the most victims or a large number of victims.id.at.
with regard to the position of the group,the court found that the record was sufficient to demonstrate that there was commingling of funds id.at and that the investors in wgtc and wgti 
were similarly situated in relationship to the fraud,in relationship to the losses,in relationship to the fraudsters,and in relationship to the nature of their investments,so that a net pro rata distribution is equitable.it is a fair and reasonable and an equitable way to make this initial distribution to investors.
there clearly was a uniform ponzi scheme here from the fraudster point of view,no distinction was made in terms of who would be the victims,where the money would come from.w hat defines the scheme is not the nature of the investments,not the nature of the victims,and not the nature of any particular relationship between westridge or wg trading that predominates or defines this activity.
id.at emphases added see also id.at the money was commingled there may have been circumstances where it was easier to account for in certain places than other places.but there nothing about the regulations that oversaw wgtc that was particularly beneficial it took a decade to uncover this fraud.
rejecting the kcera request for an inflation adjustment,the district court indicated that it viewed such an adjustment as skewing the distribution to favor a more limited number of investors.hearing tr.the court stated that 
it may be on the one hand less equitable to those people who had money in the fund earlier if they do get credit for those dollars,adjustment for those dollars.but it is similarly,and therefore balances out,inequitable for those people who are sharing the burden of the entire amount that has been stolen despite the fact that for those people who recently came in they were in the fund at a time when probably the smallest percentage of money was taken if you look at it over the years.
the district court noted in addition that 
i t is also important to me that both the sec and the cftc and the majority of investors who were trying to see the greatest return on their principal have in the majority backed the receiver plan of distribution,not because they feel that it is a perfect plan of distribution,but they feel as a choice between this method of distribution and the other methods of distribution that have been suggested that it is the preferable choice for all to maximize the return for the greatest number of investors in a fair and reasonable and equitable manner.
hearing tr.emphasis added.the court concluded that the receiver proposed pro rata initial distribution most closely mirrors what would be an equal and equitable distribution of the principal contributions of each of the investors.id.at.
as the march hearing drew to a close,the court stated that it would enter an order within a few days,approving the receiver plan and ordering that the initial distributions be made on the day after the date of the order.see,id.at.the court stated that it would not grant a stay of the distribution,and that if any interested party wanted a stay it would need to make a motion in the court of appeals.see id.at.
the district court order approving the receiver plan and ordering that the initial distributions be made on april,was entered on march.on april,the group filed its notice of appeal and moved in this court for a partial conditional stay.the motion was denied.
ii.discussion 
in its appeal,the group pursues its contention that the district court should have required the receiver to include in the initial distribution to wgtc investors a prudence premium because they invested in a regulated entity,whereas other investors chose to invest in the allegedly riskier,unregulated entity,wgti.on the,kcera pursues its contention that the receiver initial distribution should have been calculated in constant dollars in order to account for inflation.for the reasons that follow,we reject both contentions.
a district court assessing a receiver plan for compensation of victims of a fraudulent scheme has equitable authority to treat all the fraud victims alike in proportion to their investments and order a pro rata distribution.sec credit bancorp,cir credit bancorp.t he use of a pro rata distribution has been deemed especially appropriate for fraud victims of a ponzi scheme,id.at,where the funds of the defrauded victims were commingled and where victims were similarly situated with respect to their relationship to the defrauders,id.at.
fraud is endlessly resourceful and the unraveling of sins may sometimes require the grant of a measure of latitude to a trustee charged with distributing defrauders assets to fraud victims.in re bernard madoff investment securities llc,cir in re madoff.in any event,a trustee or receiver devising a distribution plan is not required to apportion assets in conformity with misrepresentations and arbitrary allocations that were made by the defrauder,otherwise,the whim of the defrauder would control the process that is supposed to unwind the fraud.id.at.
the decision of a district court as to the choice of distribution plan for a receivership estate is reviewed for abuse of discretion.credit bancorp,at.a district court has abuse d its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,cooter gell hartmarx,d,or rendered a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions,zervos verizon,cir.sims blot,cir.in considering whether there has been an abuse of discretion,we review de novo the district court rulings of law,in re grand jury subpoena issued june,cir internal quotation marks omitted,and we review factual findings for clear error,see,cooter gell,at w hen an appellate court reviews a district court factual findings,the and clearly erroneous standards are indistinguishable.
a.the group appeal 
the benefits group contends that the district court committed legal error by interpreting the similarly situated standard for equitable distributions as requiring merely that all claimants were defrauded group brief on appeal at emphasis added,by ruling that the only relevant feature of the relationship between investor and defrauder is that the investor was defrauded id.at.the group argues that 
the district court did not even address the group argument that moral hazard would result from allowing investors who purposely chose to isolate their investment from regulation and auditing to recover the identical degree as investors who chose the protections of regulation and auditing.to the extent that the district court considered the public interest at all,it defined that interest overly narrowly to include solely the equitable concern for maximizing overall return to most investors,to the exclusion of any other public interests or policies.in doing so,the district court failed to balance all the relevant equitable considerations as is required to reach a fair and reasonable plan.
id.at emphases added.the group also contends that the court factual finding that the wgtc investors and the wgti investors were similarly situated was clearly erroneous.see id.at.none of these contentions has merit.
first,the record does not support the group characterization of the district court as adopting a principle that all investors are similarly situated merely when all have been defrauded.rather,the court stated that victims may properly be considered similarly situated for purposes of a pro rata distribution plan when they were similarly situated in relationship to the fraud,in relationship to the losses,in relationship to the fraudsters,and in relationship to the nature of their investments,in what clearly was a uniform ponzi scheme.hearing tr.this ruling was entirely consistent with the principles enunciated in credit bancorp,see at.
second,we see no indication that the district court either ignored the group argument that investors in an unregulated entity deserve less compensation than investors in a regulated entity or considered government regulation in general to be irrelevant.in delivering its decision,the court expressly referred to the discussion of the prudence premium issues during the hearing see hearing tr,and as indicated in the colloquy quoted in part above,the court expressed the view that the fact that an entity is regulated does not provide assurance that money invested in it will not be stolen see,id.at.that view of the regulation to which wgtc was subject as a,relied on by the group,is supported by the view of the sec one of the regulators that b regulation is designed to protect brokerage customers,not owners sec brief on appeal at see id.the group members limited partnership interests in wgtc made them owners of a and as such they do not have a superiority of interest based on protection afforded under the securities laws to customers of registered emphases in original.thus,although the group characterizes its members as having prudently chose n the protections of regulation group brief on appeal at,they chose protections that were designed not for their benefit but for the benefit of others.we see no error in the district court determination that the mere choices of different investment vehicles did not mean that the two groups of defrauded investors in this case were meaningfully dissimilar,given,inter alia,that both the wgti and wgtc investors lost money because they were defrauded by the same individual who stole their money,and no one,whether they had invested in the regulated or the unregulated entity,could find out for a decade hearing tr.
we are not persuaded to reach the contrary conclusion by sec enterprise trust,cir enterprise trust,on which the group relies for the proposition that victims of fraud should be awarded different percentages of their losses on the basis of the nature of the risk exp
