the securities and exchange commission suspended james mccurdy for one year after finding that he recklessly departed from generally accepted auditing standards gaas in his audit of a mutual fund financial statements.the case centered on the treatment of a single receivable on the balance sheet of jwb aggressive growth fund,a diversified,management investment company.mccurdy arguments are that the commission improperly applied gaas,that its finding of recklessness was not supported by substantial evidence,and that it exceeded its authority in imposing a one year suspension.
john bagwell founded jwb aggressive growth fund and registered it with the commission in.bagwell served as the fund chief executive officer and was a member of its board of trustees.jwb investment advisory research,bagwell sole proprietorship,was the investment advisor of the fund,its only client.we will refer to jwb investment,in its capacity as the fund advisor,as bagwell.at its height,the fund had investors and assets of.the fund is now defunct.
when the fund began operations in,bagwell voluntarily agreed to waive any management fees and to reimburse the fund for its expenses exceeding of the fund assets.in the years that followed,the fund paid the expenses when incurred and bagwell reimbursed it at the end of the year for the amount reported in the fund due from advisor account.the arrangement was terminable at will,with advance notice to the board of trustees.until the year ending december,bagwell covered all such expenses.at the end of,the unpaid balance in the due from advisor account was.during,the fund expenses grew to approximately.by year end,the due from advisor account had an outstanding balance of about,after an approximately offset for organizational expenses due to bagwell.
on november,bagwell sent a letter to the board,outlining a proposed repayment plan,with monthly payments of at least a month,beginning that month and continuing until the receivable was repaid.at a meeting of the board on december,bagwell gave notice of his intention to withdraw from the reimbursement agreement.by this time,bagwell had already missed his proposed first payment.he informed the board that it would be extremely difficult for him to pay off the receivable by year end.the four other board members reviewed bagwell income statement and balance sheet,which he had provided at the meeting.satisfied of his ability to pay,they agreed to allow him until june to repay the balance on the payment terms he had proposed.
at the same meeting,the board followed bagwell recommendation and retained a new auditor,mccurdy associates cpas,an accounting firm specializing in mutual funds.the firm founder,james thomas mccurdy,had been a certified public accountant licensed to practice in ohio since.in light of the fund ongoing efforts,mccurdy pledged in his engagement letter to keep fees and expenses to a minimum in his audit of the year ending december.
mccurdy completed his field work on the audit in january,and submitted a report dated january.by that time,bagwell had missed his first two payments under the schedule and was at least in arrears.mccurdy report accompanied the fund filings with the commission on march.
the fund audited financial statements showed in assets,of which represented the due from advisor receivable.in light of the fact that percent of the fund assets depended on the collectibility of this account,mccurdy recognized that the receivable was material and would require special scrutiny.in analyzing the probability of collecting the receivable,he relied on the board decision to allow bagwell time to repay his obligation.he read the minutes of the meeting.he also spoke to the fund attorney,who was present at the meeting.but he did not speak with any board member or with bagwell except to confirm that the receivable existed,and he neither examined nor tested the financial data bagwell presented to the board.mccurdy also relied on the february renewal of the fund bond by gulf insurance company,although he took no steps to ascertain the basis for the company decision.and he considered bagwell history of making timely payments in previous years,as well as the fact that the receivable could no longer continue to grow because the reimbursement arrangement had terminated.on the basis of this information,mccurdy concluded that the receivable was probably collectible and that it properly could be treated as an asset under generally accepted accounting principles.
the commission charged mccurdy with improper professional conduct in violation of rule e of the commission rules of practice,citing his failure to obtain sufficient competent evidence to support his conclusion regarding the receivable,his failure to render an accurate report,and his lack of professional skepticism and due professional care.after an evidentiary hearing,an administrative law judge concluded that while mccurdy audit of the receivable did not comport with gaas,his conduct did not constitute reckless or highly unreasonable behavior.the commission disagreed,finding mccurdy audit both reckless and highly unreasonable.it therefore suspended mccurdy from practicing before the commission for one year.
information is the lifeblood of the market.for the market to operate,for it to operate at must have some measure of reliability.investor confidence is bolstered by the knowledge that public financial statements have been subjected to the rigors of independent and objective investigation and analysis.see,american institute of certified public accountants aicpa,code of professional conduct,available at vincent et,montgomery auditing ed.independent auditors therefore must exercise reasonable diligence in reviewing financial statements.see aicpa,codification of statements on auditing standards au.because it is not possible to give each transaction the fullest scrutiny,professional auditing standards have come to recognize,through decades of experience,particular factors that arouse suspicion and call for focused investigation.these factors are the red flags for which all auditors are trained to remain alert.see howard sec,citing graham sec,and wonsover sec.
among transactions calling for close inspection are transactions,including transactions between a company and its officers or directors.such dealings are viewed with extreme skepticism in all areas of finance.see,k one of many disclosures of transactions required by the commission in the securities context gordon comm r,wl explaining heightened skepticism of the form transactions.the reason for this is apparent although in an ordinary transaction,one may assume that parties will act in their own economic,this assumption breaks down when the parties are related.a company that would perform a thorough assessment before extending a loan might not do so if the loan were to one of its officers or directors.accordingly,gaas explicitly recognize the need for particular care in the auditor examination of material transactions.aicpa,au.
in response to the inherently suspicious nature of such transactions,the aicpa has identified particular sources of information to which an auditor should turn for assurance regarding material outstanding balances associated with transactions audited financial statements,unaudited financial statements,income tax returns,and reports issued by regulatory agencies,taxing authorities,financial publications,or credit agencies.aicpa,au e.mccurdy took no steps to obtain or consult any of these sources with regard to this receivable.the question then is whether,in view of the information upon which he did rely,the commission was warranted in finding that he lacked sufficient information to form a reasoned judgment about the receivable collectibility.
a basic guideline of field work requires auditors to form their opinions on the basis of s ufficient competent evidential matter,obtained through inspection,observation,inquiries,and confirmations.aicpa,au.in considering the evidence upon which mccurdy relied,the commission properly disregarded what was not competent.the commission found,for instance,that gulf insurance company renewal of the fund bond in f
