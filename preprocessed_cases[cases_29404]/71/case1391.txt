statutory background 
under the unclaimed property law,certain types of unclaimed property escheats to the state.code civ,et all undesignated references to sections are to the code of civil procedure.the law has two objectives protect unknown property owners by locating them and restoring their property to them,and give the state,rather than the owners of the unclaimed property,the benefits of holding the property,since experience shows most abandoned property will never be claimed.bank of america cory d.
the statute does not operate a true escheat.the law expressly provides title to property received by the state under its provisions does not pass to the state.the state holds the property as a custodian until the property rightful owner can claim the property.
in general,the law declares certain personal property either located in the state or owned by a california resident escheats to the state when its owner fails to take enumerated steps during a period of time indicating continued active ownership,such as increasing or decreasing the amount on deposit,corresponding with the holder of the property,or otherwise indicating a continuing interest in the property.see.holders of such property must give property owners mailed notice of the pending escheat if the holder has the owner address in its records.
if the owner fails to claim the property,the statute requires holders to make a verified report to the state controller,identifying the property owner name and last known address and describing the property.the holder files the report and,at the same time,transfers the property to the controller.
the controller then assumes custody of the property and is responsible for its safekeeping.within one year after receiving the holder report and the property described therein,the controller must cause a notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation to inform property owners of the escheat.
the controller in general sells all escheated property to the highest bidder,except that with regards to securities traded on an established exchange,the controller sells the securities within two years of its receipt on that exchange at the prevailing prices.the controller is required to publish prior notice of any sale,except that no notice is required for a sale of securities on a national exchange.ibid.
any person who claims an interest in property escheated to the state may file a claim to the property or to the net proceeds from its sale,subd.a.if the controller grants the claim,the controller returns the property or the proceeds from its sale to the claimant,along with a payment of interest at a specified rate.former,subd.c stats,ch.

on october,berkshire hathaway filed a holder report with the state of nebraska identifying the owners of berkshire hathaway stock and the owners last known addresses.the list named hilltop food center,willie meats and the terracinas as shareholders.the report listed hilltop food center address in los angeles,quiroz address in la habra,and the terracina former address in sherman oaks,but did not include social security numbers.
plaintiffs stock in berkshire hathaway escheated to the state of nebraska under nebraska law.
in may,pursuant to a reciprocity agreement between nebraska and california,defendant,the california state controller then gray davis,received a block of escheated berkshire hathaway shares,including those owned by plaintiffs.the nebraska report accompanying the transferred shares identified hilltop food center,willie meats,and the terracinas as owners and listed their addresses as those that had been submitted earlier to nebraska by berkshire hathaway.
in the report,each shareholder had been assigned an account number ranging from through.some of the accounts listed on the report did not fully balance with the number of shares received by the controller.under standard procedures,the controller established an aggregate account,account number,for unaccounted stocks and dividends.
subsequently,the controller identified all of the accounts attributable to the nebraska report.it established two additional stock accounts,number and,and transferred them from the aggregate account.account number became the terracina account,and number became the hilltop food center account.the willie meats account had already been assigned number.

we will provide additional facts as necessary.
procedural history 
plaintiffs complaints.
all plaintiffs filed separate complaints against the controller.fong fourth amended complaint,filed on may,alleged his shares at the time of filing would have been worth roughly per share down from a high of per share.he alleged the controller had sold other blocks of the escheated shares at other times for between and per share.he asserted the controller taking possession of,and sale of his shares at approximately per share without notice to him or obtaining his consent,and before knowing the identity of the owners of those shares,violated his due process rights of notice and compensation for property under the state and federal constitutions undesignated state and federal securities laws and notice and qualifying provisions of the unclaimed property law.
he sought declaratory and injunctive relief on those grounds and also a declaration that he was entitled to the return of either his stock investment or the reasonable value thereof,an accounting and imposition of a constructive trust,and attorney fees and the creation of a common fund consisting of all monies received by the controller from the improper acquisition and sale of stock without due process to be refunded to all similarly injured shareholders.
quiroz and the terracinas filed first amended complaints seeking recovery of compensatory damages from the controller.they alleged the controller improperly reimbursed them the value of their shares based on the sales price in when the controller did not at that time know the rightful owners of the shares sold.they sought to be paid the sale price earned by the controller when the controller allegedly sold another block of the escheated berkshire hathaway shares in at a significantly higher price.
the trial court subsequently consolidated the three actions.it also denied motions by plaintiffs to amend their complaints to include class action allegations.
fong motion for summary adjudication.
fong filed a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication.he argued undisputed facts demonstrated the controller had failed to provide him notice either by mail or by publication of the controller receipt or sale of his shares of stock.he asserted this failure violated the requirements of the unclaimed property law and his constitutional rights to due process.
the trial court kobayashi,denied fong motion.fong had not submitted undisputed facts proving hilltop food center had never received notice of the escheat.also,the court acknowledged under section,subdivision b,the sale of escheated shares of securities listed on an established stock exchange was exempt from a publication notice requirement.the explicit statutory exemption would be applicable here,thus notice was not required.
controller motion for summary adjudication.
the controller then filed a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication.he argued sections and granted the controller complete immunity against any action brought by a person aggrieved by a decision of the controller seeking to recover anything other than the property or its sale proceeds.section limited any recovery to recovering either the escheated property itself or the net proceeds from its sale,which plaintiffs had already received.he sought summary judgment on this basis.
the controller sought summary adjudication on five other issues in the event the court determined he did not enjoy complete immunity under section.first,he claimed he had no duty under the unclaimed property law to give notice prior to selling plaintiffs shares.second,he argued his sale of the shares did not violate plaintiffs due process rights.the sale did not constitute a taking nor did it trigger a requirement to give notice prior to selling the stock.
third,the controller asserted the unclaimed property law did not impose on him a duty to verify independently the information submitted to california in the holder report regarding the identity of shareholders the issuing company could no longer locate.fourth,he claimed his sale of the shares did not violate state or federal securities laws.and,fifth,he argued if the court held plaintiffs could seek damages against the controller,plaintiffs actions in this instance were barred by the requirements of the tort claims act 
the trial court mcmaster,denied the controller motion for summary judgment,but granted summary adjudication on certain issues.on summary judgment,the court acknowledged section granted the controller immunity,but determined section exception to that grant allowed an action to be brought by a person aggrieved by any decision of the controller,not just an action to establish a claim to property the controller held.
the court granted summary adjudication on the controller second,third,and fourth issues.on the second issue,the court concluded the controller had no constitutional duty to notify plaintiffs prior to selling their stock,and it concluded the sale of the stock without prior notice did not deprive plaintiffs of property without due process.
on the third issue,the court held the controller had no duty to verify the information contained in the holder report received from nebraska.the controller was entitled to rely on the fact the property had escheated under nebraska law,which required the holder report be verified by the issuing organization under penalty of perjury.
on the fourth issue,the court granted summary adjudication against plaintiffs claims of violations of state and federal securities laws.
the court denied summary adjudication on the controller first and fifth issues.first,it denied a ruling on the controller claim he had no duty to notify plaintiffs of the sale of their stock under the unclaimed property law.while the controller might not have had to give notice prior to selling the shares,the trial court stated section of the unclaimed property law required him to give notice of his receipt of the shares.insufficient evidence existed by which the court could determine whether the controller complied with section or whether the controller was excused from compliance because the state of nebraska gave notice of the escheat but failed to provide the controller with plaintiffs names and other identifying information.
second,the court denied summary adjudication on the controller argument that plaintiffs claims for damages were barred by the tort claims act.adjudicating this issue would not completely dispose of a substantive area of plaintiffs actions,as they had requested declaratory and injunctive relief as well as damages.
controller motions in limine and trial.
the action proceeded to trial before judge david abbott on the stipulated facts recited above.the controller filed a number of in limine motions,two of which became dispositive of the action.the first sought to exclude evidence of the controller alleged failure to give notice of the sale to plaintiffs.the controller argued such evidence was irrelevant because even if the controller had failed to give notice,he was immune from suit under section.
the second sought to exclude evidence relating to damages suffered by plaintiffs on the ground the tort claims act barred plaintiffs from recovering damages.
the court granted both motions.the court also deemed admitted the fact fong could not have received any mailed notice sent to the hilltop food center on or after may,the day the controller received hilltop shares from nebraska.
as a result of its rulings,the court determined plaintiffs were not entitled to declaratory or injunctive relief.since they had already received their sole remedy of the shares proceeds plus interest,plaintiffs agreed no other issues in their case remained to be tried.the court entered judgment against plaintiffs.
discussion 
plaintiffs allege the trial court erred by determining the controller was immune from liability for violations of the unclaimed property act noticing requirements as well as constitutional due process requirements determining plaintiffs were barred from seeking damages due to their failure to file a claim under the tort claims act and hearing the controller in limine motions which were identical to his earlier denied motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication and were raised without any newly discovered facts.
because the issues we discuss are each questions of law,we review the arguments de novo.mansell board of administration th,d.
