here the crime,an endless chain,proves to be an oxymoron.the conviction of defendants ends the chain,but not the losses to countless victims.
among other things,we conclude the elaborate chain scheme devised by defendants to bilk money from various hapless victims also involve securities fraud.we also conclude that the crime of filing a false income tax return does not involve a taking for the purpose of sentence enhancement.

in,mercedes founded la luz de oro,meaning the light of gold.lldo.she became chief executive officer and president of the corporation,and felix became secretary.mercedes daughter,joan frederick,became chief financial officer and treasurer.lldo held meetings to recruit members,who were required to pay meeting and membership fees,join various programs,and recruit additional members.programs included purchases of telephone calling cards,cards,cellular telephones,ownership interests in lldo,mitsubishi automobiles,and dream homes.mercedes and lldo representatives assured members that lldo would make the payments on the automobiles and dream homes.they also represented that members would receive investment returns on the calling cards,credit cards,and interests.

felix often signed the checks given as payments to lldo leaders.felix was also a director of lldo,and an application for a federal employer tax identification number indicated that he was a principal officer.
the or program provided that members would become in lldo in exchange for certain payments and for recruiting additional members.lldo were entitled to a share of its annual profits.
mitsubishi automobile program 
in,mitsubishi motor sales had a promotion that permitted a qualified purchaser to purchase a new automobile with no downpayment and no payments for six months to one year.at the time,mitsubishi motor credit,the finance subsidiary of mitsubishi motor sales,had an auto express credit approval program conferring credit approval responsibility upon the dealerships.
juan alvarado was a member and a leader of lldo.in and,assael mitsubishi in duarte employed alvarado as an assistant sales manager.miller mitsubishi in van nuys employed carlos vargas,an lldo member,as a salesman.lldo representatives referred lldo members to alvarado and vargas at their respective dealerships.alvarado and vargas sold mitsubishi automobiles to qualified lldo who paid sums to lldo,participated in other lldo programs,and recruited new members.alvarado and vargas completed credit applications for lldo members,falsely stating their employment and incomes.they assured prospective buyers that lldo would make their automobile payments after they purchased an automobile.in fact,lldo did not make any payments.counts grand theft.
mitsubishi motor credit repossessed automobiles purchased by lldo members.it lost nearly million after selling the repossessed automobiles and receiving approximately negotiated settlement from the two dealerships.mitsubishi motor credit later contacted lldo members who had surrendered vehicles,and offered to expunge derogatory credit reporting regarding the transactions.
on april,police officers executed search warrants upon lldo offices and the navarretes residence in arleta.they later seized nearly two million dollars in cash and cashier checks.an investigative audit revealed that approximately million passed through lldo bank accounts from april through june.
when police officers executed the search warrant at the navarretes residence,only frederick and a housekeeper were present.from time to time,frederick was a guest in her mother home.frederick requested permission to leave and take her black duffel bag that was on the bed in her sister bedroom.when police officers looked inside the unmarked duffel bag,they discovered nearly in currency.police officers also found in currency in a safe at the residence.
later that day,frederick obtained three cashier checks from lldo bank accounts,totaling nearly million.one check for nearly million was payable to her,another check for was payable to the lldo corporation,and a third check for was payable to an attorney.police officers later seized the bank accounts pursuant to warrant,however,and the checks were not paid.
many lldo members paid significant sums toward its programs,but did not receive cellular telephones,cards,or the promised returns.counts grand theft.many lldo members also were unaware that mercedes had been convicted of theft in michigan in,involving a similar scheme.those who had automobiles repossessed complained of damaged credit ratings.some received investment returns,but not in the amounts or with the frequency promised.a certified public accountant examined lldo cancelled checks and determined that members received approximately million overall.
bonnie youngdahl,a former attorney with the california department of corporations,testified at trial as an expert witness concerning california securities law.she explained that the department of corporations enforces the law regarding the raising of investment capital.youngdahl opined that many factors were involved in determining whether a particular offering was a security.she stated that the determination does not depend upon the name of the interest sold,but rather concerns the economic reality of the offering.this means looking through the form to the substance of the transactions.youngdahl also stated that reasonable persons could disagree whether a particular investment is a security.

prior to trial,the trial court denied frederick motion to suppress evidence of the cash found in the duffel bag during execution of the search warrant.the court found that police officers could lawfully search the bag for weapons before allowing frederick to leave.the court reasoned that the officers would put themselves at undue risk if they do look inside for officer safety.the court also found that frederick was more than a casual visitor to the residence,and that the searching police officer testimony was credible.in sum,it ruled that the plain view doctrine lawfully permitted police officers to seize the currency.
the trial court severed the trial of mercedes,felix,and frederick from the remaining defendants.defendants juan alvarado and carlos vargas were convicted after trial other defendants entered nolo contendere pleas to particular counts.we decided the appeals of alvarado,vargas,and others in unpublished decisions.people vargas,wl people miramontes,wl.
the jury convicted frederick and the navarretes of operating an endless chain scheme,conspiracy to commit grand theft,and counts of grand theft,subd.a,subd.a.it found that the excessive taking allegations of sections,subdivision a,subdivision a,and,subdivision a,were true.the jury also convicted mercedes and felix of selling a security without qualification,using a scheme to defraud in the sale of a security,and filing a false income tax return,subds.a b,subd.a.it convicted felix of making a false statement in the sale of a security,subd.b.

discussion 
frederick argues that the trial court erred by denying her motion to suppress evidence of the currency seized from her duffel bag during execution of the search warrant.she points out that the search warrant neither mentioned her nor specified seizure of currency.frederick adds that she lived in san diego and infrequently stayed at her mother home.she asserts that insufficient evidence supports the trial court factual findings that the police officer searched the duffel bag to protect officer safety and discover contraband.frederick points out that the officer gave several reasons for searching the duffel of the crime and officer safety.she adds that the officer had no evidence connecting her to illegal lldo activities or to the navarretes.people berry d.circumstances must suggest a relationship between the person,the place searched,and the illegal activities.frederick argues the error is prejudicial because the case against her was thin.chapman california,d.
in reviewing a trial court ruling on a suppression motion,we defer to the trial court factual findings that are supported by substantial evidence.people hughes cal th,d,people camacho cal th,d.the trial court sits as a finder of fact with the power to judge credibility,resolve conflicts,weigh evidence,and draw inferences.people needham th,d.whether a search is constitutionally reasonable,however,is a legal question upon which we exercise our independent judgment.people hughes,supra,cal th,d.
searching police officers may seize items not listed in the warrant provided that the items are in plain view while the officers are lawfully in the location they are searching,and the incriminating nature of the items is immediately apparent.people kraft cal th,d.
under certain circumstances,police officers may search the personal effects of a person who is more than a casual visitor,but not a resident of the premises.people berry,supra,d.if the circumstances suggest a relationship between the person and place sufficient to connect the individual to the illegal activities giving rise to the warrant,search of the person property on the premises is permitted,at.
sufficient evidence supports the trial court finding that the officer acted reasonably in searching the duffel bag.the bag contained no identifying marks and officers were not required to believe frederick statement that the bag belonged to her.frederick was more than a mere visitor to her mother home.she ate meals and stayed there from time to time.the duffel bag was on the bed in the bedroom in which she stayed as a guest.thus,she had more than just a temporary presence in the residence.people howard th,d defendant purse legally searched where she was found in bed with another defendant during execution of warrant.
moreover,police officers could search the bag for weapons to protect their safety.operation of lldo involved large amounts of checks,cash,and money orders armed security guards were present at membership meetings.a courier carrying the cash and financial instruments might carry a weapon to safeguard the items.the trial court expressly determined the credibility of the officer reason for searching the bag.we do not redetermine questions of credibility.people needham,supra,th,d.
in any event,any error in admitting evidence of the currency is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.people memro cal th,d,standard of review when evidence obtained from unlawful search and seizure.after leaving her mother home,frederick went to the bank and obtained three cashier checks totaling nearly million.the largest check for million was payable to her another check for was payable to an attorney.by comparison,evidence of the within the duffel bag is neither significant nor prejudicial.
frederick contends that the trial court erred by precluding expert testimony regarding an endless chain scheme,a complicated subject beyond the jury common experience.she points out that evidence code section allows expert opinion that embraces the ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.she asserts that the trial court ruling denied her due process of law and the assistance of counsel because the ruling restricted her right to present a defense.people reeder d.
during the examination of expert witness and lawyer thayer lindauer,the trial court ruled that his testimony regarding endless chain schemes was limited to the common features or hallmarks of a scheme.the court ruled that the question whether lldo was an endless chain scheme was an ultimate question for the jury to decide.thus,the court permitted lindauer to testify whether a particular aspect of an endless chain scheme was consistent with his experience,but not whether a particular hypothetical entity was an endless chain scheme.
evidence code section provides that t estimony in the form of an opinion that is otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces the ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.nevertheless,an expert opinion is inadmissible if it invades the province of the jury to decide a case.piscitelli friedenberg th,d.such evidence is wholly without value to the trier of fact.ibid.the determination whether an expert witness opinion bears upon or decides an ultimate issue in the case is sometimes a difficult decision,and a large element of judicial discretion is involved.people wilson cal d.
the trial court did not abuse its discretion by limiting the opinions of prosecution and defense expert witnesses regarding endless chain schemes.the trial court properly permitted the expert witnesses to testify regarding the indicia or aspects of an endless chain scheme,but not whether lldo was,in fact,an endless chain scheme.thus,lindauer testified that based upon his expertise and knowledge,endless chain schemes are not secret organizations,they do not sell products,and they compensate a participant for bringing in a new participant.he also stated that he had no knowledge of an endless chain scheme that received million from its participants,yet returned to percent of the funds.
the trial court also properly restricted lindauer and other expert witnesses from instructing upon the law of endless chain schemes.summers gilbert th,d.calling lawyers as expert witnesses to give opinions as to the application of law to particular facts usurps the duty of the trial court to instruct the jury,at,d.
the trial court evidentiary limitations did not deny frederick her constitutional right to the assistance of counsel and to present a defense.lindauer testified at length concerning the indicia of an endless chain scheme,and opined that a plan that returned to percent of its revenues to members was not an endless chain scheme.the trial court ruling was not a blanket exclusion of evidence that stripped frederick of her defense.people page th,d.
mercedes and felix argue that there is insufficient evidence to support the convictions of counts,and,violations of california securities law,count,count felix only,count.they contend that lldo programs were not securities within the meaning of corporations code section,because lldo members actively participated in the venture.people figueroa cal d,corporate securities law requires that an investor risk capital through his investment.mercedes and felix rely upon lldo requirement that members must recruit seven new members to argue that members were active participants in the venture.
corporation code section defines a security expansively,and includes participation in any agreement or an investment contract,whether or not a written document evidences the investment.all of the foregoing are securities whether or not evidenced by a written document.an investment contract is a contract or a transaction in which a person entrusts money or other capital to another,with the expectation of deriving a profit,income or some financial benefit from a business enterprise,the failure or success of which is dependent upon the managerial efforts of other persons.people smith d.it is a question for the trier of fact whether a particular investment is a security,at.here the trial court properly instructed with the definition of investment contract set forth in people smith,supra,d.
sufficient evidence supports the jury finding that the lldo program was a security.lldo members testified that they believed that they were investors and of lldo.miguel gutierrez testified that lldo representatives told him a investment meant that he would be a part of the company like an owner.jose grant received a videotape from lldo in which mercedes stated that members share in the company earnings.omar sotowade testified that he considered lldo an investment in which he expected a return.julia parkin believed lldo was an investment company.yolanda rosales invested in the program because lldo was presented to her as an investment company.alison conover invested in the program to receive a profit share at the end of the year.israel menjivar believed that he would be a based upon mercedes statements.lldo leader pedro miramontes gave undercover officer rodriguez a agreement,and stated that lldo members received a share in lldo profits.this is reasonable and credible evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could find defendants guilty of the securities counts beyond a reasonable doubt.people kipp cal th,d,standard of review of substantial evidence.
mercedes,felix,and frederick carried out the managerial functions of lldo.they alone made the important management decisions essential to lldo operations.lldo members,many of whom were poor and uneducated,were not in charge and could not influence the management of lldo.the success or failure of lldo rested upon defendants managerial efforts,not the efforts of its members.people smith,supra,d.general rule.when an investor entrusts money or other consideration to a promoter through any arrangement but retains substantial power to affect the success of the enterprise,he has not risked capital within the meaning of the corporate securities law.people figueroa,supra,cal d.here lldo investors did not retain substantial power to affect the success of lldo.ibid.
appellants argue that the trial court denied them their constitutional rights to due process of law and to a jury trial by failing to reinstruct at the conclusion of evidence regarding the elements of operating an endless chain scheme count.they point out that three weeks of evidence elapsed between preinstruction and deliberations,and assert that jurors likely forgot the required elements of the crime.people valenzuela d.better practice to reinstruct regarding credibility where three days of trial elapsed,counsel argued credibility of witnesses,and counsel paraphrased credibility instruction during summation.appellants also assert that the trial court did not include the instruction among the written instructions given at the conclusion of trial.they argue the error relieved the prosecution of proving the requisite elements of the crime.appellants claim that the error is federal constitutional error and prejudicial per se,or alternatively,not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
following opening statements by counsel,the trial court instructed regarding the elements of the crime of grand theft,and stated that it would instruct from time to time during trial.the court also then provided the jurors with written instructions concerning grand theft.
several days later,the trial court instructed concerning operating an endless chain scheme,informing counsel beforehand that the instruction was taken straight from the penal code.the court also provided jurors with some more written instructions and they incorporate also counts operating an endless chain scheme and count conspiracy to commit grand theft.
the court then instructed the defendants are accused in count of having violated of the penal code,operating an endless chain scheme every person who willfully contrives,prepares,sets up,or operates any endless chain scheme is guilty of a crime.an endless chain means any scheme for the disposal or distribution of property whereby a participant pays a valuable consideration for the chance to receive compensation for introducing one or more additional persons into participation in the scheme,or for the chance to receive compensation when a person introduced by the participant introduces a new participant.in order to prove this crime,each of the following elements must be proved number one,a person willfully contrived,prepared,set up,or operated a business entity or other organization.number two,the business entity or other organization gives compensation to some person.number three,the compensation is given by the business to the person for the chance to receive compensation for introducing one or more additional persons into participation in the scheme,or,for the chance to receive compensation when a person introduced by the participant introduces a new participant the court read this instruction as the jurors followed along with their handouts.
thereafter,the trial court instructed the jury immediately prior to summation,but did not reinstruct concerning the elements of operating an endless chain scheme.during the prosecutor summation,however,he discussed the instruction three elements one,a person set up or operated a business entity or other organization.two,the organization gave compensation to some person.three,compensation was given by the business for a chance to receive compensation for introducing an additional person or persons into the scheme.
section,subdivision f,permits the trial court to instruct a t the beginning of the trial or from time to time during the trial it does not require a of all instructions at the conclusion of trial.people chung th,d.breaking instructions into phases of the trial does not tax the attention span of jurors,provides timely and useful information to jurors as the trial progresses,and arguably benefits the parties,at,d.
for several reasons,the trial court did not err by not rereading the endless chain instruction.first,defense counsel did not object to the early instruction,and did not request rereading of the instruction at the conclusion of the evidence.people chung,supra,th,d.second,the trial court provided jurors with a written instruction when it instructed during the prosecutor.ibid.third,the prosecutor summarized and discussed the essential elements of the instruction during summation,at,d.fourth,the instruction accurately defines the crime of operating an endless chain scheme.
felix argues that the trial court erred by not instructing that count,sale of security without qualification,requires knowledge that the security was unqualified and not exempt,securities must be registered with the department of corporations unless exempt.he asserts that the error violated his right to a jury trial and denied him due process of law,because the lldo programs did not appear to be securities as commonly understood.felix adds that expert witness evidence at trial differed whether lldo programs were securities.he points out that the department of corporations declined to prosecute the lldo matter because it was questionable whether an offer or sale of securities was involved felix asserts that mercedes,not he,primarily managed lldo.he argues the error is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
during the pendency of this appeal,our supreme court decided the issue of scienter and corporations code section.people salas cal th,d.pursuant to our invitation,felix has submitted additional briefing in light of salas.
corporation code section proscribes the offer or sale of a security that has not been qualified with the department of corporations,unless the security is exempt from qualification.at trial,the parties stipulated that lldo had not applied for qualification with the department of corporations.
in people salas,supra,cal th,d,our supreme court held that a seller who believes reasonably and in good faith that a security is exempt is not guilty of the crime of unlawful sale of an unregistered security,at,d.guilty knowledge is not an element of the crime,however.ibid.rather,a defendant reasonable good faith belief that a security is exempt from registration is an affirmative defense on which the defense bears the initial burden of proof.ibid.thus,the trial court must instruct concerning a defendant good faith belief only when the defense has presented evidence sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew,or was criminally negligent in failing to know,that the security was not exempt,at,d.this rule presents no unfairness or hardship to a defendant because his knowledge or lack of knowledge is peculiarly within his personal knowledge,at,d.
the trial court was not required to instruct regarding defendants good faith belief because defendants did not present any evidence that they had a reasonable good faith belief that they were not selling securities or that the securities were exempt from qualification.defendants knowledge or lack of knowledge regarding lldo is peculiarly within their personal knowledge.an inference drawn from differing expert witness opinions regarding the general nature of a security is insufficient to support an instruction here concerning defendants knowledge or lack of knowledge regarding lldo.people salas,supra,cal th,d.defendants did not bear their initial burden of proof,at,d.
frederick asserts that the trial court erred by not instructing,sua sponte,concerning theft by trick or device,rather than theft by false pretenses.people ashley cal d,crime of theft by false pretenses involves fraudulent acquisition of title and possession theft by trick or device involves only fraudulent possession of property.she contends that the lldo victims transferred only possession,not ownership,of the money paid to lldo because they expected a particular product in return.frederick claims the error is prejudicial because she presented a defense that lldo would have paid all members had the police not frozen lldo bank accounts,and precluded further marketing.in other words,she asserts that the prosecution would have been unable to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she intended to convert the funds to her own use and to permanently deprive the owner thereof.people traster th,d victim gave computer consultant checks to purchase software licenses he absconded with funds instead.
the crime of theft by trick or device requires obtaining possession of property of another by some trick or device intent by the wrongdoer to convert it to his own use and to permanently deprive the owner thereof and transfer of possession but not title to the wrongdoer.people traster,supra,th,d.
the crimes of theft by trick or device and theft by false pretenses are similar.people traster.supra,th,d.theft by trick or device involves a transfer of possession only theft by false pretenses involves a transfer of title and possession.ibid.generally,if a victim gives money to a wrongdoer with the understanding that it will be spent for a particular purpose,title does not pass to the wrongdoer,at,d.under those circumstances,the wrongdoer may have committed the crime of theft by trick or device.ibid.
the trial court did not err.theft by false pretenses was the prosecution theory of the case against the lldo officers,and sufficient evidence supports the convictions.members joined lldo by paying meeting fees,buying programs for ownership interests,dream homes,mitsubishi automobiles,cell phones,telephone calling cards,and credit cards,as well as by recruiting new members.unlike people traster,supra,th,d,victims did not give lldo funds to
