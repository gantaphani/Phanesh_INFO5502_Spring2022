prabhat goyal,former chief financial officer of network associates,nai,appeals from his convictions on fifteen counts of securities fraud and making materially false statements to auditors.the government alleged that nai,under goyal supervision,violated generally accepted accounting principles gaap by recognizing revenue from certain software sales earlier than it should have.goyal was indicted for concealing the allegedly improper accounting from nai outside auditors and for filing reports with the securities and exchange commission that,because of nai accounting,allegedly misstated revenue in certain reporting periods between and.goyal argues that no jury could have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,as the jury below did,based on the evidence the prosecution presented at trial.we agree,and we reverse his convictions on all counts.
background 
from approximately to,goyal was chief financial officer of nai.nai,formerly known as mcafee,was and remains a major vendor of antivirus and network security software.
before,nai used a direct sales business model,meaning that it primarily sold its software directly to end users.in,the company added a distribution channel model,selling products through distribution companies.these distributors in turn sold nai software to retail stores that resold the software to end users.
the prosecution case against goyal challenged the accounting method that nai used,under goyal supervision as cfo,to recognize revenue from sales to its largest domestic distributor,ingram micro.in particular,the government took issue with the accounting method nai used to recognize large sales that it made to ingram at the end of financial quarters between and.following a practice common in the software industry,which the government did not contend was illegal,nai negotiated significant deals with ingram,called transactions,to help meet its quarterly revenue projections to close these sales,nai granted ingram substantial discounts,rebates,and other favorable sales terms.one enticement that nai offered ingram in the last two quarters of and the first quarter of,was a guarantee that its wholly owned subsidiary,nettools,would repurchase unsold product from ingram in specified amounts.nettools would then sell the repurchased product to customers 
the government did not contend that any of the sales concessions that nai gave ingram in the deals were improper or that nai claimed revenue that it never earned.rather,the government objected to the timing of nai recognition of revenue from these deals.the government maintained that nai violated gaap by using accounting to recognize revenue from these deals earlier than it should have and thereby overstated its revenue.under accounting,a manufacturer like nai recognizes revenue when it ships products to its distributors,sells in to the distribution channel.the manufacturer must estimate the amount of future rebates,discounts or returns and then reduce its stated revenue by this amount.
by contrast,a company using accounting recognizes revenue when its distributors sell the product to a reseller,sells through the distribution channel.accounting recognizes revenue later than accounting does and nets out rebates,discounts,and returns.thus the manufacturer does not need to estimate their effect on its revenue.
the jury convicted goyal of one count of securities fraud and seven counts of making false filings with the sec collectively,the securities counts and seven counts of making materially false statements to nai auditors at pricewaterhousecoopers pwc the counts 
after goyal conviction,the district court denied his motions for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial.goyal appealed.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo the district court denial of goyal rule motion for judgment of acquittal.see united states mosley,cir.we must decide whether after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime s beyond a reasonable doubt.united states nevils,cir en banc quoting jackson virginia,see also mcdaniel brown.we apply this standard to the securities counts and the counts in turn.
securities counts 
all of the securities count of securities fraud and seven counts of making false filings with the the government to prove that nai materially misstated the revenue it earned in certain quarters and years through its choice of accounting method.nai reports of allegedly inflated revenue furnished the untrue statement of material fact required for each of the false filing counts,as well as the misleading statement or omission of a material fact made with scienter needed to sustain a fraud conviction under the general antifraud provision of b of the securities exchange act of.united states.smith,cir internal quotation marks and numbering of elements omitted.
the government contention that nai materially overstated its revenue necessarily entailed two claims that nai recognized revenue at a different time than it should have and that nai accounting produced artificially higher revenue figures in certain periods that would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.basic levinson.the government relied on gaap to make its case,on the first point,that accounting was required in instances where nai used the method.but we need not decide whether nai actually violated gaap,because the government clearly failed to carry its burden on the second point,materiality.the prosecution offered no evidence adequate to prove that any gaap violations materially affected the revenue that nai reported.
the government relied at trial on the parties stipulations that applying accounting to nai entire business would have resulted in a revenue figure that is materially less than the reported figure for the periods charged in the false filing counts these stipulations are fatally overbroad,however,because the government did not contend that gaap required nai to use accounting for all sales.the government only offered evidence that accounting was required for the ingram transactions,and the stipulations did not provide that applying accounting to those transactions alone would have made a material difference in any given period.without evidence of how much less revenue nai would have recognized on the ingram deals if it had used accounting,the jury had no basis to conclude that the misstatement of reported revenue resulting from the ingram transactions was material.even presuming,as we must,that the jury drew all reasonable inferences in the prosecution favor,see nevils,at,there was no way it could have properly inferred materiality from the evidence it had before it.
confronted with this problem,the government argued after the verdict that the jury could have inferred materiality from the mere fact that the deals with ingram were substantial.the dollar amounts in the purchase orders for these transactions,according to the government calculations,represented approximately of the total revenue for nai during,and and between approximately to of nai total revenue on a quarterly basis.but this argument failed to bridge the materiality gap because goyal jury had to make the materiality findings that his convictions required,and it never saw these figures.see united states rigas,cir declining,in a challenge,to consider in the first instance arguments regarding materiality that were not presented to the jury.
the jury could not have inferred materiality from this evidence even if it had seen it,because it was not the absolute magnitude of the deals that mattered.the jury needed to assess whether nai use of accounting for the ingram transactions materially increased nai overall revenue when compared to using accounting.but the jury had no evidentiary basis for making the required comparisons.there was simply no evidence that the effect of using rather than accounting for the ingram transactions was so substantial that it made a material difference.by the government own calculations,sales always accounted for most of nai revenue.it would have been mere speculation,rather than reasonable inference,nevils,at,for the jury to conclude that applying accounting to the revenue from the ingram sales by themselves would have made a material difference in the company total revenue figures.because goyal jury had no competent evidence of materiality before it,it could not have properly convicted him on any of the securities counts.
the counts depended on two independent statements that goyal made in management representation letters to pwc that nai financial statements complied with gaap and that nai had disclosed all sales terms.the government charged goyal with willfully and knowingly making false statements to pwc.willfulness requires that goyal actions were voluntarily and knowingly wrongful.united states tarallo,cir.knowledge requires that goyal was aware of the falsification and did not falsify through ignorance,mistake,or accident.united states reyes,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the government therefore had to prove that goyal voluntarily made statements to pwc that he knew were false 
when the events in this case occurred,nai accounting for sales to distributors was governed by two gaap guidelines financial accounting standards board statement fas and statement of position sop.fas allowed the use of accounting only when 
the seller price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale 
the seller does not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer and 
the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
fas,fin.accounting standards,june.the only sop provision at issue in this case required that a v endor fee be fixed or determinable when revenue was recognized.the parties agreed that this condition was functionally equivalent to the substantially fixed or determinable prong of fas.
compliance with gaap 
the first basis for the counts requires us to decide whether the jury could have concluded that nai method of recognizing revenue violated gaap.the government had to prove that goyal representations to pwc that nai complied with gaap were materially false or misleading,and that he knew that.
it aids the analysis to group nai alleged gaap violations into two categories.the first category encompasses allegations that accounting was improper under gaap because terms of the ingram deals allegedly involved prices that were not substantially fixed or determinable,or allowed future returns that could not be reasonably estimated at the time of sale.fas,a,f.the second category involves nettools,the subsidiary nai used in and to repurchase product from ingram.the government alleged that nai use of nettools precluded revenue recognition because the arrangement amounted to nai significant obligation for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product.fas,e.
uncertain prices and returns 
the government argues that terms in the ingram deals allowing for future adjustments to prices,such as rebates,meant that prices were not substantially fixed or determinable when nai made the sales it is undisputed,however,that future contingencies do not render revenue recognition improper if the seller can reasonably estimate the effect of the contingencies and set aside reserves adequate to cover them.the prosecution,therefore,could only prove this species of gaap violation beyond a reasonable doubt by showing that nai reserves did not reasonably account for the terms of the sales.the prosecution failed to make its case on this point.
the government offered no evidence that nai reserves were,in fact,inadequate.instead,it relied on equivocal and conclusory statements from hans winters and robert stavers,two of nai auditors at the effect that sales terms like rebates would raise questions about the accounting the company was using.even where the witnesses testified that certain terms would preclude accounting,the government admits that adequate reserves would resolve these gaap problems,and the witnesses had no basis to opine on whether nai reserves actually were inadequate.
as the district court observed,no witness had done the work,or perform ed the computations that would establish a basis to render an opinion about how fas applied to nai financial statements,including the reserves it set aside with no evidence of what nai reserves were,or how they fell short of amounts that the ingram sales required,no reasonable juror could have found a gaap violation that depended on insufficient reserves.
a similar problem arose with respect to sales terms that allowed ingram to return software to nai.gaap only allows accounting to be used when t he amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated.fas,f.the government argued that certain terms in the transactions gave ingram an unlimited right to return software it purchased,and that an unlimited right of return automatically defeated accounting.
stavers testified,in response to a hypothetical question,that if the distributor had an unlimited right of return,then we do not believe it would have been possible to estimate the return.but he did not base this statement on an analysis of nai actual return estimations.fas lays out four factors that may impair the ability to make a reasonable estimate of future returns.fas.no witness applied these factors to nai deals or concluded that nai could not accurately estimate returns.the prosecution needed to prove what nai did,not what the terms made hypothetically possible.without evidence that ingram returns were not amenable to reasonable estimation,no reasonable juror could have found that using accounting for these sales violated gaap.
the nettools arrangement violated gaap if nai commitments to repurchase prespecified quantities of its software from ingram amounted to significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product.fas,e.goyal contends that the nettools commitments were not significant obligations because they were not technically binding agreements,but merely forecast s of how much software nettools would buy back from ingram.
one of ingram associate buyers testified that although there were no guarantees,the forecast came in every time for net tools if they said net tools was going to do million through the end of the quarter,on the last day of the quarter we were receiving net tools purchase orders up until in the morning to make sure that we hit million.ingram relied on the nettools forecasts to predict its own inventory.and nai used its nettools forecasts,in negotiations with ingram,to assure it that certain quantities of software would sell in subsequent quarters.even if these commitments were not formally enforceable,the evidence makes clear that both parties treated them as reliable and expected them to be honored.a reasonable juror could have concluded that the nettools commitments fell within the meaning of significant obligations,and thus that using accounting violated gaap.
even so,the prosecution had to prove that goyal willfully and knowingly misled pwc when he asserted that nai complied with gaap.we are mindful that the mere fact that evidence submitted by the government is wholly susceptible to innocent explanations,such as goyal alternative understanding of commitments,is not enough to reverse a conviction on appeal.united states wiseman,cir quoted and overruled by nevils,at.as long as the jury could have accepted a culpable explanation consistent with the proof of defendant conduct,we must assume,in the prosecution favor,that the jury did so.nevils,at see united states dinkane,cir the relevant inquiry is not whether the evidence excludes every hypothesis except guilt,but whether the jury could reasonably arrive at its verdict.the government nonetheless must offer some evidence to support a culpable explanation.w here there is a total failure of proof of the required mental state,we can not affirm a conviction.nevils,at quoting briceno scribner,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the government failure to offer any evidence supporting even an inference of willful and knowing deception undermines its case.
the government offers several ways that the jury coul
