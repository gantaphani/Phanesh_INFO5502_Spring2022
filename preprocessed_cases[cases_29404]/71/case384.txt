petitioner mfs securities mfs seeks review of an order of the securities and exchange commission the sec or the commission dismissing mfs application for review of its termination as a member organization by the new york stock exchange the nyse or the exchange.mfs urges that the commission was,as an institution,biased with respect to mfs and was therefore required to recuse itself and appoint an independent arbitrator to consider the petition the exchange was similarly biased and required to recuse itself in the matter and the commission erred in dismissing the petitioner application for review for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
background 
many of the facts underlying this petition are set out in our opinion in an earlier,related appeal in mfs securities nyse,cir mfs ii.we rehearse them here only insofar as we think necessary to explain our resolution of the petition.
mfs was an independent floor broker and member organization of the exchange,a organization sro subject to commission oversight pursuant to,mfs employed mark savarese and john savarese the savarese brothers,who were both members of the exchange,as floor brokers.
on february,the savarese brothers were arrested on charges that they had traded for an account in which they had an interest in violation of section a of the securities exchange act of,a,and sec rule.on the same day,they were summarily suspended from exchange membership.as far as we can tell from the record,the savarese brothers did not challenge their suspensions.
the arrests and suspensions of the savarese brothers were based on allegations that they had,inter alia,engaged in stock flipping or trading for eighths,a practice whereby a broker effects a purchase or sale of a security for a customer followed by its immediate sale or purchase,respectively,in order to capture the spread between the stock bid and ask prices.brokers who engage in flipping typically receive either a share of the profits thus earned or a commission that approximates half of the profits made through the transaction.the practice was viewed by the exchange at the time of the suspensions as a violation of section a and rule inasmuch as it consisted of trading,contrary to those provisions,for an account in which the broker had an interest.
during much of the,the exchange was apparently aware that some of its were engaged in flipping in the course of their trading activities on the floor of the exchange.on march,the exchange quality of markets committee established an ad hoc advisory committee on trading practices.its mission was to 
review,and,as appropriate,make recommendations regarding,a trading practice on the exchange whereby floor brokers and specialists represent both buy and sell orders in the same stock for a customer,and attempt to execute them in a manner that captures for the customer the spread between the bid and offer prices in that stock on the exchange,flipping.
new york stock exchange advisory comm.on trading practices,report on trading practices.the advisory committee was given the mandate to determine whether such trading interferes with public participation in the market and is a practice that is detrimental to the best interests of the exchange.id.
the ad hoc committee eventually issued a report on trading practices,recommending that restrictions be placed on trading because it gave at least the impression that the traders associated with exchange member floor brokers received a competitive advantage over the general investing public.id.at.but the report recommendation was not adopted.mfs alleges that,despite the report,the exchange encouraged flipping in order to augment the fees it collected based on floor brokers commissions and to increase the daily trading volume of the exchange,bolstering its apparent liquidity as compared to other stock exchanges.mfs further alleges that the savarese brothers performed flipping transactions on behalf of an mfs customer,the oakford corporation,in reliance on the nyse permissive view of the practice.
on february,the savarese brothers were suspended by the exchange for,inter alia,engaging in flipping transactions for oakford account.at the time of their suspension,the savarese brothers were the only officers or employees of mfs who were exchange members.mfs was therefore no longer then associated with an exchange member,a requirement for mfs to maintain its status as an exchange member organization.see nyse const.art.i,i,k,available at last visited.the exchange thereupon declared mfs status as a member organization terminated and disconnected its phone lines on the exchange floor.the exchange effected mfs suspension and termination without first providing notice to mfs or an opportunity for it to be heard.
the propriety of thus terminating mfs is doubtful in light of nyse rule a,which proscribes a person denial of access to services offered by the exchange unless the exchange shall have notified such person in writing of,and shall have given such person,upon not less than days prior written notice,an opportunity to be heard upon,the specific grounds for such prohibition or limitation.nyse rule a.but neither the savarese brothers,nor mfs in its initial,february,communication to the exchange relating to its termination,complained about the exchange possible violation of rule a.mfs told the exchange,instead,that mfs was attempting to hire another exchange member as a broker to enable mfs to maintain its membership in the exchange.mfs asked the exchange to permit mfs to maintain its status as a member organization in the interim pursuant to nyse rule f,which provides that,upon application,the exchange may grant a member organization whose sole member has died or ceased to be a member to continue as a member organization for up to days,provided such action is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest.nyse rule f.
on march,the nyse member firm regulation division the division denied mfs request for a rule f extension.on the same day,mfs informed the division that mfs had indeed hired an exchange member.mfs requested that,on that basis,mfs be permitted to continue as a member organization.on march,the division nonetheless notified mfs that,its new notwithstanding,it was no longer an exchange member organization.
two days later,on march,mfs protested its termination to the nyse board of directors the board,requesting review of its treatment by the division.mfs then,for the first time,argued that its termination without notice and an opportunity to be heard violated nyse rule a and d.in response,on april,the board remanded mfs complaint to the division.according to the board,the remand was for the purpose of 
promptly affording mfs a reasonable opportunity to present additional facts.appropriate written notice shall be given by the division and an appropriate record shall be made.the present status of mfs remains the same until the division renders a decision,which decision shall be rendered as promptly as practicable.
mfs sec,nyse board order.
but mfs chose not to make further submissions to the division.instead,on july,mfs brought suit against the exchange in the united states district court for the southern district of new york alleging that the exchange termination of mfs constituted an unlawful group boycott in violation of the sherman act,and a breach of contract.the district court jed rakoff,judge granted the exchange motion under federal rule of procedure b to dismiss mfs complaint as to both claims on the merits.mfs sec.nyse,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,mfs i.
mfs appealed to this court.by opinion dated january,we affirmed the district court dismissal of mfs breach of contract claim against the exchange,concluding that it was barred under the doctrine of immunity.mfs ii,at.as for the sherman act claim,however,we vacated the district court dismissal.recognizing that the sec had jurisdiction to consider many of the questions embedded in mfs complaint and believ ing that administrative review w ould be of material aid to the district court in resolving the claim brought by mfs,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,we remanded the action to the district court with directions for it to stay the proceedings until such time as the sec may have acted upon a promptly filed application for review,id.at.we did recognize,however,that i t w ould be up to the sec,in the first instance,to consider whether such an application is timely.id.
on february,mfs filed an application for review with the commission based on jurisdiction bestowed on the commission by d providing for review of sro disciplinary actions by the appropriate regulatory agency.on may,the sec harvey pitt,who,when he had been a lawyer in private practice,had represented the exchange in an sec investigation relating to the practices underlying this case,recused himself from consideration of the application.that being,in mfs view,insufficient protection for a fair hearing before the commission,on december,it requested that the commission disqualify itself entirely from considering the matter and appoint an independent arbitrator to do so instead.later,william donaldson was named pitt replacement as chairman.donaldson had previously served as exchange chairman during the early and in that capacity had received communications relating to the practice of flipping.he also recused himself from the mfs proceedings.nevertheless,mfs view was that the agency was hopelessly conflicted because of the incoming and outgoing chairmen deep involve ment in misconduct at the nyse.letter from dominic amorosa to margaret mcfarland,deputy secretary,sec,at.
the commission,chairman donaldson not participating,then addressed mfs application for review on the merits.mfs sec,exchange act release,docket,wl,sec lexis,mfs iii.it first noted that mfs had filed its application for commission review on february,long after the thirty days in which a person aggrieved by an sro must ordinarily seek commission review.see d.the commission decided,however,that our decision and the district court stay of proceedings upon remand allowing the commission to consider mfs complaint presented extraordinary circumstances justifying an extension of time for mfs to file its application with the commission.mfs iii,wl,at,sec lexis,at.
the commission then considered and rejected mfs request that the commission recuse itself with respect to the dispute in favor of an independent arbitrator.the commission noted that it was the only agency possessing statutory authority to review the adverse disciplinary actions of the exchange.the commission,citing ftc cement institute.explaining that the entire federal trade commission could not be disqualified based on an asserted conflict of interest from hearing a matter within its mandate where congress had not provided for any other agency to hear the kind of complaint at issue,reasoned that if the commission could not hear the case,no one could.it then concluded that,in any event,there was an insufficient conflict of interest to require recusal of the entire commission.outgoing commissioner pitt and incoming commissioner donaldson decisions to recuse themselves cured not only any possible conflict,but also any appearance of impropriety.
the sec then turned to mfs core grievance.the commission concluded that the nyse termination of mfs status as a member organization was without any process at all.mfs iii,wl,at,sec lexis,at.the commission noted,however,that the board had ruled that mfs was entitled to a hearing and had thereafter remanded the case to the division to permit mfs to provide further information relating to mfs grievance.acknowledging that the procedure crafted by the board was not identical to the procedure specified by nyse rule,wl,at,sec lexis,at,the commission nonetheless concluded it appears that the proffered hearing would have provided fair procedures in accordance with the exchange act,wl,at,sec lexis,at.
the commission observed,however,that mfs had not availed itself of the opportunity to participate in those further proceedings before the exchange,opting instead to file its lawsuit in federal district court.the commission noted that it had previously refused to consider arguments on appeal from applicants who failed to avail themselves of an sro procedures,wl,at,sec lexis,at.emphasizing the importance of utilizing such remedies in order to generate a record for review,the commission dismissed mfs application on the ground that it had failed to exhaust the procedures provided by the exchange.
mfs thereupon petitioned us for review of the sec decision pursuant to a and on three grounds.first,mfs argues that the commission was required to recuse itself entirely from consideration of mfs petition because of donaldson and pitt conflicts of interest.second,mfs asserts that the exchange also should have recused itself.although as far as we can tell from the record before us,mfs raised no such claim when it appealed to the exchange board,it now argues that the board was laboring under an acute conflict of interest because of the involvement of richard grasso,then the exchange chairman of the board,in the development and promulgation of the nyse interpretations permitting and encouraging,inter alia,flipping.petitioner br.at.third,mfs contends that the commission failed to act rationally in exercising its discretion to dismiss mfs petition for failure to exhaust exchange remedies.
we disagree on all counts and therefore deny the petition and affirm.

ii.alleged conflicts of interest 
a.the commission 
mfs argues that because commission chairmen pitt and donaldson labored under personal conflicts of interest with respect to mfs application for review,the commission itself was hopelessly conflicted.petitioner br.at.according to mfs,the commission as a whole was therefore required to recuse itself from reviewing mfs termination as an exchange member organization.mfs suggests that the commission should have delegated the proceedings to an independent arbitrator instead.
we disagree.irrespective of pitt and donaldson personal interests,if any,in the outcome of mfs case,their personal recusals were sufficient to cure any impropriety or appearance of impropriety with respect to the commission proceedings.
under the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments,parties and the public are entitled to tribunals free of personal bias.in re murchison.see also chew dietrich,cir.observing that the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments create equivalent requirements for most purposes,cert.denied,d.this requirement is applicable to administrative agencies such as the commission in much the same way as it is applicable to courts.see gibson berryhill,d.although claims of bias must overcome a presumption of honesty and integrity in those serving as adjudicators,withrow larkin,d,persons ruling on disputes may not hear or determine cases if they have an interest in the outcome,in re murchison,at.
but t hat interest in an outcome that requires recusal can not be defined with precision.circumstances and relationships must be considered.id.while an adjudicator substantial pecuniary interest in a proceeding obviously requires recusal,gibson,at,other interests might require recusal,too.
fortunately,we need not address this often knotty question here.whether or not chairman pitt or chairman donaldson suffered from a conflict of interest that required their recusal,they did in fact recuse themselves.due process required no more.while mfs application for review had the potential for embarrassing the exchange and,perhaps,generating controversy had mfs established donaldson alleged approval of flipping during his time as exchange chairman,for example,there is no basis upon which we can conclude that the commission,as an institution,was somehow thereby disqualified from considering and ruling on the controversy.
in general,courts have been reluctant to impute a conflict of interest on the part of an individual tribunal member to the entire tribunal.see,aetna life ins.lavoie,d antoniu sec,cir,cert.denied,d blinder,robinson sec,cert.denied,d amos treat sec,united states oregon,cir refusing to impute to a state administrative tribunal the hostility of an oregon department and officials toward the position of an indian tribe in a water rights dispute in which the department and officials would assist the adjudicator in developing an administrative record,cert.denied,d.
in aetna life,the supreme court considered and rejected an argument similar to that made by mfs.it refused to impute the conflict of one state supreme court justice to the entire court.the underlying controversy related to the tort of refusal to pay a valid insurance claim.at.during the pendency of the case,justice embry of the alabama supreme court filed two similar refusal to pay claims against insurance companies in alabama state court.one of the suits was a class action against blue shield of alabama on behalf of alabama state employees insured under a group plan,a class which apparently included all of the alabama justices.id.at.finding that justice embry therefore had a substantial interest in the outcome of the case in question,the supreme court vacated the judgment and remanded the action so that the alabama supreme court could rehear the case without his participation.id.at.but the court rejected the argument that due process also required the other justices of the alabama supreme court to recuse themselves from the case.id.at.to rule otherwise,the court feared,might require the disqualification of every judge in the state.id.at.
similarly,in blinder,robinson,the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit rejected a due process argument very much like that made by mfs here.there,the commission had been involved in litigation against them in federal court and then had adjudicated an administrative claim against the petitioners.blinder,robinson,at.the petitioners argued that the commission role as their adversary in litigation prevented it from being an impartial administrative adjudicator in the petitioners administrative action.id.the court rejected the argument that due process considerations prohibited the commission from seeking administrative sanctions against the petitioners,even though one of the commissioners on the tribunal had participated in the earlier litigation.id.at.it would be a strange rule indeed that presumed that the bias spread to infect commissioners who were not even involved in the litigation.id.here,too,we think it absurd to suggest,without more,that any bias on the part of the recused commission chairmen somehow spread to infect the commission as a whole.
of course,the cases upon which we rely are not identical to mfs.in blinder,robinson and amos treat,for instance,the conflict involved a commissioner who had previously acted in a prosecutorial role against a person who subsequently came before the commission in an adjudicatory proceeding.but if the contagion did not spread to the entire commission there,we do not see on what basis we can conclude that it might have spread to the commission here.
the only case mfs cites in which due process required an entire administrative body to recuse itself,gibson berryhill,at,is not helpful to mfs or to us.there,the disqualification of the tribunal was based on the personal pecuniary interest of every tribunal member in a proceeding requiring them to pass on issues related to competitors.id.at.mfs,by contrast,alleges no personal interest on the part of the other commissioners.it argues only that the potential for the case to embarrass chairmen pitt and donaldson,and the related threat of controversy surrounding the proceedings,required the entire commission to withdraw from the case.we have never held that the mere possibility that a proceeding might embarrass a colleague of members of a tribunal,or even the tribunal as a whole,constitutes a conflict of interest requiring recusal.blinder,robinson,at rejecting the notion that the commission as a whole is biased where the agency institutional prestige is at stake.
in this case,moreover,the very structure of the commission alleviates mfs professed concern.the commission consists of five commissioners who are appointed by the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate for terms.a.far from being a unitary body,the commission is thus intentionally designed to reflect multiple viewpoints.see id.not more than three of such commissioners shall be members of the same political party,and in making appointments members of different political parties shall be appointed alternately as nearly as may be practicable.and although the chairman of the commission is the most powerful of the five commissioners owing to his or her additional executive powers within the agency,the power to remove commissioners belongs to the president,and even that is commonly understood to be limited to removal for inefficiency,neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.sec blinder,robinson,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.we think that the relative independence of the sec commissioners is yet another barrier to any spread from chairman to commissioners.
at the end of the day,then,on the record before us,we are of the view that it is nonsense to assert,as mfs does,that a recused chairman previous legal representation of the exchange or previous chairmanship of the exchange in and of itself so hopelessly pollutes the commission that it thereby becomes incapable of performing its oversight responsibilities with respect to the exchange.we can not require,as a matter of constitutional law,that administrative tribunals disqualify themselves for the most theoretical and remote of reasons.to do so might well impair their ability to fulfill their congressionally imposed adjudicative functions.we therefore conclude that the commission did not abuse its discretion when it decided to hear mfs petition for review.
we can not,of course,foreclose the possibility that there may one day indeed that there has once case in which the conflict of interest of a person associated with an agency taints or tainted the entire agency,thereby disqualifying it from ruling in a particular matter.this is not that case 
b.the exchange 
mfs also argues that exchange chairman richard grasso alleged involvement in the promotion of flipping at the exchange prejudiced him,and thus the exchange as an institution,against mfs.according to mfs,not only was grasso therefore required to recuse himself,the entire exchange like the commission was required to disqualify itself and refer the mfs matter to an independent arbitrator.
in our opinion in sec,cir,decided today,we discuss in some detail the extent,if any,to which due process requirements apply to proceedings before the exchange,a private corporation exercising congressionally delegated authority.id.at.we need not reach that issue in the present case,however.
mfs did not,when it was before the commission,raise its argument that chairman grasso involvement in the promotion of flipping required the disqualification of the nyse.mfs petitions us for review of the commission order pursuant to a.when conducting section review,we are foreclosed from considering arguments not raised before the commission.c no objection to an order or rule of the commission,for which review is sought under this section,may be considered by the court unless it was urged before the commission or there was reasonable ground for failure to do so.see also gilligan,will sec,cir applying section to foreclose judicial review of issue not raised before the commission.although mfs did argue,when seeking to avoid the requirement that it
