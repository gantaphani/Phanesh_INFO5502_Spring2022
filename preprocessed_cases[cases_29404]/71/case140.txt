todd newman and anthony chiasson appeal from judgments of conviction entered on may,and may,respectively in the united states district court for the southern district of new york richard sullivan,following a jury trial on charges of securities fraud in violation of sections b and of the securities exchange act of the act,stat,codified as amended at b,securities and exchange commission sec rules and codified at b,and,and conspiracy to commit securities fraud in violation of.
the government alleged that a cohort of analysts at various hedge funds and investment firms obtained material,nonpublic information from employees of publicly traded technology companies,shared it amongst each other,and subsequently passed this information to the portfolio managers at their respective companies.the government charged newman,a portfolio manager at diamondback capital management,llc diamondback,and chiasson,a portfolio manager at level global investors,level global,with willfully participating in this insider trading scheme by trading in securities based on the inside information illicitly obtained by this group of analysts.on appeal,newman and chiasson challenge the sufficiency of the evidence as to several elements of the offense,and further argue that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury that it must find that a tippee knew that the insider disclosed confidential information in exchange for a personal benefit.
we agree that the jury instruction was erroneous because we conclude that,in order to sustain a conviction for insider trading,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the tippee knew that an insider disclosed confidential information and that he did so in exchange for a personal benefit.moreover,we hold that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a guilty verdict against newman and chiasson for two reasons.first,the government evidence of any personal benefit received by the alleged insiders was insufficient to establish the tipper liability from which defendants purported tippee liability would derive.second,even assuming that the scant evidence offered on the issue of personal benefit was sufficient,which we conclude it was not,the government presented no evidence that newman and chiasson knew that they were trading on information obtained from insiders in violation of those insiders fiduciary duties.
accordingly,we reverse the convictions of newman and chiasson on all counts and remand with instructions to dismiss the indictment as it pertains to them with prejudice.
background 
this case arises from the government ongoing investigation into suspected insider trading activity at hedge funds.on january,the government unsealed charges against newman,chiasson,and several other investment professionals.on february,a grand jury returned an indictment.on august,a superseding indictment cr.rjs the indictment was filed.count one of the indictment charged newman,chiasson,and a with conspiracy to commit securities fraud,in violation of.each of counts two through five charged newman and each of counts six through ten charged chiasson with securities fraud,in violation of sections b and of the act,sec rules and,and.a was charged with securities fraud in counts eleven and twelve.
at trial,the government presented evidence that a group of financial analysts exchanged information they obtained from company insiders,both directly and more often indirectly.specifically,the government alleged that these analysts received information from insiders at dell and nvidia disclosing those companies earnings numbers before they were publicly released in dell may and august earnings announcements and nvidia may earnings announcement.these analysts then passed the inside information to their portfolio managers,including newman and chiasson,who,in turn,executed trades in dell and nvidia stock,earning approximately million and million,respectively,in profits for their respective funds.
newman and chiasson were several steps removed from the corporate insiders and there was no evidence that either was aware of the source of the inside information.with respect to the dell tipping chain,the evidence established that rob ray of dell investor relations department tipped information regarding dell consolidated earnings numbers to sandy goyal,an analyst at neuberger berman.goyal in turn gave the information to diamondback analyst jesse tortora.tortora in turn relayed the information to his manager newman as well as to other analysts including level global analyst spyridon sam adondakis.adondakis then passed along the dell information to chiasson,making newman and chiasson three and four levels removed from the inside tipper,respectively.
with respect to the nvidia tipping chain,the evidence established that chris choi of nvidia finance unit tipped inside information to hyung lim,a former executive at technology companies broadcom and altera,whom choi knew from church.lim passed the information to danny kuo,an analyst at whittier trust.kuo circulated the information to the group of analyst friends,including tortora and adondakis,who in turn gave the information to newman and chiasson,making newman and chiasson four levels removed from the inside tippers.
although ray and choi have yet to be charged administratively,civilly,or criminally for insider trading or any other wrongdoing,the government charged that newman and chiasson were criminally liable for insider trading because,as sophisticated traders,they must have known that information was disclosed by insiders in breach of a fiduciary duty,and not for any legitimate corporate purpose.
at the close of evidence,newman and chiasson moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure.they argued that there was no evidence that the corporate insiders provided inside information in exchange for a personal benefit which is required to establish tipper liability under dirks.because a tippee liability derives from the liability of the tipper,newman and chiasson argued that they could not be found guilty of insider trading.newman and chiasson also argued that,even if the corporate insiders had received a personal benefit in exchange for the inside information,there was no evidence that they knew about any such benefit.absent such knowledge,appellants argued,they were not aware of,or participants in,the tippers fraudulent breaches of fiduciary duties to dell or nvidia,and could not be convicted of insider trading under dirks.in the alternative,appellants requested that the court instruct the jury that it must find that newman and chiasson knew that the corporate insiders had disclosed confidential information for personal benefit in order to find them guilty.
the district court reserved decision on the rule motions.with respect to the appellants requested jury charge,while the district court acknowledged that their position was supportable certainly by the language of dirks,tr,it ultimately found that it was constrained by this court decision in obus,cir,which listed the elements of tippee liability without enumerating knowledge of a personal benefit received by the insider as a separate element.tr.accordingly,the district court did not give newman and chiasson proposed jury instruction.instead,the district court gave the following instructions on the tippers intent and the personal benefit requirement 
now,if you find that ray choi had a fiduciary or other relationship of trust and confidence with their employers,then you must next consider whether the g overnment has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that they intentionally breached that duty of trust and confidence by disclosing material,nonpublic information for their own benefit.
on the issue of the appellants knowledge,the district court instructed the jury 
to meet its burden,the g overnment must also prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant you are considering knew that the material,nonpublic information had been disclosed by the insider in breach of a duty of trust and confidence.the mere receipt of material,nonpublic information by a defendant,and even trading on that information,is not sufficient he must have known that it was originally disclosed by the insider in violation of a duty of confidentiality.
on december,the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts.the district court subsequently denied the appellants rule motions.
on may,the district court sentenced newman to an aggregate term of months imprisonment,to be followed by one year of supervised release,imposed a mandatory special assessment,and ordered newman to pay a million fine and to forfeit.on may,the district court sentenced chiasson to an aggregate term of months imprisonment,to be followed by one year of supervised release,imposed a mandatory special assessment,and ordered him to pay a million fine and forfeiture in an amount not to exceed million this appeal followed.
discussion 
newman and chiasson raise a number of arguments on appeal.because we conclude that the jury instructions were erroneous and that there was insufficient evidence to support the convictions,we address only the arguments relevant to these issues.we review jury instructions de novo with regard to whether the jury was misled or inadequately informed about the applicable law.see united states moran toala,cir.
i.the law of insider trading 
section b of the act,b,prohibits the use in connection with the purchase or sale of any security of any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe although section b was designed as a clause to prevent fraudulent practices,ernst ernst hochfelder,neither the statute nor the regulations issued pursuant to it,including rule,expressly prohibit insider trading.rather,the unlawfulness of insider trading is predicated on the notion that insider trading is a type of securities fraud proscribed by section b and rule.see chiarella united states.
a.the classical and misappropriation theories of insider trading 
the classical theory holds that a corporate insider such as an officer or director violates section b and rule by trading in the corporation securities on the basis of material,nonpublic information about the corporation.id.at.under this theory,there is a special relationship of trust and confidence between the shareholders of a corporation and those insiders who have obtained confidential information by reason of their position within that corporation.id.at.as a result of this relationship,corporate insiders that possess material,nonpublic information have a duty to disclose or to abstain from trading because of the necessity of preventing a corporate insider from tak ing unfair advantage of uninformed stockholders.id.at citation omitted.
in accepting this theory of insider trading,the supreme court explicitly rejected the notion of a general duty between all participants in market transactions to forgo actions based on material,nonpublic information.id.at.instead,the court limited the scope of insider trading liability to situations where the insider had a duty to disclose arising from a relationship of trust and confidence between parties to a transaction,such as that between corporate officers and shareholders.id.at.
an alternative,but overlapping,theory of insider trading liability,commonly called the misappropriation theory,expands the scope of insider trading liability to certain other outsiders,who do not have any fiduciary or other relationship to a corporation or its shareholders.liability may attach where an outsider possesses material information about a corporation and another person uses that information to trade in breach of a duty owed to the owner.united states,united states libera,cir.in other words,such conduct violates section b because the misappropriator engages in deception by pretending loyalty to the principal while secretly converting the principal information for personal gain.obus,at citations omitted.
tipping liability 
the insider trading case law,however,is not confined to insiders or misappropriators who trade for their own accounts.id.at.courts have expanded insider trading liability to reach situations where the insider or misappropriator in possession of material nonpublic information the tipper does not himself trade but discloses the information to an outsider a tippee who then trades on the basis of the information before it is publicly disclosed.see dirks,at.the elements of tipping liability are the same,regardless of whether the tipper duty arises under the classical or the misappropriation theory.obus,at.
in dirks,the supreme court addressed the liability of a tippee analyst who received material,nonpublic information about possible fraud at an insurance company from one of the insurance company former officers.dirks,at.the analyst relayed the information to some of his clients who were investors in the insurance company,and some of them,in turn,sold their shares based on the analyst tip.id.the sec charged the analyst dirks with aiding and abetting securities fraud by relaying confidential and material inside information to people who traded the stock.
in reviewing the appeal,the court articulated the general principle of tipping liability not only are insiders forbidden by their fiduciary relationship from personally using undisclosed corporate information to their advantage,but they may not give such information to an outsider for the same improper purpose of exploiting the information for their personal gain.id.at citation omitted.the test for determining whether the corporate insider has breached his fiduciary duty is whether the insider personally will benefit,directly or indirectly,from his disclosure.absent some personal gain,there has been no breach of duty id.at emphasis added.
the supreme court rejected the sec theory that a recipient of confidential information the tippee must refrain from trading whenever he receives inside information from an insider.id.at.instead,the court held that t he tippee duty to disclose or abstain is derivative from that of the insider duty.id.at.because the tipper breach of fiduciary duty requires that he personally will benefit,directly or indirectly,from his disclosure,id.at,a tippee may not be held liable in the absence of such benefit.moreover,the supreme court held that a tippee may be found liable only when the insider has breached his fiduciary duty and the tippee knows or should know that there has been a breach.id.at emphasis added.in dirks,the corporate insider provided the confidential information in order to expose a fraud in the company and not for any personal benefit,and thus,the court found that the insider had not breached his duty to the company shareholders and that dirks could not be held liable as tippee.
liability for securities fraud also requires proof that the defendant acted with scienter,which is defined as a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate or defraud.hochfelder,at.in order to establish a criminal violation of the securities laws,the government must show that the defendant acted willfully.a.we have defined willfulness in this context as a realization on the defendant part that he was doing a wrongful act under the securities laws.united states cassese,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also united states dixon,cir holding that to establish willfulness,the government must establish a realization on the defendant part that he was doing a wrongful act under the securities laws and that such an act involve d a significant risk of effecting the violation that occurred.quotation omitted.
ii.the requirements of tippee liability 
the government concedes that tippee liability requires proof of a personal benefit to the insider.gov t br.however,the government argues that it was not required to prove that newman and chiasson knew that the insiders at dell and nvidia received a personal benefit in order to be found guilty of insider trading.instead,the government contends,consistent with the district court instruction,that it merely needed to prove that the defendants traded on material,nonpublic information they knew insiders had disclosed in breach of a duty of confidentiality gov t br.
in support of this position,the government cites dirks for the proposition that the supreme court only required that the tippee know that the tipper disclosed information in breach of a duty.id.at citing dirks,at emphasis added.in addition,the government relies on dicta in a number of our decisions,in which we have described the elements of tippee liability without specifically stating that the government must prove that the tippee knew that the corporate insider who disclosed confidential information did so for his own personal benefit.id.at citing,inter alia,united states jiau,cir obus,at warde,cir.by selectively parsing this dictum,the government seeks to revive the absolute bar on tippee trading that the supreme court explicitly rejected in dirks.
although this court has been accused of being somewhat delphic in our discussion of what is required to demonstrate tippee liability,united states whitman,d,the supreme court was quite clear in dirks.first,the tippee liability derives only from the tipper breach of a fiduciary duty,not from trading on material,information.see chiarella,at noting that there is no general duty between all participants in market transactions to forgo actions based on material,nonpublic information.second,the corporate insider has committed no breach of fiduciary duty unless he receives a personal benefit in exchange for the disclosure.third,even in the presence of a tipper breach,a tippee is liable only if he knows or should have known of the breach.
while we have not yet been presented with the question of whether the tippee knowledge of a tipper breach requires knowledge of the tipper personal benefit,the answer follows naturally from dirks.dirks counsels us that the exchange of confidential information for personal benefit is not separate from an insider fiduciary breach it is the fiduciary breach that triggers liability for securities fraud under rule.for purposes of insider trading liability,the insider disclosure of confidential information,standing alone,is not a breach.thus,without establishing that the tippee knows of the personal benefit received by the insider in exchange for the disclosure,the government can not meet its burden of showing that the tippee knew of a breach.
the government overreliance on our prior dicta merely highlights the doctrinal novelty of its recent insider trading prosecutions,which are increasingly targeted at remote tippees many levels removed from corporate insiders.by contrast,our prior cases generally involved tippees who directly participated in the tipper breach and therefore had knowledge of the tipper disclosure for personal benefit or tippees who were explicitly apprised of the tipper gain by an intermediary tippee.see,jiau,at to provide an incentive,jiau promised the tippers insider information for their own private trading.united states falcone,cir affirming conviction of remote tipper where intermediary tippee paid the inside tipper and had told remote tippee the details of the scheme warde,at tipper and tippee engaged in parallel trading of the inside information and discussed not only the inside information,but also the best way to profit from it united states mylett,cir tippee acquired inside information directly from his insider friend.we note that the government has not cited,nor have we found,a single case in which tippees as remote as newman and chiasson have been held criminally liable for insider trading.
jiau illustrates the importance of this distinction quite clearly.in jiau,the panel was presented with the question of whether the evidence at trial was sufficient to prove that the tippers personally benefitted from their disclosure of insider information.in that context,we summarized the elements of criminal liability as follows 
the were entrusted the duty to protect confidential information,which they breached by disclosing the information to their tippee,who knew of the tippers duty and still used the information to trade a security or further tip the information for the tippee benefit,and finally the benefited in some way from their disclosure.
jiau,at citing dirks,at obus,at.the government relies on this language to argue that jiau is merely the most recent in a string of cases in which this court has found that a tippee,in order to be criminally liable for insider trading,need know only that an disclosed information in breach of a duty ofconfidentiality.gov t br.however,we reject the government position that our cursory recitation of the elements in jiau suggests that criminal liability may be imposed on a defendant based only on knowledge of a breach of a duty of confidentiality.in jiau,the defendant knew about the benefit because she provided it.for that reason,we had no need to reach the question of whether knowledge of a breach requires that a tippee know that a personal benefit was provided to the tipper.
in light of dirks,we find no support for the government contention that knowledge of a breach of the duty of confidentiality without knowledge of the personal benefit is sufficient to impose criminal liability.although the government might like the law to be different,nothing in the law requires a symmetry of information in the nation securities markets.the supreme court explicitly repudiated this premise not only in dirks,but in a predecessor case,chiarella united states.in chiarella,the supreme court rejected this circuit conclusion that the federal securities laws have created a system providing equal access to information necessary for reasoned and intelligent investment decisions because material information gives certain buyers or sellers an unfair advantage over less informed buyers and sellers.at.the supreme court emphasized that t his reasoning suffers from a defect because not every instance of financial unfairness constitutes fraudulent activity under b.id.see also united states chestman,cir winter,concurring the policy rationale for prohibiting insider trading stops well short of prohibiting all trading on material nonpublic information.efficient capital markets depend on the protection of property rights in information.however,they also require that persons who acquire and act on information about companies be able to profit from the information they generate.thus,in both chiarella and dirks,the supreme court affirmatively established that insider trading liability is based on breaches of fiduciary duty,not on informational asymmetries.this is a critical limitation on insider trading liability that protects a corporation interests in confidentiality while promoting efficiency in the nation securities markets.
as noted above,dirks clearly defines a breach of fiduciary duty as a breach of the duty of confidentiality in exchange for a personal benefit.see dirks,at.accordingly,we conclude that a tippee knowledge of the insider breach necessarily requires knowledge that the insider disclosed confidential information in exchange for personal benefit.in reaching this conclusion,we join every other district court to our knowledge apart from judge that has confronted this question.compare united states rengan rajaratnam,july,buchwald,united states martoma,gardephe,united states whitman,d,rakoff,united states raj rajaratnam,d,holwell,state teachers retirement bd.fluor,sweet,with united states steinberg,wl at may,sullivan,and united states newman,sullivan,
our conclusion also comports with principles of substantive criminal law.as the supreme court explained in staples united states,under the common law,mens rea,which requires that the defendant know the facts that make his conduct illegal,is a necessary element in every crime.such a requirement is particularly appropriate in insider trading cases where we have acknowledged it is easy to imagine a trader who receives a tip and is unaware that his conduct was illegal and therefore wrongful.united states kaiser,cir.this is also a statutory requirement,because only willful violations are subject to criminal provision.see united states temple,cir willful repeatedly has been defined in the criminal context as intentional,purposeful,and voluntary,as distinguished from accidental or negligent.
in sum,we hold that to sustain an insider trading conviction against a tippee,the government must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt that the corporate insider was entrusted with a fiduciary duty the corporate insider breached his fiduciary duty by a disclosing confidential information to a tippee b in exchange for a personal benefit the tippee knew of the tipper breach,that is,he knew the information was confidential and divulged for personal benefit and the tippee still used that information to trade in a security or tip another individual for personal benefit.see jiau,at dirks,at.
in view of this conclusion,we find,reviewing the charge as a whole,united states mitchell,cir,that the district court instruction failed to accurately advise the jury of the law.the district court charged the jury that the government had to prove that the insiders had a fiduciary or other relationship of trust and confidence with their corporations that they breached that duty of trust and confidence by disclosing material,nonpublic information that they personally benefited in some way from the disclosure that the defendant knew the information he obtained had been disclosed in breach of a duty and that the defendant used the information to purchase a security.under these instructions,a reasonable juror might have concluded that a defendant could be criminally liable for insider trading merely if such defendant knew that an insider had divulged information that was required to be kept confidential.but a breach of the duty of confidentiality is not fraudulent unless the tipper acts for personal benefit,that is to say,there is no breach unless the tipper is in effect selling the information to its recipient for cash,reciprocal information,or other things of value for himself dirks,at quotation omitted.thus,the district court was required to instruct the jury that the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that newman and chiasson knew that the tippers received a personal benefit for their disclosure.
the government argues that any possible instructional error was harmless because the jury could have found that newman and chiasson inferred from the circumstances that some benefit was provided to or anticipated by the insiders.gov t br.we disagree.
an instructional error is harmless only if the government demonstrates that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error.neder united states,accord moran toala,at united states quattrone,cir.the harmless error inquiry requires us to view whether the evidence introduced was uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence such that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error.neder,at.here both chiasson and newman contested their knowledge of any benefit received by the tippers and,in fact,elicited evidence sufficient to support a contrary finding.moreover,we conclude that the government evidence of any personal benefit received by the insiders was insufficient to establish tipper liability from which chiasson and newman purported tippee liability would derive.
iii.insufficiency of the evidence 
as a general matter,a defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence bears a heavy burden,as the standard of review is exceedingly deferential.united states coplan,cir.specifically,we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,crediting every inference that could have been drawn in the government favor,and deferring to the jury assessment of witness credibility and its assessment of the weight of the evidence.id.citing united states chavez,cir.although sufficiency review is de novo,we will uphold the judgments of conviction if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.citing united states yannotti,cir emphasis omitted jackson virginia.this standard of review draws no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence.the government is entitled to prove its case solely through circumstantial evidence,provided,of course,that the government still demonstrates each element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt.united states lorenzo,cir.
however,if the evidence is nonexistent or so meager,united states guadagna,cir,such that it gives equal or nearly equal circumstantial support to a theory of guilt and a theory of innocence,then a reasonable jury must necessarily entertain a reasonable doubt,cassese,at.because few events in the life of an individual are more important than a criminal conviction,we continue to consider the beyond a reasonable doubt requirement with utmost seriousness.cassese,at.here,we find that the government evidence failed to reach that threshold,even when viewed in the light most favorable to it.
the circumstantial evidence in this case was simply too thin to warrant the inference that the corporate insiders received any personal benefit in exchange for their tips.as to the dell tips,the government established that goyal and ray were not close friends,but had known each other for years,having both attended business school and worked at dell together.further,ray,who wanted to become a wall street analyst like goyal,sought career advice and assistance from goyal.the evidence further showed that goyal advised ray on a range of topics,from discussing the qualifying examination in order to become a financial analyst to editing ray résumé and sending it to a wall street recruiter,and that some of this assistance began before ray began to provide tips about dell earnings.the evidence also established that lim and choi were family friends that had met through church and occasionally socialized together.the government argues that these facts were sufficient to prove that the tippers derived some benefit from the tip.we disagree.if this was a benefit,practically anything would qualify.
we have observed that p ersonal benefit is broadly defined to include not only pecuniary gain,but also,inter alia,any reputational benefit that will translate into future earnings and the benefit one would obtain from simply making a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend.jiau,at internal citations,alterations,and quotation marks deleted.this standard,although permissive,does not suggest that the government may prove the receipt of a personal benefit by the mere fact of a friendship,particularly of a casual or social nature.if that were true,and the government was allowed to meet its burden by proving that two individuals were alumni of the same school or attended the same church,the personal benefit requirement would be a nullity.to the extent dirks suggests that a personal benefit may be inferred from a personal relationship between the tipper and tippee,where the tippee trades resemble trading by the insider himself followed by a gift of the profits to the recipient,see at,we hold that such an inference is impermissible in the absence of proof of a meaningfully close personal relationship that generates an exchange that is objective,consequential,and represents at least a potential gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature.in other words,as judge walker noted in jiau,this requires evidence of a relationship between the insider and the recipient that suggests a quid pro quo from the latter,or an intention to benefit the latter.jiau,at.
while our case law at times emphasizes language from dirks indicating that the tipper gain need not be immediately pecuniary,it does not erode the fundamental insight that,in order to form the basis for a fraudulent breach,the personal benefit received in exchange for confidential information must be of some consequence.for example,in jiau,we noted that at least one of the corporate insiders received something more than the ephemeral benefit of the value of jiau friendship because he also obtained access to an investment club where stock tips and insight were routinely discussed.id.thus,by joining the investment club,the tipper entered into a relationship of quid quo pro with jiau,and therefore had the opportunity to access information that could yield future pecuniary gain.id see also sec yun,cir finding evidence of personal benefit where tipper and tippee worked closely together in real estate deals and commonly split commissions on various real estate transactions sec sargent,cir finding evidence of personal benefit when the tipper passed information to a friend who referred others to the tipper for dental work.
here the career advice that goyal gave ray,the dell tipper,was little more than the encouragement one would generally expect of a fellow alumnus or casual acquaintance.see,offering minor suggestions on a resume,offering advice prior to an informational interview.crucially,goyal testified that he would have given ray advice without receiving information because he routinely did so for industry colleagues.although the government argues that the jury could have reasonably inferred from the evidence that ray and goyal swapped career advice for inside information,ray himself disavowed that any such quid pro quo existed.further,the evidence showed goyal began giving ray career advice over a year before ray began providing any insider information.tr.thus,it would not be possible under the circumstances for a jury in a criminal trial to find beyond a reasonable doubt that ray received a personal benefit in exchange for the disclosure of confidential information.see,united states,cir evidence must be sufficient to reasonably infer guilt.
the evidence of personal benefit was even more scant in the nvidia chain.choi and lim were merely casual acquaintances.the evidence did not establish a history of loans or personal favors between the two.during cross examination,lim testified that he did not provide anything of value to choi in exchange for the information.tr.lim further testified that choi did not know that lim was trading nvidia stock and in fact for the relevant period lim did not trade stock,thus undermining any inference that choi intended to make a gift of the profits earned on any transaction based on confidential information.
even assuming that the scant evidence described above was sufficient to permit the inference of a personal benefit,which we conclude it was not,the government presented absolutely no testimony or any other evidence that newman and chiasson knew that they were trading on information obtained from insiders,or that those insiders received any benefit in exchange for such disclosures,or even that newman and chiasson consciously avoided learning of these facts.as discussed above,the government is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that newman and chiasson knew that the insiders received a personal benefit in exchange for disclosing confidential information.
it is largely uncontroverted that chiasson and newman,and even their analysts,who testified as cooperating witnesses for the government,knew next to nothing about the insiders and nothing about what,if any,personal benefit had been provided to them.adondakis said that he did not know what the relationship between the insider and the tippee was,nor was he aware of any personal benefits exchanged for the information,nor did he communicate any such information to chiasson.adondakis testified that he merely told chiasson that goyal was talking to someone within dell,and that a friend of a friend of tortora would be getting nvidia information.tr.adondakis further testified that he did not specifically tell chiasson that the source of the nvidia information worked at nvidia.similarly,tortora testified that,while he was aware goyal received information from someone at dell who had access to overall financial numbers,he was not aware of the insider name,or position,or the circumstances of how goyal obtained the information.tortora further testified that he did not know whether choi received a personal benefit for disclosing inside information regarding nvidia.
the government now invites us to conclude that the jury could have found that the appellants knew the insiders disclosed the information for some personal reason rather than for no reason at all.gov t br.but the supreme court affirmatively rejected the premise that a tipper who discloses confidential information necessarily does so to receive a personal benefit.see dirks,at all disclosures of confidential corporate information are not inconsistent with the duty insiders owe to shareholders.moreover,it is inconceivable that a jury could conclude,beyond a reasonable doubt,that newman and chiasson were aware of a personal benefit,when adondakis and tortora,who were more intimately involved in the insider trading scheme as part of the corrupt analyst group,disavowed any such knowledge.
alternatively,the government contends that the specificity,timing,and frequency of the updates provided to newman and chiasson about dell and nvidia were so overwhelmingly suspicious that they warranted various material inferences that could support a guiltyverdict.gov t br.newman and chiasson received four updates on dell earnings numbers in the weeks leading up to its august earnings announcement.similarly,newman and chiasson received multiple updates on nvidia earnings numbers between the close of the quarter and the company earnings announcement.the government argues that given the detailed nature and accuracy of these updates,newman and chiasson must have known,or deliberately avoided knowing,that the information originated with corporate insiders,and that those insiders disclosed the information in exchange for a personal benefit.we disagree.
even viewed in the light most favorable to the government,the evidence presented at trial undermined the inference of knowledge in several ways.the evidence established that analysts at hedge funds routinely estimate metrics such as revenue,gross margin,operating margin,and earnings per share through legitimate financial modeling using publicly available information and educated assumptions about industry and company trends.for example,on,cooperating witness goyal testified that under his financial model on dell,when he ran the model in january without any inside information,he calculated may quarter results of billion revenue,gross margin,and earnings per share.tr.these estimates came very close to dell reported earnings of billion revenue gross margin,and earnings per share.appellants also elicited testimony from the cooperating witnesses and investor relations associates that analysts routinely solicited information from companies in order to check assumptions in their models in advance of earnings announcements.goyal testified that he frequently spoke to internal relations departments to run his model by them and ask whether his assumptions were too high or too low or in the ball park,which suggests analysts routinely updated numbers in advance of the earnings announcements.tr.ray supervisor confirmed that investor relations departments routinely assisted analysts with developing their models 
moreover,the evidence established that nvidia and dell investor relations personnel routinely leaked earnings data in advance of quarterly earnings.appellants introduced examples in which dell insiders,including the head of investor relations,lynn tyson,selectively disclosed confidential quarterly financial information arguably similar to the inside information disclosed by ray and choi to establish relationships with financial firms who might be in a position to buy dell stock.for example,appellants introduced an email tortora sent newman summarizing a conversation he had with tyson in which she suggested low opex was reasonable for dell upcoming quarter and that she was fairly confident on operating margin and gross margin.tr.
no reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that newman and chiasson knew,or deliberately avoided knowing,that the information originated with corporate insiders.in general,information about a firm finances could certainly be sufficiently detailed and proprietary to permit the inference that the tippee knew that the information came from an inside source.but in this case,where the financial information is of a nature regularly and accurately predicted by analyst modeling
