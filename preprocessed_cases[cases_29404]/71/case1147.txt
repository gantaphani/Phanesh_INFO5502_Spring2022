facts and procedural history 
the nugents were shareholders in betacom.betacom owned all of the outstanding stock of debtor betacom of phoenix,and percent of the outstanding stock of debtor beta communications.the betacom entities owned two radio stations.
in,betacom entered into a merger agreement with debtor abs.the parties entered into a superseding amendment dated february.the merger agreement,as amended,provided that abs was to acquire betacom in exchange for abs stock.abs was to assume certain betacom liabilities and agreed to use its best efforts to use the proceeds of a future registration or offering to retire the betacom debts,including debts owed to the nugents.the merger agreement called for an audit to determine the value of the liabilities assumed by abs.for days after the completion of the audit,the abs shares would be held in escrow,after which they would be delivered to the betacom shareholders.the audit was never performed,and abs never paid the nugents any cash or stock.in july,the nugents filed suit in federal district court against abs and the betacom entities for breach of the merger agreement and breach of an alleged oral consultancy agreement between the nugents and abs the district court litigation.in their fourth amended complaint,filed on july,the nugents asked for damages in lieu of the promised abs stock.in their original and first three amended complaints,the nugents had asked for declaratory relief in the form of a determination of the number of abs shares to which they were entitled under the merger agreement as well as damages for unpaid consulting fees.
in may,the debtors filed chapter bankruptcy petitions nos,and.the three bankruptcy cases are being jointly administered.on january,the nugents filed three proofs of claim in the bankruptcy case.the first was an unsecured claim for allegedly owed by betacom pursuant to a promissory note dated may,in the principal amount of.the second was a secured claim for pursuant to a promissory note from betacom also dated may,in the principal amount of.the nugents third proof of claim alleges an unsecured,claim against abs in the amount of for abs alleged breach of contract and fraud,which was being litigated in the district court litigation.the nugents obtained an order modifying the automatic stay to allow the district court litigation to proceed to final liquidation.
the debtors filed a complaint in the bankruptcy court against the nugents and two other betacom shareholders,scott burton and ed knight,seeking mandatory subordination of their claims the subordination litigation.section b of the bankruptcy code mandates the subordination of damages claims arising from the purchase or sale of a security.on september,the bankruptcy court entered the order at issue in the nugents and granted partial summary judgment in favor of the debtors on the issue of whether the nugents claims were subordinated.a similar order was issued against burton and knight on april.the bankruptcy court reasoned that the language of the statute is plain and that the merger of betacom into abs was a purchase or sale of securities of the debtor.it added that a literal reading of the statute was not at odds with the statute legislative history,which expressed a concern with adapting bankruptcy distribution to the differing expectations of shareholders and general creditors.the bankruptcy court found,however,that there was a material issue of fact whether some of the nugents other claims,a claim for back wages on the alleged consultation agreement with abs were related to the purchase or sale of securities.on these claims,the bankruptcy court denied summary judgment.
on september,the district court,acting in its capacity as a bankruptcy appellate court,reversed the decision of the bankruptcy court to subordinate the nugents breach of contract claims.in re betacom of phoenix,the van sickle order.the district court held that an actual purchase or sale of stock is required to trigger mandatory subordination under b and when the evidence was construed in the light most favorable to the nugents,the debtors had not met their burden of proof in showing that there was no material issue of fact as to whether the merger had closed.in a separate appeal,a different district court judge found the van sickle order to be controlling and vacated the bankruptcy court order granting summary judgment for the debtors against knight and burton.the debtors appeal the van sickle order as well as the order reversing summary judgment against knight and burton.the nugents and knight the bankruptcy court decision 
this court reviews the district court decision on an appeal from a bankruptcy court de novo.see preblich battley,cir.the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment is also reviewed de novo.see in re bakersfield westar ambulance,cir.the bankruptcy court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.see in re weisman,cir.
debtors argue that the district court determination that the bankruptcy court erred in finding that the merger agreement had closed is a finding of fact subject only to review for clear error.the nugents contend that the district court made no finding of fact and accepted no evidence on the issue so its determination should be reviewed de novo.as the district court explained,this was not a purely factual question.accordingly,its determination should be reviewed de novo.see in re chang,cir stating that mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed de novo.
ii.analysis 
the nugents raise three arguments for why their claim should not be subordinated to the claims of the debtors unsecured creditors b only applies to securities fraud claims b does not apply to their claim since they never enjoyed the rights and privileges of stock ownership and the merger agreement never closed,and,therefore,there was not an actual sale or purchase of securities that could trigger mandatory subordination under b.
mandatory subordination is not limited to securities fraud claims 
the nugents contend that b applies only to securities fraud claims.the nugents argue that because they have not asserted fraud in the issuance of abs securities,their claims against abs should not be subordinated.two cases support the nugents position in re,and in re amarex.in amarex,limited partners sought damages stemming from a general partner mismanagement.the limited partners filed claims for breach of contract and common law fraud.the court concluded that the limited partners claims should not be subordinated.see id.at section b pertains only to claims based upon the alleged wrongful issuance and sale of the security and does not encompass claims based upon conduct by the issuer of the security which occurred after this event.in the case,a shareholder sued to enforce
