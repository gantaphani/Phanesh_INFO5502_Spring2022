in this appeal we decide whether california ethics standards for neutral arbitrators apply to arbitrations conducted in california by the national association of securities dealers nasd.we conclude that the california legislature intended the new ethics standards to apply to neutral arbitrators.we hold,however,that the securities and exchange act of exchange act,as amended,preempts application of california ethics standards to nasd arbitrations.in so holding,we further conclude that nasd rules approved by the securities and exchange commission have preemptive force over conflicting state law.accordingly,we affirm.
this appeal arises out of an employment dispute between scott grunwald and his former employer,credit suisse first boston csfb.after csfb terminated grunwald from his position as director of csfb technology private client services program,grunwald exhausted csfb internal grievance procedures and mediated his dispute with csfb through initial steps required by csfb employment dispute resolution program edrp.grunwald then filed a demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association aaa.csfb,however,successfully obtained a preliminary injunction in district court that enjoined grunwald from arbitrating before the aaa.the court granted the preliminary injunction on the ground that csfb edrp required employees registered with the nasd,like grunwald,to arbitrate before a arbitration panel.grunwald responded to the preliminary injunction by filing a demand for arbitration with the nasd.
before the nasd appointed grunwald arbitration panel,the california judicial council adopted heightened disclosure and disqualification standards for neutral arbitrators.see ethics standards for neutral arbitrators in contractual arbitration,cal.rules of court,div.vi hereinafter california ethics standards.the nasd,however,determined that the california ethics standards should not apply to nasd arbitrations because the standards conflicted with the nasd own rules that had been approved by the securities and exchange commission.consequently,the nasd immediately suspended the appointment of arbitrators in california when the california ethics standards went into effect on july.on august,the nasd announced that it would recommence arbitrations initiated in california,but only on the express condition that all parties agreed to arbitrate outside of california in september,the nasd gave california parties the additional option of waiving the california ethics standards and proceeding with arbitration in california in connection with this waiver policy,the nasd successfully sought commission approval of a new rule requiring industry parties to nasd arbitrations in california to waive the california ethics standards upon waiver of these standards by investors or associated persons.because grunwald qualified as an associated person,the waiver rule would have required csfb to waive the california ethics standards if grunwald had chosen to waive the standards 
grunwald,however,refused to waive the california ethics standards and declined the nasd offer to proceed with arbitration outside of california.grunwald then requested that the district court grant him leave to file a motion to reconsider the preliminary injunction.he argued that the nasd suspension of arbitrations in california undermined his right to an expeditious arbitration under the federal arbitration act faa.he also asserted that the nasd waiver option amounted to a coerced waiver of his right to have his arbitration conducted pursuant to the california ethics standards.grunwald motion sought modification or dissolution of the preliminary injunction so that he could his claims in state court or with the aaa.
the district court permitted grunwald to file his motion for reconsideration,but ultimately denied the motion.in refusing to modify or dissolve the preliminary injunction,the district court determined that the california ethics standards did not apply to nasd arbitrators because the standards apply only to neutral arbitrators appointed directly by the parties.thus,grunwald did not have a right to have his nasd arbitration conducted pursuant to the requirements of the california ethics standards.additionally,the district court determined that there was no right to a speedy and expeditious arbitration under the faa.even if such a right existed,the district court held that grunwald could obtain a speedy arbitration by submitting to arbitration outside california or by waiving application of the california ethics standards to his nasd arbitration.finally,the district court determined that the faa precluded invalidation of the parties agreement to arbitrate their employment dispute before the nasd.grunwald filed a timely appeal from the district court order denying his motion for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction.
we begin by considering four jurisdictional objections raised by csfb.because the district court order was an i nterlocutory order refusing to dissolve or modify the injunction,a,we have jurisdiction over this appeal.
initially,csfb contends that grunwald motion for reconsideration was untimely because it was filed some ninety days after the district court granted the preliminary injunction.csfb points out that a motion to alter or amend a judgment must be filed within ten days of the entry of the judgment.e.csfb also correctly states that this time limit applies to motions for reconsideration of a preliminary injunction order see sierra,phoenix software,cir.consequently,if grunwald motion was not based on events that occurred after the district court granted the preliminary injunction,the motion would be untimely because it was filed well after the time limit.
although a motion for reconsideration is subject to rule e time limit,there is no time limit on a motion to vacate or dissolve a preliminary injunction.federal rule of civil procedure b states that a district court can modify an interlocutory order at any time before entry of a final judgment,and we have long recognized the rule that a district judge always has power to modify or to overturn an interlocutory order or decision while it remains interlocutory.tanner motor livery,avis,cir.
in determining whether a motion requesting the district court to reconsider its preliminary injunction should be treated as a motion for reconsideration under rule or a motion for dissolution or modification under rule,we agree with the third circuit that we must look beyond the motion caption to its substance.favia.of,cir see also ortho pharm.amgen,cir we agree with amgen that we must determine from its substance and not from its form whether we should treat ortho motion as a motion for reconsideration under.e or a motion to modify a preliminary injunction under.c.while t he purpose of a motion to reconsider under.e is to relitigate the original issue,ortho,at,a motion to modify a preliminary injunction is meant only to relieve inequities that arise after the original order.favia,at.thus,a motion that merely seeks to relitigate the issues underlying the original preliminary injunction order is subject to rule e limit,while a motion that in substance is based on new circumstances that have arisen after the district court granted the injunction may be filed at any time before entry of a final judgment.
if we did not look at the substance of the motion,a preliminary injunction would forever be subject to challenge and appeal.see sierra,at.in sierra,the appellant conceded that it had presented no new matter in its motion for reconsideration.we declined to treat the district court order denying the motion for reconsideration as an order refusing to dissolve the preliminary injunction,explaining 
the evident purpose of section a is to permit review of orders made in response to claims of changed circumstances,not to extend indefinitely the time for appeal from a preliminary injunction by the simple device of seeking to vacate it or modify it.wright,miller,cooper gressman,federal practice and procedure,at.as a general rule,therefore,the denial of a motion to modify or dissolve an injunction,or to reconsider a request for an injunction,will be appealable only if the motion raises new matter not considered when the injunction was first issued.
id.thus,our task is to determine whether the substance of grunwald motion was based on changed circumstances.
grunwald motion indeed raise d new matter not considered when the injunction was first issued.id.the california ethics standards were implemented after the district court granted the preliminary injunction.the nasd also suspended arbitrations in california,absent waiver of the california ethics standards,after the district court had issued the preliminary injunction.grunwald motion alleged that these events deprived him of his right to a speedy arbitration,as well as his right to have his arbitration conducted pursuant to the requirements of the california ethics standards.thus,grunwald motion was based on circumstances that occurred after the court granted the preliminary injunction.consequently,grunwald motion for reconsideration was,in substance,a motion to vacate or dissolve the injunction based on changed circumstances.
in light of the nature of grunwald motion,we conclude that it was timely filed.as we explained above,a motion to vacate or dissolve an injunction based on changed circumstances is not subject to the time limit in rule e.because grunwald motion alleged changed circumstances and did not simply seek to relitigate the issues decided by the district court when it granted the preliminary injunction,grunwald was not required to file his motion within the period established by rule e.consequently,grunwald motion,although filed some ninety days after the district court granted the preliminary injunction,was timely.
csfb next argues that this appeal is moot because grunwald dismissed his claim before the aaa,and commenced arbitration of his claim before the nasd.although a party moving for dismissal on mootness grounds bears a heavy burden,coral constr.king county,cir,csfb fails to explain why these events render grunwald appeal moot.if grunwald had obtained the relief he sought in his motion for reconsideration,the preliminary injunction order would have been modified to permit grunwald to proceed with arbitration before the aaa or to file his case in state court.because there is no showing that grunwald claims before the aaa were dismissed with prejudice,he would still be able to his claims with the aaa.in any event,grunwald also requested that the district court modify the preliminary injunction to allow him to file his claims in state court.because the outcome of this appeal will determine whether grunwald can pursue arbitration with the aaa or file his case in state court,this is not a situation where the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.powell mccormack,d.therefore,we conclude that this appeal is not moot.
next,csfb argues that grunwald is improperly attempting to obtain judicial review of the nasd rule changes.however,as even csfb appears to recognize,grunwald only seeks to vindicate an alleged right to have his arbitration conducted in accordance with the california ethics standards.grunwald may lack such a right,but that is a question that goes to the merits of this appeal,not to our jurisdiction.
finally,csfb asserts that grunwald appeal from the district court denial of his motion for reconsideration fails to satisfy the criteria for an interlocutory appeal under a.csfb reasons that an appellant can only bring an interlocutory appeal when fundamental rights are at stake,and contends that rules do not implicate fundamental rights.there is no requirement,however,in a that an appeal from an interlocutory order be premised on a fundamental right.consequently,we conclude that we have jurisdiction,and we turn to the merits of grunwald appeal.
the district court concluded that the judicial council had exceeded its statutory authority by applying the california ethics standards to arbitrators appointed by a dispute resolution provider organization drpo like the nasd because the california legislature only authorized the adoption of ethics standards for arbitrators jointly selected by the parties 
because the california supreme court has not addressed whether the judicial council acted within its authority in this instance,our task is to predict how the highest state court would decide the issue using intermediate appellate court decisions,decisions from other jurisdictions,statutes,treatises,and restatements as guidance.walker city of lakewood,cir quoting nlrb calkins,cir 
in interpreting the california statute at issue here,we look to california principles of statutory construction.neilson chang in re first investment,cir.these principles require us to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law by looking first to the words of the statute.state farm mut.auto.ins.garamendi,cal th,d,cal citations omitted.we utilize the ordinary meaning of words in a statute unless the legislature has defined the terms.sec.pac.bank wozab,cal d,cal.it is axiomatic that in the interpretation of a statute where the language is clear,its plain meaning should be followed.id.citation omitted.this plain meaning rule,however,does not prohibit a court from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose or whether such a construction of one provision is consistent with other provisions of the statute.lungren deukmejian,cal d.thus,t he intent prevails over the letter,and the letter will,if possible,be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.id.in the event the letter of the law is ambiguous,california law requires us to examine the legislative history for further guidance.hughes bd.of architectural exam rs,cal th,d,per curiam.
the california statute authorizing the judicial council to adopt new ethics standards specified that t he judicial council shall adopt ethical standards for all neutral arbitrators effective july.a emphasis added.thus,the california legislature authorized the judicial council to adopt ethics standards only for neutral arbitrators,a term that is defined by statute to mean 
an arbitrator who is selected jointly by the parties or by the arbitrators selected by the parties or appointed by the court when the parties or the arbitrators selected by the parties fail to select an arbitrator who was to be selected jointly by them.
d.the california ethics standards explicitly apply to arbitrators appointed by drpos.standard a c however,the judicial council may not act inconsistent with the governing statutes.people hall,cal th,d,cal.thus,the only question is whether the judicial council exceeded its authority when it required arbitrators to comply with the new standards.
the district court held that because section plainly applies only to neutral arbitrators as defined by section,it could not apply to arbitrators.although we agree with the district court determination that section permitted the judicial council to adopt ethics standards only for neutral arbitrators,we disagree with its unjustified assumption that all arbitrators are not neutral arbitrators.as section sets forth,an arbitrator qualifies as a neutral arbitrator if he is selected jointly by the parties.
under the nasd code of arbitration procedure nasd code,the parties jointly select the arbitrators that serve on the panel.after receiving a list of potential arbitrators,a party may strike one or more of the arbitrators from each list for any reason.nasd code c a.the parties then rank order all of the remaining arbitrators.id.c b,c.next,the nasd director of arbitration adds the parties rankings together,and must appoint the arbitrators that have the best consolidated rankings,subject only to availability and disqualification.id.c.because the parties have unlimited strikes and the power to choose the arbitrators through the consolidated ranking process,we conclude that nasd arbitrators are selected jointly by the parties and therefore qualify as neutral arbitrators.see.
because nasd arbitrators are neutral arbitrators within the meaning of section,section authorized the judicial council to adopt ethics standards that would be applicable to nasd arbitrators.the judicial council therefore did not exceed its authority by requiring drpos,like the nasd,to comply with the california ethics standards.accordingly,contrary to the district court ruling,we hold that the judicial council did not act ultra vires by subjecting nasd arbitrators to the new ethics standards.for a different reason,however,we agree with the district court ultimate conclusion that the new ethics standards can not be applied to nasd arbitrators.
csfb contends that the exchange act preempts application of the california ethics standards to arbitrators.we agree.
under the supremacy clause,federal laws preempt conflicting state laws,art.vi,cl.federal regulations issued by an agency in the scope of its authority are included among the laws of the united states which can preempt state law.city of new york fcc,d.we deal here,however,with rules adopted by private organizations sros within the securities than federal agencies.the exchange act delegated government power to sros such as the new york stock exchange nyse and the nasd to enforce compliance by members of the industry with both the legal requirements laid down in the exchange act and ethical standards going beyond those requirements,at,reprinted in.
whether sro rules can preempt conflicting state laws is an issue that we have not addressed.in merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith ware,however,the supreme court suggested by implication that sro rules can in certain circumstances have preemptive force despite the fact that they are adopted and enforced by private organizations,d c onflicting law should be by exchange only to the extent necessary to protect the achievement of the aims of the securities exchange act.quoting silver stock,d.in light of the supreme court ware decision and the amendments to the exchange act,we conclude that sro rules approved by the commission preempt conflicting state law.because the nasd arbitration rules at issue here were approved by the commission and because the california ethics standards conflict with the nasd arbitration disclosure rules,the california ethics standards are preempted by the nasd rules.
the securities exchange act of created a system of supervised in the securities industry whereby organizations such as the nasd or the nyse could promulgate their own governing rules and regulations,subject to oversight by the securities and exchange commission.the original version of the statute gave sros considerable latitude to fashion their own governing rules,at.the commission was authorized to take action only when necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors or to insure fair dealing b.
this system gave rise to questions regarding the preemptive effect of sro rules,issued by private organizations although sanctioned by federal law,over conflicting state law.the supreme court addressed this issue in in ware and articulated a standard to determine when sro rules would preempt state law.at.merrill lynch argued that a nyse rule providing for compulsory arbitration preempted a california state law that afforded employees a right of action for unpaid wages regardless of any private agreement to arbitrate.the court disagreed,and instead held that state law applied.id.at.
as the court explained,congress aim in providing for supervised was to insure fair dealing and to protect investors from harmful or unfair trading practices.id.at.sro rules that contradicted this policy were subject to commission supervision.conversely,however,any rule or practice not germane to fair dealing or investor protection would not appear to fall under the shadow of the federal umbrella it is,instead,subject to applicable state law.id.at.because the arbitration rules at issue were insufficiently related to fair dealing or the protection of investors,the court concluded that they fell outside the federal shadow.id.at.t he relationship between compulsory arbitration and fair dealing and investor protection is extremely attenuated and peripheral,if it exists at all.citation omitted.
the court decision in ware emphasized that the limited authority granted to the commission under the exchange act was central to its preemption analysis.id.at.see also perry thomas,d silver,at.were there commission jurisdiction and ensuing judicial review for scrutiny of a particular exchange ruling,a different case would arise concerning exemption from the operation of laws,an issue we do not decide today.the authority to adopt rules was vested in the sros,and as congress put it,i t is only where sros fail adequately to provide protection to investors that the commission is authorized to step in and compel them to do so,at see also ware,at.the commission ability to scrutinize sro rules was confined to designated subject areas and the direct supervisory power the commission did enjoy was exercised sparingly.ware,at.
it was in this context of the commission limited regulatory control over the sros and the sros substantial latitude that the court decided ware.the arbitration rule at issue,in fact,clearly would not have been subject to the commission modification or review under the exchange act.id.at.the court explained that because the exchange act scheme provided for no agency check on sro behavior in some cases,state laws could operate as a beneficial form of review of exchange id.at.quoting silver,at.
just two years after the supreme court decided ware,however,congress initiated a major overhaul of the exchange act and drastically shifted the balance of rulemaking power in favor of commission oversight.securities acts amendments of,stat.codified as amended at to.the amendments were intended to work a fundamental reform of the economic and regulatory structure of the securities markets and the securities industry,at.under the amended statute,the commission play s a much larger role than it has in the past id.
after the amendments,the sros authority to regulate independently of the sec control was substantially curtailed.id.at.this limitation on the sros authority was accomplished by requiring sros to file a proposed rule with the commission,along with a policy statement justifying the basis and purpose for the proposed rule.b.the commission must give public notice of the proposed rule and provide an opportunity for comment.id.with the enhanced supervisory role of the commission,sros are no longer free to adopt new substantive rules or modify existing rules at any time as they could prior to the amendments,at.no proposed rule change shall take effect unless approved by the commission,b moreover,the commission must give public notice of the specific reasons for its approval,at.
the ultimate approval of a proposed sro rule reflects the commission determination that the proposed rule is consistent with the purposes of the exchange act.b.express,mcmahon,d no proposed rule change may take effect unless the sec finds that the proposed rule is consistent with the requirements of the exchange act.moreover,the amendments gave the commission the power to abrogate,add to,and delete from the rules of any sro as the commission deems necessary or appropriate to insure the fair administration of the self regulatory organization c.unlike the restrictions in the original statute,this new authority is not limited to specific subject matter areas,at.the commission expanded authority includes,for example,the power to mandate the adoption of any rules the commission deems necessary to ensure that arbitration procedures adequately protect statutory rights.express,at.
finally,the amendments removed the original statute explicit requirement that all sro rules be consistent with the applicable laws of the state in which the exchange is located c.by contrast,the current statute requires that sro rules be not inconsistent with applicable federal and state law only when they are promulgated as either administrative,housekeeping matters that do not require commission approval under b a,or when they are temporary rule changes instituted summarily by the commission under b b.the mandated approval process under b does not contain a similar requirement that sro rules be consistent with state law.
these new provisions for commission approval are now the measure of congressionally delegated authority for in the national interest drayer krasner,cir.section b provides for vastly expanded commission oversight and requires that sro rules promote the federal objectives of the exchange act.commission approval of an sro rule under the new b therefore satisfies ware requirement that a rule be germane to fair dealing or investor protection and fall under the shadow of the federal umbrella indeed,the commission is in fact obligated to refrain from imposing,or permitting to be imposed,any new regulatory burden not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the exchange act.drayer,at quoting conf,at,reprinted in,
the supreme court has expressly withheld any opinion regarding the effect of the amendments on ware holding and the preemptive effect of sro arbitration rules approved under b.perry,at.but our decision here is consistent with the second circuit analysis in drayer,decided not long after the effective date of the amendments.at.drayer wrongful termination claim against his employer,a member of the nyse,was stayed pending arbitration in accordance with nyse rules.id.at.the second circuit affirmed the district court confirmation of the arbitration award,concluding that supervised contemplated by the exchange act.id.at.
the court in drayer concluded that ware specific compulsory arbitration fell outside the exchange act abrogated by the amendments.id.at.as the court explained,the amendments expanded the federal umbrella such that the compulsory arbitration rule now falls within the act reach as germane to the goal of market efficiency and to the objective of fair administration of the exchange id.at.
having recognized the significance of the amendments,the court in drayer held that the nyse employment arbitration rules were within the purposes of the exchange act even though the commission had at that time never specifically reviewed those rules.id.the fact that the commission had the opportunity for though it had not exercised that sufficient to satisfy ware requirements.
since the second circuit decided drayer,however,the commission has issued an affirmative statement of approval for the sro arbitration rules.in,the sros overhauled their arbitration procedures.t he sec specifically approved the arbitration procedures of the nasd after a period of public notice and comment,in line with the exchange act requirements.express,at.this,of course,included a thorough review and eventual approval of the nasd code disclosure and disqualification rules 
the commission worked closely with the securities industry conference on arbitration,a group composed of representatives from each sro that had an arbitration program,a representative of the securities industry,and three or four public representatives,to develop the sros rules in addition,with respect to the current controversy,the commission directed a special study to examine whether the sros should amend their rules to incorporate the california ethics standards disclosure and disqualification requirements.michael perino,report to the securities and exchange commission regarding arbitrator conflict disclosure requirements in nasd and nyse securities arbitrations,at,hereinafter perino report the commission also has repeatedly approved the nasd waiver rule,which requires industry parties to waive the california ethics standards if those standards are waived by an investor or an associated person,see also.
in sum,we conclude that sro rules that have been approved by the commission pursuant to b preempt state law when the two are in conflict,either directly or because the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the objectives of congress.specifically,we hold that the nasd arbitration procedures in dispute here have preemptive force over conflicting state law.
as we previously noted,if a state law prevents the nasd from complying with its rules or if it interferes with the congressional goals underlying the exchange act,the state law is preempted by federal law preemption occurs where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal law.crosby foreign trade council,d.additionally,state law is preempted if it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.id.thus,the exchange act preempts application of the california ethics standards to arbitrators if it impossible for the nasd to comply with both its own rules and the ethics standards,or if the ethics standards would inhibit the achievement of congressional objectives.see serv.eng g emery,cir.we will evaluate the disqualification rules and disclosure rules in turn.
disqualification rules 
the nasd can not simultaneously comply with both the nasd code and the california ethics standards disqualification rules.if an arbitrator fails to make a required disclosure,the california ethics standards provide for mandatory and automatic disqualification of the arbitrator once a party serves a timely notice of disqualification.standard a.if the arbitrator fails to remove himself from the panel,the arbitration award can be vacated.a.in contrast,the nasd code specifies that the director of arbitration may remove an arbitrator if he fails to make a required disclosure.nasd code d t he director may remove an arbitrator from an arbitration panel based on information that is required to be disclosed pursuant to rule and that was not previously disclosed.thus,in the event of a failure to make a required disclosure,the california ethics standards require disqualification once a party serves a notice of disqualification,while the nasd code grants discretion to the nasd director of arbitration to decide whether the arbitrator should be disqualified.
the nasd director of arbitration would find himself in a if the california ethics standards applied to nasd arbitrations.if the nasd director exercises his discretion under the nasd code by refusing to dismiss an arbitrator that failed to make a required disclosure,the director violates the california ethics standards mandatory disqualification provision.see standard a.alternatively,if the director determines that he is bound by the california ethics standards,he effectively forfeits his discretionary authority under the nasd code.see nasd code d.
a similar conflict would arise if an arbitrator disclosure revealed a possible conflict of interest.again,under the california ethics standards,disqualification is mandatory and automatic if a party serves a timely notice of disqualification.standard a see also azteca,adr consulting,th,d,there is no good faith or good cause requirement for the exercise of this right,nor is there a limit on the number of proposed neutrals who may be disqualified in this manner.but under the nasd code,when a party objects to an arbitrator appointment,the nasd director of arbitration shall determine if the arbitrator should be disqualified.nasd code d likewise,the disclosure rule in the nasd code also specifies that t he director may remove an arbitrator based on information that is required to be disclosed pursuant to this rule.id.d emphasis added.application of the california ethics standards to nasd arbitrations would strip the director of arbitration of his obligation to make a determination whether an arbitrator should in fact be disqualified.because the nasd director can not comply with both sets of disqualification rules,the california ethics standards are preempted.see crosby,at.
disclosure rules 
in contrast to the disqualification rules,it is not physically impossible for a party to simultaneously comply with the nasd code and the california ethics standards.true,the california ethics standards enumerated list of mandatory disclosures is more extensive than the nasd code disclosure rule.compare standard d with nasd code a see also perino report at while the california ethics standards and the sro rules clearly require disclosure of similar kinds of information,they are not.standard d requires disclosures that current rules do not.for example,under the california ethics standards an arbitrator could be subject to disqualification because her spouse used to serve on a bar committee with an associate of a party lawyer,even if the associate is uninvolved in the case.perino report at because such a remote relationship is completely unlikely to affect impartiality or to reasonably create an appearance of partiality or bias,the nasd code would not require this disclosure.see nasd code a.
nonetheless,the two sets of disclosure standards do not actually conflict because it is entirely possible for an arbitrator to satisfy both sets of disclosure requirements without violating the nasd code.see serv.eng g,at holding that federal law did not preempt a state workers compensation program because it was possible for a claimant to collect under both the federal and state programs.while the state standards are more stringent than the federal standards,it is possible to comply with both.north star int l.comm n,cir.nothing in the nasd code prevents an arbitrator from disclosing more information than is required by the nasd code disclosure rule.see nasd code a.to the contrary,the nasd encourages its arbitrators to bend over backwards to avoid any appearance of bias by opting for disclosure in close cases thus,an arbitrator that discloses all of the information required by the california ethics standards may go beyond the call of duty,but he does not violate any rule contained in the nasd code.the two sets of disclosure rules,while not coextensive,do not conflict.
we must,however,consider the second type of conflict preemption whether application of the california ethics standards disclosure requirements to arbitrators would stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.see crosby,at.this type of preemption naturally requires us to look to congressional intent in enacting the exchange act,and determine whether state law would result in a frustration of this purpose.serv.eng g,at.
the commission contends in its amicus curiae brief that the california ethics standards do interfere with congressional goals for at least two reasons.first,permitting each state to regulate nasd arbitration procedures would create a patchwork of laws that would interfere with congress chosen approach of delegating nationwide,cooperative regulatory authority to the commission and the nasd.second,the commission contends that the california ethics standards extensive disclosure requirements may undermine the nasd arbitration system protection of investors.as the commission points out,its study of the california ethics standards concluded that the additional disclosure rules are unnecessary because empirical evidence reveals little evidence of bias in sro arbitration outcomes,survey data suggests participants in sro arbitrations perceive arbitrators as fair and unbiased,and awards are rarely challenged on the basis of arbitrator bias.perino report at.
at the same time,the added disclosure requirements could have a number of costs.first,they would increase the nasd administrative costs because the nasd would have to create and maintain a more extensive database of information on each of its arbitrators.these higher administrative costs will either be shouldered by the parties,thereby making arbitration more costly for investors and employees,or by the nasd,which would result in the nasd having fewer resources available for its other regulatory responsibilities.second,the additional requirements may deter individuals from serving as nasd arbitrators,especially in light of the relatively low honorariums that nasd arbitrators receive see id.at concluding that the california ethics standards may well deter many individuals from participating in sro arbitrations.finally,the commission expresses concern that the california ethics standards would increase the complexity,cost,and uncertainty of the arbitration process because of the potential for a party to seek an award vacature under the california disclosure rules.as the commission explains,these problems could significantly undermine a primary congressional purpose in enacting the exchange the average investor is less likely than the average brokerage firm to be able to afford the costs of protracted litigation.in sum,the commission has taken the position in its amicus curiae brief that application of the california ethics standards disclosure requirements would create an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.see crosby,at.
the commission has extensive experience with regulating the sros arbitration procedures,and it is in a unique position to evaluate whether application of the california ethics standards to nasd arbitrations would frustrate the objectives of the exchange act.in short,
b ecause the commission is the federal agency to which congress has delegated its authority to implement the provisions of the exchange act,the agency is uniquely qualified to determine whether a particular form of state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.
medtronic,lohr,d footnote omitted quoting hines davidowitz.accordingly,we place some weight upon the commission conclusion that the california ethics standards conflict with the purposes of the exchange act.geier am.honda motor,d.
the commission has reasonably concluded that allowing california to regulate sro arbitrations would result in a patchwork of inconsistent state arbitration regulations that would interfere with congress intent in delegating sro regulatory authority to the commission.indeed,we have recognized that allow ing states to define by common law the regulatory duties of the nasd is a result which can not with the congressional scheme of delegated regulatory authority under the exchange act.sparta surgical,at.there is also nothing arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to statute about the commission fear that the california ethics standards disclosure rules would undermine the exchange act goal of protecting investors and the public interest.see brannan united student aid funds,cir see also geier,at.the only study that has examined the effects of applying the california ethics standards to nasd arbitrators concluded that california disclosure rules were unnecessary and would increase the costs of nasd arbitrations.see perino report at.because the commission determination that the state law conflicts with sro rules is by the record,we conclude that the exchange act preempts application of the california ethics standards disclosure rules to neutral arbitrators 
in light of our holding that the california ethics standards can not apply to nasd arbitrations because they are preempted by federal law,we also reject grunwald claims that the nasd and csfb were attempting to coerce him to waive his rights under the california ethics standards and were depriving him of his right to a speedy arbitration.grunwald argues that he faces an unacceptable choice accept the nasd offer to go forward with the arbitration subject to grunwald waiver of the california ethics standards thereby forfeiting his right to have his arbitration conducted in accordance with the ethics standards or forfeit his right to a speedy arbitration by refusing the nasd offer.grunwald dilemma is illusory,however,because he never had a right to have his arbitration conducted pursuant to the california ethics standards.because federal law preempts the california ethics standards,the ethics standards are without effect.cipollone liggett group,d since maryland,it has been settled that state law that conflicts with federal law is without effect.citation omitted quoting maryland louisiana,d.
even if the federal arbitration act creates an enforceable right to a speedy arbitration,a contention that we take no position on,grunwald could have chosen the first of the california ethics standards in exchange for a speedy forfeiting any right.instead,grunwald chose to litigate the issue of whether the california ethics standards should apply to nasd arbitrators.as we have explained,grunwald had no right to an arbitration conducted in accordance with ethics standards that were without effect.see id.at.having refused the option of waiving the california ethics standards and proceeding with the nasd arbitration,grunwald can not now complain that he was denied a speedy arbitration.
although the district court erroneously concluded that the california judicial council acted ultra vires when the judicial council applied the california ethics standards to nasd arbitrators,we agree with the district court ultimate conclusion that the ethics standards do not apply to nasd arbitrations because the ethics standards are preempted by the exchange act.accordingly,we affirm.

i agree in the main with the majority opinion,with the exception of section iv a with regard to that section,concerning whether the nasd arbitration and waiver rules as applied to disputes are capable of preempting state law,i fear that the majority otherwise cogent discussion oversimplifies the exceedingly challenging issue at the heart of this substantive extent of the authority of organizations sros to promulgate preemptive rules under the securities exchange act of,et,as amended by the securities act amendments of,stat.
nonetheless,as i explain below,the two potential results in this case seem equally plausible and equally imperfect.given the apparent equipoise,i do not support creating a circuit split with drayer krasner,cir.thus,while i write separately to explain why i can not join in section iv a of the majority opinion,i am not sufficiently convinced that the result it reaches is wrong to justify dissenting.i therefore concur in the judgment.
my concerns with the majority opinion are easy enough to describe the majority holds that any sro rule purportedly promulgated under section b of the exchange act,b may preempt contrary state law,including the california ethics standards that would otherwise govern the employment arbitration at issue in this case.see ante at.section b,however,is a provision that governs the procedure by which an sro rule is promulgated on its own,it does not govern the permissible substance of such a rule.the majority thus concludes that how an sro promulgates and the sec approves or does not need to approve,see exchange act b,b a rule,rather than the substance of that rule,is solely determinative of its preemptive force.this focus for determining the preemptive force of sro rules does not address or resolve a substantive question embedded in the exchange act as amended in are the nasd arbitration and waiver rules as applied to disputes within the authority of sros to enact and the sec to approve under section b in the first place 
sro rules approved pursuant to section b must be consistent with the requirements of the exchange act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the sro.b.these requirements include the registration requirements in sections b and b of the exchange act for exchanges and associations respectively,one of which mandates that t he rules of the sro must not be designed to regulate by virtue of any authority conferred by the exchange act matters not related to the purposes of the act or the administration of the sro.b,b.in other words,in its current form,the exchange act does not authorize sros to promulgate any rules,let alone preemptive rules,not related either to the purposes of the act or the administration of the sro.see ante at see also,at,reprinted in,business roundtable sec,discussing the relationship between section b and section thus,whether the nasd had the substantive authority,under the exchange act,to promulgate the rules at issue here is,in my view,central to the preemption question before us.the majority analysis almost entirely passes by this potentially determinative issue.
any discussion of this substantive authority question must begin with merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,ware,d.ware held that the arbitration of disputes is outside the shadow of the federal umbrella created by the exchange act,and is therefore not an area in which sro rules have preemptive force.without doubt,ware would control the outcome of this case but for the passage of the securities act amendments of.these amendments substantially revised the supervisory authority of the securities and exchange commission sec over sro rulemaking.as the majority recounts,see ante at,the changes regarding the nature of sec oversight of sro rules were extensive.the impact of the amendments on the permissible substantive reach of sro rules is much less clear.
we are therefore left with a substantive question deceptively simple in formulation did the amendments bring arbitration procedures such as those at issue both in ware and in this case back within the shadow of the federal umbrella if not,then ware still controls,and the california ethics standards can not be preempted by the nasd rules at issue here.if the amendments did,however,make ware obsolete on this substantive breadth point,then the majority is correct in its preemption conclusion.further complicating this inquiry is an important distinction unresolved by ware in referencing the shadow of the federal umbrella,ware was unclear as to whether it meant the substantive scope of the exchange act or the substantive limits of the sec oversight thereunder.although such a distinction is empty under the current exchange act,since the amendments expanded sec oversight to occupy the field of,it was at the time of ware.
only one court,in the thirty years since the amendments,has addressed this difficult question with any care.the second circuit,in drayer,understood the issue in exactly these terms,and offered two different explanations for why the same new york stock exchange rule that was outside the shadow of the federal umbrella in ware was moved inside that shadow by the amendments.the majority understandably reads drayer for the proposition that the amendments expanded the federal umbrella such that the compulsory arbitration rule now falls within the act reach.ante at.what the majority does not examine,however,is whether that holding was correct.as i explain in more detail below,while i agree with the second circuit methodology,i do not agree with some of its conclusions,nor with the extent to which the majority finds its decision controlling here.
i begin with the original language of the exchange act.as initially enacted,the securities exchange act of,ch,stat,included one provision,section c,which provided that n othing in this title shall be construed to prevent any exchange from adopting and enforcing any rule not inconsistent with this title and the rules and regulations thereunder and the applicable laws of the state in which it is located.although the original exchange act largely left sros on their own with regard to rulemaking,as the majority deftly summarizes,the sec was given supervisory authority,in particular,for thirteen designated subject areas the last of which was a catchall,similar matters where the commission was authorized to alter or supplement sro rules.see exchange act b,stat.at ante at.the exercise of oversight,however,even in these discrete areas,was further conditioned on the sec determination that such changes are necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors or to insure fair dealing in securities traded in upon such exchange or to insure fair administration of such exchange.exchange act b,stat.at.as such,under the exchange act as originally enacted,there were three distinct categories of sro rules rules over which the sec exercised substantive oversight rules within the scope of the exchange act over which the sec did not exercise substantive oversight and rules outside the scope of the exchange act.
in ware,the supreme court was asked to pass on a question largely analogous to that presented here w hether certain rules of the new york stock exchange,promulgated as measures pursuant to of the securities exchange act of,and a broker employee pledge to abide by those rules,avenues of wage relief otherwise available to the employee under state law.at.citation omitted after surveying the legislative background of the exchange act,the court concluded as follows 
it is thus clear that the congressional aim in supervised is to insure fair dealing and to protect investors from harmful or unfair trading practices.to the extent that any exchange rule or practice contravenes this policy,or any authorized rule or regulation under the act,the rule may be subject to appropriate federal regulatory supervision or action.correspondingly,any rule or practice not germane to fair dealing or investor protection would not appear to fall under the shadow of the federal umbrella it is,instead,subject to applicable state law.
id.at.based on this reading of the exchange act,ware interpreted the new york stock exchange rule requiring mandatory arbitration as falling far enough outside the federal umbrella,so as not to preempt state law.stated in broader terms,any sro rule outside the shadow of the federal umbrella,according to ware,can not preempt state law.
importantly,in conducting this analysis,the court rejected two lines of analysis made by merrill lynch and germane here.first,and most significantly,the court decisively rejected merrill lynch contention that the mandatory arbitration rule fell under the nyse obligation to protect the investing public and to insure just and equitable trade practices.id.at.as the court explained 
merrill lynch has not alleged that arbitration will effect fair dealing or result in investor protection.it suggests only that investor confidence not be shaken further by public airing of disputes.there is no explanation of why a judicial proceeding,even though public,would undermine investor confidence.it is difficult to understand why muffling a grievance in the cloakroom of arbitration would prevent lessening of confidence in the market.to the contrary,for the generally sophisticated investing public,market confidence may tend to be restored in the light of impartial public court adjudication.furthermore,it should be apparent that,so far as investor confidence is concerned,compulsory arbitration of an grievance is no substitute for direct effective disciplinary action against any abusive exchange practice.other rules of the exchange serve this very function.
second,the court flatly rejected merrill lynch contention that the arbitration rule was necessary to ensure uniform national regulation.in so holding,ware concluded that 
there is no revelation in the act or in any commission rule or regulation that nationwide uniformity of an exchange housekeeping affairs is necessary or desirable.and merrill lynch has not demonstrated that national uniformity in the area of wage claims is vital,in some way,to federal securities policy.convenience in exchange management may be desirable,but it does not support a plea for uniform application when the rule to be applied is not necessary for the achievement of the national policy objectives reflected in the act.
all told,ware appears to be a clear holding that only sro rules intimately related to the fundamental purposes of the exchange the court identified as ensuring fair dealing and investor preempt state law.see id.at.the principle that emerged from silver,and the premise upon which the court based its judgment,was that conflicting law,absent repealing or exclusivity provisions,should be by exchange only to the extent necessary to protect the achievement of the aims of the securities exchange act.quoting silver,at.because it held that arbitration of disputes was not so related,the court did not allow the nyse arbitration rules to preempt california state arbitration laws.
just over four years after ware,the second circuit reached the diametrically opposite result in drayer.the turnaround was premised entirely on the amendments.drayer followed,rather than departed from,ware shadow an sro rule,to have preemptive force,must be within the federal umbrella.drayer,however,offered two different theories for why the shadow of the federal umbrella had expanded since 
at issue in drayer was nyse rule,the same rule at issue in ware,which required compulsory arbitration of disputes.after observing that section b of the exchange act,as amended by the amendments,required that r ule changes proposed by an exchange must be approved by the commission as being consistent with the requirements of the act and the rules and regulations thereunder before the changes can become effective,id.at,drayer concluded that 
whatever the relationship of rule to the objective of investor protection,it is germane to the goal of market efficiency,reflected in b and throughout the amendments,and to the objective of fair administration of the exchange,implicated in b and an explicit standard of c.registered representatives play an important role in the flow of business on securities exchanges.the arbitration provision enables member firms to rid themselves of registered representatives who,as they believe,are dishonest or ineffective,or who have violated rules of the nyse,including the rule,without subjecting themselves to lengthy and costly,as here,a request for punitive damages.it is likewise in the interest of fair administration and market efficiency,as well as in the public interest,that honest and ethical registered representatives should have speedy,cheap and effective remedies against their employers.at least,the nyse is entitled to think this in the absence of any indication otherwise from the sec.
id.at citations and footnote omitted.drayer thus expressly departed from ware,at least in part,because it concluded that the amendments added market efficiency and fair administration of the exchange to the purposes of the exchange act and compulsory arbitration implicated these new purposes.see id.with these provisions now the measure of congressionally delegated authority for in the national interest,rule would seem to fall within them.quoting ware,at.
drayer also suggested another theory,albeit implicitly,for why the nyse rule was back within the shadow of the federal umbrella after the amendments.unlike the original exchange act,which authorized sec oversight of sro rulemaking only with regard to twelve discrete subject areas and similar matters,the amended act contains no subject matter restrictions on this authority.id.at see also id.at.on this reading,the shadow of the federal umbrella described by ware referred to the substantive breadth of the sec supervisory authority over sros,and not to the substantive purposes of the exchange act as a whole.as such,in holding the nyse compulsory arbitration rule to be outside the shadow of the federal umbrella,this reading suggests that ware held not that it was unrelated to the purposes of the exchange act,but only that it was outside the discrete realm of sec oversight.because the amendments expanded sec supervision to cover virtually all areas of exchange act,this theory posits the alternative argument that,even if the purposes of the exchange act were not altered,areas that were not within the shadow prior to could be thereafter.i consider both of these arguments in turn.
the first theory,and the one on which the second circuit principally relied,is,in my view,the less plausible of the two.recall that ware identified two principal purposes behind sro rulemaking through the exchange dealing and investor protection the second circuit response in drayer was that market efficiency and fair administration of the exchange were additional purposes added by the amendments,thereby expanding the permissible substantive scope of sro rules beyond that recognized in ware.see,at.seven of the nine provisions of the amended exchange act cited in drayer in supprt of the new purposes theory arguably went to the market efficiency point,and the remaining two addressed the fair administration of the exchange ideal.see id.citing exchange act,b,a c,b,b,a,c,f,a.
f air administration as a new statutory purpose can not pass muster section b of the exchange act as originally enacted had already provided insur ing fair administration of the exchange as one basis for the sec to alter or supplement an sro rules.see exchange act b,stat.at.in other words,the version of the exchange act before the court in ware already included this fair administration concept as an animating principle with regard to sec oversight.the court in ware did not view that concept as informing the preemption analysis.instead,the court held that rules concerning an exchange housekeeping affairs or c onvenience in exchange management were not preemptive.ware,at.
as to market efficiency,the alternative added exchange act purpose posited in drayer,a close reading of the text of the amendments and the relevant legislative history suggests that instead of adding market efficiency as a new independent purpose of the exchange act,the amendments clarified what fair dealing and investor protection actually meant under the original exchange act.
for its conclusion that market efficiency was added to the exchange act as a new purpose justifying the preemptive force of the arbitration rule,drayer relied on seven provisions of the exchange act,as amended.see at whatever the relationship of this rule to the objective of investor protection,it is germane to the goal of market efficiency,reflected in b and throughout the amendments,see,a c b a f a.five provide,at best,only weak support for drayer conclusion that market efficiency was a new purpose added by the amendments.for example,section a c,a c,provides only that i t is in the public interest and appropriate for the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets to assure five different goals concerning the establishment of a national securities market,including the economically efficient execution of securities transactions.a c i.similarly,new section a a of the exchange act provides that t he prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions,including the transfer of record ownership and the safeguarding of securities and funds related thereto,are necessary for the protection of investors and persons facilitating transactions by and acting on behalf of investors.a a.two of the cited provisions speak only of the extent to which sec and sro rules should not unnecessarily burden competition.see exchange act b,a,b,a.another provides nothing more relevant than an abstract reference to the purposes of this title.exchange act f,f.
two provisions,however,provided somewhat firmer footing for the market efficiency argument section of the exchange act,and the revisions to the registration requirements for associations in section b of the exchange act,b these sections require closer scrutiny.
section of the exchange act,as enacted in,provided that 
transactions in securities as commonly conducted upon securities exchanges and markets are affected with a national public interest which makes it necessary to provide for regulation and control of such transactions and of practices and matters related thereto,including transactions by officers,directors,and principal security holders,to require appropriate reports,and to impose requirements necessary to make such regulation and control reasonably complete and effective,in order to protect interstate commerce,the national credit,the federal taxing power,to protect and make more effective the national banking system and federal reserve system,and to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets in such transactions 
exchange act,stat.at.the revision to section in the amendments added to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a national market system for securities and a national system for the clearance and settlement of securities transactions and the safeguarding of securities and funds related thereto after to require appropriate reports.see securities act amendments of,stat.at.this provision might have indicated an intent to codify market efficiency as a new purpose of the exchange act,but for the extent to which the amendments to sections c and a a,already discussed above,linked these goals to investor protection.see exchange act a c,a a,a c,a a.given those later provisions,however,the addition of the national market system language to section by the amendments supports the contrary the amendments meant to clarify the scope of the act,not to broaden it.
all that is left,then,to support drayer assertion that market efficiency became a new purpose of the exchange act through the amendments are the revised registration requirements.most of the language in these requirements,however,had its origins in the maloney act of,not in the amendments with only that language which was not included in the exchange act after emphasized,the amendments rewrote sections b and b of the exchange act to require that 
the rules of the sro are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,to promote just and equitable principles of trade,to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating,clearing,settling,processing information with respect to,and facilitating transactions in securities,to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system,and,in general,to protect investors and the public interest and are not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers,issuers,brokers,or dealers,to fix minimum profits,to impose any schedule or fix rates of commissions,allowances,discounts,or other fees to be charged by its members,or to regulate by virtue of any authority conferred by this title matters not related to the purposes of this title or the administration of the sro.
b,b emphasis added the latter of the two new passages closed the procedural preemption loophole in the version of the act,by barring the possibility that sros could promulgate rules not related to the purposes of the exchange act or the administration of the sro.to conclude that we may discern,from the former addition,a clear congressional intent to add a new market efficiency ideal to the exchange act seems at best a dubious proposition,particularly in light of the extent to which the other amended provisions tied these concepts to investor protection.
the relevant legislative history behind the amendments is not much more illuminating,though it seems to run,at least to some degree,against drayer thesis.one of the major impetuses for the amendments was concern that the sros were not sufficiently subject to federal regulation,by either congress or the sec.see,at meaningful reform of this country securities trading mechanism will be impossible unless there is also reform of the method and manner by which the organizations operate and in the way that the sec oversees the performance of their regulatory responsibilities,reprinted in at.thus,a principal purpose of the amendments was to provide more sec oversight over sro rules.see,id.at,reprinted in at.
as the authoritative senate report accompanying the amendments explained 
the basic goals of the exchange act remain salutary and unchallenged to provide fair and honest mechanisms for the pricing of securities,to assure that dealing in securities is fair and without undue preferences or advantages among investors,to ensure that securities can be purchased and sold at economically efficient transaction costs,and to provide,to the maximum degree practicable,markets that are open and orderly.is an important step in assuring that the securities markets and the regulations of the securities industry remain strong and capable of fostering these fundamental goals under changing economic and technological conditions.
id.at,reprinted in at emphasis added see also id.at,reprinted in at contains a number of provisions which would clarify the scope of the responsibilities of national securities exchanges and registered securities associations and the manner in which they are to exercise those responsibilities.the bill would also clarify and strengthen the commission oversight role with respect to the organizations.emphases added.thus,the intent behind the amendments,according to the senate report,was not to expand the field in which sros could promulgate rules but to strengthen the total regulatory fabric.id.at,reprinted in at see also id.at,reprinted in at the committee believes that the statutory pattern governing the scope of the nasd authority is basically sound.
moreover,the senate report suggested that,if anything,the amendments were meant to narrow the substantive scope of sro rulemaking within the fixed confines of the act 
the bill would eliminate present section c and the authority it grants to the exchanges,and it would limit by sections b and b the scope of the organizations authority over their members to matters related to the purposes of the exchange act.the growing diversification of securities firms into activities has raised,and will continue to raise,significant questions about the adequacy of the present regulatory structure.however,the diversification of securities firms should not automatically extend the jurisdiction of the agencies.until it is specifically demonstrated to the congress that the activities of firms which are members of agencies should be limited or regulated in the public interest,such firms should be free to undertake and pursue these activities in the same manner as other business organizations,subject only to those regulatory limitations necessary to assure protection of public investors and the public interest.
id.at,reprinted in at.although this passage relates more directly to the resolution of the procedural preemption question described above,see ante at,this language,and the senate report as a whole,suggests that an area of regulation unrelated to the purposes of the exchange act before the amendments remained unrelated afterwards.
finally,even if these amendments can be said to have created a new purpose for supervised under the exchange act,which i doubt,i have a hard time understanding how arbitration is related to market efficiency.true,arbitrating rather than litigating disputes may in some sense make the market for registered securities employees more efficient,by decreasing the transaction costs involved in discharging such employees and replacing them with others.but,as the legislative language and history just discussed highlights,the exchange act regulates the securities market,not the employment market.it is plain from the language of the statute that it is the facilitation of transactions within a national securities market with which the statute is concerned 
it is therefore difficult to conclude,as drayer did,that arbitration disputes such as those at issue there,in ware,and in this case,are now within the shadow of the federal umbrella solely because they implicate market efficiency.
a more subtle,alternative ground for drayer conclusion was that ware concept of the federal umbrella described not the purposes of the exchange act but the substantive breadth of the sec supervisory authority over sros under the original language of the exchange act.this premise suggests that the amendments necessarily substantively broadened the shadow of the federal umbrella at the core of ware not by altering the core purposes of the exchange act,but by expanding the substantive scope of the sec oversight.because it is beyond question that the amendments greatly increased the scope of sec supervision over sros,it is at this point where i find resolution of this case difficult.ware,in my view,seems susceptible of two mutually exclusive interpretations.
what is unclear is the relationship between ware assertion that the nyse compulsory arbitration rule did not implicate the core purposes of the exchange act,and its partial reliance on the fact that the sec lacked oversight over such a rule under the exchange act.see,at.none of the subject matter categories suggests that the commission has review authority with respect to a rule requiring arbitration of disputes.at some points in ware,it appears that the court meant,through the term federal umbrella,to refer only to the limited substantive scope of sec oversight over sro rules.at other points,the ware court seemed plainly to be considering the broader purposes of the exchange act,without regard to the precise scope of sec oversight.because the sec oversight authority now occupies the entire field of exchange act,as it did not before,it now matters,as it did not at the time of ware,whether the shadow of the federal umbrella was cast only as far as sec oversight,or covered the whole realm of authorized sro.
as i have already discussed,ware was clear that arbitration did not implicate fair dealing or investor protection,the two central purposes of the exchange act identified in silver.what ware was less clear about was the relationship between arbitration and the concept of fair administration of the exchange.see id.at.quoted ante at.
fair administration appeared in the act only in section b,which,as noted above,provided for twelve areas and similar matters over which the sec could exercise oversight by alter ing or supplement ing the rules of the exchange.the sec could alter or supplement rules related to those subject matters,however,if the change was necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors or to insure fair dealing in securities traded in upon such exchange or to insure fair administration of such exchange.exchange act b,stat.at.without referring to the fair administration of such exchange language in the section b,ware concluded that t here is no revelation in the act or in any commission rule or regulation that nationwide uniformity of an exchange housekeeping affairs is necessary or desirable.at.this conclusion may well have been premised on the understanding that fair administration of such exchange does not include such housekeeping affairs as the manner in which members of the exchange settle disputes with their employees.
fair administration of such exchange could well be,were we writing on a clean slate,i would so interpret pertaining to administrative matters.the version of section b,for example,listed as within the sec oversight authority matters including hours of trading,and the time and method of making settlements,payments,and deliveries.the internal affairs of members of the exchanges and associations,in contrast,ware may well have concluded,are not within the scope of fair administration of such exchange,and are thus outside the act federal umbrella.on the other hand,ware may have reflected only the conclusion that housekeeping affairs concerning members of exchanges,as opposed to the exchanges as a whole,were not among the listed areas of sec oversight.
neither drayer nor the majority address what ware meant by housekeeping affairs.neither explains why ware holding that housekeeping affairs were beyond the area in which there is a need for national uniformity was altered by the amendments.both drayer and the majority do appear,without so stating,to assume that the housekeeping affairs are within the federal umbrella after because of the provisions that do not always oversight of sro administrative rules.see,exchange act b a ii,c,b a ii,c.but this unstated assumption rests on another,similarly unstated,ware tossed aside the housekeeping rules because they were then beyond the sec oversight authority,not because they were outside the act purposes altogether.if the latter were the case,nothing in the amendments would matter.as noted earlier,fair administration of the exchange was not a new addition in.
ware is indeed ambiguous on this key point.because my two colleagues have chosen to rely on drayer,however,and because i can not conclude with any reasonable certainty that the result in drayer is necessarily wrong given the concerns,the only prudent course of action for me is to set out my views in detail,as i have done,and to concur in the judgment,while remaining dubitante.see lon fuller,anatomy of the law e xpressing the epitome of the common law spirit,there is the op
