factual and procedural background 
the parties and relevant nonparties 
heritage housing development,heritage is a nonprofit organization and the parent company of various nonprofit entities heritage entities.heritage raised money through municipal bond offerings for the purpose of financing the acquisition,operation and renovation of healthcare facilities for elderly and alzheimer patients.under securities and exchange commission rule,the bonds were structured as conduit financing in which the obligations of the municipal issuers were assigned to the heritage entities pursuant to indentures or loan agreements.a new heritage entity was formed in connection with each bond offering and was considered a private issuer under rule.trust company of texas,was the named trustee for the proceeds of the bonds.
appellant cary medill became a director of heritage in and appellant stephen goodman was the chief financial officer of heritage from november through august.appellants who classify themselves as the heritage bond class action plaintiffs were substituted in as judgment creditors for virgil lim,who was an officer of heritage.respondent westport insurance corporation westport insured heritage,the heritage entities and the directors and officers,as discussed more fully below.
the underlying bond litigation 
the underlying litigation consists of consolidated actions against appellants and other defendants known as in re heritage bond litigation mdl docket.the relevant lawsuits are referred to by the parties as the class action,brought by a class of bondholders,and the trust petition,brought by the trust.
the class action 
the third amended complaint in the class action alleges this action arises from damages sustained by plaintiffs in eleven municipal bond offerings,which raised over between december and march.the monies raised were to be used to acquire,renovate and reopen former hospitals in texas,florida,illinois and california,as facilities designed to assist elderly persons however,due to wrongful disbursements,diversions of bond proceeds and improper of funds,renovations at many of the facilities were not completed.all of the facilities went into shortly after the bond offerings.
the complaint further alleges that under each loan agreement between the municipal issuer and the heritage entity as the private issuer,the heritage entity was solely obligated to repay all principal,interest and any premium on the bonds,but defaulted on the bond repayment obligations,rendering the bonds virtually worthless.the class plaintiffs further allege that as part of an elaborate ponzi scheme,proceeds from subsequent bond offerings were used to cover the cash shortfalls from prior bond offerings and that these transfers of money among the various heritage entities violated the loan agreements and indentures.the questions of law and fact common to the members of the class were alleged to include whether the defendants violated federal and state securities laws breached their fiduciary duties to the class were negligent in performing their obligations and responsibilities owed to the class made material misrepresentations in the course of the bond offerings and breached their contracts with the class.
the third amended complaint asserts causes of action against appellant goodman and virgil lim for violations of the securities exchange act of and corporations code section,and causes of action against all heritage director and officer defendants for negligence and breach of fiduciary duties.the negligence claim alleges that defendants breached their duties owed to plaintiffs and the class by failing to adequately perform all appropriate investigations and analysis required to determine the legitimacy and feasibility of the proposed plans under each of the bond offerings failing to include the discoverable and known adverse information in the respective official statements.with respect to the fiduciary duty claim,the complaint alleges that the defendants breached their duty of care to the plaintiffs by,among other things,failing to ensure the disclosure of material information in the official statements failing to file annual reports with the appropriate agencies permitting the heritage entities to transfer funds among themselves in violation of the terms of the indentures and loan agreements and failing to adequately monitor construction and operation of the facilities.
the fourth amended complaint further alleges that the class plaintiffs suffered approximately million in damages,that heritage outside directors routinely approved matters presented to them without question and failed to perform due diligence,and that virgil lim signed and submitted to trust,numerous fund transfer requests which requested transfers among the various heritage entities.the negligence cause of action further alleges that lim commingled bond funds,engaged in and approved future projects after being informed that prior projects were over budget,and that appellant medill approved future bond offerings rather than correcting the existing problems at the facilities and failed to fire the management companies.
the trust action 
the trust petition was filed by trust as the indenture trustee against appellants medill,goodman and other directors and officers not parties here to recover damages caused by the negligent acts,omissions and breaches of duty of the various defendants.the petition alleges that certain defaults and events of default as defined in the indentures and the deeds of trust have occurred under all of the indentures and all of the deeds of trust,including events of default for failure to make payments on the notes and bonds when due.in the section of the petition entitled misfeasance and malfeasance of the defendant directors and officers,the petition alleges the defendants knew or should have known the healthcare projects were not feasible failed to adopt realistic expectations regarding rates of stabilization,revenues,operating costs,debt and corporate overhead of the facilities caused the issuance of additional bonds for more projects when prior projects had already failed or were about to fail improperly used future bond proceeds to pay for costs of earlier projects in violation of the applicable bond documents and failed to adequately supervise construction and operation of the facilities.causes of action for breach of fiduciary duties,negligence and fraudulent concealment of their misfeasance and malfeasance are asserted against appellants.
the policy and denial of tender 
westport issued a nonprofit organization liability insurance policy to heritage and the heritage entities for the period of february,to february,for which the premium was.the limit of liability was million for each loss and aggregate for each policy period.in addition to heritage and the heritage entities,insureds under the policy include any person acting within the course and scope of his or her duties and responsibilities on behalf of heritage or the heritage entities,who was,now is,or shall be a director,officer,trustee,employee,volunteer,or staff member.
under part i,entitled coverage,the policy provides we will pay on the insured behalf all loss for which the insured shall be legally obligated to pay resulting from civil claims that are made against the insured because of a wrongful act,provided that the claim is first made during the policy period and written notice of said claim is received by us no later than sixty days after the expiration date of the policy period.
under part iii,entitled definitions,the policy defines loss as any amount which the insured is legally obligated to pay for any claim or claims made against the insured during the policy period for wrongful acts,and includes compensatory damages,prejudgment interest,judgments and settlements.loss shall not include any of the following.damages arising out of breach of any contract,whether oral,written or implied,except employment contracts with individuals.arising out of is defined as based upon,arising out of,or in connection with.the policy defines wrongful act s as any actual or alleged error or omission,negligent act,misleading statement,or breach of duty committed by an insured in the performance of duties on behalf of the entity.
under part iv,entitled exclusions,the policy contains two exclusions relevant here.first,the policy provides that it does not apply to any claim,or loss alleging or arising out of.violation of the securities act of as amended or the securities exchange act of as a mended or any state blue sky or securities law or similar state or federal statute and any order or regulation issued pursuant to any of the foregoing statutes,or any insured issuance or endorsement of stocks,bonds,securities,annuities,or other financial instruments.second,the policy does not apply to any claim,or loss alleging or arising out of.failure to honor or pay on any financial instrument or credit given for continued patronage or use of any insured services or products.
appellant medill and other heritage directors tendered defense of the underlying bond litigation to westport.relying on the above cited provisions,westport denied coverage.
trial court proceedings 
appellant medill and other directors sued westport for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and declaratory relief,alleging that westport had wrongfully refused to provide a defense in the underlying bond litigation westport moved for summary judgment,arguing that it had no duty to defend because the policy definition of loss did not include coverage for claims arising out of breach of contract,and the policy specifically excluded coverage for claims arising out of the issuance or endorsement of bonds and the failure to pay on the bonds.
the trial court granted the motion,finding that the three policy provisions relied on by westport precluded the duty to defend.first,the court noted the policy definition of loss excludes coverage for damages arising out of breach of contract.the court explained that a lthough the plaintiffs in the bond litigation seek recovery on the basis of numerous legal theories,all of the claims alleged against heritage directors and officers are premised on breach of its contractual obligations in connection with the bond transactions.without the alleged breaches of various agreements as cited in the bond litigation,there could be no recovery against the directors and officers for mismanagement,breach of fiduciary duty or negligence.second,the court found that the policy exclusion for claims or loss arising out of any insured issuance or endorsement of bonds was applicable because the complaints allege that the insureds made numerous misrepresentations when offering and promoting the bonds for sale and there is no coverage where any insured engaged in the excluded activity and where the claims against the insureds arise out of that activity.third,the court found that the policy exclusion for claims or loss arising out of the failure to pay on any financial instrument was also applicable because i t is undisputed that the bond litigation is premised on heritage default on its financial obligations under the bonds and related financial instruments and t he allegations against heritage directors and officers are directly related to heritage failure to pay.the court therefore concluded that westport had conclusively established that there is no potential for coverage for any of the claims asserted against the insureds.appellant medill appeals from the summary judgment in favor of westport.
following the court order granting summary judgment,westport filed a against other insureds who claimed westport had a duty to defend them in the underlying bond litigation,including appellant goodman and virgil lim.summary adjudication was ultimately granted to westport on the duty to defend based on the same analysis.appellants goodman and the heritage bond class action plaintiffs,who have taken lim place,separately appeal from this summary adjudication in favor of westport.the appeals have been consolidated.

standard of review 
a trial court properly grants summary judgment where no triable issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.we review the trial court decision de novo.citations.if,in deciding this appeal,we find there is no issue of material fact,we affirm the summary judgment if it is correct on any legal ground applicable to this case,whether that ground was the legal theory adopted by the trial court or not,and whether it was raised by defendant in the trial court or first addressed on appeal.citation.if,on the other hand,we find that one or more triable issues of material fact exist,then we must reverse the judgment.westoil terminals,industrial indemnity th,d.similarly,we apply the de novo standard of review to the interpretation of an insurance policy,zurich american ins.cal th,d.
ii.the duty to defend 
it is well established that an insurer must defend its insured against a suit which potentially seeks damages within the coverage of the policy.gray zurich insurance cal d.this obligation can only be excused when the third party complaint can by no conceivable theory raise a single issue which could bring it within the policy coverage.montrose chemical superior court cal th,d.in other words,the insured need only show that the underlying claim may fall within policy coverage the insurer must prove it can not.ibid.any doubt as to whether the facts give rise to a duty to defend is resolved in the insured favor.id.at,d.
however,while the duty to defend is broad,it is not unlimited.it is entirely dependent upon a showing by the insured that the third party claim for which it seeks a defense is one for damages which potentially fall within the policy coverage.it is the nature and kind of risk covered by the policy which both defines and limits the duty to defend.lebas fashion imports of usa,itt hartford ins.group th,d waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.
t he determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy.facts extrinsic to the complaint give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy.waller truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d.if,at the time of tender,the allegations of the complaint together with extrinsic facts available to the insurer demonstrate no potential for coverage,the carrier may properly deny a defense.we do graphics,mercury casualty th,d.
iii.three policy provisions preclude the duty to defend 
arising out of breach of contract 
we first consider whether westport owed a duty to defend the directors and officers in the underlying bond litigation under the insuring language and definitions of the liability policy.before even considering exclusions,a court must examine the coverage provisions to determine whether a claim falls within the policy terms.waller truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d.a lthough exclusions are construed narrowly and must be proven by the insurer,the burden is on the insured to bring the claim within the basic scope of coverage,and unlike exclusions courts will not indulge in a forced construction of the policy insuring clause to bring a claim within the policy coverage.ibid.accordingly,appellants have the initial burden of proving the claim falls within the scope of coverage.prichard liberty mutual ins.th,d.
the policy restricts coverage to loss,which is defined as any amount which the insured is legally obligated to pay for any claim or claims made against the insured during the policy period for wrongful acts,the definition of loss then provides that loss shall not include damages arising out of breach of any contract,whether oral,written or implied,except employment contracts with individuals.
appellants contend that the breach of contract exclusion in the policy definition of loss does not apply because none of the plaintiffs in the bond litigation asserted any claims for breach of contract against appellants or alleged any privity of contract between plaintiffs and appellants or that appellants were personally liable for any other party failure to pay on the bonds.appellants argue that the plaintiffs asserted only tort claims against the directors and officers for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty,which are specifically included in the policy definition of wrongful act s.we are not persuaded by this argument.
in essence,the plaintiffs in the underlying bond litigation are seeking to recover damages for the failure of the heritage entities to perform their contractual obligations to make repayments on the bonds.the plaintiffs allege that these defaults were caused in part by the improper transfer of money among the various heritage entities in violation of the terms of the loan agreements and indentures,and by the wrongful conduct of the directors and officers in connection with the issuance of the bonds and mismanagement of the bond funds and projects.in other words,the bond litigation in its entirety arises out of breach of contract.
the policy broadly defines arising out of as based upon,arising out of,or in connection with.case law similarly grants a broad definition to the phrase arising out of.california courts have consistently given a broad interpretation to the terms arising out of or arising from in various kinds of insurance provisions.it is settled that this language does not import any particular standard of causation or theory of liability into an insurance policy.rather,it broadly links a factual situation with the event creating liability,and connotes only a minimal causal connection or incidental relationship.acceptance ins.syufy enterprises th,d.such language requires the court to examine the conduct underlying the lawsuit,instead of the legal theories attached to the conduct.century transit systems,american empire surplus lines ins.th,fn,d.
southgate recreation park dist.california for park recreation ins.th,d is instructive.there,southgate recreation and park district contracted with a general contractor to build a golf course.the general contractor went bankrupt and unpaid subcontractors sued southgate and its directors seeking payment for goods and services they had provided.id.at,d.southgate sought defense and indemnity under insuring documents that excluded from coverage any liability a rising out of or related to construction contracts or to any other contract for the purchase of goods or services.id.at,d.southgate argued that the subcontractors claims were noncontractual and that the contract exclusion was inapplicable because the claims were based on negligent administration of the construction contract funds.ibid.the reviewing court disagreed southgate alleged negligence and breach of statutory duties arise out of or are related to the construction contract.it is southgate failure to retain funds under that very contract and southgate failure to ensure an adequate payment bond for that very contract that comprise the basis of the subcontractor lawsuits against southgate for conversion,breach of trust,and violation of stop notice.the construction contract exclusion applies.this linkage between the construction contract and southgate alleged failings regarding the subcontractors,coupled with the arising out of language of the construction contract exclusion,defeats southgate argument that this exclusion applies only if there were direct construction contracts between southgate and the subcontractors.id.at,d.
similarly here,the directors and officers potential liability would not exist without the contracts heritage and the heritage entities entered into in connection with the issuance and financing of the bonds.all of the allegations against the directors and officers arise out of duties and obligations heritage and the heritage entities assumed under the bond contracts.the claims are therefore not within the scope of coverage.
the class appellants assert that the breach of contract exclusion is ambiguous because it operates to preclude coverage for a claim denominated as negligence when the policy expressly provides coverage for negligence under the definition of wrongful act s.they rely on a federal case,church mutual ins.liability ins.d,which we find to be inapposite.there,an insured was sued for breach of a construction contract and fraud.the liability policy excluded coverage for any claim arising out of,directly or indirectly resulting from or in consequence of,or in any way involving any actual or alleged breach of contract.id.at.the insurer argued that pursuant to this language,no more than an incidental connection between breach of contract and fraud was required.ibid.the court rejected this argument,finding that the exclusionary language was ambiguous when read in conjunction with the coverage provisions providing coverage for wrongful acts,defined to include fraudulent statements.id.at.the court concluded that the ambiguous exclusionary language should be narrowly construed against the insurer to require more than an incidental connection.ibid.the court then determined that the gravamen of the underlying complaint was fraud,not breach of contract based on the complaint,insured failure to perform the contract arises out of its fraudulent intent.insurer contends that the underlying action would not have been brought against insured but for insured failure to pay for plaintiff work.this interpretation of the underlying complaint is belied by the allegations that insured defrauded plaintiff into reducing its billing statements by falsely claiming that plaintiff work was unsatisfactory,and that insured stole the core of plaintiff business.these allegations are independent of breach of contract.id.at.
here,the tort claims against the directors and officers are not independent of the breach of contract claims.no aspect of the underlying bond litigation would exist without the alleged breaches of the loan agreements and indentures and the contractual obligations to pay on the bonds.without the breaches of the contractual obligations to make repayments on the bonds,there would have been no loss to the bondholders and no recovery against the directors and officers for mismanagement,negligence or breach of fiduciary duty.language in an insurance policy is interpreted as a whole,and in the circumstances of the case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.citation.the proper question is whether the provision or word is ambiguous in the context of this policy and the circumstances of this case.citation.the provision will shift between clarity and ambiguity with changes in the event at hand.citation,zurich american ins,supra,cal th at,d.under the circumstances here,we do not find the breach of contract exclusionary language to be ambiguous.
appellants have failed to meet their burden of proving there has been a covered claim within the terms of the policy.but even if they had met their burden,the policy exclusions would still preclude coverage,as discussed below.
issuance or endorsement of bonds 
as noted above,under the section entitled exclusions,the policy does not apply to any claim,or loss alleging or arising out of.violation of the securities act of as a mended or the securities exchange act of as amended or any state blue sky or securities law or similar state or federal statute and any order or regulation issued pursuant to any of the foregoing sta
