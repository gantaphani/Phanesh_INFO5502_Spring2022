the securities and exchange commission sec sought a permanent injunction and civil penalties against kenneth ough for alleged violations of section a of the securities act,a,amended by.b,stat,section b of the exchange act,b,amended by.d,stat,and rule thereunder,and for violations of section c of the exchange act,c,and municipal securities rulemaking board msrb rule g the alleged violations stem from ough acts and omissions as an investment banker for an underwriter of municipal offerings in his investigation and disclosure of the risks attached to the offering of certain taxable municipal notes.
the district court entered summary judgment in favor of ough,and the sec appeals.the sec contends the district court erred in looking solely to the industry standard as the governing standard of care by which to measure ough conduct.further,the sec asserts there is a genuine issue of material fact as to what the industry standard is,and as to whether ough conduct departed from that standard or from a standard of reasonable prudence which the sec contends is the appropriate standard.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we reverse.we hold that the standard of care for an underwriter of municipal offerings is one of reasonable prudence,for which the industry standard is one factor to be considered,but it is not the determinative factor.we also conclude there are genuine issues of material fact as to what is the applicable industry standard,whether ough conduct met the controlling standard of reasonable prudence,and whether any departure from that standard was so extreme as to satisfy the element of scienter under the securities antifraud statutes and regulations.
in and,dain rauscher,a,was the senior underwriter for nine taxable municipal note offerings,and financial advisor for a tenth offering.kenneth ough,vice president in the public finance department of dain rauscher municipal securities division,acted as lead investment banker on these undertakings.two of the offerings were for the city of anaheim,and eight were for various municipal school districts.
at the time the taxable municipal notes were offered,they were a new type of security.the anaheim transaction was one of the first such offerings ever made.with this type of security,the issuers,all of whom were municipalities,used the note proceeds for interest arbitrage,meaning that the proceeds were used solely for investment purposes,rather than for infrastructure improvement,debt reduction or other projects.the goal of interest arbitrage is to pay back invested money at a certain interest rate,but invest it at a higher rate so that the issuers make a profit equal to the spread between interest rates.in this case,all of the issuers invested the note proceeds in investment pools managed by orange county treasurer robert citron.
in underwriting the offering of the taxable municipal notes,the underwriter followed the procedure for underwriting the offering of municipal bonds.that procedure requires the underwriter to obtain and review an official statement and send it to potential bidders or purchasers.see b.here,as the principal investment banker for the underwriting firm,ough helped prepare and draft the offering documents.others were also involved in drafting those documents,including bond counsel,underwriting counsel and public officials.ough was responsible for reviewing the final offering statements prior to issuance of the notes.
the anaheim offering statements provided that the purpose of the issuance was to provide moneys to meet the city fiscal year general fund expenditures,including current expenses,capital expenditures and the discharge of other obligations or indebtedness of the city.the school districts offering statements were almost identical,although they included investment and reinvestment in the list of expenditures to be met with proceeds from issuance of the notes.all of the offering statements explained that the issuance proceeds would be invested directly or through investment agreements to the greatest extent possible by the city treasurer or the school district collector.
although ough was aware that the purpose of the issuances was interest arbitrage,none of the offering statements used that term.ough also knew the money would be invested in the orange county investment pools,but no offering statement disclosed that fact.ough never discussed the pools investment strategy with citron,the manager of the orange county investment pools,and he did not make inquiries about the specific portfolio of investments and securities held by the pools.ough said that reviewing such portfolios was not his expertise.
in evaluating the risk level to investors,ough relied on statements and presentations by the assistant treasurer for orange county,the treasurer of the city of anaheim,analysis and ratings by standard poor and moody,the history of the orange county pool investments,and citron investing and management record.ough said that he believed the pools investments were conservative and safe,and that citron had strong management expertise.
citron strategy was to invest in securities that were highly sensitive to interest rate changes.as long as interest rates declined or held steady,returns on investments in the pools were high.in,however,the federal reserve raised rates.the rate increase caused significant losses in the value of the orange county portfolio and ultimately led to the orange county bankruptcy.nonetheless,all of the notes issued in the ten offerings in which ough was involved were repaid in full and on time.notwithstanding that circumstance,the sec filed the complaint in this case seeking a permanent injunction and civil penalties against ough.in its complaint,the sec alleged that the offering documents misrepresented and omitted material facts that ough knew,or through reasonable investigation,should have known,including the risks of the investment strategy.according to the sec,the fact no one lost any money was simply a fortuitous fluke.
both sides moved for summary judgment.the district court granted ough motion.the district court determined as a matter of law that the applicable standard against which to measure ough conduct was the industry standard,and held there was no material factual dispute that ough actions complied with that standard.this appeal followed.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.flick liberty mut.fire ins,cir.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,we must determine whether the district court correctly applied the relevant law,and whether there is a dispute as to a genuine issue of material fact.id.
section a of the securities act,and section b of the exchange act and rule,prohibit fraudulent conduct or practices in connection with the offer or sale of securities these antifraud provisions forbid making a material misstatement or omission in connection with the offer or sale of a security by means of interstate commerce.see sec rana research,cir sec rogers,cir.msrb rule requires that brokers and dealers deal fairly with others and not engage in deceptive,dishonest or unfair practices
