this case requires us to trace the contours of the in connection with element of the securities litigation uniform standards act of slusa,f,in the reflected light of the supreme court recent decision in chadbourne parke llp troice.giving full voice to troice,we conclude that the district court impermissibly extended the slusa reach.accordingly,we vacate the judgment below,reverse the denial of the plaintiffs motion to remand,and remit the case to the district court with directions to return it to the puerto rico court of first instance.
background 
we begin at the beginning,rehearsing the origin and travel of the case.because this appeal follows the granting of a motion to dismiss,we draw the relevant facts from the plaintiff s complaint,supplemented by documentation incorporated by reference in the complaint.rivera díaz humana ins.of,cir.
the plaintiffs are mostly investors in the puerto rico global income target maturity fund the fund a investment company licensed under the puerto rico investment companies act,see laws ann.tit.the fund solicited investors through a prospectus,which promised that the fund would invest at least of its assets in notes with an equally weighted exposure to both european and north american investment grade corporate bond indices.relatedly,the prospectus promised that the fund would invest no more than of its assets in securities issued by a single issuer.consistent with these two promises the promise and the promise the complaint alleges that the primary purpose of the fund was to expose its investors to certain specialized notes issued by different international financial institutions such as banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria,
in may of,the fund spurned these promises and invested more than of its assets in notes sold by a single issuer,lehman brothers.the complaint alleges that this investment transgressed both the terms of the prospectus and puerto rico law.
these transgressions had dire consequences.the lehman notes soon lost most of their value,and the fund was forced to adopt a plan of liquidation.
in due course,the plaintiffs,suing on their own behalf and on behalf of all other investors similarly situated,filed a putative class action in a puerto rico court.their complaint asserted both direct claims on behalf of the investors and shareholder derivative claims on behalf of the fund.the named defendants included the fund its officers and directors its investment advisor,san juan asset management its sales agent,bbva securities of puerto rico and its independent auditor,pricewaterhousecoopers pwc.although the complaint is not a model of clarity,it is clear that its gravamen is that the fund did not comply with the investment policies promised in the prospectus and that the strategy it did pursue flouted puerto rico law 
pwc,later joined by other defendants,removed the action to the federal district court,asserting that it fell within the ambit of the slusa.see f.the plaintiffs moved to remand.the district court cerezo,denied the plaintiffs motion.see hidalgo vélez san juan asset,hidalgo vélez i,wl,at.
at that point,the plaintiffs asked the district court to certify the jurisdictional question for interlocutory appeal.see b.the defendants not only opposed this request but also pressed dismissal motions premised on slusa preclusion.see.b.the district court mcauliffe,refused to certify the question and granted the motions to dismiss.see hidalgo vélez san juan asset,wl,at.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
we review a district court disposition of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim de novo.see artuso vertex,cir.in conducting this review,we accept as true all facts alleged in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the pleader favor.butler balolia,cir.
the defendants invite us to alter this standard of review on the ground that the plaintiffs failed to preserve their central argument.we decline this invitation.
the defendants insist that the plaintiffs failure to oppose their motions to dismiss constitutes a waiver or,at least,a forfeiture.see generally united states olano,limning distinction between waiver and forfeiture.but this hypertechnical view of the record gives too little weight to the plaintiffs consistent and vigorous opposition to the defendants contention that the slusa pretermitted the plaintiffs claims.common sense suggests that in certain situations substance ought to prevail over form and in the peculiar circumstances of this case we believe that the fact that the plaintiffs presented their opposition in their motion for remand rather than as part of formal objections to the motions to dismiss is of no moment.
we briefly explain our reasoning.the slusa contains both a preclusion provision and a removal provision.kircher putnam funds trust,footnotes omitted.these symbiotic provisions are mirror images of each other any action that is properly removable under the removal provision is per se precluded under the preclusion provision and,conversely,any action not so precluded is not removable.see id.at madden.cowen,cir.thus,the ruling on the plaintiffs motion to remand would necessarily be dispositive of the defendants motions to dismiss.given this juxtaposition,we hold that the plaintiffs presentation of their opposition to the slusa applicability in their remand papers sufficed to preserve their position for purposes of appeal.this holding is consistent,we think,with the supreme court admonition that r ules of practice and procedure are devised to promote the ends of justice,not to defeat them.hormel helvering.
we are equally unimpressed with the defendants more general importuning that the plaintiffs failed to develop their central argument sufficiently to preserve it on appeal.while the plaintiffs certainly could have developed their argument more fully,they did enough to put the dispositive issue in play before the district court.in view of the fact that the supreme court did not decide troice until this case was pending on appeal,treating the plaintiffs argument as abandoned would require an overly strict application of waiver principles.
we turn now to the meat of this appeal.the slusa is a spare but sweeping statute,which for present purposes may be viewed as the third in a trilogy of statutory enactments.we find it helpful,therefore,to trace its lineage.
in the aftermath of the stock market crash,congress passed the securities exchange act of the exchange act,ch,stat.see merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith dabit.as amended,that statute forbids the use of any manipulative or deceptive devices or contrivances in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any security not so registered,or any swap agreement.b.exercising regulatory authority granted by the exchange act,the securities and exchange commission sec promulgated rule,which likewise prohibits fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.see b.the supreme court has read a private right of action into these provisions.see blue chip stamps manor drug stores,sup t of ins.of bankers life cas.moreover,the court has forged a link between,on the one hand,the in connection with provisions of the exchange act and rule and,on the other hand,the slusa parallel in connection with terminology.see dabit,at.
more than sixty years after the passage of the exchange act,congress enacted the second statute in the trilogy the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,stat.congress fashioned the pslra as a means of combating unfounded strike suits against issuers of securities.see dabit,at.consistent with this congressional intent,the pslra imposed heightened pleading requirements in actions brought pursuant to b and rule and contained a gallimaufry of provisions targeting abusive litigation.id.
congress soon discovered that the pslra had not sounded the death knell for abusive litigation plaintiffs simply started using state law as a vehicle for their claims.in an effort to close this loophole,congress passed the third statute in the trilogy in the slusa,stat.see kircher,at see also conf,at.
pertinently,the slusa provides 
n o covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any state or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any state or federal court by any private party alleging a a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security or b that the defendant used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.
f four requirements must be satisfied in order for the slusa to attach.there must be i a covered class action,ii based on state law,iii alleging fraud or misrepresentation in connection with the purchase or sale of,iv a covered security.see romano kazacos,cir.although the courts of appeals have made this same point in ways that differ slightly from circuit to circuit,see,appert morgan stanley dean witter,cir madden,at lasala bordier et cie,cir,all of them agree with the essence of this formulation.
this case does not demand an archaeological dig into these four requirements.for present purposes,it is enough to emphasize a few points that are beyond cavil.first,a covered class action is a lawsuit in which damages are sought on behalf of more than people.dabit,at internal quotation marks and footnote omitted.second,the most common type of covered security is one traded nationally and listed on a regulated national exchange.id.internal quotation marks and footnote omitted.another standard type of covered security is one issued by an investment company registered under the investment company act of,to.see troice.at.
for slusa purposes,puerto rico is the functional equivalent of a state,see a and in this instance,it is undisputed that the plaintiffs suit is a covered class action alleging fraud or misrepresentation in violation of puerto rico law.the critical question is whether the alleged misrepresentations on which the suit is founded were made in connection with a transaction in covered securities.
the early appellate cases construing the slusa in connection with requirement primarily concerned representations about or the marketing of covered securities,often in the context of investment services.see,gray seaboard,app x,cir rowinski salomon smith barney,cir prof l mgmt.emps.profit sharing plan kpmg llp,cir behlen merrill lynch,dudek prudential,green ameritrade.for the most part,the dispute in those cases did not involve whether the misrepresentations were connected to covered securities but,rather,whether they were sufficiently intertwined with a purchase or sale.see,rowinski,f d at prof l mgmt,at behlen,at.
the tectonic plates shifted when the dabit court authoritatively delineated the scope of the slusa purchase or sale language.see at.the court held that the slusa should be construed to preclude holder actions that is,actions in which the plaintiffs alleged injury from merely holding covered securities in addition to actions directly involving purchases sales of covered securities.see id.at.three important lessons emerged from the dabit court opinion.
to begin,the court made pellucid that the slusa in connection with requirement should be construed broadly.see id.at.next,the court declared that it is enough that the fraud alleged coincide with a securities transaction.id.finally,the court indicated that the focus of an in connection with inquiry under the slusa should be on the defendant actions,not on the plaintiff actions.as the court explained,t he requisite showing is deception in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,not deception of an identifiable purchaser or seller.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
some elaboration is in order with respect to the second of these lessons.the dabit court imported this lesson from its exchange act and rule jurisprudence.see sec zandford,united states.in the wake of dabit,the courts of appeals interpreted this coincide language expansively,though not uniformly.see roland green,cir surveying differing approaches.in troice,the supreme court reviewed the fifth circuit decision in roland and shed new light on the subject.see.at.
troice involved an action brought by victims of an alleged ponzi scheme.the fraudster sold the plaintiffs certificates of deposit cds in a bank that he controlled.see id.at.the cds were uncovered debt assets that promised a fixed rate of return,not covered securities.id.the defendants parties accused of abetting the fraud argued that the slusa applied because,even though the cds themselves were not covered securities,they were sold on the basis that they would be backed by covered securities.the court found this argument unconvincing and ruled that the slusa did not apply.see id.at.
the troice court was careful to preserve dabit core holding.see id.at see also calderón serra banco santander,cir.nevertheless,justice breyer opinion for the court broke new ground in illuminating the contours of the in connection with requirement.it held that a fraudulent misrepresentation or omission is not made in connection with a purchase or sale of a covered security unless it is material to a decision by one or more individuals other than the fraudster to buy or to sell a covered security.troice.at.in other words,the in connection with requirement is satisfied only where the misrepresentation makes a significant difference to someone decision to purchase or to sell a covered security.id.in an effort to put the matter into perspective,justice breyer went on to explain that the in connection with requirement reached only those cases involving victims who took,who tried to take,who divested themselves of,who tried to divest themselves of,or who maintained an ownership interest in financial instruments that fall within the relevant statutory definition.id.emphasis in original.
with the legal landscape set in place,we now move from the general to the specific.the court below,ruling without the benefit of troice,held that the slusa precluded the plaintiffs claims 
at the outset,the district court acknowledged that the securities actually held by the plaintiffs the shares in the fund were not themselves covered securities.see hidalgo vélez i,wl,at.the court concluded,however,that this circumstance alone did not place the plaintiffs claims beyond the slusa reach since the fund anticipated investments included various covered securities,the slusa in connection with requirement was satisfied.id.
we agree with the district court general approach,and troice confirms that approach.see troice.at.but as we explain below,we disagree with the district court particularized conclusion.
for purposes of a motion to remand,we must credit the plaintiffs thesis that the defendants misrepresentations induced the plaintiffs to purchase uncovered securities.by the same token,it is undisputed that the only securities involved in any transactions carried out by the plaintiffs were uncovered securities.troice teaches that a misrepresentation in connection with the purchase of an uncovered security,by itself,is insufficient to bring a claim within the slusa grasp a connection matters where the misrepresentation makes a significant difference to someone decision to purchase or to sell a covered security,not to purchase or to sell an uncovered security.id.at calderón serra,at holding rule in connection with requirement satisfied when there was no dispute as to whether the plaintiffs actually bought securities covered by the exchange act.
to be sure,the analysis does not invariably end there.in certain cases,the primary intent or effect of purchasing an uncovered security is to take an ownership interest in a covered security.the defendants strive to convince us that this is such a case.
in advancing this proposition,the defendants rely heavily on the feeder fund cases.those are cases where the plaintiffs invested in funds that,directly or indirectly,acquired or purported to acquire covered securities.see roland,at canvassing cases.typical is in re herald,cir,in which the court addressed feeder funds in the context of the infamous ponzi scheme initiated by bernie madoff.there,investors in madoffaffiliated feeder funds sued madoff bankers for facilitating the fraud.the
