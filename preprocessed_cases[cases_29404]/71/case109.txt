charles huggins huggins was convicted on may,after a jury trial in the united states district court for the southern district of new york sidney stein,judge for wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud in violation of and.the district court sentenced him to months in prison,entered an order of forfeiture in the amount of million,and ordered restitution in the amount of million.
on appeal,huggins argues that his conviction was improper because the indictment lacked specificity and failed to inform him of the nature and cause of the accusations against him in violation of the fifth and sixth amendments of the united states constitution.huggins also argues that the district court incorrectly applied sentencing enhancements based on a loss figure of million,gross receipts from a financial institution in excess of million,and abuse of a position of trust.in addition,he brings an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
in a summary order published contemporaneously with this opinion,we affirm the district court judgments on the indictment and sentencing enhancement for a loss figure of million,and decline to resolve huggins ineffective assistance of counsel claim at this time.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the district court erred in applying the two sentencing enhancements for receiving gross receipts in excess of million from a financial institution pursuant to b a and for abuse of a position of trust pursuant to.
background 
in the early,huggins ran sham oil companies he promised investors he would use their money to make a profit in west african oil,but in fact simply pocketed the money.see trial tr.beginning in the,huggins began running sham diamond and gold mining companies jyork industries jyork and urogo urogo.id,psr huggins informed investors that their investments in jyork would be used to acquire diamonds and gold in sierra leone,and that investments in urogo would be used to acquire the same in liberia.trial tr,huggins convinced dozens of investors to invest in these companies,establishing friendships with at least two of the investors.a trial tr,in total,huggins received approximately million from investors for jyork and urogo.gov t br.at add.including the receipts attributable to the sham oil companies from the early,huggins received approximately million from investors.a,the investors sent this money to jyork and urogo accounts at bank of america in new york.trial tr.huggins withdrew money from these accounts by atm,wire transfer,or by having his assistant,anne thomas,cash checks.see id,
although huggins told investors that jyork and urogo would use their money to acquire diamonds and gold in sierra leone and liberia,huggins used practically none of the investors money to do so.see trial tr.instead,huggins used the money for a wide variety of personal expenses,including rent payment and other personal bills,distributions to family members and friends,meals at expensive restaurants,the purchase of a mercedes car,and gifts for a young actress.trial tr,the government filed an indictment against huggins on march.indictment,de the superseding indictment,filed on september,alleged two counts wire fraud under,and conspiracy to commit wire fraud under.superseding indictment,de

discussion 
financial institution enhancement 
we review the district court application of the enhancement under b a de novo.see,united states conca,cir.b a provides for a sentencing enhancement if the defendant derived more than in gross receipts from one or more financial institutions as a result of the offense.gross receipts from the offense includes all property,real or personal,tangible or intangible,which is obtained directly or indirectly as a result of such offense.cmt.b.huggins argues that withdrawals of money from his companies bank of america accounts by atm,check,and wire transfer did not trigger this enhancement on the grounds that routine withdrawals from a bank account are not derived from a financial institution.huggins br.at huggins reply br.at the government contends that the passage of money through a financial institution,even when individual investors are the primary source,is enough to trigger this enhancement gov t br.at we disagree.
our analysis begins with the text of the enhancement.united states young,cir.the financial institution enhancement applies only if the defendant derivation of gross receipts from a financial institution is as a result of the offense.when a defendant derives gross receipts from a financial institution at which he has an account,whether by atm,check,or wire transfer,he does so simply as a result of having sufficient funds in his account,not as a result of the offense.in this sense,a financial institution acted as little more than a conduit of funds as opposed to being the victim who lost funds as a result of the fraud.the guidelines provide no basis to enhance penalties for a defendant who stores his fraudulent proceeds in a financial institution before withdrawing,while allowing a defendant who avoids use of a financial institution to receive a lesser punishment.
our precedents focus on whether the financial institution suffers some type of loss or liability in providing the requisite funds.indeed,no case in this circuit has applied this enhancement where a financial institution did not suffer some type of loss or liability.see,united states goldstein,cir.applying the enhancement for stealing banking and credit card information united states khedr,cir.fraudulently obtaining car loans united states savin,cir.stealing money from a foreign investment company united states millar,cir.bank robbery 
focusing on whether the financial institution suffers a loss or incurs liability comes from the enhancement requirement that the gross receipts be derived from a financial institution as a result of the offense,that the financial institution must suffer a loss or liability.emphasis added by stealing or fraudulently borrowing from a financial institution,the criminal is putting that institution financial safety and soundness at risk.the sentencing enhancement thereby penalizes the criminal for this reckless behavior.that was the theory behind the act creating this enhancement.financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act of,pub,stat.for example,when a defendant fraudulently obtains a mortgage or car loan and fails to pay the money back,the financial institution suffers a loss.by contrast,when a defendant simply withdraws money he deposited in a bank,the financial institution is not incurring any meaningful new liability nor is the criminal leveraging the financial institution balance sheet to support criminal activity.
here,huggins derived the funds for his fraudulent companies from individual investors,not bank of america.the bank did not incur a meaningful loss or liability when huggins withdrew money from his companies accounts because investors had deposited
