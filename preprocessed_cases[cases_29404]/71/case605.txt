defendant charles zandford was convicted of thirteen counts of wire fraud for stealing from two of his investment clients.the securities and exchange commission subsequently filed this civil action against zandford under a of the securities act of,b of the securities exchange act of,and the sec rule.the district court granted the sec motion for summary judgment.zandford now appeals.we hold that the federal securities laws do not reach every claim for the theft or conversion of a security from a brokerage account.because zandford fraudulent actions were not sufficiently connected with a securities transaction,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with directions to dismiss the case.
between and,charles zandford worked as a securities broker.in,zandford persuaded william wood to open a joint investment account for himself and his daughter,diane wood okstulski.wood was an elderly man who was in poor health.his daughter was mentally retarded and suffered from a multiple personality disorder.zandford promised to conservatively invest the woods money.in total,the woods entrusted zandford with.by september,all of it was lost.
in april,a federal grand jury indicted zandford on thirteen counts of wire fraud in violation of.the indictment alleged that zandford engaged in a scheme to defraud the woods.the first count maintained that zandford sold the woods shares of a mutual fund in order to use the proceeds for his own benefit.the remaining counts related to twelve separate checks from the woods account that zandford made payable to himself.zandford generated money in the woods account by selling their securities.a jury convicted zandford on all counts.zandford was sentenced to months imprisonment and was ordered to pay in restitution.this court subsequently affirmed zandford conviction.see united states zandford,cir table.
in september,the securities and exchange commission filed this civil action against zandford under section a of the securities act of,a,section b of the securities exchange act of,b,and rule promulgated thereunder.the sec complaint alleged that zandford violated these laws by selling the securities in the woods account,by misappropriating in proceeds,and by using the money for his own personal needs.the sec sought to enjoin zandford from further violating the federal securities laws and to recover zandford gains.
in april,the sec moved for partial summary judgment on its misappropriation claim.zandford subsequently moved for permission to conduct limited discovery on the issue of whether his fraud was in connection with a securities transaction.on march,the district court denied zandford motion and granted the sec motion for summary judgment.the court determined that zandford criminal conviction for wire fraud established all facts necessary to satisfy the elements of the sec securities fraud claim.therefore,the court held that the doctrine of collateral estoppel prevented zandford from arguing that he was not civilly liable under the federal securities laws.the court enjoined zandford from committing future violations of the securities laws.it also ordered zandford to disgorge.zandford now appeals 
the district court determined that zandford criminal conviction for wire fraud established all facts necessary to satisfy the elements of the sec securities fraud claim.that court erred in holding that the doctrine of collateral estoppel prevented zandford from contesting his civil liability under the federal securities laws.
a criminal conviction can prevent a party from relitigating issues in a subsequent civil proceeding.see emich motors.general motors.for collateral estoppel to apply,the sec must establish that the issue sought to be precluded is identical to one previously litigated the issue must have been actually determined in the prior proceeding determination of the issue must have been a necessary part of the proceeding the prior judgement must be final and valid and the party against whom estoppel is asserted must have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the previous forum.see sedlack braswell services group,cir.
at the very least,the sec invocation of collateral estoppel fails to satisfy the identity of issues requirement.to establish that zandford violated sections a and b,the sec must prove,inter alia,that zandford committed fraud in the offer or sale of securities,or in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.see a b.by contrast,under the wire fraud statute,the government only need prove that zandford engaged in a scheme to defraud,and that he used wire communications in executing his scheme.see united states rebrook,cir.thus,to find zandford guilty of wire fraud it was wholly unnecessary to determine whether his fraud was sufficiently connected to a securities transaction.since zandford was never charged with a criminal violation of b,he did not have the opportunity to argue at trial or on appeal that,as a legal matter,his fraud was not sufficiently connected to a securities transaction.the sec concedes as much when it argues both that the criminal trial established the fact that zandford sold securities as part of a scheme to misappropriate proceeds,and that the district court properly made a legal conclusion in this case that such a scheme satisfies the in connection with requirement.it is this legal conclusion which we will now review.
the securities act of was designed to provide full and fair disclosure of the character of securities sold and to prevent frauds in the sale thereof,and for other purposes.blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d.likewise,the fundamental purpose of the securities exchange act of was to implement a philosophy of full disclosure,by providing participants in stock transactions with the information they need to make their investment decisions.hunt robinson,cir quoting santa fe industries,green,d citation omitted.
the federal securities laws do not cover all types of fraud.rather,both the securities act and the exchange act require that the defendant fraud be connected sufficiently to a securities transaction.to state a claim under a of the securities act,the sec must show that zandford fraud,misstatement,or omission occurred in the offer or sale of any securities.a likewise,to state a claim under b of the exchange act and rule,the sec must show,inter alia,that zandford misrepresented or failed to state material facts in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.see b 
the precise contours of the in connection with requirement are not.it seems unavoidable that the standard be fleshed out by a cautious approach.see chemical bank arthur andersen,cir quoting smallwood pearl brewing,cir.while the in connection with requirement must be flexible,it is not so elastic as to cover incidents which bear no relationship to market integrity or investor understanding.in particular,it is clear that ordinary state law fraud or conversion claims do not invariably violate the federal securities laws.congress,in enacting the securities laws,did not intend to provide a federal remedy for all common law fraud.rivanna trawlers unlimited thompson trawlers,cir citing marine bank weaver,d.indeed,the goal of b would not be served by expanding its scope to include claims amounting to breach of contract or common law fraud which have long been the staples of state law.hunt,at.with these principles in mind,we turn to the merits of zandford appeal.
the precise issue before us is whether zandford alleged fraud is sufficiently connected to a securities transaction,as required by a of the securities act,b of the exchange act,and rule.the sec advocates a very broad reading of the in connection with requirement.it alleges that zandford defrauded the woods by failing to inform them that he intended to sell their securities in order to obtain the proceeds for himself.the sec argues that this omission was fraudulent since zandford,as the woods investment adviser,bore a duty to disclose material information to the woods.the sec contends that zandford omissions were in connection with zandford sale of the securities in the woods account.
we do not believe that the feder
