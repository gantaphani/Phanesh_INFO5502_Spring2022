this case requires us to consider whether the fact that a stock share price recovered soon after the fraud became known defeats an inference of economic loss in a securities fraud suit.plaintiff appellant acticon ag acticon is the lead plaintiff in a consolidated putative class action suit against china north east petroleum holdings limited nep brought pursuant to b a of the securities exchange act of,b a,and under sec rule,b.acticon alleges that nep misled investors about its reported earnings,oil reserves,and internal controls.it further alleges that nep revealed this information through a series of corrective disclosures and that in the trading days after each disclosure was made,nep stock price dropped.nep argues that these allegations are not sufficient to allege economic loss because its share price rebounded on certain days after the final disclosure to the point that acticon could have sold its holdings and avoided a loss.we disagree.for the reasons below,we hold this price recovery does not defeat an inference of economic loss.accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
background 
acticon is the lead plaintiff in a putative securities class action against nep.acticon alleges that beginning may,nep misled investors regarding the financial health and prospects of the company.in brief,acticon alleges that nep inflated its proven oil reserves and did not account for certain warrants which entitle the holder to purchase stock for a fixed price until the expiry date in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap.it also alleges that nep former ceo and his mother transferred funds from the company corporate coffers into their own accounts.
acticon alleges that this information gradually became public as nep was required to withdraw its financial statements and revise its prior earnings downwards.nep announced that it was withdrawing its and financial statements on february.on april,nep announced delays in the filings of its annual report and form k.the next day,it announced that it was facing delisting by the new york stock exchange nyse and that there were certain deficiencies in its internal controls concerning accounts payable and business development activities.on april,it announced another downward estimate of its earnings and linked its need to do so to its misvaluation of oil and gas properties.nep stock price fell sharply in the days following each of these disclosures.
on may,nep announced that the nyse had halted trading of its stock as of may.in the same press release,it further announced the resignation of certain members of management for financial improprieties.over the summer,defendant robert bruce,the chairman of the audit committee,announced in a letter to the board that he was resigning because he had concerns regarding whether nep financial statements were prepared in accordance with gaap and whether the company had bribed foreign governmental officials.on september,nep stock again resumed trading,and its share price dropped nearly on very high volume.
acticon filed one of several complaints against nep,various officers and directors,and an independent oil engineering firm that estimated nep reserves,regarding these events.on november,the district court consolidated these complaints into a single action and appointed acticon lead plaintiff.although the complaint contains class allegations,the district court has not yet considered a motion for class certification.on march,the defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint.at oral argument on may,the district court expressed concern regarding whether acticon could show loss causation.it observed that acticon had foregone several opportunities to sell its shares at a higher price and requested supplemental briefing on the issue.
after supplementary briefing,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss.it held as a matter of law that acticon did not suffer an economic loss,grounding its holding in a line of cases applying dura pharmaceuticals,broudo,d.in its words,since dura,courts have held as a matter of law that a purchaser suffers no economic loss if he holds stock whose price has risen above purchase if that price had initially fallen after the corrective disclosure was made.in re china ne.petroleum holdings.secs,d.it observed that acticon had purchased nep shares with an average purchase price of per share.id.at.nep stock had closed at a price higher than on twelve days during october and november after nep was relisted.id.the district court held that because acticon had foregone multiple opportunities to sell its shares at a profit,it had not suffered an economic loss.id.it therefore dismissed the consolidated complaint.id.at.
this appeal followed.

the supreme court has held that,to maintain a private damages action under b and rule,a plaintiff must prove a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant scienter a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission economic loss and loss causation.pac.inv.mgmt.llc mayer brown llp,cir quoting stoneridge inv.partners,llc scientific atlanta,d,cert.denied sub nom.rh capital assocs.llc mayer brown llp,d.nep argues that because its stock price rose higher than acticon average purchase price on various dates in the months following the close of the class period,acticon has failed to plead economic loss as a matter of law 
after dura,it is unclear whether the plaintiffs must satisfy the short and plain statement of the claim standard demanded by rule a or the more stringent heightened pleading requirements of rule b in pleading economic loss.in dura,the supreme court assume d,at least for argument sake,that neither the rules nor the securities statutes impose any special further requirement in respect to the pleading of proximate causation or economic loss.at.
although we are aware of no decision by our sister circuits considering which pleading standard plaintiffs must satisfy to adequately allege economic loss in the wake of dura,several circuits have considered which pleading standard applies to loss causation.this analysis is instructive because dura considered the two elements together and left the pleading standard applicable to loss causation equally ambiguous.the circuits have split in the wake of dura as to which rule applies to loss causation.the fourth circuit has held that heightened pleading requirements of rule b apply to the element of loss causation because it is among the circumstances constituting fraud.katyle penn gaming,cir internal quotations omitted.the fifth circuit,in contrast,has held that only the requirements of rule a apply,relying upon the fact that the supreme court in bell atlantic twombly,d,construed dura in formulating its plausibility standard.lormand unwired,cir.and the ninth circuit has recognized that ambiguity exists regarding which pleading standard applies,but has found it unnecessary to resolve which standard applies because in each case where it could address the issue,either pleading standard was satisfied.see wpp lux.gamma three sarl spot runner,cir in re gilead scis.sec,cir.because we find that the price fluctuations here would not rebut an inference of economic loss under either standard,we,like the ninth circuit,find it unnecessary to resolve this issue at this time.
traditionally,economic loss in section b cases has been determined by use of the measure for damages.under that measure,a defrauded buyer of securities is entitled to recover only the excess of what he paid over the value of what he got.levine seilon,cir friendly.in other words,damages consist of the difference between the price paid and the value of the stock when bought.elkind liggett myers,cir.the supreme court adopted the measure of damages in afiliated ute citizens united states,d.re
