ordinarily,when an employee is compensated with nonstatutory stock options that do not have a readily ascertainable fair market value at the time of the grant,the employee realizes income for tax purposes upon exercising the options see a e e a.the taxpayer is taxed on an amount equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of exercise minus the option price paid for the stock.see c.a id.a.internal revenue code c,however,allows taxpayers to defer recognition and valuation of income so long as a profitable sale of the stock acquired through the exercise of the options could subject a person to suit under section b of the securities exchange act of.c.section b,in turn,forbids a corporate insider from profiting on a purchase made within six months of a sale or a sale made within six months of a purchase of the corporation stock.see b.if a taxpayer is permitted to defer tax consequences under irc c,the taxpayer will be later taxed on an amount equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date that c no longer applies minus the option price paid for the stock.see a a.
in this opinion,we first interpret the phrase could subject a person to suit under section b and determine what that phrase requires a taxpayer to demonstrate before she can postpone tax consequences under c.we then hold that the taxpayer here has not demonstrated an entitlement to deferral of tax consequences under c,and after addressing a distinct legal issue pertinent to the ultimate resolution of this case,reverse and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural history 
in november,bernee strom was hired as the president and chief operating officer coo of,infospace she was appointed to the company board of directors around the same time she was hired.according to strom,about a year after joining infospace she announced that she was planning to leave the company because of ethical concerns with the way the company founder practiced business.
to avoid the market disruptions that might result from an abrupt resignation by the company president and coo,strom agreed to continue working in a different position at infospace for a few more months.she transitioned into the role of president of infospace venture capital fund ventures,a new venture capital division of infospace that later became a subsidiary.strom stayed on the board of directors of infospace until april and remained president of ventures until june,at which time she voluntarily resigned from ventures and severed all connection to infospace.
when strom was hired as president of infospace,she entered into three stock option agreements granting her a conditional right to purchase a total of shares of infospace stock at per share.most of the stock options were not vested at the time of grant.instead,the option agreements provided that strom would acquire a right to purchase a fixed number of shares on specified future dates.two of the agreements,collectively covering shares,provided that strom right to buy those shares would vest on certain dates so long as she was not terminated for cause or did not voluntarily leave infospace or an infospace affiliate.the third agreement governed the remaining shares and provided that,so long as strom was not terminated for cause or did not voluntarily leave the company,her options to buy those shares would vest at the latest six years after her start date,but sooner if gross revenue and net income performance criteria were met.
strom exercised options to acquire shares in september and december,and then almost monthly through july.because the market price of infospace stock rose substantially during and early,the value of the stock greatly exceeded strom option price during that period.in march,the value of infospace stock began rapidly to decline.by january,the market value fluctuated between and per share,down from prices in excess of per share in early though still in excess of strom option price at issue here is whether strom can postpone tax consequences attributable to her option exercises during this period.because she must report as gross income the difference between the market value of the stock and her option price,her taxes will be significantly lower if she can defer calculation of income until a period after the stock price dropped.see a a.
during strom employment,infospace was involved in mergers with three different companies.we explain the pertinence of those mergers below,but in brief,strom maintains that she was subject to an infospace policy that restricted her from selling her stock for a few months before and after each merger.infospace created that policy,strom represents,to comply with accounting rules,a method of accounting for business combinations or mergers permitted during the tax years at issue.
strom reported as gross income for,the year she began exercising options,the difference between the market value of the infospace stock on the dates she exercised her options and the option price.infospace withheld federal income and medicare taxes from strom wages for with respect to that income.strom did not,however,report any income on her income tax returns related to her exercise of infospace options,even though she exercised options that year.infospace did not withhold income tax with respect to strom exercise of stock options in,but it did withhold medicare tax premised on her realizing income by exercising those options.
strom filed administrative claims with the irs seeking a refund of the income and medicare taxes paid in and the medicare taxes paid in.when the irs failed to act on strom claims,she brought the instant refund suit in district court seeking to recover approximately million see.
the district court granted strom motion for summary judgment in the main,holding that she was entitled to defer the calculation and recognition of income attributable to her option exercises until december,almost the entire period at issue.the district court also granted summary judgment in favor of the government on a narrow ground,ruling that strom could not further defer tax consequences through january.

discussion 
as noted above,the ordinary rule is that an employee realizes income for tax purposes upon exercising a compensatory nonstatutory stock option that does not have a readily ascertainable fair market value at the time it is granted a e e a.this rule does not apply,however,until the employee rights to the stock obtained are transferable or are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.a.in other words,the employee can defer calculation of the gain realized until her rights to the stock are relatively secure id.the taxpayer is then taxed on an amount equal to the fair market value of such property at the first time the rights in such property are transferable or are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture,which ever occurs earlier,over the amount if any paid for such property.see a see also a.
rights in property can be subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture for a variety of reasons.for instance,an employee might receive property subject to a condition that it be forfeited if performance targets are not achieved.see generally c d providing examples.ordinarily,this determination depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case.id.at c.but the internal revenue code enumerates some specific ways property is deemed subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and not transferable.the provision pertinent to this case,c,provides 
so long as the sale of property at a profit could subject a person to suit under section b of the securities exchange act of,such person rights in such property are a subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture,and b not transferable.c a b emphasis added.section b of the securities exchange act of the exchange act is a prophylactic rule prohibiting corporate insiders from profiting on securities trades specifically,on a purchase and a sale of their company securities made within any period of less than six months.an insider who makes a prohibited trade must disgorge to the issuer any profit she received.see b foremost mckesson,provident sec.
irc c remedies a tension created by the interaction of the tax and securities laws namely,that absent the provision,a taxpayer could be forced to realize income on the exercise of options when,as a practical matter,she could not convert the stock received to cash without facing a realistic threat that she would forfeit the cash in a b suit.indeed,congress enacted c in response to a series of decisions from the united states tax court holding that taxpayers in such situations could not defer tax consequences,because section b of the securities exchange act does not make the stock nontransferable,and therefore does not affect the taxation of the stock,reprinted in,citing horwith comm r.the house ways and means committee considered that result inequitable.id.thus,c was enacted to ensure that stock subject to the application of section b will be treated as being subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture for the month period during which that section applies.id.in other words,c allows a taxpayer to postpone the tax consequences attributable to the exercise of options where she might otherwise be taxed on property that she could not realistically liquidate into cash.see boris bittker lawrence lokken,federal taxation of income,estates and gifts,at ed.section c was enacted to relieve the liquidity problem that formerly arose when employees subject to b were taxed on the receipt of stock but could not immediately sell the stock to raise money to pay the tax without incurring liability under b.
the key statutory question under irc c is what could subject a person to suit under section b means.as we explain below,that phrase signifies the following a taxpayer may postpone tax consequences attributable to the exercise of options if she can demonstrate that,if she had sold stock and a b suit was brought against her,there is an objectively reasonable chance that the suit would have succeeded.
starting,as usual,with the language of the statute,see,children hosp.health ctr.belshe,cir citing united states ron pair,inc,we determine the meaning of the statutory provision by examin ing not only the specific provision at issue,but also the structure of the statute as a whole.id.internal citations omitted.here,the statutory provision,c,speaks of subjecting a person to suit under b.c.this language makes clear that a taxpayer need not demonstrate that she would have been liable if she had sold stock and a b suit was brought against her.if congress intended such a result,the statute would have been drafted to so provide stating,for example,that rights in property are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and not transferable,s o long as the sale of property at a profit could subject a person to forfeiture of the profit under section b.
our interpretation is supported by the consideration that the could subject a person to suit phrase describes a specific instance in which rights in property are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and not transferable.c.a risk of forfeiture of profits from the sale of stock exists even where a b suit with a reasonable chance of success is brought,yet ultimately fails.likewise,in that case,congress has determined when it rejected the cases to the contrary by enacting c,that the stock itself is as a practical matter not transferable,because a prudent person would not sell it in the face of the legitimate threat of forfeiting the profits obtained from the sale.finally,the phrase could subject a person to suit accounts for the likelihood that,in cases where the application of b is not clear,a taxpayer will be unwilling to sell stock for fear of incurring substantial legal expenses defending herself against a b suit that could survive a motion to dismiss or summary judgment but might nonetheless fail 
at the same time,and conversely,c does not apply where any b suit,even an entirely frivolous one,could have been filed against the taxpayer.the could subject a person to suit language of c,standing alone,could perhaps be so read.but the provision,as noted,is expressly described in the statute as a particular circumstance in which rights in property are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and not transferable.c a b.it would be senseless to say that there was a substantial risk of forfeiture and that rights were not transferable if a potential b suit threatened no realistic possibility of forcing an insider to disgorge profits from a securities sale.
moreover,the precept that c requires a realistic chance of forfeiture is consistent with our prior treatment of the term substantial risk of forfeiture as it appears in other subsections of.as noted above,rights in property can be subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture under for a variety of reasons.in these other contexts,t he risk of forfeiture analysis requires a court to determine the chances the employee will lose his rights in property transferred by his employer.theophilos comm r,cir emphasis added.we have not defined how likely the chances that an employee will lose property rights must be,but our caselaw requires more than a remote risk.for instance,in theophilos,an employee signed an agreement obligating him to purchase stock in a corporation once it amended its articles of incorporation.id.at.the commissioner maintained that the contractual right to buy the stock was subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture until the corporation actually amended its articles of incorporation,which required approval from the corporation board of directors and shareholders.id.at.we rejected that argument because,among other reasons,we found it unlikely that the corporation would have been unable,in good faith,to gain approval for the amendment.thus,there was no substantial risk of forfeiture after the contract to acquire stock became binding.id.at emphasis added see also robinson comm r,cir explaining that,for purposes of a,t he use of the modifier substantial indicates that the risk must be real.
there is no reason to interpret the phrase could subject a person to suit under section b contained in c any differently from how we interpret other ways that rights to property are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture under.these subsections are intended to protect taxpayers who possess only limited rights in property from immediate taxation in such instances,we evaluate the realistic chances that an employee will be forced to forfeit their property rights.see gonzales oregon,s tatutes should not be read as a series of unrelated and isolated provisions.quotation omitted mccarthy bronson,in ascertaining the plain meaning of a statute,the court must look to the particular statutory language at issue,as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.quotation omitted.
given the statutory text and context,and in light of the congressional intent underlying the provision,the best interpretation of c is that a taxpayer may defer the calculation and recognition of income if there is an objectively reasonable chance that a suit under b based on a sale of her stock would have succeeded.that standard roughly equates to a determination of whether a reasonably prudent and legally sophisticated person would not have sold her stock,because,if a b suit had been brought against her,she likely would have been forced to forfeit the profit obtained by the sale or,at a minimum,she would have faced substantial legal expenses defending herself against a claim not readily dismissed.
the standard we adopt is somewhat more stringent than the federal rule of civil procedure frivolousness standard used by the district court.rule sets a low bar it deters baseless filings by requiring a reasonable inquiry that there is some plausible basis for the theories alleged.see cooter gell hartmarx,holgate baldwin,cir t he word frivolous denote s a filing that is both baseless and made without a reasonable and competent inquiry.quotation omitted united ins.r d latex,cir reversing rule sanctions because c ounsel had some plausible basis,albeit quite a weak one for the argument advanced.so,for example,a suit raising a novel issue of law as to which there is no caselaw to the contrary would not be subject to rule sanctions,even if it was subject to dismissal on the pleadings for failure to state a claim for relief.see,larez holcomb,cir w e must exercise extreme caution in sanctioning attorneys under rule,particularly where such sanctions emerge from an attorney efforts to secure the court recognition of new rights.simon debartolo,richard jacobs,cir t o constitute a frivolous legal position for purposes of rule sanction,it must be clear under existing precedents that there is no chance of success and no reasonable argument to extend,modify or reverse the law as it stands.quotation omitted.we do not believe that a reasonably prudent and legally sophisticated insider would hesitate to sell stock simply because a b suit not squarely foreclosed by existing precedents could be filed against her.
we also note that a suit capable of surviving a rule b motion to dismiss is not necessarily sufficiently meritorious to satisfy the standard we articulate for c,although it could be.a taxpayer seeking deferral of tax consequences under c will often have access to factual information regarding whether a transaction would be prohibited by b.she therefore could be relatively certain that,although a b suit might survive a rule b motion because it is dependent on a minimal factual showing,it could not succeed an early summary judgment motion premised on establishing the requisite facts.thus,while an insider might be assured to a near certainty that she will not be liable in a b suit because the challenged transactions were not prohibited,the applicability of b often will turn on factual issues not appropriately resolved on a motion to dismiss for example,whether the transactions were approved by the issuer board of directors and so exempt from b.see b d.in such a case,there is not a realistic possibility that the taxpayer would forfeit her profits in a b suit,and so her property rights can not be characterized as subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.
having established the standard for deferral of tax consequences under c namely,a taxpayer must show that a b suit premised on a sale of her stock would have had an objectively reasonable chance of success we now turn to whether strom has demonstrated that a sale of her infospace stock could have subjected her to a b suit meeting that standard.
section b of the exchange act reads in relevant part 
for the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by a beneficial owner,director,or officer by reason of his relationship to the issuer,any profit realized by him from any purchase and sale,or any sale and purchase,of any equity security of such issuer involving any such equity security within any period of less than six months shall inure to and be recoverable by the issuer,irrespective of any intention on the part of such beneficial owner,director,or officer in entering into such transaction.
thus,t here are four basic elements of a section b claim a purchase and a sale of securities by an officer or director of the issuer or by a shareholder who owns more than ten percent of any one class of the issuer securities within a period.simmonds credit suisse sec.usa llc,wl,at cir,quoting gwozdzinsky fund,cir.we have described b as a blunt instrument targeted at a class of transactions in which the possibility of abuse was believed to be intolerably great.dreiling am.express,cir quoting kern county land occidental petroleum.consequently,the statute is overinclusive in that it imposes strict liability regardless of motive,including trades not actually based on inside information.id.citing kern county,at.it is in that there is no liability for trades made on inside information if more than six months transpire between purchase and sale.see also thomas lee hazen,the law of securities regulation ed.
here,the parties disagree on the dates at which strom purchased her options,and thereby contest the period that she could have been liable under b if she had sold stock 
strom contends that her options were purchased under b on each date that they vested.because her options vested periodically every six months or less,she claims that any sale of her stock could have been matched with any of those periodic vesting dates.under this theory,she was precluded from selling her stock from november,the date the first options vested until december,after the final vesting date.
the government disagrees,maintaining that the sole purchase under b occurred when strom was granted the options in subsequent vesting of the options were not purchases.according to the government,therefore,the window for potential liability under b would have ended in may,six months after she was granted the unvested options and about four months before she exercised any of them.
if strom theory is correct,that each vesting date constituted a new purchase under b,or if a suit premised on that theory would have had a realistic chance of imposing b liability,then she could not have sold stock from november until december,without facing a serious risk of forfeiting the profit in a b suit,or at least incurring considerable legal fees defending such a suit.thus,under the tax provision discussed above,c,she could defer tax consequences from her exercises of options throughout the entire period because she was exposed to a b suit with an objectively reasonable chance of success if her theory is wrong,or does not at least present a close question,then she was free to sell her stock after may without risk of b liability,and so she was not entitled to defer tax consequences under c from her exercise of options after that date.
to evaluate strom b thesis,we need to delve into treatment under the exchange act of derivative securities generally and stock options in particular.the exchange act itself says nothing about whether the grant or vesting of an unvested option is considered the purchase of an equity security the accompanying regulations,however,offer several pertinent definitions.
those regulations provide,first,that the establishment of a call equivalent position shall be deemed a purchase of the underlying security for purposes of section b.b a.a call equivalent position,in turn,is defined as a derivative security position that increases in value as the value of the underlying equity increases.id.a b.finally,derivative securities include any option with an exercise or conversion privilege at a price related to an equity security,or with a value derived from the value of an equity security.id.a c.
undoubtedly,under these definitions,when strom options vested,they constituted derivative securities providing her with a call equivalent position.because the options had a fixed exercise price,their value was derived from the value of the underlying stock meaning that,when the stock price rose,the value of her options rose with it.the harder question is whether a call equivalent position was establish ed and so a purchase occurred for b purposes earlier than the vesting dates.specifically,did a purchase occur when the options were originally granted but were not yet vested and so could not be exercised 
the starting point for addressing this question is an sec rule promulgation in that overhauled the treatment of derivative securities for purposes of including establishing the definitions quoted above.those rules,and an accompanying agency release explaining them,clarified that the grant or acquisition of a derivative security constitutes the purchase of that security under b.ownership reports and trading by officers,directors and principal security holders,exchange release,hereinafter release.so long as the derivative security has a fixed price when granted,its value is a function of the price of the underlying equity security id.at.the profit obtainable from the option is the difference between the fixed price at acquisition and the price at which stock obtained through exercise of the option is eventually sold.thus,the potential for insider abuse arises when the option price is negotiated and fixed,and it is that date that is matched as a purchase with the eventual sale of stock under b.this framework recognizes that,holding derivative securities is functionally equivalent to holding the underlying equity securities for purposes of section.id.at.in both instances,the security is purchased under b when acquired,not at some later date.id.
contrary to strom contentions,the sec rules and the release accompanying those rules do not differentiate between vested and unvested securities.rather,the release interpreted the rules to mean that a purchase under b occurs on the date stock or a derivative security is granted,regardless of whether the security is vested when granted.the sec explained that,in the case of stock,
t he acquisition of restricted stock containing vesting or forfeiture provisions likewise is deemed to occur as of the date of grant even if not vested or subject to risk of forfeiture.the vesting of the stock or the lapse of a forfeiture provision is not a reportable event for purposes of section.
release at emphasis added.
this passage clarifies that unvested securities are acquired,and thus purchased under b,when granted.moreover,because the sec did not intend the vesting of restricted stock to constitute a reportable event under a,the agency also did not intend vesting to constitute a purchase under b.this conclusion follows because any event that triggers liability under b must first be a reportable event under a.see citadel holding roven,cir w here the sec does not require reporting under a,there can be no liability under b.
while the portion of the release quoted above addresses the acquisition of stock,not derivative securities,there is every indication that the sec interpretation of its rules treats the two forms of securities identically in this respect.the sec emphasized in the release the functional equivalence of derivative securities and their underlying equity securities for section purposes.release at.indeed,a primary justification for the rules was to equate ownership of the derivative security to ownership of the underlying equity security.id.at.more directly,the sec specifically explained that a derivative security is reportable upon acquisition,whether or not the derivative security is presently exercisable.id.at.
in sum,the sec release contemporaneously interpreted its rules as establishing three related principles derivative securities are purchased under b when granted or acquired that rule applies to securities that are unvested or not immediately exercisable and the vesting of restricted stock or derivative securities is not reportable under a and so can not be a purchase under b.contrary to strom theory,the date of vesting is not reportable and does not constitute a purchase.
we owe substantial deference to the sec published interpretation of its own regulations and will treat it as controlling if it is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation s.sec phan,cir quoting auer robbins,internal quotation marks omitted.here,the sec interpretation is sensible and furthers the purposes of b.underlying the prohibitions contained in b is the presumption that inside information will often motivate both a purchase and a sale made within a short period.see,blau max factor,cir.the opportunity to abuse inside information arises when an insider negotiates an option price.it therefore makes sense to identify the date an option price is fixed and granted as triggering the b period.subsequent vesting,in contrast,generally occurs more or less automatically for example,as is the case here,vesting may be contingent only on continued employment and the passage of time.under these circumstances,there generally is no opportunity for the insider to manipulate the vesting of her options on the basis of material inside information.while investors might unfairly trade on inside information within six months of the vesting dates,such transactions should not be covered by b the b rule is and targets paired transactions that both offer the opportunity for an insider to abuse material inside information,whether or not that opportunity is exploited.see dreiling,at.
to illustrate,consider an example,slightly altered,from the release 
a n insider with knowledge of a positive material development,to be announced shortly,determines that while he wants to retain his existing equity position,he wants to take advantage of the information,so he negotiates and is granted fixed price options that will vest in months.after the public announcement and rise in stock price the insider sells his common stock that he otherwise holds,obtaining a profit,knowing that he can replace the common stock shares at a predetermined price since he holds the options.
release at.in this example,it makes sense to match the insider grant of the unvested options as a purchase with the sale of common stock inside information motivated both transactions.in contrast,there is no potential for the manipulation of inside information on the subsequent vesting date of the option,so there is no reason to think that that date should fall within the class of transactions in which the possibility of abuse was believed to be intolerably great.dreiling,at quoting kern county,at.
the sec interpretation therefore comports with the purposes of b.strom does not argue otherwise,or that the interpretation is erroneous or inconsistent with the agency regulations.rather,she advances several reasons to think that the sec in fact meant to treat vested and unvested options differently in the release.none of these arguments persuades us that our interpretation of the sec release is incorrect.
strom points out,first,that the statements from the release indicating that the rules governed derivative securities,whether or not they are presently exercisable,discuss reporting requirements under a,and those requirements are not entirely coextensive with b.but as we explained,where reporting is not required,b liability can not attach.see citadel,at.thus,when the sec states that the vesting of a security is not a reportable event,the agency is also saying that vesting does not constitute a purchase under b.
next,strom argues that the sec statements about present exercisab ility should be read as referring to instances where an option is vested,such that the holder has an absolute right to exercise it,but can not do so until some future date.she contends that her options were different because she would lose the right to exercise them if she left the company.her argument is squarely precluded by the sec conclusion that a security is acquired when granted,even if not vested or subject to risk of forfeiture.release at.
finally,strom seizes on instances in the release where the sec explains that derivative securities should be treated identically to the underlying equity securities,because ownership of either provides opportunities to lock in profit.id.at.strom claims that she did not have sufficiently complete ownership of her options because of the contingencies attached to them,and so she was never guaranteed a profit.thus,she maintains,her unvested options were not the functional equivalent of an insider direct ownership of stock.in support of this argument,she avers that there was no market for her unvested derivative securities,and she faced some uncertainty about her ability to realize a profit,because her options might never have vested and,in fact,she did forfeit a considerable portion of her unvested options when she left infospace.
despite these characteristics,the sec interpretation that both vested and unvested securities are purchased when acquired governs treatment of strom options.her arguments do not set her options apart from many securities plainly encompassed within the agency general rule.employment contracts often grant options that are nontransferable.and the sec expressly stated in its release that nontransferability does not warrant treating these securities differently from other options subject to the scope of b.id.at.the absence of a market for strom options,therefore,is of no import.
likewise,while strom options were not guaranteed to vest,she would forfeit unvested options only if she voluntarily ceased to be an employee or was terminated for cause.again,employee options are often so restricted,yet the sec decided to treat them identically to options,clarifying in the release that securities are purchased when granted,even when subject to risk of forfeiture.id.at.thus,the sec did not consider the uncertainty associated with unvested options pertinent.
in sum,strom arguments do not undermine the sec interpretation that vested and unvested options are both purchased under b when granted,not when they later vest.strom does not contend that the sec interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with its regulations.with one possible caveat discussed below,we adopt the agency stance.strom therefore can not establish based on the release that she could have been subject to a b suit with an objectively reasonable chance of success during the period pertinent to her tax liability.
as we have explained,the release provided a definitive sec interpretation that,under the rules governing b,the purchase of an unvested option occurs upon grant,not upon vesting.after the rulemaking,however,sec staff suggested a narrow exception to that rule through a series of letters addressing instruments granting options contingent on employees meeting performance targets.the letters indicate that,so long as instruments are contingent on conditions other than the passage of time and continued employment,they will not be considered derivative securit ies until those conditions are satisfied.it would then follow that no purchase occurs under b until the conditions are met and the instruments come to constitute derivative securities.
the staff letters interpretation is based on the definition in sec rule c of derivative securities as including any option with an exercise or conversion privilege at a price related to an equity security,or a value derived from the value of an equity security.a c.according to the staff letters,until the number of shares that an employee will be granted is fixed,the value of the instruments is not derived from the value of the underlying equity security.see certilman balin adler hyman,sec no action letter,fed.sec.cch,wl,at april,stating that where options conditioned the number of shares exercisable on earning targets,the options did not become derivative securities until those conditions were satisfied see also merrill lynch,sec no action letter,fed.sec.cch,wl,boston edison,sec no action letter,fed.sec,wl,ford motor,sec no action letter,fed.sec.cch,wl july.
in,the sec considered an amendment to the definition of derivative security to codify these staff interpretive positions.see ownership reports and trading by officers,directors and principal security holders,release,docket,wl,at may,hereinafter release.in the end,the sec endorse d the staff analysis but did not adopt it or codify it in the regulatory definitions.rather,to retain flexibility,the agency indicated that future questions on conditional derivative securities should continue to be addressed to staff,while stating that a condition will be considered material only if it possesses substance independent of the passage of time or continued employment.id.at.
for most of strom options,vesting was conditioned solely on elements the sec declared not material the passage of time and her continued employment.thus,upon acquisition,a large majority of strom options undoubtably had a value derived from the value of the equity security according to the sec pronouncements,and so fit the sec definition of derivative securities.a c.these options therefore did not fit into the staff interpretive exception,and so were purchased under b when granted.
still,a small percentage of strom options did contain performance conditions.those options,however,also did not fall within the class of instruments identified in the sec noaction letters.the number of options that strom could exercise on each date was fixed upon acquisition satisfying the performance conditions simply accelerated the vesting dates of the options.thus,putting aside the possibility of early vesting,her options would vest contingent only upon the passage of time and continued employment.they were therefore derivative securities when granted,and so also purchased under b at that time.
we express no opinion on the staff administrative exception identified here.for our purposes,it is sufficient to note that strom options are not encompassed by the staff interpretation.thus,the general rule established in the release that derivative securities are purchased under b when acquired applies to strom options,no matter the validity of the staff interpretation.because strom acquired her options in november,the window of potential b liability ended in may,before she exercised any options.as a result,strom was not entitled to defer tax consequences from her exercises of options throughout and under irc c,because,had she sold stock during that period,she would not have been subject to a b suit that had an objectively reasonable likelihood of success.
even so,strom maintains that no caselaw definitively addresses whether unvested options are purchased when they vest,and so even if her theory is wrong,she still could have been subject to a b suit with an objectively reasonable likelihood of success if she had sold her stock in and.we disagree.
strom is correct that no caselaw explicitly precludes her theory of securities law of course,the sec interpretation of its regulations does preclude her theory,explaining,in part,the absence of caselaw on the issue the agency reasonable interpretation is sufficient to determine that there was no realistic possibility that she would have been forced to forfeit property from the sale of stock in a b suit.
the only case addressing the issue is not to the contrary.the court in dreiling america online,no,wl,denied a motion to dismiss a b suit premised on the theory that the vesting of options contingent upon performance targets constituted a purchase of those options.citing an sec staff letter articulating the exception for instruments conditioned on criteria other than the passage of time and continued employment,the court assumed without deciding that the vesting dates have the possibility of triggering section b liability as purchases.id.at.
because the instruments in dreiling were conditioned on performance criteria,it is plausible that,under the interpretive exception carved out by sec staff,the instruments did not constitute derivative securities until the criteria were satisfied.the district court willingness to assume that the vesting dates in that case could be sufficiently pertinent under b to preclude dismissal under rule b does not support strom argument that the vesting of her unvested options none of which fit into the sec staff exception constituted purchases under b 
to summarize our holdings under the sec interpretation of its rules,the vesting of strom unvested options did not constitute purchases under b.thus,she is not entitled to defer the tax consequences of her option exercises under irc c,because she has not demonstrated that she could have been subject to a b suit that had an objectively reasonable chance of success had she sold her stock at a profit in or.a reasonably prudent and legally sophisticated person in strom position would have felt free to sell her property,because,if a b suit had been brought against her,she would not have been forced to forfeit the profit obtained by the sale,nor would she have faced substantial legal expenses defending herself in a suit not readily dismissable.
should any of these holdings appear anomalous,it is because c incorporation into the tax code of b makes for strange bedfellows.the statutory and regulatory structures and purposes of the tax law and the securities law are distinct.in strom case,the interaction of the two statutory schemes means that she was not exposed to a realistic threat of forfeiting profits during the period when she was able to exercise options and thereby incur tax consequences,because the period of concern for b purposes had passed by then.there was therefore no overlap between the period of potential b liability and the period strom could incur tax consequences due to the options.but that lack of overlap wo exist in many other instances for example,where an employer grants vested options,or grants unvested options with a vesting schedule shorter than six months.so there is no anomaly,only an accommodation of two statutory schemes that turns out to have no impact on the facts of this particular case.
although the district court correctly rejected strom theory of securities law,it incorrectly applied the rule frivolousness standard under c in assessing the viability of a b suit,and so held that she was entitled to defer tax consequences attributable to her option exercises under c.we therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of strom on this ground.
to this point,our rulings prohibit strom from deferring the recognition and valuation of income attributable to her option exercises in and under irc c.the final question we face is whether strom could defer tax consequences for a distinct reason under treasury regulation k,strom could defer the tax consequences of her option exercises if her property rights were subject to restriction s on transfer to comply with the pooling of interests accounting rules.k.strom points to the three mergers in which infospace engaged in and,and arguing that her ability to sell stock was restricted for some months before and after each merger by an infospace policy designed to comply with accounting rules.according to strom,she is therefore entitled to defer the calculation and recognition of income during those restricted periods.
before explaining the rules,we address a procedural issue.because the district court held that strom could defer recognition and valuation of her income from until december,based on c,it did not decide whether restrictions also allowed her to defer tax consequences during that period.the district court discussion of this distinct argument was limited only to whether restrictions allowed strom further to defer tax consequences from december,into january.addressing that question,the district court concluded that the agency restrictions were not applicable during that short period.as will appear,we do not agree with the district court legal analysis as applied to that period or any other.we therefore reverse the district court on that issue.having done so,we remand for the district court to apply the correct legal standard for the restrictions to the entire period at issue,to january,now that income during that much longer period can no longer be sheltered under c.
the district court held that the treasury regulation allowing for deferral of tax consequences based on restrictions applies only when a policy limits the transferability of stock after a merger occurs.we do not agree with that conclusion.
the rules were a method of accounting for business mergers permitted during the tax years at issue for companies that met requirements set out in accounting principles board opinion.see accounting for business combinations opinion,superseded by statement of financial accounting standards sfas see also allegheny energy,dqe,cir describing the method.the rules required stockholders of both companies in a merger to share the risks of the combined entities.was accomplished in part by restricting officers from trading in shares of their company during the merger process.
the sec issued two releases,releases and,interpreting opinion.see accounting series release,hereinafter release accounting series release,hereinafter release.release noted an increasing number of mergers that appeared to satisfy the requirements for accounting set forth in opinion,but which did not conform with the overriding thrust of that opinion,because the mergers did not include a sufficient sharing of rights and risks among constituent stockholder s.release.in an effort to avoid form over substance and retain flexibility in future cases,the sec was careful to emphasize that there was no formula or absolute rules that would automatically qualify a merger for the rules.id.rather,release established general guidelines to assist companies contemplating business combinations.id.
shortly thereafter,the sec issued release to clarify that,after a merger,companies should restrict their officers transfers of stock until at least the publication date of financial results covering days of activity.specifically,release explained that the sec would consider the accounting requirements to be satisfied if no affiliate of either company in the business combination sells any common shares received in the business combination until such time as financial results covering at least days of post merger combined operations have been published.release.
a few years later,sec staff issued a bulletin interpreting releases and to mean that companies should also consider restricting their officers ability to trade stock before the consummation of a merger.see staff accounting bulletin,sec docket,wl,hereinafter sab.sec staff stated that it would be inconsistent to allow affiliates to sell their shares shortly before the consummation of a combination while restricting such sales immediately following the exchange.id.at the same time,the staff advised that it will generally not raise a question about the applicability of pooling of interests accounting as a result of dispositions of shares by affiliates prior to days before consummation of a business combination.id.
these sec materials established general guidelines regarding the rules.the principal inquiry remained whether the constituent stockholders sufficiently shared rights and risks during the merger.the agency provided some guidance regarding whether restrictions on the transfer of stock before and after mergers were consistent with the rules.but,aside from the rule articulated in release namely,that accounting will have occurred if no affiliate sells stock until publication of days of financial results the agency refrained from articulating absolute criteria establishing when the rules would be satisfied.
for the tax purposes at issue here,property restricted in compliance with rules is subject to substantial risk of forfeiture and not transferable 
for purposes of section and the regulations thereunder,property is subject to substantial risk of forfeiture and is not transferable so long as the property is subject to a restriction on transfer to comply with the pooling of interests accounting rules set forth in accounting series release numbered and.
the district court noted that treasury regulation k references only release and,and that those releases only expressly recommend that companies restrict their officers sales of stock,release explains that stock should not be transferred until after the publication of financial results covering days of activity.the district court concluded that k therefore must be limited only to restrictions on sales of stock,and that the regulation has no application to restrictions on officers sales of stock.the district court declined to consider the staff recommendations about restrictions in sab,because that bulletin is not referenced in the treasury regulation.
we can not agree with this interpretation.the pertinent question under treasury regulation k is whether property is subject to a restriction on transfer that complied with the rules set forth in releases and.those releases were quite broad and disclaimed any intention to limit the applicability of the rules to business combinations on the basis of rigid criteria.in other words,so long as a combination represents a sharing of rights and risks among stockholders,the releases contemplate a range of methods for restricting officers transfers of stock compatible with the method.finally,while we recognize that sab is not binding,the staff recommendation that releases and may require restrictions supports our interpretation.
with those criteria in mind,we remand for further proceedings.applying the principles we have enunciated will require factual inquiries not made by the district court because of the view it took on the c issue.for example,the parties dispute the terms and even the existence of an infospace policy restricting strom transfer of stock during the pertinent period.moreover,the precise dates of
