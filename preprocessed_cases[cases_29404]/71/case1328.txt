management of a corporation,including decisions concerning the prosecution of actions,is vested in its board of directors.when the board refuses to enforce corporate claims,however,the shareholder derivative suit provides a limited exception to the rule that the corporation is the proper party plaintiff.in deference to the managerial role of directors and in order to curb potential abuse,the shareholder asserting a derivative claim must make a threshold showing that he or she made a presuit demand on the board to take the desired action.this demand requirement was recognized over years ago by the supreme court see hawes city of oakland,and is codified in california see,subd.b hereafter,b under section b,a plaintiff must plead with particularity the attempts that were made to secure board action before bringing suit,or,alternatively,the factual basis upon which the plaintiff believes that a demand on the board was unnecessary,that a demand would have been futile.difficulties often arise in shareholder derivative suits in resolving whether the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts supporting demand futility,thereby obviating the need for a prior demand on the board and the concomitant opportunity for the directors to decide whether to pursue litigation on the corporation behalf.another issue that often presents itself is whether a shareholder who brings suit alleging an individual wrong or direct action is in fact asserting a derivative claim for which a demand on the board is required.both of these issues are present in the case before us.
plaintiff lauri cohen bader filed a shareholder derivative suit in may against apple,and its directors and officers.she challenged a cash performance bonus plan for nondirectors plan that was approved by apple shareholders after the dissemination of a march proxy statement proxy statement,or statement that she claimed was misleading.in her amended complaint,she alleged that she was pursuing both derivative claims and individual or direct claims.after the sustaining of three successive demurrers,and after the case had been pending for more than two years,the court sustained without leave to amend a demurrer to the fourth amended complaint complaint.the court concluded,among other things,that bader had failed to adequately plead demand futility,that the proxy statement was false or misleading,or facts sufficient to constitute a direct cause of action.
bader argues that she adequately pleaded both derivative and direct claims.she asserts further that the court erred because the demand futility doctrine is inapplicable to claims based upon materially false and misleading proxy statements.bader also contends that she adequately pleaded facts demonstrating that the proxy statement contained material misstatements and omissions.
in the published portion of this opinion,we conclude that bader lacked standing to assert derivative claims on behalf of apple because of her failure to make a presuit demand on the board and her failure to allege that the making of such a demand would have been futile.in so holding,we reject bader position that the requirement of specific pleading of a demand or,in the alternative,demand futility under section b is inapplicable to derivative suits based upon alleged misrepresentations in proxy statements.we also hold in the published portion of this opinion that the claims bader purported to assert in the complaint as direct claims on behalf of herself and all similarly situated shareholders are not maintainable,because the gravamen of those claims is corporate in nature and may therefore be asserted only by the corporation.in the unpublished portions of this opinion,we reject bader derivative claim based on the contention that the plan adoption was invalid conclude that the allegations of the complaint were insufficient to support a derivative claim based upon an allegedly false or misleading proxy statement dispose of bader remaining contentions by holding that they have been forfeited and find that the court did not abuse its discretion by denying bader leave to amend where she failed to identify in what manner the complaint could be amended to state a viable claim.accordingly,we will affirm the judgment of dismissal.
procedural background 
superseded pleadings 
on may,bader filed a shareholder derivative complaint alleging three causes of action,naming apple,seven individuals alleged to be members of its board of directors,and nine individuals alleged to be executive officers and plan participants prior to defendants filing an answer,bader filed an amended complaint alleging three causes of action.bader asserted both direct and derivative claims challenging the adoption of the plan,claiming that the proxy statement soliciting the shareholder vote was false and misleading.defendants filed a demurrer,which was sustained by the court with leave to amend.
in bader second amended complaint,she again alleged both direct and derivative claims in three causes of action.the court sustained defendants demurrer with leave to amend as to apple and the apple directors.the court concluded,inter alia,that the claims alleged were derivative,not direct bader had failed to plead facts sufficient to establish demand futility required for a derivative action and bader had failed to allege sufficient facts that the proxy statement was false or misleading.the court also sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the apple officers.
bader filed a third amended complaint,alleging that she was asserting both a stockholder direct or class action as well as a derivative action.she alleged five causes of action.apple and the apple directors again demurred the court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.the court concluded,inter alia,that bader had failed to allege sufficient facts that the proxy statement was false or misleading to support her direct shareholder claim even if such allegations had been sufficient,bader could not assert a direct claim because the primary alleged injury was to apple the class action allegations were insufficient and bader had again failed to plead facts sufficient to establish demand futility required for a derivative action.the court also allowed bader to conduct limited discovery on the issue of demand futility.
ii.fourth amended complaint 
on april,bader filed a fourth amended complaint.in it,she alleged six causes of action,namely,for a declaration that the plan was void because it was not adopted in accordance with california law a declaration that the plan was void because there were material misstatements and omissions in the proxy statement breach of fiduciary duty unfair and unlawful business practices in violation of business and professions code,section violations of the express terms of the plan and waste.
bader alleged that she had been an apple shareholder continuously since october.she brought the action for the benefit of apple to redress injuries suffered and to be suffered by apple as a result of the conduct of the individual defendants.bader did not make a prior demand on the board in accordance with section b.she claimed that her suit did not concern a management decision and therefore the business judgment rule did not apply.bader alleged that because the demand requirement is an extension of the business judgment rule,she was not required to make a presuit demand.demand was,in any event,not required because t he entire board was neither disinterested nor independent 
in the first cause of action claiming that the plan was invalidly adopted,bader alleged that the board had appointed a compensation committee committee consisting of three persons campbell,drexler,and gore,and that the committee authorized and enacted the plan ultimately approved by the shareholders.the board itself never approved the plan,an omission that rendered its purported adoption invalid pursuant to section.
the second cause of action captioned material misstatements and omissions in proxy statement extensively referred to and quoted from the statement over the course of pages of text.the board authorized the distribution of the proxy statement to shareholders for the purpose of,inter alia,approval of the plan at the annual shareholders meeting scheduled for april.each of the defendants knew or should have known that the proxy statement contained materially false or misleading representations and omissions the complaint alleged that the statement falsely represented that bonus payments made under the plan,if the plan were approved,would qualify as compensation that would be deductible as provided in section,subdivision m of the internal revenue code,title united states code section,subdivision m irc,m.bader alleged further that the statement use of the term operating margin was false or misleading the term was vague and nonobjective,and was not a performance goal stated in the plan.the proxy statement was also false or misleading in that it stated that the committee would make an adjustment in evaluating performance under a performance criterion by excluding extraordinary items a phrase that is not an accounting expression.
it was also alleged in the second cause of action that the proxy statement was false and misleading because it did not disclose the identities and the number of persons who were eligible under the plan,did not define the term key employee,and did not disclose the number of such employees that would participate in the plan.the proxy statement represented that the committee had engaged an outside compensation consultant,who had concluded that the total cash compensation paid to apple executive vice president and senior vice presidents was not competitive and falls significantly below market median due to the absence of a cash bonus program.but the statement did not disclose whether the consultant had reached that conclusion with the benefit of the additional information that apple had granted restricted stock units rsus to various executive officers in march worth millions of dollars.
the third through sixth causes of action incorporated by reference the prior paragraphs of the complaint.in the third claim,bader alleged that the apple directors and apple officers breached their fiduciary duties owed to the corporation and its shareholders.in the fourth cause of action,bader alleged that defendants conduct constituted unfair and unlawful business acts or practices within the meaning of business and professions code section.in the fifth cause of action captioned as a claim for violations of the express terms of the plan,she alleged that the board had permitted the use of undefined performance goals,including operating margin goals,to be used in implementing the plan for apple and fiscal years.the sixth cause of action alleged a claim of waste,based upon the making of bonus payments under the plan the issuance in and of the rsus to senior officers,because they were structured in a way that the payments were nondeductible by apple and the grant in january to jobs of options to purchase of apple shares,which option grants may have been backdated and therefore nondeductible by apple.
apple and the apple directors again filed a demurrer.the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.the court concluded,inter alia,that bader had again failed to plead facts sufficient to establish that she was excused from making demand on apple board of directors before bringing suit the proxy statement was false or misleading she had a viable direct cause of action or the plan was invalid because its manner of adoption did not comply with california law.
a judgment of dismissal was entered in favor of defendants on october.bader filed a timely notice of appeal.the matter is a proper subject for appellate review.berri superior court cal d,hill city of long beach th,d.

ii.applicable law 
corporate governance and derivative suits 
it is a fundamental principle of corporate governance that the role of managing the business of the corporation is vested in its board of directors,not in its shareholders.grosset wenaas cal th,d.this responsibility includes the prosecution,defense,and control of corporate litigation.ibid.judicial deference is accorded to directors under the business judgment rule,which recognizes that where decisions are without fraud or breach of trust,management of the corporation is best left to those to whom it has been entrusted,not to the courts.citation.desaigoudar meyercord th,d.as codified in section,the business judgment rule obligates a director to perform his or her duties in good faith,in a manner such director believes to be in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders and with such care,including reasonable inquiry,as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances,subd.a and it insulates a director from liability when he or she performs those obligations in the manner provided in the statute,subd.c 
in light of the directors role in the operation of the business affairs of the corporation,where conduct,including mismanagement by corporate officers,causes damage to the corporation,it is the entity that must bring suit the individual shareholder may not bring an action for indirect personal losses,decrease in stock value sustained as a result of the overall harm to the entity.anderson derrick cal,see also nelson anderson th,d.a contrary rule would authorize multitudinous litigation and ignore the corporate entity.citation.schuster gardner th,d schuster.and d irectors have the same discretion with respect to the prosecution of claims on behalf of the corporation as they have in other business matters.findley garrett d,findley.thus,the business judgment rule protects a board good faith decision to reject a derivative lawsuit so long as the majority of the board does not have a personal interest in the lawsuit outcome.desaigoudar meyercord,supra,th at,d see also,subd.a iii.
this principle that the corporation must bring suit on its own behalf notwithstanding,where the directors fail or refuse to act,a shareholder has a sufficient interest in the entity to justify the bringing of a propulsive action,designed to set in motion the judicial machinery for the redress of the wrong to the corporation.citations.klopstock superior court cal d,klopstock.t he corporation is the ultimate beneficiary of such a derivative suit.id.at.a derivative lawsuit is in essence a consolidation in equity of two suits,one by the shareholder against the directors seeking an order that they sue those who have wronged the corporation,and the other by the corporation against the wrongdoers.daily income fund,fox,fn,d.a presuit demand on the directors,however,is ordinarily required for the bringing of a derivative action.
derivative and demand excusal 
as a precondition for bringing a derivative action on behalf of the corporation,the shareholder should show to the satisfaction of the court that he has exhausted all the means within his reach to obtain,within the corporation itself,the redress of his grievances,or action in conformity with his wishes.he must make an earnest,not a simulated effort,with the managing body of the corporation,to induce remedial action on their part,and this must be apparent to the court.hawes city of oakland,supra,at.the shareholder must demonstrate to the court with particularity the efforts he or she made to induce the directors to take action.id.at.as the supreme court later explained,hawes sought to maintain derivative suits as a limited exception to the usual rule that the proper party to bring a claim on behalf of a corporation is the corporation itself,acting through its directors or the majority of its shareholders the principal means by which the court in hawes sought to vindicate this policy was,of course,its requirement that a shareholder seek action by the corporation itself before bringing a derivative suit.citation.this demand requirement affords the directors an opportunity to exercise their reasonable business judgment and waive a legal right vested in the corporation in the belief that its best interests will be promoted by not insisting on such right.they may regard the expense of enforcing the right or the furtherance of the general business of the corporation in determining whether to waive or insist upon the right.citation.on the other hand,if,in the view of the directors,litigation is appropriate,acceptance of the demand places the resources of the corporation,including its information,personnel,funds,and counsel,behind the suit.citation.daily income fund,fox,supra,at,fn.omitted.
this requirement that a shareholder establish that he or she made a suitable demand,unless excused by extraordinary conditions citation kamen kemper financial services,d kamen,is to encourage intracorporate resolution of disputes and to protect the managerial freedom of those to whom the responsibility of running the business is delegated shields singleton th,d shields.the demand requirement is also intended to prevent the abuse of the derivative suit remedy.kamen,at.the demand requirement under federal law is embodied in rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.kamen,at.california demand requirement under section b is similar to the federal rule and requires that the plaintiff in a shareholder derivative suit allege in the complaint with particularity plaintiff efforts to secure from the board such action as plaintiff desires,or the reasons for not making such effort,and allege further that plaintiff has either informed the corporation or the board in writing of the ultimate facts of each cause of action against each defendant or delivered to the corporation or the board a true copy of the complaint which plaintiff proposes to file.
as discussed below,a critical issue is whether bader adequately pleaded circumstances excusing her from making demand on apple board,demand futility.although jurisdictions differ widely in defining the circumstances under which demand on directors will be excused,citation,demand typically is deemed futile when a majority of the directors have participated in or approved the alleged wrongdoing,citation,or are otherwise financially interested in the challenged transactions,citation.kamen,supra,at,fn.omitted.in california,there have been few cases that have attempted to delineate the circumstances constituting demand futility.however,given the requirement under section b that allegations be made with particularity,it is clear that general averments that the directors were involved in a conspiracy or aided and abetted the wrongful acts complained of will not suffice to show demand futility.shields,supra,th at,d.likewise,a general claim that there is nationwide structural bias common to corporate boards will not excuse the making of a demand before bringing a derivative suit.oakland raiders national football league th,d oakland raiders i.rather,the court must be apprised of facts specific to each director from which it can conclude that that particular director could or could not be expected to fairly evaluate the claims of the shareholder plaintiff.shields,at,d.thus,the court,in reviewing the allegations to support demand futility,must be able to determine on a basis whether or not each possesses independence or disinterest such that he or she may fairly evaluate the challenged transaction.oakland raiders i,at,d.
the test commonly employed in determining the adequacy of the pleading of demand futility was enunciated by the delaware supreme court in aronson lewis aronson the court there observed that the entire question of demand futility is inextricably bound to issues of business judgment and the standards of that doctrine applicability.id.at.aronson held that a court,in deciding whether a plaintiff will be excused from making a demand on the board,must evaluate whether,under the particularized facts alleged,a reasonable doubt is created that the directors are disinterested and independent and the challenged transaction was otherwise the product of a valid exercise of business judgment.id.at see also oakland raiders i,supra,th at,d describing aronson test.f utility is gauged by the circumstances existing at the commencement of a derivative suit.aronson,supra,at.and the test under aronson is disjunctive accordingly,there is demand excusal if either prong is satisfied.brehm eisner.
the delaware supreme court later clarified in rales blasband,rales,that the aronson test could not be applied mechanically to all derivative suits in which no prior demand is made.instead,although the aronson standard is to actions challenging conscious decisions by boards to act or refrain from acting,the business judgment rule and hence the test in aronson could not be applied where there was no board action,such as where the business decision complained of was made by the board,the majority of whose members were no longer part of the directorate when the suit was filed the matter complained of was not a board business decision or the challenged decision was made by the board of a different corporation.rales,at.in those instances,the court inquires whether the board that would be addressing the demand can impartially consider its merits without being influenced by improper considerations.thus,a court must determine whether or not the particularized factual allegations of a derivative stockholder complaint create a reasonable doubt that,as of the time the complaint is filed,the board of directors could have properly exercised its independent and disinterested business judgment in responding to a demand.id.at.
a director will be deemed not to be disinterested if the facts alleged demonstrate a potential personal benefit or detriment to the director as a result of the decision.beam stewart,fn.omitted beam see also rales,supra,at.the personal benefit must arise out of the transaction being challenged.rales,supra,at.such a showing that a director may not be disinterested is not made through general allegations that he or she sold stock in the company while in possession of material,nonpublic information.in re verisign.derivative litig.d.but where there is a showing that a director is not disinterested,and the transaction has not been approved by a majority of directors,the business judgment rule does not come into play demand futility is established.aronson,supra,at.
the derivative plaintiff seeking demand excusal based upon a director lack of independence must allege specific facts that cast doubt as to whether the director decision is based on the corporate merits of the subject before the board,rather than extraneous considerations or influences.beam,supra,at,fn.omitted.such lack of independence may be demonstrated by specific facts showing that the director is beholden to an interested director or officer,or so under their influence that their discretion would be sterilized.citation.in re securities litigation d,quoting rales,supra,at.where the claim is that specified directors lack independence because they are dominated by a controlling shareholder,the general allegation that the controlling shareholder personally selected the directors is insufficient.aronson,supra,at.rather,in addition to alleging control,the plaintiff is required to present specific facts showing that through personal or other relationships the directors are beholden to the controlling person.citations.see also beam,supra,at,fn.omitted allegations must show relationship was so substantial that noninterested director would be more willing to risk his or her reputation than risk the relationship with the interested director fn.omitted.and in this context,simple allegations,of themselves,that a director has a personal friendship or outside business relationship with the controlling person will not suffice to cast a reasonable doubt as to the director independence.beam,supra,at.
a mere threat of personal liability for approving a questioned transaction by itself is insufficient to refute the disinterestedness or independence of a director.aronson,supra,at.therefore,a plaintiff may not bootstrap allegations of futility by pleading merely that the directors participated in the challenged transaction or that they would be reluctant to sue themselves.citation.in re sagent technology.derivative litig.d.in that vein,the fact that the board approved the challenged transaction,of itself,does not establish demand futility under the theory that such approval automatically connotes hostile interest and guilty participation by directors.aronson,supra,at.to hold otherwise would eviscerate the demand requirement entirely.ibid.
derivative direct claims 
as noted,a derivative suit is one in which the shareholder seeks redress of the wrong to the corporation.citations.klopstock,supra,cal d at.thus,an action is derivative,in the corporate right,if the gravamen of the complaint is injury to the corporation,or to the whole body of its stock and property without any severance or distribution among individual holders,or it seeks to recover assets for the corporation or to prevent the dissipation of its assets.citations.jones ahmanson cal d.on the other hand,a direct or individual suit by a stockholder is a suit to enforce a right against the corporation which the stockholder possesses as an individual.citation.id.at.a direct as opposed to a derivative action is maintainable only if the damages are not incidental to an injury to the corporation.citation.nelson anderson,supra,th at,d.and the two actions are mutually exclusive,the right of action and recovery belongs to either the shareholders direct action or to the corporation derivative action.oakland raiders national football league th,d oakland raiders ii,quoting friedman,cal.practice guide corporations the rutter group.
iii.standing to assert derivative claims 
since each of the six causes of action of the complaint is asserted as a derivative claim,we first examine whether bader had standing to sue as a result of having complied with the demand requirement of section b.there is no assertion that bader made a presuit demand upon apple board accordingly,the question is whether she allege d in the complaint with particularity her reasons for not making a demand.ibid.the failure to comply with this requirement under section b leaves a without standing to bring a derivative claim on behalf of the corporation.nelson anderson,supra,th at,d.
here,bader claimed in her complaint that she was exempt from the requirement of making a demand on the board because her suit did not challenge a business decision.alternatively,she alleged that a demand would have been futile because t he entire board was neither disinterested nor independent since every member of the board is liable for the material misstatements and omissions in the proxy statement,violations of the plan,violations of statute and commission of waste.
claimed exemption from demand requirement 
bader contends that in light of the fact that her claim arose out of the proxy statement,it is uniformly recognized that the demand futility rule excuses demand upon the b oard because the submission of a misleading proxy statement to shareholders is not an exercise of business judgment.in essence,she argues that by virtue of the nature of her claim,a challenge to the proxy statement,she was exempt from the requirement under section b that she plead with particularity the reasons for being excused from making a presuit demand.we reject that argument 
in support of her contention that she is exempt from making a demand on apple board,bader cites vides amelio d vides.in vides,the plaintiff brought a derivative action asserting federal violation of a of the securities exchange act,a and breach of fiduciary duty claims arising out of the distribution of a false and misleading proxy statement.vides at.the court,in rejecting the defendants attempt to dismiss the case because of the absence of a presuit demand,held that under delaware law,no demand was required for such a claim arising out of misstatements and omissions in a proxy statement.id.at.the court reasoned that a presuit demand has little bearing on a claim that a proxy statement makes a false assertion or an insufficient disclosure.such questions are normally determined without particular need for business judgment,and the courts decide them as a matter of course.whether a proxy statement properly omitted an item is regarded as a question of materiality,not one protected by the business judgment rule.id.at.
similarly,seinfeld barrett,wl,dist.lexis seinfeld,cited by bader,involved a derivative suit in which the plaintiff alleged a federal securities claim arising out of the issuance of an allegedly false or misleading proxy statement that represented that bonuses listed in a proposed executive officer incentive compensation program eiop would be tax deductible.the court held that the plaintiff failure to make a presuit demand was excused because he had pleaded facts sufficient to raise a reason to doubt that the action was taken honestly and in good faith by alleging that the d efendants made a false or misleading statement when they promised tax deductions to shareholders in return for their approval of the eiop,when,in fact,no tax deduction would result id.at,at pp.
katz pels.katz,also cited by bader,is not persuasive.there,the court rejected the defendants claim that the plaintiffs federal securities claim based upon omission of material facts in a proxy statement should be dismissed because there was no presuit demand.the court concluded that because the suit was both direct and derivative,no demand was required.id.at.as we discuss post,we disagree with bader assertion that her challenge to the proxy statement here constituted a direct as well as a derivative claim.accordingly,the reasoning of katz,concluding that the plaintiffs could maintain parallel direct and derivative federal securities claims,does not apply here.
a number of cases have questioned the soundness of the holding in vides,supra,d,and other cases similarly holding that plaintiffs asserting derivative federal securities claims based upon misleading proxy statements are exempt from making a presuit demand on a corporation board of directors.see,in re cnet networks d,cnet rejecting vides,concluding that weight of authority supported application of demand requirement to federal securities derivative suit in re networks,no,wl,dist.lexis,same.for instance,in clair shores employees ret.system eibeler,civ.swk,wl,dist.lexis clair shores,the plaintiff alleged direct and derivative claims that included a federal securities claim based upon alleged nondisclosure of material facts in three proxy statements that resulted in the approval of employee stock option plans.id.at,at pp.the plaintiff argued that its derivative federal claim was a species of derivative claim not subject to the demand requirement and business judgment rule.id.at,at.the court rejected this position.
after acknowledging the existence of some conflict on the issue clair shores,supra,wl,fn,dist.lexis at pp.fn.citing vides,the court noted that the second circuit had held that the presuit demand requirement applied to federal securities litigation,and thereby had impliedly held that the business judgment also applied.clair shores,supra,wl,at,citing lewis graves cir.further,after observing that a board decision concerning the contents of a proxy statement would not under all circumstances be protected under the business judgment rule,the court held that this is no reason to conclude,as some courts have,that a board decision as to whether the corporation should pursue derivative litigation to vindicate violations of federal and state disclosure requirements is not entitled to the protection of the business judgment rule.citation.to the contrary,it is axiomatic that decisions of a the decision to initiate be made by the board of directors.citations.id.at,at.the clair shores court therefore held that since the business decision of whether to litigate a federal securities claim on behalf of the corporation is best left to the board,there was no sound reason to exempt such a derivative suit from the demand requirement.clair shores,at,at pp.see also risberg ex rel.aspen technology,mcardle d,declining to follow vides bader blankfein,slt jma,wl,dist.lexis,same in re computer sciences.derivative litig,no.cv mrp ex,wl,fn,dist.lexis,fn.same.
we concur with the clair shores court and other courts that have similarly refused to recognize an exception to the demand requirement in instances in which the underlying wrong concerns alleged misrepresentations or omissions in a proxy statement.such an exception would unnecessarily divest directors of the customary power they hold in the initiation and management of litigation in any instance where the alleged wrong to the corporation resulted from the issuance of a proxy statement.just as the demand requirement would be substantially diluted if prior board approval of the challenged action standing alone established futility lewis graves,supra,at,creating a exemption would permit a large group of derivative cases to proceed without either prior submission of the matter to the corporate board or a showing of demand futility.we do not view the,the fact that the underlying dispute concerns the issuance of an allegedly misleading proxy constitute an extraordinary condition kamen,supra,at.constituting an excuse for a demand.in light of the significant policy considerations for the demand requirement,there is in our opinion no basis for the creation of such a demand excusal guttman huang,when the underlying suit involves the distribution of a proxy statement.
demand futility 
although bader argument on appeal focuses on her claim that she is exempt from the demand requirement,the complaint alleged in the alternative that a demand on apple board would have been futile in any event.accordingly,we address whether bader adequately alleged demand futility.
we are first confronted with whether to apply the aronson or the rales demand futility tests to the allegations of the complaint.in the first cause of action,bader alleged,citing section,that the plan was unlawfully adopted because it was not approved by the full board of directors.because the claim was that the board did not approve the thus the challenge did not involve a decision of the appears that the rales test applies.rales,supra,at.although the claim that the plan was unlawfully we discuss in section,without merit,even were we to assume its potential merit,bader did not plead facts justifying her failure to make a demand.she was required to allege facts with particularity b sufficient to create a reasonable doubt that,as of the time the complaint is filed,the board of directors could have properly exercised its independent and disinterested business judgment in responding to a demand.rales,supra,at.the complaint alleged that t he entire board is neither disinterested nor independent since every member of the board is liable for the violations of statute this wholly conclusory allegation was insufficient to establish demand futility.see aronson,supra,at mere threat of personal liability for approving a questioned transaction insufficient to challenge disinterestedness or independence of director.
the second cause of action was founded on the distribution of the proxy statement that was allegedly defective due to misstatements and omissions of material fact.bader alleged that the seven apple directors authorized the distribution of the statement to solicit the proxies of the company stockholders for,approval of the plan because this claim was based upon a conscious decision by directors to act rales,supra,at,we apply the aronson test.see,cnet,supra,d at aronson test applied where majority of allegations concerned board actions,including preparing and signing proxy statements.there was no allegation whatsoever by bader that raised a reasonable doubt that any board member was disinterested.aronson,supra,at.nothing in the complaint suggested a potential personal benefit or detriment to the director as a result of the decision to distribute the proxy statement.beam,supra,at,fn.omitted.indeed,at the hearing on the demurrer to the amended complaint,bader counsel acknowledged that this is not a case involving an interested board.
further,there were no allegations of specific fact that created a reasonable doubt that any apple director was independent with respect to the challenged transaction.aronson,supra,at.the facts alleged raised no concern that the directors were beholden to any of their colleagues or so under their influence that their discretion would be sterilized.citations.rales,supra,at.the mere assertion that t he entire board is neither disinterested nor independent since every member of the board is liable for the material misstatements and omissions in the proxy statement was wholly insufficient.shields,supra,th at,d broad,conclusory allegations that each director participated in,conspired in,or aided and abetted activities complained of insufficient to establish demand futility see also findley,supra,d at.and that allegation was belied by the fact that the complaint sought no damage relief against the apple directors for authorizing the distribution of the proxy statement.
moreover,the act complained of,issuance of the statement does not constitute the type of gross misconduct or malfeasance that would create a reasonable doubt that the challenged transaction was otherwise the product of a valid exercise of business judgment.aronson,supra,at.in evaluating this second prong of the aronson test,courts look at both the substantive due care substance of the transaction and the procedural due care an informed decision used by the directors.citation.starrels first nat.bank of chicago cir.here,as discussed in section,post,bader failed to show in her complaint the existence of material misstatements or omissions in the proxy statement supporting her causes of action challenging the approval and implementation of the plan.certainly,the authorization to distribute the statement was not the rare case where a transaction may be so egregious on its face that board approval can not meet the test of business judgment,and a substantial likelihood of director liability therefore exists.citations.aronson,supra,at.nor does the pleading show that in authorizing the statement distribution,the apple board demonstrated gross negligence in the process by which it made its decision.brehm eisner,supra,at see also in re abbott laboratories derivative shareholders cir.to the contrary,the only allegation in the complaint pertaining to the board decisionmaking process was extremely general,namely,that all the defendants knew or should have known that the proxy statement contained materially false or misleading representations and omissions concerning the terms and provisions of the plan,the deductibility of
