in this class action case,we face a rare joint appeal from a district court order.after the parties arrived at a settlement agreement,the district court deborah batts,denied plaintiffs motion to certify a settlement class.the court held that the class could not satisfy the predominance requirement of federal rule of civil procedure b because the presumption does not apply to the class securities fraud claims.we hold that,under amchem products,windsor,a securities fraud class failure to satisfy the presumption primarily threatens class certification by creating intractable management problems at trial.because settlement eliminates the need for trial,a settlement class ordinarily need not demonstrate that the presumption applies to its claims in order to satisfy the predominance requirement.we therefore vacate the district court class certification ruling,its grant of judgment on the pleadings,and its grant of partial final judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b,and remand this case to the district court.
background 
in october,a number of securities fraud class actions were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against american international group,aig and various other corporate and individual defendants,including the general reinsurance corporation and its officers ronald ferguson,richard napier,and john houldsworth collectively,gen re or gen re defendants.on february,the district court consolidated those actions and appointed as lead plaintiffs three ohio public pension funds the ohio public employees retirement system,the state teachers retirement system of ohio,and the ohio police and fire pension fund collectively,the lead plaintiffs because the present appeal arises from the efforts of the lead plaintiffs and gen re defendants to obtain approval for their proposed class settlement,we focus primarily on the course of the litigation between them 
on december,lead plaintiffs filed the consolidated third amended class action complaint complaint on behalf of a putative class consisting of investors who purchased aig publicly traded securities between october,and april.the complaint alleges,in relevant part,that aig and gen re violated rule a and c,promulgated under section b of the securities exchange act of,b,by entering into a sham million reinsurance transaction designed to mislead the market and artificially increase aig share price.
in particular,the complaint alleges that in late and early aig and gen re entered into a transaction that allowed aig to book a total of million in premiums revenues and million of claims reserves to its balance sheet in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of.the terms of the transaction appeared to require aig to make an additional million of claims payments in the event that additional losses developed.according to the complaint,however,the additional million of risk was a fiction,having been added by the parties to give the appearance that risk was being transferred in the transaction.in reality,aig was only obligated to pay a total amount of million in losses,which was equal to the amount of premiums revenues that aig was receiving from gen re.the complaint alleges that the transaction was therefore not a bona fide reinsurance transaction,which would have required that aig assume actual insurance risk,but was instead a transaction that would only look like reinsurance for aig accounting purposes.the complaint further alleges that gen re did not treat the transaction as reinsurance in its own accounting,but knew that aig intended to account for the transaction improperly as reinsurance.in exchange for its participation in the transaction,gen re received an undisclosed million side payment.
the sham reinsurance transaction came,according to the complaint,at a time when investors were concerned about recent reductions in aig loss reserves.the transaction had a significant impact on aig financial statements,allowing it to report added loss reserves of million for the fourth quarter of and million for the first quarter of.as the complaint noted,the increased reserves were highlighted in a press release issued by aig and received favorably by investment analysts.
the complaint further alleges that the true nature of the transaction remained hidden from public view until late and early,when the securities and exchange commission and the new york attorney general began to investigate aig dealings with gen re.following a series of news reports detailing the results of the investigation,aig publicly acknowledged on march,that it had improperly treated the gen re transaction as reinsurance for accounting purposes.in the wake of that announcement,as well as of the disclosure of numerous other serious accounting improprieties at aig,the company stock price dropped substantially.on may,aig issued a dramatic restatement of its earnings for the previous four years,reducing its reported income for that period by more than billion.
just over a year after filing the complaint,lead plaintiffs moved,on february,to certify a class for litigation of its claims against all of the defendants,including the gen re defendants.to demonstrate the element of reliance in their section b claim,the lead plaintiffs invoked the doctrine of basic levinson,on may,before the district court had ruled on the class certification motion,the gen re defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings based on a supreme court case,stoneridge investment partners,llc scientific atlanta,which addressed the availability of the doctrine in circumstances similar to those in the present case.
the stoneridge plaintiffs had alleged that charter communications,a cable operator,arranged a transaction with two of its suppliers of digital cable set top boxes in which charter overpaid for each set top box by and the suppliers returned the overpayment by purchasing advertising from charter at rates.id.at.according to the plaintiffs,the transaction had no economic substance,and existed solely to enable charter to fool its auditor into approving a financial statement showing it met projected revenues and operating cash flow numbers.id.at.the suppliers properly accounted for these transactions in their own financial statements,and were not involved in preparing charter fraudulent financial statements.id.at.nonetheless,the plaintiffs alleged that the suppliers were liable under section b of the exchange act and rule because the suppliers knew that charter intended to use the transactions to issue misleading financial statements.id.
the supreme court held that the stoneridge plaintiffs claim failed because the plaintiffs had not adequately alleged reliance under section b.id.at according to the court,the presumption of reliance did not apply to the suppliers conduct because their deceptive acts were not communicated to the public and n o member of the investment public had knowledge,either actual or presumed,of the suppliers deceptive acts during the relevant times.id.at as a result,the plaintiffs could not establish their reliance upon the suppliers actions except in an indirect chain that we find too remote for liability.id.the court also rejected the plaintiffs scheme liability argument,which suggested that the market had relied on the suppliers actions because the suppliers conduct was essential to charter ability to make its deceptive statements.id.at 
in their motion for judgment on the pleadings,the gen re defendants argued that,under stoneridge,the lead plaintiffs failed to state a section b claim against gen re because gen re made no public statements about the sham reinsurance transaction.the lead plaintiffs opposed the motion,arguing,among other things,that their claims against gen re survived stoneridge because key details about the sham transaction including gen re participation in it and the amount of loss reserves transferred were disclosed to the market by aig in state regulatory filings shortly after the transaction was consummated.in these circumstances,lead plaintiffs argued,aig investors can be presumed,through the doctrine,to have relied on gen re deceptive acts.thus,the central dispute between the parties was whether stoneridge bars a section b claim against a counterparty to a deceptive transaction with an issuer of stock where the existence of the transaction and the counterparty participation in it is disclosed to the market by the issuer,but not by the counterparty.
the district court did not immediately rule on this question.on september,gen re filed its opposition to lead plaintiffs motion for class certification.at around the same time,in light of the uncertainty with respect to how the district court,and this court,would rule on the stoneridge issue,gen re and the lead plaintiffs entered into settlement discussions.joint brief of appellants and appellees joint br.at.
on november,the parties jointly requested that the district court hold gen re motion for judgment on the pleadings in abeyance so that they could participate in mediation.the court stayed decision of the motion until february,on february,lead plaintiffs and gen re collectively,the settling parties reported to the district court that they had reached an agreement in principle on terms for a settlement.at their request,the district court granted a further stay until march.thereafter,the settling parties agreed upon terms for a million settlement,and on february,they submitted to the district court a signed settlement agreement and an accompanying motion for preliminary settlement approval.the district court subsequently granted several additional stays during,the last of which suspended the gen re proceedings indefinitely.
while the gen re litigation was stayed,the district court heard several days of evidence and argument on lead plaintiffs pending motion for class certification.in light of the settlement,the gen re defendants did not participate in those proceedings.on february,the district court issued a lengthy class certification decision,which,in relevant part,denied lead plaintiffs class certification motion with respect to the claims against gen re.see in re am.int l.sec.the court invoked our decision in in re salomon analyst metromedia litigation,which recognized that,under stoneridge,a section b plaintiff must demonstrate that a defendant conduct satisf ies each of the elements or preconditions for liability and that the presumption does not apply to a defendant whose deceptive acts were not communicated to the public,cir quoting stoneridge,at.the district court then held 
because lead plaintiffs have not established or even pled that the gen re defendants made any public misstatement or omission with regard to aig,the presumption does not apply to claims against these defendants,and individual issues of reliance predominate over common issues for the claims against the gen re defendants regarding aig stock.accordingly,the court does not certify the class of claims against the gen re defendants.
id.at.on march,the court issued a order denying lead plaintiffs motion for preliminary approval of the settlement as moot in light of its class certification ruling.
thereafter,the settling parties continued to seek approval of the gen re settlement.on june,they jointly moved for preliminary approval of the settlement,arguing that even if certification of a litigation class was inappropriate,the court could and should nonetheless certify a settlement class.relying on the supreme court decision in amchem,at,the settling parties argued that the individual reliance issues that led the court to deny class certification would not pose a problem of trial manageability because the very existence of the settlement eliminated the need for a trial.
on september,the court issued an order dismissal order denying the preliminary approval motion and granting gen re motion for judgment on the pleadings.on the class certification question,the court rejected the settling parties attempts to distinguish between settlement and litigation classes based upon the issue of manageability at trial.dismissal order at.according to the court,the parties trial manageability argument was beside the point,because the lead plaintiffs claim against gen re still fail ed to meet the predominance requirement of federal rule of civil procedure b.id.as support for this conclusion,the court again invoked our decision in in re salomon,noting its teaching that a successful rebuttal of proof of the elements of the presumption defeats certification by defeating the rule b predominance requirement.id.quoting in re salomon,at.the court found that neither we nor the supreme court have state d that a court may dispense with the requirement of proving the application of the presumption when certifying a class for settlement purposes.dismissal order at citing basic,in re salomon,in re initial pub.offerings sec,cir in re ipo.then,turning to gen re motion for judgment on the pleadings,the district court again held that stoneridge barred lead plaintiffs section b claim because none of the gen re defendants made any public statement or took any action regarding aig stock that could be relied upon.id.at.the court therefore dismissed the claim against gen re,and entered a partial final judgment in favor of gen re pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.
lead plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.the settling parties then jointly moved to bifurcate this appeal,so that the issue of the propriety of certifying a settlement class about which the settling parties agree could be addressed before the merits issues about which they disagree.we granted the motion,and the settling parties filed a joint brief that argues that the district court erred by declining to certify a settlement class.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review both a district court ultimate decision on class certification and its rulings as to individual rule requirements for abuse of discretion.in re ipo,at myers hertz,cir.when reviewing a denial of class certification,we accord a district court noticeably less deference than when we review a grant of class certification.in re salomon,at.to the extent a district court ruling on an individual rule requirement involves an issue of law,our review is de novo.brown kelly,cir.
ii.class certification requirements 
rule does not set forth a mere pleading standard.wal mart stores,dukes.the party seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate compliance with the rule,and a district court may only certify a class if it is satisfied,after a rigorous analysis,that the requirements of rule are met.id.quoting.of southwest falcon,see also in re ipo,at holding that a district court must make a definitive assessment of rule requirements and resolve factual disputes relevant to each rule requirement myers,at the party seeking class certification bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that each of rule requirements has been met.as the supreme court has recently noted,f requently that rigorous analysis will entail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff underlying claim.that can not be helped.wal mart stores.at see also in re ipo,at holding that the obligation to make rule determinations is not lessened by overlap between a rule requirement and a merits issue,even a merits issue that is identical with a rule requirement.
before approving a class settlement agreement,a district court must first determine whether the requirements for class certification in rule a and b have been satisfied.see in re pet food prods.liab,cir.thus,the court must assess whether the proposed class satisfies rule a four threshold requirements numerosity the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,commonality there are questions of law or fact common to the class,typicality the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class,and adequacy of representation the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.a.the district court must also determine whether the action can be maintained under rule b,or.in this case,the lead plaintiffs seek to certify a class under rule b,which permits certification where the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.if the class satisfies the requirements of rules a and b,then the district court must separately evaluate whether the settlement agreement is fair,reasonable,and adequate under rule e.
in its landmark decision in amchem,the supreme court addressed whether a class of both current and future asbestos claimants could be certified for the purpose of entering into a global settlement of virtually all asbestos claims.at.the court noted that the settlement class consisted of u ntold numbers of individuals,including both plaintiffs who currently manifested injuries and those who had only been exposed to products.id.at.the court held that this sprawling class failed both rule b predominance requirement and rule a adequacy of representation requirement,and accordingly refused to permit the certification of the class.id.at.
in the course of its opinion,the court recognized that the settlement only class has become a stock device in modern class action litigation,and noted that it had granted review to decide the role settlement may play,under existing rule,in determining the propriety of class certification.id.at.the court squarely held that s ettlement is relevant to a class certification.id.at.according to the court,a district court c onfronted with a request for class certification need not inquire whether the case,if tried,would present intractable management problems,for the proposal is that there be no trial.id.at citing fed civ.b d.at the same time,however,the court stressed that in the settlement context other specifications of rule those designed to protect absentees by blocking unwarranted or overbroad class definitions demand undiluted,even heightened,attention.id.as judge scirica has explained 
s ome inquiries essential to litigation class certification are no longer problematic in the settlement context.a key question in a litigation class action is manageability how the case will or can be tried,and whether there are questions of fact or law that are capable of common proof.but the settlement class presents no management problems because the case will not be tried.conversely,other inquiries assume heightened importance and heightened scrutiny because of the danger of conflicts of interest,collusion,and unfair allocation.
sullivan db,cir scirica,concurring citing amchem,at see also in re motors.pick up truck fuel tank products liab,cir identifying collusion,inadequate prosecution,and attorney inexperience as the paramount concerns in settlements.thus,in the context of settlement,rules a and b continue to serve the purpose of focus ing court attention on whether a proposed class has sufficient unity so that absent members can fairly be bound by decisions of class representatives.amchem,at 
as noted above,the lead plaintiffs seek to certify a rule b class,and therefore must show that common questions of law or fact predominate over purely individual questions and that a class action is superior to other methods of resolving the dispute.b.as amchem observed,rule b was developed for situations in which treatment is not as clearly called for as it is in rule b and b,but may nevertheless be convenient and desirable.u.at internal quotation marks omitted.rule b specifies that the matters pertinent to the predominance and superiority findings include 
a the class members interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions b the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members c the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum and d the likely difficulties in managing a class action.
rule b predominance requirement tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.amchem,at.the requirement purpose is to ensure that the class will be certified only when it would achieve economies of time,effort,and expense,and promote uniformity of decision as to persons similarly situated,without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results.cordes.fin,v.a.edwards sons,cir quoting amchem,at.while predominance may be difficult to demonstrate in mass tort cases,such as amchem,in which the individual stakes are high and disparities among class members great,it is a test readily met in certain cases alleging consumer or securities fraud or violations of the antitrust laws.amchem,at.
when evaluating litigation classes,we have held that the predominance requirement is satisfied if resolution of some of the legal or factual questions that qualify each class member case as a genuine controversy can be achieved through generalized proof,and if these particular issues are more substantial than the issues subject only to individualized proof.myers,at quoting moore painewebber,cir see also in re salomon,at to meet the predominance requirement,a plaintiff must show that those issues in the proposed action that are subject to generalized proof outweigh those issues that are subject to individualized proof.internal quotation marks omitted in re nassau county strip search cases,cir a n issue is common to the class when it is susceptible to generalized,proof.
in the context of a settlement class,concerns about whether individual issues would create intractable management problems at trial drop out of the predominance analysis because the proposal is that there be no trial.amchem,at.however,the certifying court must still determine whether the the legal or factual questions that qualify each class member case as a genuine controversy are sufficiently similar as to yield a cohesive class.id.at see also sullivan,at scirica,concurring issues of predominance and fairness do not undermine this settlement.all plaintiffs here claim injury that by reason of defendants conduct has caused a common and measurable form of economic damage all claims arise out of the same course of defendants conduct all share a common nucleus of operative fact,supplying the necessary cohesion.the focus of this analysis is on questions that preexist any settlement,and not on whether all class members have a common interest in a fair compromise of their claims.amchem,at.
while the predominance inquiry will sometimes be easier to satisfy in the settlement context,other requirements of rule designed to protect absentees by blocking unwarranted or overbroad class definitions,such as the rule a requirement of adequate representation,will demand undiluted,even heightened,attention.id.at see also in re prudential ins.am.sales practice litig.agent actions,cir suggesting that the key to amchem appears to be the careful inquiry into adequacy of representation in re literary works in databases copyright,cir vacating certification of settlement class of copyright owners because of conflicts between different categories of class members.
iii.certification of the gen re settlement class 
the district court held that it could not certify a settlement class because stoneridge barred plaintiffs from invoking the presumption against gen re.the settling parties note that the proposed class in this securities case is far more cohesive than the sprawling asbestos class in amchem,and argue that the district court erred by denying their joint motion for preliminary approval of the gen re settlement because,w hether or not a class could properly have been certified for purposes of litigation,such a class could have been and should have been certified conditionally for settlement purposes.joint br.at.
even assuming that the district court correctly applied stoneridge an issue we do not the court erred in holding that a section b settlement class must satisfy the presumption in order to demonstrate predominance.in the context of a litigation class,the presumption spares the plaintiff class from the extremely laborious and often impossible task of proving at trial that each individual plaintiff was aware of and specifically relied u
