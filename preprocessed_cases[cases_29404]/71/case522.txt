opinion of the court 
appellants michael miller and philip rennert were convicted by a jury of conspiracy,wire fraud,and securities fraud appellant george jensen was convicted by a jury of securities fraud.their convictions resulted from their involvement in a complex scheme under which they leased the worthless stocks of several public companies to the teale network teale,a fraudulent network of offshore and domestic companies.the details of the operation of the teale network,through its principal alan teale,are set forth in our earlier opinion in united states yeaman,cir,and we repeat only such details as are necessary to decide the issues before us in this appeal.
in essence,teale represented the worthless leased stocks as valuable assets that could be liquidated to pay claims pursuant to reinsurance contracts entered into with world life and health insurance company world life,a pennsylvania insurance company that was already in financial difficulty.when world life attempted to liquidate these assets to pay its outstanding medical reinsurance claims,the stocks were found to be worthless.
world life became insolvent at some point during or before,but did not reveal its financial difficulty to regulators or to its insureds.in and,world life issued four group medical policies.teale entered into contracts reinsuring world life policies from november to november.pursuant to these agreements,teale assumed percent of the liability associated with world life four group medical insurance policies in exchange for receipt of percent of the premiums paid by world life insureds on those policies.appellants supplied teale with stocks from offshore companies that teale could list as putatively valuable collateral backing the company,though the stocks were essentially worthless.yeaman,at.
in,rennert created forum rothmore to serve as an intermediary between teale and the publicly traded corporations that desired to lease their stock to teale.this arrangement created the appearance of legitimacy in two ways.first,forum rothmore helped the teale network comply with pennsylvania reinsurance regulations that require unlicensed offshore reinsurance companies,such as teale,to deposit in escrow accounts collateral in the form of corporate stocks equal to the liability associated with its reinsurance contacts.second,forum rothmore entered into surplus contribution agreements with teale,which gave teale the appearance of being backed by independent stockholdings.id.
teale and rennert first met and discussed this fraudulent scheme in august and executed the first of their surplus contribution agreements on september.under the terms of these agreements,public shell corporations leased their stock to teale and authorized the sale of the stock,if necessary,to pay claims under insurance policies that teale had reinsured.teale then listed these shares at inflated values on the financial statements presented to world life.after receiving insurance premiums from world life,teale paid monthly leasing fees to forum rothmore,which in turn split the fees with the stock providers.id.the teale network was forum rothmore sole client,and forum rothmore was the teale network only consistent source of assets.
in particular,forum rothmore entered into surplus contribution agreements with ecotech corporation ecotech.jensen was at various times in control of and president of ecotech.on december,jensen manipulated ecotech stock price and then leased one million dollars worth of ecotech stock to teale.although ecotech shares were virtually worthless,appellants fraudulently ecotech shares on the company financial statements.members of the conspiracy manipulated the market for ecotech and other corporations stock in order to maintain the inflated trading prices.
miller,a lawyer,was corporate counsel for forum rothmore and a shareholder in ecotech.the ecotech stock at issue was not tradeable and carried a restrictive legend to that effect.miller issued opinion letters stating that forum rothmore could remove that legend from stock certificates so that it falsely appeared that the stock could be freely traded and leased to teale.the government submitted evidence that miller was paid for representing the company and from leasing ecotech stock to teale.
in,the pennsylvania insurance department discovered world life insolvency and ordered its liquidation.because teale had been paying insurance claims with premiums and had no other significant assets to draw upon,this liquidation deprived teale of the ability to pay further insurance claims.world life policyholders thus were unable to receive insurance payments as needed.
following world life liquidation,the pennsylvania life and health insurance guarantee fund,a state fund through which pennsylvania insurance companies pay the outstanding liabilities of insolvent carriers,provided approximately million for group medical reinsurance claims left unpaid as a result of the fraud.
appellants were indicted on february,and were convicted by a jury on april.at the sentencing hearing held january,the district court assigned each appellant a upward departure for loss of confidence in an important institution,but found no monetary loss attributable to the appellants because world life was insolvent at the time it entered into reinsurance contracts with teale.the district court also rejected the application of additional sentencing enhancements for use of special skills and substantially jeopardizing a financial institution.
appellants appealed their individual verdicts and sentencing calculations to this court in and we set out the full factual and procedural history of their cases in prior unpublished opinions.see united states rennert,cir,united states jensen,cir,and united states miller,cir.appellants challenged the district court instructions to the jury,the sufficiency of the evidence supporting their convictions,and the upward adjustment for loss of confidence in an important institution.the government,arguing that the district court had erred in finding that there was no loss caused by the fraud,in failing to increase miller offense level because he had used special legal skills in furtherance of the conspiracy,and in failing to increase all appellants offense levels for causing a substantial effect on a financial institution.
in miller,we rejected miller argument that he acted only as an attorney.instead,we held that miller involvement went beyond the role of legal representation and could not be categorized as simple legal advice,especially given miller ownership of ecotech stock and his letters regarding removal of restrictive legends.miller,slip op.at.in rennert and jensen,we also upheld rennert and jensen convictions and affirmed the imposition of a upward departure based on loss of confidence to an important institution.however,we remanded all three cases for to consider whether there was a causal connection between the appellants misrepresentations and the fraud loss caused by teale collection of premiums,and in miller case,whether an enhancement would be appropriate for miller use of special legal skills.with respect to fraud loss,we clarified that the fraud loss calculation should be based on the dates of appellants agreement to the conspiracy,rather than the dates of their misrepresentations.also,in a related case,we suggested that the loss calculation might be based on the net gain to teale or the balance of unpaid claims.see yeaman,at involving another in the conspiracy who is not a party to the instant appeal 
on february,the district court held a hearing for miller,jensen,and rennert.miller attempted to present testimony and documents in support of his argument that the scope of his involvement in the conspiracy was less than that of his and that the extent of the total loss caused by the fraud was not foreseeable to him.in particular,miller attempted to contest the government arguments that he was present at the august meeting,that he prepared opinion letters in support of the conspiracy,that he received payments for services as a stock provider,and that he falsified records bearing the date of ecotech merger with a gold mine to create additional stock shares for teale.the district court declined to permit miller to submit additional evidence that was not already presented at trial because the issue was subsumed by the jury verdict and was therefore immaterial to sentencing.see app.at finding miller factual allegations were matters of defense for the trial,not for sentencing.
on the issue of fraud loss causation,the government presented two witnesses,a representative from the liquidations and rehabilitation section of the pennsylvania department of insurance and a general counsel to a administrator.they stated that,had their organizations known that appellants assets were worthless,they would have halted the flow of premiums months earlier and forced world life to obtain a solvent reinsurer.
on february,the district court issued a sentencing opinion concluding that miller,rennert,and jensen entered into an agreement conspiring to defraud world life and its policyholders no later than august.the district court held that the total fraud loss caused by the appellants was approximately million the difference between the total premiums paid to teale minus the claims paid by teale to world life policyholders.the district court further found that there was a causal connection between the misrepresentations of the defendants and the continued payment of premiums to world life and the defendants.app.at.finally,the district court increased miller sentence based on his use of special skills and more than minimal planning.the appellants also received upward departures for causing the loss of confidence in an important institution the stock market.the district court sentenced miller to months,rennert to months,and jensen to months of imprisonment.
all three appellants contest the district court factual finding of a causal connection between their misrepresentations and the fraud loss to the victims of million.miller challenges the district court order barring him from submitting additional testimony and documents to demonstrate the limited scope of his involvement in the conspiracy.we will affirm.
the district court had jurisdiction under and this court has jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to and.we review the district court factual findings for clear error.united states weaver,cir.we review the district court decision to admit or deny evidence for abuse of discretion.united states serafini,cir.
fraud loss causation 
appellants assert two primary challenges to the district court finding that their conspiracy caused approximately million in fraud loss.first,all appellants argue that the district court erroneously found that their misrepresentations of stock values actually caused teale to continue receiving premiums from world life policyholders by preventing the pennsylvania department of insurance from discovering the fraud and halting the flow of premiums.this is one of the issues we directed the district court to consider on remand.second,rennert contends that even if the district court were correct that the pennsylvania department of insurance would have stopped the flow of insurance premiums to teale network if it had known appellants were stock,rennert only should have been held liable for the approximately million in losses that occurred on or after december,rather than counting losses beginning in september.because this lower fraud loss amount would have reduced rennert sentence,he argues that a remand for is required.
relationship between appellants misrepresentation of stock values and world life continued payment of premiums 
appellants contend that the victim,world life,did not rely on their misrepresentations of stock assets as valuable and therefore their misrepresentations did not cause the fraud loss.moreover,they contend that it was world life own obstruction of the investigation by the pennsylvania department of their prevented the department from discovering the fraud and immediately halting the flow of premiums to teale.appellants thus argue that the district court committed clear error.the government responds that world life and its policyholders paid teale millions of dollars for reinsurance in reliance on the appellants fraudulent representations that their stocks were valuable and redeemable as assets,as they purported.
we have addressed the issue of fraud loss causation in connection with the teale conspiracy in yeaman,where we stated,w ithout the assets of the defendants and the resulting appearance of solvency,the most reasonable inference is that world life would have ceased paying premiums to teale long before it eventually did.yeaman,at.we explained the causality analysis as follows 
teale could not have entered and remained in the business of reinsuring world life but for its fraudulent misrepresentations.although the district court made no finding on the issue before,the record would also appear to us to support the proposition that world life was not capable of insuring any of the four group medical policies without having received a commitment for reinsurance.it follows that if the teale fraudulent reinsurance contracts had not been available,world life would either have secured other reinsurance or would not have issued the group policies involved.if reinsurance from a solvent reinsurer had been obtained,all claims under the policies would have been paid to the reinsurer if the group policies had not been issued,the employers who purchased the policies from world life would have obtained group medical coverage from another source and all claims of the beneficiaries would have been paid in full.in either event there would have been a causal nexus between the fraud and all unpaid claims.
id.at.in short,we found that the most reasonable inference is that world life relied on the appellants misrepresentations about the value of their stock assets when it paid teale additional premiums.
on remand,the district court concluded that there was a causal connection between the misrepresentations of the defendants and the continued payment of premiums to world life,and teale and the defendants.app.at.in particular,the district court made the following findings 
had the true value of the defendants stocks been known,at the very least,the pennsylvania department of insurance would have stopped the payment of premiums to the teale network.
in addition,because world life was insolvent,had the reinsurance contracts been terminated,the company would have been liquidated much sooner than it was,and the policyholders would have never made those premium payments at all.
although appellants argue that the district court findings do not answer the question of whether their misrepresentations caused the fraud loss,it is apparent that the department of insurance did not intercede because it did not know the true value of the appellants stocks.app.at.that lack of knowledge was the result of appellants misrepresentations of the value of those stocks.this,in turn,caused the department of insurance to permit world life continued operation and caused world life to continue providing teale insurance premiums in reliance on appellants misrepresentations.appellants attempt to sever the connection between their misrepresentations and the department of insurance delayed intervention is unpersuasive 
appellants next challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the district court finding that the flow of insurance premiums would have been halted but for their misrepresentations.at the appellants hearing,two government witnesses testified that but for appellants misrepresentations about the value of the stock assets teale claimed as collateral,world life would not have continued paying its policyholders premiums to is,the department of insurance or various policyholders would have halted the flow of premiums if they had known the true value of appellants stocks.one witness,the director of liquidations and rehabilitation for the pennsylvania department of insurance,testified that the department could have halted the flow of insurance payments had it known that appellants assets were worthless because appellants fraudulently misrepresented their assets value and
