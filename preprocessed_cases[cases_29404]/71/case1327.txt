defendant vincent smith was charged in a information with counts of grand theft,subd.a counts of sale of unqualified securities,subd.a counts of using false statements to sell securities,subd.a and one count of using a scheme to defraud in connection with the sale of securities,counts one through,the charges of grand theft,sale of unqualified securities and use of false statements in the sale of securities,contained the names of separate victims.at trial,only eight of the named victims testified.after the close of evidence,the court dismissed the counts pertaining to the remaining victims.the court admitted for purposes the approximately agreements executed by the individuals named in the dismissed counts,and permitted the prosecutor to refer in closing argument to those documents and to other similar agreements seized in a search of appellant home and offices.
appellant,who was convicted on all the counts that survived dismissal,contends that these documents were not properly authenticated and constituted inadmissible hearsay.in addition,appellant contends that the documents should have been excluded under evidence code section.appellant further contends that the prosecutor alleged improper comment on appellant failure to testify influenced the jury verdict and seeks our review of pitchess materials previously reviewed by the trial court 
we conclude that the documents at issue were authenticated by their content and by circumstantial evidence and that their use did not violate the hearsay rule.with respect to evidence code section,appellant did not raise an objection to the documents based on that provision and,in any event,the documents were more probative than prejudicial.moreover,assuming arguendo that the documents were improperly admitted,the evidence supporting the charges was so overwhelming that the use of these documents added little to the prosecution case and any error was harmless.with respect to the alleged prosecutorial misconduct,we conclude it resulted from a misstatement and had no impact on the verdict.finally,we find no error in the trial court pitchess review.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.

detective david lingscheit,a fraud investigator for the los angeles county sheriff department,explained the basics of a ponzi scheme funds are solicited from victims,who are told that the funds will be used for specific investments and pay very high returns within a short period of time.in fact,however,any money paid back to victims comes from funds received from other victims.part of the scheme involves making payments as promised to early victims,so that they will be induced to bring others into the scheme.the scheme eventually collapses because the amount scheduled to go out is too great and the money runs out.to prevent the scheme from collapsing too soon,victims are encouraged to roll over funds when payments become due.
detective lingscheit also testified to serving search warrants seeking records for ten bank accounts associated with appellant,mv s and avbs,identified by interviewing alleged victims and reviewing their documents.by the time he served the warrants,the accounts had been closed and the balances were at zero.detective lingscheit also seized documents pursuant to search warrants at avbs offices in quartz hill and at appellant residence.avbs files contained over executed contracts similar to those signed by the witnesses,all promising returns of to percent among the documents seized were the agreements executed by the victims who testified at trial.detective lingscheit calculated that the investment amounts on the contracts totaled million.also seized were promotional materials bearing appellant picture and promising large returns to those who became involved with avbs and mv s.in his search,detective lingscheit found no evidence of productive activity or business operations,except a preliminary tract map for a property in lancaster.
peter mock,the prosecution accounting expert,defined a ponzi scheme as a fraudulent operation involving a promise of abnormally high returns on investments.payouts are derived from funds received from investors rather than any actual economic or business activity.mock reviewed the bank statements,checks and deposit by detective lingscheit and performed a cash roll analysis,identifying how much money came in to each account,where it came from and what it was used for.he was able to identify the checks from investors from information written on the checks and from the fact that investment checks were always in round numbers.he identified payments to investors from information written on the checks and by comparing the names of some of the payees to the master list of investors compiled by detective lingscheit.mock concluded that appellant was operating a ponzi scheme because there did not appear to be any income being generated from investments or operations.all funds coming into the accounts and used to pay investors were obtained from other investors.
the majority of the funds traced by mock through two of the ten bank accounts.with respect to those two accounts,to percent of the funds paid out went to investors.most of the remainder was paid to appellant or people associated with him,including his lawyer,wife and girlfriend.a relatively small sum was paid to an engineering company.
defense case 
charles agapiou,a luxury car dealer,testified that he sold several used vehicles to appellant between and,at a cost of approximately.
john williamson,an attorney,testified that he was introduced to appellant in and was retained to assist appellant in developing a property appellant had acquired in lancaster.appellant and his partner or associate bought the property for.in september,a tentative map was approved,permitting individual lots to be sold.there were lots on the property,and the lots could have sold at that time for approximately each.alternatively,if homes were built and sold at an estimated cost of million,the profit would have been estimate williamson recalled was million.appellant and williamson subsequently learned that in order for houses to be built on the land,fill additional soil had to be added at a cost of over.in november,a lawsuit was filed and a lis pendens placed on the property causing progress to come to a halt.in that same month,williamson met with a group of investors and told them the housing project had the potential of paying off.
appellant informed williamson that he had told potential investors that no return was guaranteed,but that their original investments would be returned.however,williamson had warned appellant that numerous problems could arise during the various stages of development.williamson believed that guaranteeing investors that their initial investments were not at risk was not prudent.williamson believed appellant was not running a ponzi scheme because as he understood it,newer investors were buying out older investors.
during direct examination,williamson testified that in,he was asked by appellant to review blank contracts similar to those executed by the victims who testified.williamson told appellant that the contracts were or could be classified as securities and would need to be registered.by that time,however,appellant had already entered into the agreements and williamson believed there was nothing to be done.subsequently,williamson came to the conclusion that the people involved were sophisticated investors and therefore the agreements did not need to be registered.on,williamson was asked to review some of the contracts signed by the victims who testified he conceded that they were securities.williamson was aware of no business activity or investment being undertaken by appellant that would have generated profits in the short time frame set forth in the agreements.
kenny kang was the defense accounting expert.kang testified that mock underestimated the amount of funds from the reviewed bank accounts that went toward business expenses.he testified that was spent on real estate or real estate development,was spent to purchase a pizza parlor and was spent on payments related to buying or fixing automobiles.kang conceded,however,that there was no evidence of income other than payments from investors.kang expressed the opinion that as long as investors were only taking out the funds that they put in,there was no ponzi scheme.
craig morse testified that he obtained a percent share of the lancaster property from appellant in or by agreeing to pay litigation expenses.morse intended to develop the property and,toward that end,he obtained a final tract map approximately one year after becoming involved.morse estimated that had homes been built and sold,there would have been a or million profit to the developer.however,he and appellant did not end up building any homes.morse eventually sold his share for millions.
stipulations 
the parties stipulated that none of appellant companies ever registered securities with the state of california.
defense counsel stipulated that the documents contained in exhibit were seized from appellant offices pursuant to a search warrant.
pertinent evidentiary rulings 
prior to trial,defense counsel objected to the prosecution apparent plan to introduce an exhibit,prepared by detective lingscheit,summarizing the thousands of investment contracts seized in the search of appellant offices.defense counsel was concerned that any reference to the contracts apparent face value million,according to the overstate the size of the operation defense counsel was aware that the prosecution also intended to introduce bank records,but those records showed a significantly lesser amount having passed through the bank accounts,and counsel raised no objection to the introduction of bank records.the primary basis for defense counsel objection to detective lingscheit summary was evidence code section,but he also raised hearsay.the prosecutor explained that he did not intend to introduce any contracts other than those at issue in the specific counts of the information,but that he wished to inform the jury that appellant had thousands of similar contracts in his possession.the prosecutor contended this evidence was relevant to showing that appellant was engaged in a ponzi scheme and that it would give the jury a more accurate picture of the scope of the enterprise.the court stated that the information appeared relevant under evidence code section,subdivision b to show intent to defraud,but agreed with defense counsel that the amount was exaggerated.ultimately,the court deferred a ruling and the prosecutor agreed not to discuss the number of contracts or their face value in his opening statement 
during trial,immediately prior to detective lingscheit testimony,the prosecutor stated his intention to question the detective concerning the approximately agreements executed by the individuals who were named in the information but not had testified the prosecutor argued that the documents themselves would prove appellant sale of unregistered securities to those individuals and arguably also establish the related theft counts.defense counsel objected on grounds of hearsay and lack of foundation.the court concluded that the documents could not be used to establish substantive violation of securities law or grand testimony of the named victims was necessary to establish reliance and other elements.the court stated,however,that the documents could be used to support the theory that appellant was operating a ponzi scheme.the court observed that the documents,along with the bank records,were circumstantial evidence that the money appellant used to pay investors came from people who had entered into investment contracts with appellant and his companies,and supported the prosecution theory that this was the only income appellant had to pay investors.
prior to the beginning of deliberations,defense counsel objected again to exhibit,stating that the portions which consisted of agreements executed by individuals who did not testify were hearsay and that no adequate foundation had been laid for their admission.the court stated that such contracts were admissible as circumstantial evidence of a scheme to defraud.the court invited defense counsel to submit a limiting instruction clarifying that the documents were introduced for a limited purpose,but defense counsel declined to do so.
section motion 
after the close of the prosecution case,the defense moved pursuant to penal code section to acquit on all the counts that named victims who had not testified.the prosecutor conceded the grand theft counts could not be established without the testimony of the victim,but argued that the agreements themselves established the securities counts.the court concluded that absent the testimony of the persons who entered into the agreements,the prosecution could not prove that the securities were offered for sale in california and that use of the agreements to establish this documents contained the names and addresses of the constitute hearsay.the court granted the defense motion,but did not strike or exclude the documentary evidence pertaining to the victims in so doing,the court stated a lthough i granted the defense motion,with respect to the,quote,unquote,victims,obviously,the people can still argue the documentary evidence pertaining to those victims to prove a scheme to defraud and so forth.
pertinent argument 
during closing,the prosecutor asked the jury to reflect on the enormity of this crime and what appellant was up to here w hen they finally got around to doing a search warrant of appellant office,t here were in excess of four thousand of these investment contracts with a face value of eight point nine million dollars.that is a lot of people,a lot of lives ruined.later,in discussing whether appellant was legitimately investing the funds as opposed to engaging in a scam,the prosecutor stated we know that there were four thousand investment contracts totaling almost nine million dollars we gave you contracts from a representative sample,about thirty percent of the people,so you could see what these contracts looked like.according to the prosecutor,this evidence showed what appellant was doing he was setting up a club to get more and more people to bring more and more people in.
the prosecutor referred briefly to exhibit in his closing.he directed the jurors to the portions that contained the agreements executed by the victims who testified and did not discuss the portion of the exhibit pertaining to the dismissed counts and the named victims who had not testified.
the prosecutor identified the misrepresentations made by appellant as promising a high return,guaranteeing that principal was safe,and representing that money was being invested in legitimate business ventures.he also contended that appellant lied by omission,failing to inform participants that any returns paid came from other investors.
the defense argued in closing that there was no evidence of intent to defraud because most of the money collected was used to pay investors.he also pointed to the evidence that appellant had purchased the lancaster tract of land and was working with others to develop homes on it.counsel contended this operation could have led to a substantial profit that allowed e verybody to be paid back.
in rebuttal,the prosecutor again disputed the suggestion that appellant had been engaged in any legitimate business enterprise.the prosecutor noted that appellant own accountant had acknowledged that there was no evidence of any productive enterprise,and conceded that the evidence of money coming in from investors and being paid right out to other investors was consistent with a fraudulent scheme.the prosecutor then said,y ou have heard nothing here to explain how this is any sort of whatsoever.the defendant had every opportunity to speak to you and to point out how this was not a fraudulent scheme.he could defense counsel interposed an objection.the prosecutor immediately explained that he meant to refer to defense counsel rather than to defendant.the court stated to the jury obviously,it improper to comment the absence of testimony of the defendant.you not to consider it and i so instruct on it.before proceeding with his argument,the prosecutor repeated that he had intended to refer to defense counsel and the court advised the jury that t he prosecutor misspoke.
verdict and sentencing 
the jury found appellant guilty of the remaining counts eight counts of grand theft,eight of selling unqualified securities,eight of using false statements to sell securities,and one of using a scheme to defraud.in addition,the jury found true that appellant had taken property with a value of more than from carew,duplechein and lavie and that the value of property taken from all the victims exceeded.
the court sentenced appellant to a term of eight years and eight months,consisting of the midterm of two years on count,sale of unqualified securities eight months or the midterm on counts,and also,and two years for the penal code,section enhancement.as to the remaining counts,sentence was imposed,but stayed,under penal code,section.
discussion 
exhibit.authentication 
the first issue we consider is appellant contention that the portions of exhibit consisting of agreements or enrollment forms between named victims who did not testify and mv s or avbs were not properly authenticated.a document is not presumed to be what it purports to be fakhoury magner d.authentication of a writing is required before it may be received in evidence.authentication means a the introduction of evidence sufficient to sustain a finding that it is the writing that the proponent of the evidence claims it is or b the establishment of such facts by any other means provided by law.a trial court finding that sufficient foundational facts have been presented to support admissibility is reviewed for abuse of discretion.people lucas cal th,d,jazayeri mao th,d molenda of motor vehicles th,d.
evidence code sections through list various methods of authentication of,by the testimony of a subscribing witness or a handwriting these methods are not exclusive,people olguin th,d.california courts have never considered the list set forth in evidence code sections as precluding reliance upon other means of authentication.people olguin,supra,at,d.circumstantial evidence,content and location are all valid means of authentication.people gibson th,d.
in people olguin,for example,several sheets of rap lyrics were authenticated as having been authored by the defendant through evidence establishing their location when their to the defendant gang and identifying the composer with the defendant gang moniker.accordingly,they were properly admitted to establish the defendant gang membership,his loyalty to his gang,his familiarity with gang culture,and inferentially,his motive and intent on the day of the killing.people olguin,supra,th at,d.similarly,in people gibson,two manuscripts were authenticated as the defendant writings by their to the author as sasha,one of the defendant aliases,and descriptions of a prostitution enterprise similar to one operated by defendant as established by independent the locations from which they were defendant home and hotel room.the court of appeal held that the trial court had not erred in permitting the prosecution to use the documents to show that the defendant was acting as a madam.people gibson,supra,th at,d see also people miller th,d deceased victim charge account records authenticated in part because items described were found in defendant possession moran cir,computer files authenticated where computer was seized from defendant home,access to files was protected by password,one account was in defendant name,and files contained records related to defendant business,including data about its principals,clients and programs.
circumstantial evidence,location and content were sufficient to authenticate the documents at issue here.they were found filed in avbs offices,intermingled with the agreements and enrollment forms authenticated by the testifying victims.the portions of the documents at issue were identical in every respect to the agreements and enrollment forms authenticated by the witnesses.the blanks in the investment agreements were filled out in a similar manner to those authenticated by the witnesses with the names and addresses of the participants,the amount of the investments and boxes checked to indicate the amount of anticipated returns.the investment agreements identified the party promising to pay returns as mv s,appellant company.further proof of authenticity came from the fact that most were signed by appellant,smith,vince had been identified as an agent for avbs by the tamikia white,who had been identified by randy townsend as an employee of avbs.this evidence was sufficient to establish that the documents were what they purported to between third parties and mv s.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the objection based on lack of authentication should be overruled.
we next turn to whether the documents at issue constituted inadmissible hearsay.hearsay is evidence of a statement that was made other than by a witness while testifying at the hearing and that is offered to prove the truth of the matter stated,subd.a.for purposes of the hearsay rule,a s tatement is defined as an oral or written verbal expression or nonverbal conduct of a person intended as a substitute for oral or written verbal expression,people lewis cal th,d.hearsay is not admissible unless it qualifies under some exception to the hearsay rule,subd.b people lewis,supra,at,d.
if a fact in controversy is whether certain words were spoken or written and not whether the words were true,evidence that these words were spoken or written is admissible as nonhearsay evidence.people fields th,d,quoting jefferson,cal.evidence benchbook ed.hearsay and nonhearsay evidence,see jazayeri mao,supra,th at,d documents not offered for the truth of the matter asserted are,by definition,not hearsay.witkin,cal.evidence ed.hearsay,where the very fact in controversy is whether certain things were said or done the words or acts are admissible not as hearsay,but as original evidence fed.rules evid.c,advisory committee note if the significance of an offered statement lies solely in the fact that it was made,no issue is raised as to the truth of anything asserted,and the statement is not hearsay.written or spoken words offered as original evidence rather than for their truth are generally referred to as operative facts.jazayeri mao,supra,th at,d people fields,supra,th at,d.
as discussed above,the prosecutor initially offered the documents for the truth of matters stated in them.he contended that information written on the participants addresses and the investment that appellant violated california securities law by offering and selling unregistered securities in the state and that appellant defrauded these parties by taking their funds under false pretenses.however,the court correctly ruled that the documents would be inadmissible hearsay if offered for those purposes.the court concluded that the documents were nonetheless admissible to establish appellant intent and the size and nature of the appellant operation encompassed more participants than the eight witnesses who testified and that the promised payments could not be made unless greater and greater numbers were induced to participate.thus,our review focuses on whether the documents supported the nonhearsay purposes identified by the court and whether those purposes were relevant to an actual issue in dispute.see people bunyard cal d,quoting people armendariz cal d,a n statement is not made admissible simply because its proponent states a theory of admissibility not related to the truth of the matter asserted the trial court must also find that the nonhearsay purpose is relevant to an issue in dispute.
preliminarily,we note that fraudulent intent is an element of grand theft and the offense of use of false statements in the sale of securities.see,people shirley d.elements of theft by false pretenses include making false pretense or representation with intent to defraud the victim of his or her property people simon cal th,d,k nowledge of the falsity or misleading nature of a statement or of the materiality of an omission,or criminal negligence in failing to investigate and discover them,are elements of the criminal offense described in corporations code section.moreover,appellant actual intent was put in issue by the defense when it introduced evidence that appellant was involved in a legitimate land development operation and argued that the profits that could have been derived from that enterprise would have been sufficient to pay investors.
the documents were probative of appellant intent.by virtue of their authentication,the documents must be deemed to be what they purported to between entities under the control of appellant and dozens of third parties.without regard to whether the information written on any individual agreement was true or whether these particular individuals were defrauded,the agreements as a whole established that appellant promised to pay fantastic returns not just to the eight victims who testified,but to numerous others.the sheer number of agreements entered into by appellant supported the prosecution theory that appellant was generating money to pay existing investors only by soliciting new ones,and appellant any legitimate real estate development.had the evidence been limited to appellant interaction with the eight witnesses,the defense argument that appellant intended in good faith to compensate investors from the anticipated profits on development of the lancaster property would have had more force.as appellant states in his brief in the absence of the or so investment contracts at issue,appellant trial would have been limited to an evaluation of the mere eight who actually appeared at trial,and of their handful of contracts.the fact that appellant or the entities he controlled entered into significantly more agreements than the relative handful attested to by the witnesses supported the inference that appellant intent in dealing with the eight victims named in the counts submitted to the jury was fraudulent.
the documents were also relevant to explain to the jury how a ponzi scheme works.while the precise nature of the scheme was not an element of any of the charged offenses,the prosecution was entitled to demonstrate why,in such a scheme,some initial investors would be paid off.had the jurors not understood that a ponzi scheme requires an initial group of satisfied customers,they might have concluded that the failure to pay the eight testifying victims was the result of bad luck or intervening factors,such as the lawsuit over the lancaster property or the unexpected need for additional fill.the prosecutor ponzi scheme explanation made clear that appellant inability to pay investors their promised returns or to refund their investments was an inevitable outcome of the operation he put in motion.
appellant contends on appeal that the court should have rejected under evidence code section the agreements executed by named victims who did not testify,because their probative value was outweighed by their prejudicial effect.as respondent points out,however,appellant failed to raise that objection to exhibit it has long been the rule that a verdict or finding shall not be set aside,nor shall the judgment or decision based thereon be reversed,by reason of the erroneous admission of evidence unless t here appears of record an objection to or a motion to exclude or to strike the evidence that was timely made and so stated as to make clear the specific ground of the objection or motion,subd.a.
moreover,even were we to consider the merits,we would conclude that exclusion under evidence code section would not have been appropriate.for the reasons discussed,the documents were probative of appellant intent and helped establish that appellant was operating a ponzi scheme.appellant contends that admission of the documents may have caused the jury to presume that each of the signatories was a victim of fraud,theft misrepresentations and that appellant did not pay back any of these investors either.the court offered to give a limiting instruction,which defense counsel declined,presumably because he did not wish to highlight the uses to which the jury could properly put the documents.accordingly,the prejudice identified by appellant was invited.
harmless error 
while we conclude the documents were admissible for the reasons stated,we further believe that appellant would have been
