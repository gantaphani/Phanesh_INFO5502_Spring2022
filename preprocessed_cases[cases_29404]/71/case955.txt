plaintiffs bruce ritchey and marty crawford filed suit,alleging that william horner and his mother,eloise horner,committed violations of federal and state securities laws when they sold their building supply business to plaintiffs.the district court granted summary judgment on the federal claim in favor of the horners,concluding that it was,and declined jurisdiction over the supplemental state law claims.plaintiffs appeal,and we reverse.
on september,ritchey and crawford met with the horners to finalize their purchase of the horners corporation,the mississippi county lumber company.ritchey had worked as a truck driver and salesperson for the company from to.he then left the company but rejoined it again in and was employed as its manager until the time of the purchase.crawford was not employed by the company but had done business with jack horner since in relation to his home improvement business.at the meeting,the parties executed a written agreement in which ritchey and crawford agreed to purchase the horners interest in the corporation.in the agreement,the horners warranted that the corporation had filed all tax returns required by law,that the returns had been timely filed,and that the corporation had no outstanding tax liabilities.
ritchey and crawford were apparently concerned about the company tax returns and tax liabilities because ritchey knew that the company had received a proposed tax assessment from the state of arkansas for the and tax years.the notice indicated that the assessed tax was due on july.jack horner,however,assured ritchey sometime prior to the meeting that the company did not actually owe taxes for the two years and that the company received the notice only because its accounting firm,deitz associates deitz,had not yet filed the tax returns for those years jack horner also directed deitz to fax a may,company financial statement to plaintiffs,which they received on september.the statement did not reflect any outstanding tax liabilities.at the meeting itself,jack horner specifically stated that the corporation and federal and state income tax returns had been filed but that he would have to send them to ritchey and crawford later because the returns were in deitz possession.although the record is not clear as to why,plaintiffs were apparently no longer concerned about the tax returns at the time of the september meeting.
after the september meeting,ritchey and crawford were told by their own accountant that there were advantageous tax reasons to restructure the purchase of the company.as a consequence,the horners and the corporation entered into a stock repurchase agreement on october,in which the corporation agreed to pay the horners for their shares as a down payment and the remaining balance,plus interest,in installments over months.ritchey and crawford,in turn,each contributed approximately to the corporation and furnished the down payment to the horners on behalf of the corporation.they also personally guaranteed the corporation debt to the horners,and,in exchange,the corporation issued one share to each.as part of the deal,the horners requested that of the down payment be paid directly to deitz for its accounting work.the stock repurchase agreement provided that the horners would remain on the company board for life and that jack horner would have the right to review and approve any distributions or salaries paid by the corporation to its officers or employees until such time as the corporation repaid its debt to the horners.
ritchey and crawford asked jack horner on numerous occasions after the september meeting why they had not yet received the and tax returns from deitz.on at least one occasion,horner explained that the delay was caused by some confusion or dispute over some accounting charges that he and his mother owed to deitz for personal work performed for him and his mother.on the other occasions,he told them that the returns would be coming soon and that he needed to get with his accountant about getting the returns.plaintiffs never verified whether the returns had in fact been filed,believing it better to let jack horner resolve the matter because he had dealt with the firm in the past.following the purchase,plaintiffs no longer employed deitz to perform its accounting work.
despite horner repeated promises to resolve the tax return problem,ritchey received a letter from deitz on june,which explained that the company and tax returns had not been completed or filed because the company had failed to pay the firm for its past services approximately one month later,ritchey and crawford received a notice from the state of arkansas assessing the company tax liability,including penalty and interest,at,and seeking immediate payment.after attempts to resolve the tax liability with the horners failed,plaintiffs brought suit on april,asserting that the horners engaged in securities fraud in violation of b of the securities exchange act of,b,and rule,based on their representations that the company tax returns had been filed and that the company owed no outstanding taxes.the horners then filed a motion to dismiss,which the district court treated as one for summary judgment because the parties relied on matters outside the pleadings,arguing that the securities fraud claim was not brought within the applicable statute of limitations.in ruling on the motion,the district court found as a matter of law that plaintiffs had inquiry notice of the alleged problems with the company tax returns by,at latest,february,more than one year before the suit was filed.
the time period in which an aggrieved party must bring an implied private cause of action under b and rule is governed by of the securities act of,supp.iv.great rivers coop.of iowa farmland,cir citing lampf,pleva,lipkind,prupis petigrow gilbertson,d.section provides,as relevant here,that the action must be brought within one year after the discovery of the alleged misrepresentation or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence.the reasonable diligence standard is an objective one,commonly referred to as the doctrine of inquiry notice,because the limitations period may be triggered even though the victim is unaware of the misleading statements if,in exercising reasonable diligence,he should have discovered their misleading nature.see great rivers,at.we have said before that inquiry notice exists when there are storm warnings that would alert a reasonable person of the possibility of misleading information,relayed either by an act or by omission.id.quoting davidson wilson,cir.because plaintiffs alleged failure to file suit within the period prescribed by is an affirmative defense,the horners bear the burden of establishing it.see law medco research,cir schmidt united states,cir recognizing that statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that defendant bears the burden to prove.thus,the issue is whether defendants have shown that there is no genuine dispute of fact that plaintiffs were on inquiry notice that the returns had not been filed sometime before april.
in deciding this issue,the district court reasoned that jack horner unconvincing excuses as to why ritchey and crawford had not received the company tax returns constituted red flags that should have led ritchey and crawford,by february at the very latest,to verify whether the returns had in fact been filed.we review the district court decision de novo,and we uphold summary judgment only if we find that no genuine issues of material fact remain and that the horners are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.concerned irrigators belle fourche irrigation,cir.in determining the existence of any genuine issues of material fact,we view the record most favorably to plaintiffs,the nonmoving parties.id.
plaintiffs argue that the record does not support the district court finding as a matter of law that they were on inquiry notice of the company tax problems for more than a year before they filed suit.in particular,they contend the district court failed to take into account their relationship with jack horner in characterizing his excuses as unconvincing.their position,i
