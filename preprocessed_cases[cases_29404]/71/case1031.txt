background 
factual background 
this case involves a k matched asset plan the plan offered by computer sciences corporation csc to certain of its employees.csc is a multibillion dollar fortune information technology company with major operations in the united states and more than other countries.its revenue grew in every year but one between december,and january,the class period,and it was profitable in every year during that period.its stock was and is heavily held by private and institutional investors,including public pension funds.
participants in the plan could contribute up to of their salaries to their individual investment accounts.at regular intervals,the plan gave participants full discretion to allocate and reallocate the voluntary contributions among fourteen diverse investment alternatives,which included a fund holding csc stock the csc stock fund.under the plan governing document,the csc stock fund was a mandatory investment offering designed to allow participants to own part of the company for which they work.csc then matched a part of these voluntary contributions with matching contributions equal to fifty cents for every dollar a participant contributed to his individual account,up to of the participant salary.prior to january,matching contributions were allocated to the csc stock fund,and plan participants could only reallocate the contributions to other diversified funds in the plan when they met certain age and service requirements later,from january onward,plan participants could direct and reallocate matching contributions to any fund or funds in the plan.
at times during the class period,the plan held approximately ten million shares of csc common stock.the csc retirement plans committee the committee,which consisted of csc officers,was responsible for selecting plan investment options.the plan required that the csc stock fund be one of the investment options.
plaintiffs are a class of current and former employees of csc and participants in the plan the participants.defendants are named and allegedly de facto fiduciaries of the plan the fiduciaries,consisting of csc,the committee,and current and former officers and directors of csc.the participants claims arise from alleged material weaknesses in csc stock option granting and tax accounting practices.the participants allege that these material weaknesses caused over errors in the pricing of stock options deficiencies relating to accounting for income taxes two restatements of csc financial statements within seven months a drop in csc stock price and an alleged loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in retirement savings to csc employees and retirees.
csc provided stock options as incentives to certain executives.the stock options purportedly had an exercise price equal to of the market value on the option grant date.however,csc followed a common practice for identifying the measurement date as the earliest date on which a company knows the option recipients,number of options to be issued,and the exercise price of the options.thus,the stock option grant dates were actually changed between and of the time to adjust the market value of the stock options.on june,csc announced that the securities and exchange commission sec had made an informal request for information about csc stock option granting practices.other significant matters were also announced on june,including that csc was no longer for sale and had decided to repurchase up to billion of its common stock,amounting to about of its outstanding shares.the following day,csc stock suffered a drop of about in value from to.the stock price quickly rebounded after the announcements,to within a week,to within two weeks,and to approximately a year later.
in september,the sec office of the chief accountant issued new guidance on how the measurement date for stock options was to be determined,recognizing that there had been widespread confusion on that point.csc established a special committee of directors to oversee an internal investigation into csc stock option granting practices.the investigation involved a law firm and an accounting firm,and cost more than million.the special committee identified no intentional,but did identify necessary adjustments to csc pricing of stock option grants.in addition,an independent audit had revealed tax deficiencies including accounting for income taxes,errors in income tax expenses and related liabilities,and errors in deferred tax assets.as a consequence of repricing its stock options and correcting its tax deficiencies,csc restated its financial statements twice,on june,and on january.
the participants allege that the fiduciaries misrepresented csc accounting and income tax problems by stating that stock options were granted at of the market value on the day of the grant by filing financial statements with the sec on forms and that later had to be restated in and,after they had been incorporated into information to plan participants about the csc stock fund and by stating that the june stock price drop was caused by the market,not csc.the participants also assert that certain of the fiduciaries breached their monitoring duties by failing to ensure that the committee had access to information about csc business problems,which made csc stock an imprudent retirement investment and by failing to ensure that the monitored fiduciaries completely appreciated the huge risk of investing a significant amount of rank and file employees retirement savings in csc stock.
the participants assert that the fiduciaries improper conduct caused class period damages to the plan of over million.the fiduciaries concede that the total charge resulting from the and restatements was a reduction of reported income for fiscal years to and retained earnings for fiscal year of million,but they argue that those charges had no impact on the financial health of csc,and were later largely offset by a settlement with the irs concerning historic tax positions and accounting practices.the fiduciaries also contend that the charges resulting from the stock option pricing errors amounted to only about million in cumulative charges to csc earnings spread out over eleven fiscal years,which amounted to only about of csc net income,and only about of its revenues over the same period.
procedural background 
this action pursuant to sections a and a of the employee retirement income security act erisa,a and a,was transferred to the united states district court for the central district of california from the eastern district of new york.the court certified a class of participants on december,and set trial for july.
before trial,the parties filed for summary judgment.the participants sought summary judgment on their imprudent investment and misrepresentation claims,and the fiduciaries sought summary judgment on all of participants claims.the district court issued an order denying the participants summary judgment motion,but granting the fiduciaries motion.the district court considered the participants imprudent investment claim under both the moench presumption,which the court noted that the ninth circuit has not yet adopted,and the prevailing prudent man standard of a b.the district court concluded that the participants had presented no evidence or argument that the fiduciaries failed to use the care,skill,prudence,and diligence that a prudent man would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.in the alternative,the district court concluded that the participants had presented no evidence or argument that a prudent investor under the circumstances would not have followed the plan mandate to invest in employer securities,and thus failed to rebut the moench presumption that the fiduciaries acted consistently with erisa in their decisions to invest plan assets in csc stock.the district court also concluded that the participants had failed to establish or to create a triable issue as to losses from the allegedly imprudent investment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the fiduciaries on the participants improper monitoring claim because the claim was derivative of the participants failed imprudent investment claim.
as to the participants misrepresentation and nondisclosure claim,the district court first concluded that such a claim could be based on corporate documents and filings,if they were incorporated into plan documents.nevertheless,the district court found that the participants had not generated any genuine issues of material fact that the alleged misrepresentations and nondisclosures at issue were material.the district court also found that the participants had not generated genuine issues of material fact that they detrimentally relied on the alleged misrepresentations.
the district court summary judgment order did not award costs.nevertheless,the subsequent judgment stated,without explanation,the parties shall bear their own costs.
the participants appeal the summary judgment ruling against them and the fiduciaries the district court failure to award them costs.
ii.review of summary judgment in an erisa case 
in erisa cases,as in other cases,this court review s de novo the district court grant of summary judgment and,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,determine s whether there are any genuine issues of material fact for trial.syncor,at.we may affirm summary judgment on any ground supported by the record.alexander.emp.stock ownership plan trust.union ins,cir cline indus.maint.eng g contracting,cir.for the reasons explained,the participants fail to demonstrate that there are genuine issues of material fact that make summary judgment improper 
iii.imprudent investment 
a.the statutory standard 
the statutory framework for claims under erisa,including imprudent investment claims,involves sections,and of erisa,and.see generally vaughn bay envtl,cir.section a of erisa imposes a duty on plan fiduciaries to invest plan assets as a prudent man would do.a section of erisa imposes liability for breach of fiduciary duty,a,and section provides,in pertinent part,that a civil action for breach of fiduciary duty may be brought by a participant,beneficiary or fiduciary for appropriate relief under section of this title.a.
section a requires a fiduciary to act prudently by diversifying the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses,unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so.a c.however,section a expressly exempts acquisition or holding of qualifying employer real property or qualifying employer securities,in the case of an eiap,like the plan at issue here,from the obligation to diversify.a.we have explained,the plain language of a does not require fiduciaries of an eligible individual account plan to diversify their investment outside of company stock in order to meet the prudent man standard of care.syncor,at wright oregon metallurgical,cir.on the other hand,a does not exempt fiduciaries for eiaps from the first prong of the prudent man standard,which requires a fiduciary to act with care,skill,prudence,and diligence in any investment the fiduciary chooses.syncor,at wright,at.thus,fiduciaries are required to act prudently when determining whether or not to invest,or continue to invest,erisa plan assets in the plan participants employer stock.this is true,even though the duty of prudence may be in tension with congress expressed preference for plan investment in the employer stock.kirschbaum reliant energy,cir.
as we have explained,there are a myriad of circumstances that could violate the prudent man standard for investment of erisa plan assets in a company own stock.syncor,at.generally,a court task in evaluating a fiduciary compliance with this standard is to inquire whether the individual trustees,at the time they engaged in the challenged transactions,employed the appropriate methods to investigate the merits of the investment and to structure the investment.wright,at quoting donovan mazzola,cir.
b.the moench presumption 
the fiduciaries urge us to adopt the moench presumption,first formulated by the third circuit in moench,at,for assessing whether fiduciaries imprudently invested in employer stock.the participants point out that we have twice declined to adopt it and have even criticized it.
in moench,the third circuit was confronted with the question,to what extent may fiduciaries of esops be held liable under erisa for investing solely in employer common stock,when both congress and the terms of the esop provide that the primary purpose of the plan is to invest in the employer securities moench,at.the court concluded that in limited circumstances,esop fiduciaries can be liable under erisa for continuing to invest in employer stock according to the plan direction.id.
the plan at issue in moench required the fiduciaries to invest primarily in the employer stock based on this language,the third circuit concluded that the plan did not absolutely require the fiduciaries to invest exclusively in the employer stock,so that the district court erred in holding that the fiduciaries had no latitude but to continue investing in the employer stock.id.at.
the fiduciaries in moench argued that they nevertheless could not be liable under erisa,because of the nature of the esop therefore,the court turned to the standard of review for an esop fiduciary decisions,and ultimately concluded that the most logical result is that the fiduciary decision to continue investing in employer securities should be reviewed for an abuse of discretion a n esop fiduciary who invests the assets in employer stock is entitled to a presumption that it acted consistently with erisa by virtue of that decision.id.at.the court went on to explain,in somewhat more detail,what a claimant would be required to show to rebut the presumption of prudent investment.moench,at.the third circuit has since elaborated on the scope and effect of the moench presumption.see in re.erisa,cir edgar avaya,cir.
the fifth and sixth circuits have expressly adopted the moench presumption.see kuper iovenko,cir kirschbaum,at.no federal appellate court has rejected the moench presumption on its merits.but see bunch grace,cir declining to adopt a moench presumption that retention of employer stock was reasonable in a case challenging the fiduciary decision to divest the plan of the employer stock,as doing so would controvert the purpose of the presumption and transform the intended shield into a sword to be used against a prudent fiduciary.
until now,we have declined to adopt the moench presumption.see syncor,at wright,at.on the other hand,we have also declined to reject moench.wright did express reservations about the presumption 
the third circuit intermediate prudence standard is difficult to reconcile with erisa statutory text,which exempts eiaps from the prudence requirement to the extent that it requires diversification.interpreting erisa prudence requirement to subject eiaps to an albeit tempered duty to diversify arguably threatens to eviscerate congressional intent and the guiding rationale behind eiaps themselves.
wright,at internal citations omitted.wright also observed that t he moench standard seems problematic to the extent that it inadvertently encourages corporate officers to utilize inside information for the exclusive benefit of the corporation and its employees.id.at.
we are not persuaded by either of the objections to the moench presumption raised in wright,that the presumption conflicts with erisa diversification exemption,a and the presumption encourages fiduciaries to engage in insider trading.we conclude that the moench presumption is fully reconcilable with erisa statutory text and does not encourage insider trading,when properly formulated.
first,the wright court was concerned that the moench presumption was at odds with erisa exemption of esops and other eiaps from its diversification requirements.if there is no duty to diversify esop plan assets under the statute,it logically follows that there can be no claim for breach of fiduciary duty arising out of a failure to diversify,or in other words,arising out of allowing the plan to become heavily weighted in company stock wright,at citing in re mckesson hboc.erisa,no,wl,at,unpublished disposition.we were likely concerned about this conflict between moench and erisa text because moench itself cites a for the proposition that under normal circumstances,esop fiduciaries can not be taken to task for failing to diversify investments,regardless of how prudent diversification would be under the terms of an ordinary pension plan.moench,at.that is not the scenario in which the moench presumption would do its work,however moench would not apply to allegations which fairly state only a violation of the fiduciaries duty to diversify kirschbaum,at.we do not read the moench presumption to apply to a diversification claim,because a presumption of prudence is unnecessary where fiduciaries are not subject to a prudence requirement to begin with.on the other hand,where employer stock is only one of the possible plan investments,and plaintiffs assert a claim that the fiduciary should have divested the plan of employer stock,the fiduciaries would be entitled to the presumption that investment in employer stock was prudent.thus,the moench presumption does not run afoul of the exemption from diversification in a.
the wright court second concern was that t he moench standard seems problematic to the extent that it inadvertently encourages corporate officers to utilize inside information for the exclusive benefit of the corporation and its employees,which would potentially run afoul of the federal securities laws.at.quite the opposite is true in contrast to erisa prudence requirement,moench gives fiduciaries a safe harbor from failing to use insider information to divest from employer stock.in kirschbaum,the fifth circuit noted that an objection to tempering the moench presumption was that doing so would effectively require the fiduciary to trade on insider information.kirschbaum,at.we believe that if the burden to rebut the presumption of prudent investment is sufficiently heavy,plan fiduciaries will not be tempted to act on insider information to protect themselves from liability for decisions about continued investment in employer stock.
we therefore adopt the moench presumption.the presumption is consistent with the statutory language of erisa and the trust principles by which erisa is interpreted,whether the plan is an esop or other eiap.see wright,at.at its core,our objection to adopting the moench presumption in wright was that it was not sufficiently deferential to or protective of fiduciaries,not that it placed too great a burden on those asserting claims.we believe that if properly formulated,the moench presumption can strike the appropriate balance between the employee ownership purpose of esops and other eiaps,and erisa goal of ensuring proper management of such plans.
plans that tie employee compensation to the company success are widely believed to be good for employee productivity and loyalty they expand the national capital base among effective merger of the roles of capitalist and worker.moench,at citing donovan,at.congress has granted favored status to esops and other eiaps by exempting them from certain erisa requirements.congress has also expressed concern that regulations and rulings which treat employee stock ownership plans as conventional retirement plans block the establishment and success of these plans.id.at citing tax reform act of,h,stat.
we adopt the moench presumption because it provides a substantial shield to fiduciaries when plan terms require or encourage the fiduciary to invest primarily in employer stock.fiduciaries are not expected to predict the future of the company stock performance without the moench presumption,a fiduciary could be sued for not selling if he adhered to the plan and the company stock dropped,but also sued for deviating from the plan and selling if the stock rebounded.kirschbaum,at.moreover,the horizon of retirement investing requires protecting fiduciaries from pressure to divest when the company stock drops.id.at.the moench presumption should also make it less likely that a plan fiduciary would be tempted to use insider information to divest the plan from company stock,since continued investment in the plan will be presumed prudent.
the presumption does not entirely insulate a fiduciary from a claim because it may be rebutted by a showing that the fiduciary abused its discretion by investing in employer stock.moench itself does not fully spell out what plan participants must show to rebut the presumption of prudent investment.the moench court explained that the presumption would be rebutted if owing to circumstances not known to the settlor and not anticipated by him the making of such investment would defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the purposes of the trust.moench,at quoting restatement second of trusts cmt.g.we agree and add that if there is room for reasonable fiduciaries to disagree as to whether they are bound to divest from company stock,the abuse of discretion standard protects a fiduciary choice not to divest.this will allow fiduciaries to fulfill their duties in the safe harbor that congress seems to have intended to provide them for managing eiaps and esops.in re ford motor.erisa litigation,d.
how bad do things have to be before no reasonable fiduciary in similar circumstances would have continued investing in company stock a plaintiff in moench pled the impending collapse of the company in order to overcome the presumption of prudent investment on a motion to dismiss.moench determined the precipitous decline in company stock combined with an insider fiduciary knowledge of the stock impending collapse and the fiduciary own conflicted status would constitute the type of change in circumstances that was not anticipated by the settlor of the trust.at.similarly,in wright,we contemplated the need for dire circumstances before the presumption would be rebutted,observing that u nlike moench,this case does not present a situation where a company financial situation is seriously deteriorating and there is a genuine risk of insider.at.
to overcome the presumption of prudent investment,plaintiffs must therefore make allegations that clearly implicate the company viability as an ongoing concern or show a precipitous decline in the employer stock combined with evidence that the company is on the brink of collapse or is undergoing serious mismanagement.id.at lalonde textron,d,rev on different grounds in lalonde textron,cir.it will not be enough for plaintiffs to prove that the company stock was not a prudent investment or that defendants ignored a decline in stock price.plan participants can only rebut the moench presumption by showing publicly known facts that would trigger the kind of careful and impartial investigation by a reasonable fiduciary that the plan fiduciary failed to perform.moench,at internal quotation marks omitted in wright,we said that,under erisa prudence requirement,the court task is to inquire whether the individual trustees,at the time they engaged in the challenged transactions,employed the appropriate methods to investigate the merits of the investment and to structure the investment.at quoting donovan,at.in contrast,under the moench presumption,a fiduciary decision not to divest,when faced with m ere stock fluctuations,even those that trend downward significantly,does not give rise to the inference that the fiduciary did not properly investigate the merits of continued investment in employer stock.wright,at.
there is no rule as to how much evidence is needed to rebut the moench presumption because congress has not chosen to create one t he statutory standard itself prudence has no tidy limiting principle in this matter as in many others,fiduciaries and courts alike must rely on common sense and experience to supplement airtight logic.in re ford motor,d at.a guiding principle,however,is that the burden to rebut the presumption varies directly with the strength of a plan requirement that fiduciaries invest in employer stock.for a directed trustee,there is a lesser degree of judicial scrutiny,while the more discretion a fiduciary has to invest in holdings as necessary,the more his decisions will be subject to judicial scrutiny.kirschbaum,at.in any event,however,the moench presumption would be difficult to rebut.see id.at citing cases with facts insufficient to rebut the moench presumption,including an merger,reverse stock split,and percent drop in stock price,financial woes and eighty percent drop in stock price and widespread accounting violations,restated revenues for three years,and percent drop in stock price.
c.the imprudent investment claim 
the participants assert that investment of the plan assets in csc stock was imprudent,because of material weaknesses in both csc stock option granting program and csc accounting for income taxes.the moench presumption applies to this claim of breach of fiduciary duty by an eiap fiduciary for offering employer stock in the plan and failing to divest the plan of the employer stock.the moench presumption applies even if,prior to january,the fiduciaries were not only required to offer employer stock as an investment option,but also required to invest matching contributions in employer stock.we note that the participants did not show that the committee had discretion to halt purchases of csc common stock or to invest plan assets that were required to be invested in the csc stock fund in other assets instead.the question is whether the district court correctly found that the participants did not generate any genuine issues of material fact that the fiduciaries nevertheless should have stopped plan investments in csc stock.see kirschbaum,at syncor,at the claimant must show that a prudent investor under the circumstances would not have followed the plan mandate to invest in employer securities.
the participants contend that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the fiduciaries on their imprudence claim,because the record is rich with evidence that it was imprudent for the fiduciaries to hold or offer csc stock in the plan.we agree with the district court,however,that the participants did not generate a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to rebut the moench presumption that continued investment in csc stock was prudent.
even assuming that the fiduciaries were aware of problems with the stock option granting practices and income tax contrary to the participants assertions,the record giving rise to inferences that the fiduciaries would have known of these problems is rather scant o ne can not say that whenever plan fiduciaries are aware of circumstances that may impair the value of company stock,they have a fiduciary duty to depart from plan provisions.kirschbaum,at.instead there ought to be persuasive and analytically rigorous facts demonstrating that reasonable fiduciaries would have considered themselves bound to divest.id.the participants here have presented no evidence that it was unreasonable for the fiduciaries to believe that csc would overcome its problems with stock options pricing and income tax accounting,especially in light of csc internal investigations of those problems.thus,the participants evidence is insufficient to rebut the moench presumption of prudence.
nor do the participants point to evidence that would generate a genuine issue of material fact that,at the time that the fiduciaries continued to hold csc common stock as part of the plan investment,the fiduciaries failed to employ appropriate methods to investigate the merits of the investment and to structure the investment.wright,at see also moench,f d at.first,m ere stock fluctuations,even those that trend downward significantly,are insufficient to establish the requisite imprudence to rebut the moench presumption.wright,at.thus,the district court properly found that the decline in csc stock price did not give rise to an inference that the fiduciaries did not properly investigate the merits of continued investment in csc stock.
second,contrary to the participants contentions,the district court did not engage in a faulty analysis by considering that the fiduciaries might also have been sued if they had stopped offering csc stock.courts applying the moench presumption have recognized that this very principle applies,not only where fiduciaries allegedly fail to maximize returns,but also where they allegedly held employer stock imprudently.see moench,at see also kirschbaum,at.moreover,the participants argument against considering whether the fiduciary might also be sued for divesting improperly relies on the hindsight conclusion that the fiduciary acted imprudently by holding the company stock in the first place.see difelice airways,cir w hether a fiduciary actions are prudent can not be measured in hindsight,whether this hindsight would accrue to the fiduciary detriment or benefit.
third,the district court properly rejected the participants claim that the drop in csc stock price in late june was sufficient to show that the fiduciaries did not properly investigate their continued investment in csc stock.it is true that a violation may occur where a company stock did not trend downward over time,but was artificially inflated during that time by an illegal scheme about which the fiduciaries knew or should have known,and then suddenly declined when the scheme was exposed.syncor,at emphasis added.however,the participants did not argue below,and do not argue on appeal,that any alleged problems in the handling of stock options,which purportedly caused the drop in csc stock price,amounted to an illegal scheme.that drop also does not generate a genuine issue of material fact as to imprudence of continued investment in csc stock on the basis of allegations of short of illegal conduct,where the price of the stock rebounded to more than its trading price within a reasonably short time frame.see edgar,at.
fourth,equally unavailing is the participants assertion that the fiduciaries knowledge of problems with csc stock option granting practices and accounting for income taxes shows that the fiduciaries failed to evaluate the merits of continued investment in company stock.courts have held that a duty to investigate whether continued investment in company stock is prudent only arises when there is some reason to suspect that investing in company stock may be is,there must be something akin to a red flag of misconduct.pugh tribune,cir citing barker am.mobil power,cir the participants alleged that the fiduciaries ignored red flags,but csc responded to the red flag issues by appropriately investigating and addressing the alleged problems.the fiduciaries did not breach their duty by failing to divest the plan of company stock.see id.
finally,to generate genuine issues of material fact on an imprudent investment claim,the participants must show a causal link between the failure to investigate or divest and the harm suffered by the plan.wright,at.they have not done so.the evidence they present does nothing to distinguish the causal effect on the stock price,if any,of the announcement of the sec request for information about csc stock option granting practices from the causal effect of the announcement of other significant matters that same day,including the fact that csc was no longer looking for a buyer and would buy back a substantial amount of its stock the record is also devoid of evidence that csc repricing its stock options,after its internal investigation and after the sec clarification of the guidelines for stock option pricing,was out of step with adjustments that other companies were forced to make in light of the sec clarification.
upon de novo review,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the fiduciaries on the participants imprudent investment claim.
iv.the misrepresentation claim 
the participants assert that the fiduciaries concealed and negligently misrepresented the truth about csc accounting and income tax problems.we have recognized erisa fiduciaries breach their duties if they mislead plan participants or misrepresent the terms or administration of a plan a fiduciary has an obligation to convey complete and accurate information material to the beneficiary circumstance,even when a beneficiary has not specifically asked for the information.barker,at internal citations omitted.t he same duty applies to alleged material misrepresentations made by fiduciaries to participants regarding the risks attendant to fund investment.edgar,at.
as the third circuit has explained,a misrepresentation is material if there was a substantial likelihood that it would have misled a reasonable participant in making an adequately informed decision about whether to place or maintain monies in a particular fund.id.this definition of materiality is consonant with this court formulations of materiality in other erisa contexts.see washington bert rozelle nfl ret.plan,cir erisa disability benefits case thomas,head greisen emps.trust buster,cir action by an erisa trust against the seller of deed of trust notes.the definition applies here,too.
the participants misrepresentation claim is premised on a statement purportedly to the effect that the june stock price drop was caused by the market,not csc statements that stock options have an exercise price equal to of the market value on the day they were granted and financial statements filed with the sec on forms and that were incorporated into information to plan participants about the csc stock fund.we assume,without deciding,that alleged misrepresentations in sec disclosures that were incorporated into communications about an erisa plan are fiduciary communications on which an erisa misrepresentation claim can be based.even with this assumption,the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of the fiduciaries on the participants misrepresentation claim must be affirmed because the participants failed to generate genuine issues of material fact that each of the communications in question was a misrepresentation that was material.
first,and easiest to dispose of,is the participants contention that the fiduciaries made a material misrepresentation in the csc newsletter entitled solutions that it was the market,not csc that caused the significant market decline.as the district court correctly found,this statement could not possibly be a misrepresentation about the cause of the market decline,because the statement was actually made based on information known to the commentator for the period ending june.the participants ignore this fact,or attempt to direct the court attention away from it,by concentrating their appeal on the district court determination that the statement was not made by the fiduciaries,but by a third party.even supposing that the statement was adopted by the fiduciaries,it still is not a misrepresentation about the cause of the stock drop on june.
second,the participants contend that the fiduciaries made material misrepresentations in statements about pricing of stock options at of market value at the time they were granted.those statements may have been untrue in light of the clarification of the standard for pricing of stock options in the sec guidance in september.nevertheless,it is not clear that anything in the record generates a genuine issue of material fact that the statements were untrue prior to that guidance.also,even assuming that they were untrue when made,the participants did not generate any genuine issues of material fact that the statements were material,in the sense that there was a substantial likelihood that they would have misled a reasonable participant in making an adequately informed decision about whether to place or maintain monies in the csc stock fund.edgar,at.the stock options pricing errors amounted to only about million in charges over eleven fiscal years,only about of csc net income,and only about of its revenues over the same period.the participants attempt to direct the court attention only to the charges from repricing of stock options in the aggregate,and at the percentage error in relation only to stock option pricing claimed in particular years.doing so,however,does not generate a genuine issue of material fact that the allegedly erroneous statements about the stock options pricing were material to csc financial condition as a whole or material to decisions about investment in csc stock.
the participants assert that united states reyes,cir,stands for the broad proposition that improper accounting of backdated stock options is necessarily a material misstatement.we disagree.reyes is about criminal backdating but recognizes that backdating is not itself illegal if properly recorded.reyes,at.the reyes decision also states the same test of materiality as edgar,whether there is a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having altered the total mix of information made available.id.at quoting basic,levinson.we concluded,above,that information about the pricing of stock options was not material under this standard.
thus,as the district court concluded,it was highly unlikely that a reasonable participant would have been misled in making an adequately informed decision about whether to place or maintain monies in the csc stock fund by statements about the pricing of stock options later shown to be arguably inaccurate.edgar,at.because the participants failed to generate any genuine issue of material fact that the fiduciaries made material misstatements or nondisclosures,the district court properly granted summary judgment on their misrepresentation claim.
v.the fiduciaries costs 
the fiduciaries the district court failure to award them costs as prevailing parties pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.although the district court summary judgment ruling was silent on the matter,the subsequent judgment stated,without explanation,the parties shall bear their own costs.rule provides that u nless a federal statute,these rules,or a court order provides otherwise,than attorney be allowed to the prevailing party.d emphasis added.erisa g also provides for an award of costs in any action under this subchapter by a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary,the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney fee and costs of action to either party.g emphasis added.
this court has not resolved the question of whether rule d is supplanted or supplemented by g,nor has any other circuit court.but see agredano mutual of omaha,cir using rule d to assist in the interpretation of allowable costs under leonard sw.bell.disability income plan,cir considering whether an award of costs was appropriate pursuant to rule d in an erisa case otherwise brought pursuant to.federal district courts to consider the question appear to be split.compare brieger tellabs,d,awarding costs under g because it provide s otherwise within the plain language of rule d,with macleod procter gamble disability ben.plan,d,awarding costs under rule d while recognizing that g allows an award of costs to either party,not just to a prevailing party.
we hold g does not plainly provide otherwise than rule d for the award of costs to a prevailing party.to provide otherwise than rule d,the statute or rule would have to bar an award of costs to a prevailing party.section g,however,in no way precludes an award of costs to a prevailing party it simply provides that,in any action
