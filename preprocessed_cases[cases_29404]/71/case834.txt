judd hirschberg floor broker registration was revoked after he was convicted of mail fraud in.in,he received a presidential pardon for that conviction,but the commodity futures trading commission cftc nevertheless denied his application for floor broker registration.because a pardon does not eliminate the legal determination that hirschberg was guilty of the crime of which he was convicted,and the crime was properly considered in the cftc application process,we affirm the decision of the cftc and deny hirschberg petition for review.
hirschberg became a registered floor broker in.according to the commodities exchange act,floor brokers buy and sell futures contracts for others on an exchange floor such as that of the chicago mercantile exchange cme,where hirschberg worked.floor brokers commonly act as fiduciaries in conducting transactions.they are required to register with the cftc,which has delegated most of the registration process to the national futures association nfa.see e,o.the cftc also has the power to revoke registration from floor brokers who violate cftc or nfa rules.
the cftc initiated revocation proceedings against hirschberg in,alleging disqualification under sections a conviction of a felony involving fraud and a for good cause of the commodities exchange act.d,m.hirschberg had indeed been convicted in federal court on four felony counts of mail fraud and two felony counts of tampering with vehicle identification numbers.these convictions stemmed from an insurance fraud scheme that took place in,when hirschberg reported that his car had been stolen and then collected from his insurance company.several years later,evidence was discovered suggesting that hirschberg had voluntarily transferred the car to a friend and altered its vehicle identification number to hide the crime.on appeal,this court found insufficient evidence to uphold the conviction for identification number tampering,but affirmed the conviction for mail fraud.hirschberg was ordered to serve three years of probation and pay in restitution.
the cftc proceedings ultimately led to revocation of hirschberg registration in.the administrative law judge alj presiding over the hearing did not find sufficient evidence of mitigation or rehabilitation to justify hirschberg keeping his registration.weighing against hirschberg was evidence of disciplinary proceedings brought against him by the years after the insurance fraud,hirschberg was disciplined for engaging in trading in violation of cme rules.hirschberg has made his living since earning substantially less than he did as a floor broker by consulting for trading houses and training young traders.
in,hirschberg applied for a presidential pardon of his mail fraud conviction,which was granted by president clinton in.pardon in hand,he applied to the nfa for registration as a floor broker in july.after a designated subcommittee conducted a hearing,the nfa denied hirschberg application.the subcommittee found that hirschberg conviction and subsequent revocation of registration subjected him to a section a disqualification based on his prior revocation.see a.although this merely created a rebuttable presumption that he was unfit for registration,the subcommittee did not find that hirschberg presented enough mitigating evidence to rebut the presumption of unfitness.the cftc affirmed the denial of registration in.hirschberg appeals the denial on the grounds that the cftc decision violates the pardon clause,due process,and his statutory rights under the commodities exchange act.
ii.analysis 
we review the cftc decision by addressing each of hirschberg arguments in turn.to summarize the legal effect of a presidential pardon is to preclude further punishment for the crime,but not to wipe out the fact of conviction.the cftc did not violate the pardon clause by considering the conduct underlying hirschberg conviction in determining whether he was qualified to do business as a floor trader,because its decision was grounded in protection of the public rather than in punishing hirschberg as a convicted felon.hirschberg due process and statutory rights arguments also do not justify reversal of the decision to deny his application for registration.
pardon clause 
the cftc denied hirschberg application for registration based on section a of the commodities exchange act,which is codified at a and allows the cftc to revoke or deny registration of any person if a prior registration of such person in any capacity has been suspended or has been revoked.the revocation underlying this statutory disqualification was,of course,based on hirschberg conviction for mail fraud.hirschberg asserts that,because he received a full and unconditional pardon for that conviction,the cftc denial unconstitutionally interferes with the presidential pardon power.this is a legal question which we review de novo.see lacrosse cftc,cir reviewing constitutional double jeopardy issue de novo.
the constitution gives the president power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the united states,except in cases of impeachment.const.art.ii.hirschberg relies on a civil war era case to support his position that a presidential pardon shields him from suffering any further direct or indirect consequences of his conviction.in ex parte garland,the supreme court held that depriving an attorney of the right to practice law based on a pardoned conviction for treason stemming from service in the confederate legislature violated the pardon clause.wall.a pardon reaches both the punishment prescribed for the offence and the guilt of the offender,the court said.id.at.i t releases the punishment and blots out of existence the guilt,so that in the eye of the law the offender is as innocent as if he had never committed the offence.id.
but modern caselaw emphasizes and indeed hirschberg admits that this historical language was dicta and is inconsistent with current law.see in re north.a pardon in no way reverses the legal conclusion of the courts it does not blot out guilt or expunge a judgment of conviction.north,at see also nixon united states,d a pardon is in no sense an overturning of a judgment of conviction by some other tribunal burdick united states.a pardon carries an imputation of guilt.the effect of a pardon is not to prohibit all consequences of a pardoned conviction,but rather to preclude future punishment for the conviction.see nixon,at.bjerkan united states,cir.the question we must answer,then,is whether the cftc denial of hirschberg registration is impermissible punitive action or simply a consequence of the conduct underlying the conviction that the pardon could not erase.
the answer turns on whether the conduct for which hirschberg was convicted has any bearing on his ability to work as a floor broker.government licensing agencies may consider conduct underlying a pardoned improperly punishing the pardoned long as that conduct is relevant to an individual qualifications for the licensed position.grossgold supreme court of illinois,cir bjerkan,at.in grossgold,for example,an attorney was suspended from practice for three years based on a conviction for mail fraud.at.fraudulent activity was grounds for discipline under illinois and integrity are deemed important traits in the practice of a conviction for a crime involving fraud was conclusive evidence of fraudulent activity.in re grossgold.a presidential pardon did not invalidate the suspension,because it did not wipe out the moral turpitude inherent in the factual predicate supporting plaintiff mail fraud conviction.grossgold,at.in cases where governmental action has been held to violate the pardon clause,on the other hand,the pardoned individual is stripped of his rights based not on the conduct underlying the conviction,but on the fact of conviction alone.see bjerkan,at holding that a state deprivation of a pardoned individual civil rights based on fact of a conviction alone violated pardon clause.
the statutory disqualification scheme under which hirschberg registration was revoked in and then denied in was enacted with the futures trading act of.it was designed to streamline and simplify the former registrati
