we conclude that cutera alleged incomplete disclosures about its sales force are not material omissions made in violation of the securities laws,and that cutera earnings projections fall within the statutory safe harbor for projections under the private securities litigation reform act of pslra.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of the suit under federal rule of civil procedure b.
background 
cutera sells lasers and other aesthetic systems to medical professionals for use in cosmetic procedures,primarily through its direct sales force.in,cutera expanded its senior sales force and by met with considerable success,increasing its revenue,primarily due to increased sales and marketing efforts and its higher concentration of direct sales employees in the united states.in late,cutera also embarked on an aggressive sales force expansion plan to market a laser the solera opus through junior sales representatives.the expansion was complete by may and cutera projected it would take two quarters for the junior sales representatives to reach target productivity.in a january,conference call with analysts reporting results from the third quarter of,connors attributed growth to the success of the senior sales force but stated that cutera was looking to improve upon the sales productivity of the junior sales team.
the junior sales force failed to move the solera opus,and cutera abandoned the program.by the end of march,only two junior representatives remained in their original roles,while the rest had transferred to other positions within cutera or left the company.
the investors purchased cutera stock between january,and may,the class period.in a january,press release and conference call,cutera disclosed that it did get the productivity it was looking for from the junior sales staff,and that it had since made modifications to the alignment of the sales organization.cutera nonetheless projected first quarter and year end revenues in of million and million respectively,a growth of over the previous year.cutera stock value jumped from to the next day.
cutera stock price stayed above throughout february and march,peaking on april,at a share.on april,cutera revised revenue projections for the first quarter of down from million to million,stating the shortfall was due primarily to lower than expected productivity levels of the recent sales expansion.that same day,cutera stock price dropped more than to.the stock price hovered between and between april and may,when cutera reported final first quarter revenues of million,laying the shortfall at the feet of the unsuccessful implementation of the junior sales program,unusually high sales employee turnover,and disappointing results from certain national accounts.by the close of business may,cutera shares closed at,a loss of per share or more than off the previous day price.
the investors allege that on january,cutera did not adequately disclose the poor performance of the junior sales force,leading to artificially inflated stock prices,and thus failing to provide investors with information material to whether they should purchase cutera stock.this claim rests on the charge that cutera knew about the significant shortcomings of the junior sales program before the beginning of the class period.as a result,the investors claim that in april and may,when cutera more fully disclosed the problems with its sales staff and associated shortfalls in earning projections,the stock price fell,causing a loss to investors.
the district court granted cutera motion to dismiss the complaint,finding no material difference between cutera january,disclosures and later disclosures in spring and concluding that the alleged failure to fully disclose information about the junior sales staff did not sufficiently allege a violation of securities laws.the district court further held that allegations about cutera misleading earnings projections fell within the pslra safe harbor for statements.the district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice to allow the investors to amend the complaint to the particularity contemplated by the pslra that the factors which accounted for cutera deviation from the january earnings projection were not warned against in the cautionary statements that accompanied the january protections.the investors eschewed the amendment option and instead filed an appeal.
