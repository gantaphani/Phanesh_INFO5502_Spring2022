this case requires us to determine whether the securities act of the act applies to a bridge loan and whether a single phone call and the mailing of allegedly fraudulent information can be sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over defendants.plaintiff alleges violations of the act and texas state law.the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss,holding that the plaintiff failed to state a claim under the act and that the evidence was insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over the defendants.we agree with the district court as to the reach of the act,but we find that sufficient minimum contacts exist as to all but one of the appellees and reverse the district court dismissal as to the state law claims.
facts and proceedings below 
appellant michael lewis was a customer of the bear stearns brokerage house from april to april.david fresne was his stockbroker.in,fresne tried to convince lewis to buy stock through a private placement in mad martha ice cream,mad martha,a delaware corporation with business locations in massachusetts.fresne sent lewis a private placement memorandum on a mad martha stock offering,but lewis refused to buy.
lewis did agree to fresne second suggestion making a bridge loan to mad martha pending the closing of a private placement of the company stock.in june,lewis loaned to mad martha.in return,lewis received a promissory note for the note,which was never repaid,and a pledge of shares of mad martha stock,which became worthless when mad martha filed for bankruptcy eight months later.the note was supposedly secured by,among other things,a first lien on the assets of a mad martha store in nantucket,massachusetts.it was to bear interest at a rate of percent per annum,or,and that amount was not tied to the performance of mad martha stock.
lewis claims that the defendants misrepresented the facts surrounding the nantucket store when he agreed to loan the.apparently,the former president of mad martha,thomas quinn,entered into the lease for mad martha nantucket store in his own name instead of mad martha.even after he was removed by the board of directors,quinn continued to retain possession of the nantucket store and operate it as if it were his own store and not mad martha.mad martha unsuccessfully filed suit in an effort to regain control of the nantucket store.lewis alleges that the defendants sent him letters and documents falsely stating that mad martha was providing him with a first lien on the nantucket store when they knew that quinn was the store true owner.
the efforts to sell mad martha stock in a private placement failed.on february,mad martha filed for bankruptcy.lewis filed a complaint in texas state court alleging breach of fiduciary duty by fresne,securities fraud under the texas securities act,violations of the securities act of,common law fraud,and civil conspiracy.the case was then removed to the united states district court for the southern district of texas.in an august,order,the district court denied lewis motion to remand the case to state court and dismissed several defendants from the case on the basis that personal jurisdiction was lacking.this appeal only concerns those defendants eric rosenfeld lowell farkas eric young and rosenfeld,bernstein tannenhauser,llp 
in an october,opinion,the district court reaffirmed that lewis failed to state a claim under the act and the evidence was insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over the defendants in this appeal.the district court denied lewis request to file an amended complaint alleging violations of the securities act of.meanwhile,lewis eventually settled with the defendants that had not been dismissed in the august order,including fresne.following his settlement with fresne the last remaining defendant,lewis submitted an agreed final judgment that was approved by the court on april.lewis then filed a motion for a new trial as to the defendants dismissed in the august,order.he attached to this motion a statement from fresne who claimed that he had been acting as an intermediary between lewis and rosenfeld.the district court denied the motion citing the prejudice to the defendants who had been out of the case for three years and the lack of probative value in fresne statement.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews both the district court denial of lewis motion to remand the case back to state court and its dismissal for want of personal jurisdiction de novo.see frank bear stearns,cir motion to remand jobe atr,cir dismissal for want of personal jurisdiction.when a trial court rules on a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction without holding an evidentiary hearing,as the trial court did in this case,it must resolve any factual conflicts in favor of the plaintiff.see stripling jordan production,cir.
the district court denial of leave to amend the complaint is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see patterson healthcare,cir.
iii.failure to state a claim under the securities act 
the act states no case arising under this title and brought in any state court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any court of the united states.the district court acknowledged this language,but explained that in limited circumstances the defendant may pierce the pleadings to show that claims otherwise not removable have been pled solely to prevent removal.in its august order,the district court held that the note was not a security,and,therefore,lewis did not have a valid claim under the act.in its subsequent opinion,the district court explained that lewis also failed to state a claim because lewis only sued under of the act and that portion of the act does not apply to transactions.
the burden is on the defendants to show that lewis federal securities act claim is baseless.this is a heavy burden.defendants must show that there is no possibility that plaintiff would be able to establish a cause of action.lackey atlantic richfield,cir.all questions of fact and any ambiguities in the current controlling substantive law must be resolved in the plaintiff favor.see burchett cargill,cir.
we decline to address the issue of whether the note was a security under the act because we agree with the district court that this was a private transaction.for his act claims,lewis alleged only violations of,and derivative liability under these correspond to,and in the.section provides liability or rescission for the offer or sale of a security without a registration statement.section imposes liability on any person who offers or sells a security by means of a prospectus or oral communication,which includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact.section of the act does not apply to private transactions.see gustafson alloyd,d.in gustafson,the supreme court analyzed the legislative history of the act to determine that congress meant for to apply only to public offerings 
the evidence shows that this was a private transaction.lewis only agreed to make the loan after receiving and rejecting a private placement memorandum.he entered the deal through his own private broker.the was designed to keep mad martha running until a private placement sale of stock could be completed.see whirlpool financial gn holdings,cir holding that did not apply to a transaction involving a private placement memorandum vannest sage,rutty,same.
lewis contends that the district court ignored the public aspects of his transaction.he cites to a decision from the southern district of new york that allowed a plaintiff to sue under even though his purchase of stock was made pursuant to a private placement memorandum.see fisk superannuities.the plaintiff in fisk,however,alleged in his complaint that he had purchased shares out of an offering of up to million shares of common stock.id.at.in contrast,lewis complaint contends that his shares were represented to be of the outstanding shares of stock.thus,lewis purchase involved a major stake in mad martha while the plaintiff in fisk only bought himself a relatively small stake in the company.two of the criteria for determining if a transaction is public are the size of the offering and the number o
