background 
debtors are former employees of the boeing company who became employees of spirit aerosystems,on june,when spirit acquired boeing wichita plant.in re lowe.at the time of the sale,debtors unions ratified substantially similar collective bargaining agreements the cba with spirit.in re dittmar,cir.during negotiations,spirit proposed a wage cut for employees.lowe,at.as an inducement,spirit also offered to establish an equity participation program epp for employees and to contribute stock appreciation rights sars to the program if certain payment events occurred.id.these sars would expire in fifteen years if no payment event occurred.the final cba contained language that t he parties agree to establish an epp for participating employees.lowe,at.emphasis added.the cba did not provide a detailed description of the epp and did not define the term participating employees.id.at.prior to voting on the cba,the union members attended a slide presentation discussing the epp.id.at.the slides indicated that participants would be awarded options approximately options per employee an option was a right to share in payment event profits on one share of stock.the value of the option would be determined upon a payment event with a participant ultimately receiving proceeds less the exercise price of the option,following a payment event,cash or stock will be distributed automatically.the amount you receive will be net of the exercise price of the option.the slides further noted that w e do not know when a payment event will take place,but the company is using a period in their planning.the company will want a payment event as soon as the conditions are right for an optimal valuation.the unions ratified the cba on june.lowe,at.
shortly after ratification of the cba,debtors filed their respective bankruptcy petitions over roughly a period between august and october.dittmar,at.on october,over one year after the bankruptcy filings,spirit memorialized the epp in a document.lowe,at.the full plan document defined which employees were eligible to participate in the epp,as well as the sars each eligible employee would receive under the epp.id.one month later,on november,a payment event an ipo occurred.id.ultimately,the sars were worth per employee.id.participating employees received in cash around december,and shares of spirit class a common stock around march.id.at.
trustees then filed motions to compel turnover of the distributions received from the sars as property of the bankruptcy estate pursuant to.after a hearing,the bankruptcy court entered an interim order denying turnover.dittmar,b.at.after discovery,various trustees and debtors moved for summary judgment on the turnover motions.the bankruptcy court granted debtors motion for summary judgment and denied trustees motion,finding the distributions were not property of the bankruptcy estate.lowe,at.the bankruptcy court,relying on kansas law,held that the cba did not grant debtors an enforceable right in the distributions because it did not clearly define which employees would have rights under the epp.id.at.the court noted that participating employees was not defined until the creation of the epp.id.the bankruptcy court concluded the right to the distributions was not part of the estate because debtors did not have a contingent future interest until the epp was created.id.at.
a split panel of the bap affirmed the bankruptcy court judgment but utilized different reasoning.the panel majority determined that the bankruptcy court erred in relying upon kansas contract law to interpret the cba,finding the cba unambiguous,and limiting its analysis to the plain language of the cba.dittmar,at.however,the majority held that the debtors did not have an interest in the distributions until the payment event occurred.id.until this time,debtors had only a hope,anticipation,or expectation in the sars because those distributions were entirely dependent upon the economic decisions of spirit.id.at.according to the majority,because spirit had discretion over whether the payment event would occur,debtors had no interest in the distributions.id.at.the dissenting member of the panel would have denied summary judgment and remanded for an evidentiary hearing on various issues.id.at.
discussion 
on appeal from a bap decision,we review matters of law de novo and the bankruptcy court factual findings for clear error.melnor,corey,cir.w e treat the bap as a subordinate appellate tribunal whose rulings are not entitled to any deference although they certainly may be persuasive.mathai warren,cir.
for purposes of most bankruptcy proceedings,property interests are created and defined by state law.once that state law determination is made,however,we must still look to federal bankruptcy law to resolve the extent to which that interest is property of the estate under.parks fia card,n,cir citations and quotations omitted a.
we first consider whether and to what extent debtors have an interest in the sars under kansas law.butner united states,see,williamson hall,no,wl,at cir,holding that pay on death accounts were not part of the bankruptcy estate under because,under kansas law,debtor had no property interest in the accounts until the death of the owner.we then consider whether that interest existed before debtors filed their bankruptcy petitions.finally,we turn to whether the sars are property of the bankruptcy estate under.
nature of debtors interest 
the parties do not address whether the distribution rights at issue would be considered a property interest under kansas law,although trustees generally note that kansas law recognizes that contingent interests are property interests.aplt.br.see also in re allen.truck lines,cir.our research has not uncovered any kansas cases with similar facts.as a result,we must predict how the kansas supreme court would rule.see,boehme postal,f d,cir.to this end,we are free to consider all resources available,including decisions of kansas courts,other state courts and federal courts,in addition to the general weight and trend of authority.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
stock appreciation rights are a type of compensation that give the holder the right to a cash payment or stock in an amount representing the difference between the market price and the fixed or strike price specified on the face of the sar.scholastic,harris,cir citing searls glasser,cir see also fasb accounting standards codification,glossary,stock appreciation right.the sars at issue in this case vested upon an ipo or other payment event,and the distribution was the difference between the net offering price per share of the ipo and plus an incremental amount for each year.see also spirit aerosystems annual report at upon the closing date of the ipo,all rights to receive stock were considered vested.
debtors interest in the sars is similar to an employee interest in a stock option plan.see,in re carlton.employees with stock options own contractual rights to purchase stock in the future that are subject to certain limitations of use and to the possibility of defeasance by later events.id.at.such postponed enjoyment does not disqualify these interests as property.id.the carlton court held that t he fact that some of the options had not accrued and were not exercisable as of the bankruptcy petition date,but whose exercise was contingent on the debtor continued employment,is of no consequence to the issue of ownership of the options on the petition date.id.that the epp required a payment event as condition precedent does not alter this analysis.see,capital health management group hartley,describing a sars agreement where payment was contingent on the sale of company stock.
once debtors satisfied the condition for being participating employees completing ninety days of employment for the new company,they were eligible to participate in the epp.these employees held contingent property rights.while the value of the sars before any payment event occurred may have been de minimis,that does not mean that debtors did not have a property interest in the sars.the nature of that interest and whether it is legally recognizable is a different question than its valuation.
creation of the property right 
trustees argue that the cba,which was approved before debtors filed for bankruptcy,created the sars rights.aplt.br.debtors counter that,if their interest is a property interest,it was not created until the epp was did not occur until after the bankruptcy filings.aplee.br.the epp provisions in the cba indicate that the program applies to participating employees,but participating employees was not defined within the cba document.the bankruptcy court concluded that debtors did not have an enforceable right until the epp document defined which employees were participating employees.lowe,at.taking a different view,the bap majority concluded that debtors had a mere expectancy until the payment event occurred.dittmar,at.we believe the key question is whether the epp provisions in the cba were merely an agreement to agree or whether they evidenced a binding agreement that would be formalized at a later date.if the latter is the case,debtors property rights were created at the time the cba was ratified.
while the bankruptcy court construed the cba relying only on its plain language,interpretation of a cba is governed by federal law.see lueck.in the labor context,parties frequently reach informal or oral collective bargaining agreements that they later intend to formalize.see,united steelworkers of am.cci,cir t he trial court was not clearly erroneous in holding that a binding verbal contract was intended by the parties pending a written formalization of their agreement.these agreements are enforceable under federal law,even when they are not reduced to writing.see,int l union,united mine workers big horn coal,cir the contract between the parties need not be a written,signed collective bargaining agreement,but may exist as any informal agreement between the parties significant to the maintenance of labor peace between them.mack trucks,int l union,uaw,cir adoption of an enforceable labor contract does not depend on the reduction to writing of the parties intention to be bound.bobbie brooks,int l ladies garment workers union,cir the existence of a collective bargaining agreement does not depend on its reduction in writing it can be shown by conduct manifesting an intention to abide by terms.to determine the objective intent of the parties,courts may look to the surrounding circumstances,and the parties conduct manifesting an intention to abide by terms.mack trucks,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
we disagree with the bankruptcy court conclusion that the cba is unambiguous.lowe,at.while many of the epp provisions are established in the cba document,there are at least two ambiguities first,the agree to establish an epp language in the cba is susceptible to two possible meanings it could indicate a present agreement with the understanding that formalization of the epp will occur in the future or it could reflect an agreement not to be bound until the plan has been executed.in addition,the cba does not define the term participating employees.
the summary judgment record contains extrinsic evidence regarding the parties intent the slides describing the epp presented to the employees prior to the cba vote.the deposition testimony of jeff clark,the former director of union relations for boeing and then spirit,who testified about negotiating the cba.and the sec registration statements filed before the payment event.this evidence is uncontroverted both parties represented to this court at oral argument that there are no disputed material facts.
as noted,after the bargaining units and spirit negotiated the cba and the epp,spirit employees assisted in the preparation of a slide presentation that was used to educate union members about the epp prior to the cba vote.aplt.br.aplee.br.the slides indicated that the unions had negotiated an epp for eligible employees.the slides described the nature of the sars rights,how the rights would be allocated,and which employees would be eligible for the rights.clark testified that,at the time of the bargaining agreement,t here was a description about who would be eligible to participate in the epp and an agreement about what would constitute sars.before the ipo payment event,spirit filed a series of registration statements with the sec.aplt.br.aplee.br.one filing described spirit obligations regarding the epp as part of the collective bargaining agreements,spirit has agreed to establish a union epp pursuant to which it will grant sars to each eligible employee.spirit then memorialized the epp on october.aplt.br.aplee.br.the written epp document contained identical terms to those described in the slide presentation.compare,with.prior to the memorialization of the epp,when employees had questions about the epp,they were referred to the presentation slides,which were posted online.aplt.br.aplee.br.this extrinsic evidence supports trustees position that the epp terms were part of the cba negotiations.debtors have not offered evidence to the contrary.accordingly,the evidence fully supports the contention that the cba included a binding agreement about the epp rather than an agreement to agree on the parameters of the epp at some later point.
we agree with the bap dissent that summary judgment is usually not an appropriate vehicle for determining the parties intent about contract formation.dittmar,at.however,debtors must raise more than some metaphysical doubt about whether the epp terms were agreed on during the cba negotiations given trustees proof on the issue.see anderson liberty lobby.while intent is usually a question of fact,the evidence supporting contract formation is uncontroverted,and the parties agree that there are no disputed material facts.under such circumstances,remand for an evidentiary hearing is not warranted,and trustees are entitled to judgment on this point.
property of the bankruptcy estate under 
under federal law,the bankruptcy estate includes,with enumerated exceptions,all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.a.we have pointed out that the scope of is broad and should be generously construed,and that an interest may be property of the estate even if it is novel or contingent.parks,at internal quotation marks omitted united states rauer,cir quoting united states cardall,cir,for the proposition that is broadly construed to include all property interests,whether reachable by creditors or not,and whether vested or contingent see also in re barowsky,cir discussing congress affirmative adoption of segal rochelle,in adopting.another circuit has likewise noted,when a bankruptcy petition is filed,virtually all property of the debtor at that time becomes property of estate e very conceivable interest of the debtor,future,nonpossessory,contingent,speculative,and derivative,is within reach of.in re yonikus,cir citations and quotation marks omitted.even contingent interests that may or may not vest for years at the time of their creation are not necessarily excluded.in re yeary,cir bankruptcy estate includes property subject to a creditor security interest created years before the bankruptcy petition was filed.
adopting the bap majority reasoning,debtors argue that their interests were merely the hope,anticipation,or expectation that in the event of a payment event,they would receive a share of the profits because their interests were entirely dependent upon the economic decisions of spirit.aplee.br.this suggests that a contingent interest can not become property of the bankruptcy estate unless the contingency is entirely in the control of the interest holder.such a rule amounts to nothing more than a statement that virtually no contingent interest can be property of the bankruptcy position that clearly conflicts with our precedent.as discussed above,debtors interest in the sars is similar to an employee interest in stock options.as long as the employee had a legal interest in the options prior to filing for bankruptcy,the options are sufficiently rooted in the past to become part of the bankruptcy estate.in re allen.that vesting of the options is contingent on a term of condition that is not exclusively within the employees not remove this interest from the bankruptcy estate.see,in re wick,cir noting that unvested options contingent on continued employment are property of the estate because those that require additional services or those that may defeat the right to enjoyment of the not bar a property interest from becoming part of the estate.like stock options,the fact that the sars are contingent on events does not mean that debtors interest in them is not rooted in the past.
neither the parties nor the courts below found any cases with similar facts.instead they rely on contingent employee benefits cases where a program entitling the debtor to payment is in existence before the debtor files for bankruptcy and the eventual payment to the debtor is contingent on several factors,employment for a certain amount of time or profitability of the company.these cases help illustrate when a contingent interest is rooted in the past and when the interest is so speculative that it was a mere expectancy at the time the bankruptcy petition was filed.
one line of cases concludes that contingent interests are property of the bankruptcy estate even if the rights do not accrue or are uncertain until a date after the bankruptcy filing.see booth vaughn,cir in re edmonds,aff.the booth court applied a broad reading of.there,the cba provided that hourly workers would receive a payout at the end of the year if the employer made a profit and the employee was employed through year end.at.booth filed for bankruptcy before a profit was realized and before the end of the year.id.at.the court determined that the right to the bonus was a contingent interest that was property of the estate.similarly,in edmonds,the cba provided that ford employees would receive a payout at the end of the year if ford made a profit and the employee was employed at the end of the year.at.edmonds filed for bankruptcy on december.id.noting that plaintiff had worked all but a few of the days necessary to become entitled to his profit sharing,the court held that the profit sharing payment is sufficiently rooted in the past to be property of the estate under a.id.at.thus,contingencies like continued employment and company profit do not transform the employee interest into a mere expectancy that is excluded from the bankruptcy estate when the interest is rooted in the past.
the bap majority cited a second line of cases where employee bonuses were excluded from the bankruptcy estate.see in re chappo,sharp dery,vogel palmer.in vogel,palmer was entitled to receive a bonus if he was employed on a date almost six months after the filing of his bankruptcy petition,he performed his job satisfactorily,and most importantly,the company chief executive officer determined palmer was entitled to a bonus.at.because the award of the bonus was purely discretionary,the court held that palmer interest was nothing more than a potential of receiving an award.id.at.in sharp,sharp was eligible for a bonus if he was employed in good standing when the company issued the bonus checks.at.the timing of any bonus checks was at the employer sole discretion,and the employer had the right to amend,suspend,or terminate the bonus plan at any time.id.sharp filed for bankruptcy on december and received his bonus in february.id.the court noted that under michigan law,a worker does not have an enforceable right in bonus dividends before payment.id.at.the court concluded that on the date he filed for bankruptcy,sharp had no legal interest in the bonus check he later received on february because his employer could have decided not to pay any bonus at all under the terms of the bonus plan itself.id.at.finally,chappo presents similar facts and an identical outcome.at.citing sharp and vogel,the court noted that the bonus plan contained dispositive characteristic s the plan provided that the board of directors at any time may terminate or modify the plan or suspend any of its provisions and the bonus plan committee could determine in its sole discretion not to make an award to a particular participant or group of participants or to all participants for any plan year.id.at.at bottom,this line of cases suggests that an employer promise to pay a bonus is not enforceable where the employer reserves the right to withhold payment at its discretion.thus,the employee had no right to the bonus at the time the bankruptcy petition was filed.accordingly,the employee interest in the bonus was a mere expectancy and should not be part of the bankruptcy estate.
we believe the sars created by the cba are more akin to the contingent property rights described in the former line of cases than the mere expectancies based on discretionary bonuses described in the latter.spirit had a contractual obligation to make payments if the ipo occurred.this obligation existed before debtors filed for bankruptcy debtors interest in the sars are sufficiently rooted in the past.the sars are properly part of the bankruptcy estate under.
i respectfully dissent.i would affirm the judgment of the bankruptcy court.the debtors interests in the stock appreciation rights sars were too uncertain to be included within their bankruptcy estates.
background.
almost all the relevant facts are noted in the majority opinion,and i will only mention facts that seem most critical to me.as noted in the majority opinion,the sars at issue here were given for a fifteen year term op.at,while spirit told the eligible employees,including debtors,that it was using a period in planning,which implied that spirit believed it likely that a payment event would probably occur within five years,if it were to occur.
the bankruptcy judge found that spirit had absolute discretion whether to sell,merge,or publicly offer stock,which were the three ways that a payment event could occur.parks dittmar in re dittmar,cir quoting bankruptcy court interim order.and there was a further contingency that applied to any of these three possible routes to issuance of the sars the payment event would first have to result in at least a fifteen per cent annual profit to the initial equity investors.
the framework for the analysis.
the majority opinion outlines for the analysis first,whether the debtors have a property interest in the sars under kansas law second,whether the interest existed at the time the debtors filed their petitions and third,whether the property interests are property of the bankruptcy estate under.op.at.this seems to be correct,but applying the approach in this context presents a real challenge.
were the interests recognized as property under state law 
on the first the benefits are an interest in property under kansas have previously held that as a general rule contingent interests are property in kansas.kirby united states in re allen.truck lines,cir.the property in that case was a contractual right.the bankrupt,a trucking company,had agreed to sell its certificate of convenience and necessity to another,with part of the consideration having been paid at the time of the agreement and the remainder to be paid upon approval of the transfer by the state agency with authority over the matter.bankruptcy was declared before the sale had been completed.and before the bankruptcy petition was filed,the irs had notified the buyer of the certificate that it claimed a tax lien on the payment contingently owed to the trucking company.the bankruptcy trustee challenged the tax lien,arguing that there was no property to which the lien could attach.
on appeal,we held in favor of the irs.the parties did not dispute that the certificate itself was property under kansas law.the bankruptcy trustee,however,argued that because the contested balance of the payment for the certificate was not due unti
