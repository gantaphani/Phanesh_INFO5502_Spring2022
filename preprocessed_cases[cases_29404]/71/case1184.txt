this matter is before the court on appellees petition for rehearing en banc.the members of the hearing panel have determined that it is appropriate to revise section iii a b ii of the opinion.the panel therefore grants rehearing in part,withdraws the opinion filed on july,vacates the judgment,and substitutes the modified opinion attached to this order.
the petition for rehearing en banc was transmitted to all of the judges of the court who are in regular active service.as no member of the panel and no judge in regular active service on the court requested that the court be polled,the petition is denied.
a number of german citizens were defrauded when they attempted to invest in united states securities.assets were obtained from the perpetrators of the fraud to create a receivership estate to compensate the victims.the united states has claimed that the estate is a qualified settlement fund qsf that is liable for income taxes on its earnings.the district court ruled that the fund did not satisfy the criteria to be a qsf,and the united states appealed.we reverse.
background 
hans kuhlen and douglas brown managed or controlled various businesses the businesses that were involved in a scheme to market securities to investors.the businesses contracted with hundreds of german citizens for the purchase of securities in the united states.an fbi investigation produced evidence that brown,kuhlen,and several of the businesses had wrongfully represented that the securities they offered were regulated and insured by the national association of securities dealers and the securities investor protection corporation,freely transferable,and traded on recognized exchanges.the fbi also found evidence that some of the businesses were dealing in securities without obtaining the appropriate registrations,were misleading their clients as to the history of one of the businesses,and were falsely representing one of the businesses as a investment bank.
the fbi obtained a search warrant for the premises of one of the businesses,wellshire services,wellshire,and seized a number of stock certificates.wellshire then moved under rule e of the federal rules of criminal procedure for return of some of the seized property,including stock certificates that belonged to german investors.the court initially allowed stock certificates to be released to wellshire upon proof that its customers were entitled to possession.but the court halted release of the stock when it suspected that wellshire had fabricated claims and did not own or control as many shares of stock as it had sold.
brown,kuhlen,and five of the businesses were later indicted for securities fraud and related offenses.the indictment sought forfeiture of any and all property,real and personal,involved in the offenses,and any and all property traceable to such property.at.both brown and wellshire entered into stipulations with the united states whereby they released their claims to certain property and placed that property in a fund designed to provide restitution to the defrauded investors.two other businesses entered into similar stipulations desert mountain properties,stipulated to the sale of a residence and its furnishings and the brown family trust relinquished its claims to the proceeds of a sale of stock seized by the united states.the proceeds of the sales were added to the restitutionary fund.
to make a claim on the fund,a wellshire customer needed to complete a form that asked the customer to i dentify each stock or security purchased,the number of shares purchased,the purchase price per share,the date of purchase,the amount paid for the shares,and whether the investor had received the shares purchased.id.at.the form announced a deadline for submitting claims.
the united states asked that a receiver be appointed b ecause of the complex nature of the interests involved and the fact that the interests of the investors could potentially conflict with respect to some assets.id.at.the district court granted the united states request,appointing steven call the receiver.at the same time,the court identified the receivership estate the estate as a ll property then held by the united states of america its agencies or employees in connection with the case,including but not limited to the assets of wellshire securities its principles sic or affiliated entities which were seized.id.at.the court authorized the receiver to endorse,sell transfer all of the securities in his possession for the benefit of the estate,and to liquidate any securities belonging to the estate that are in the possession of other brokers.id.at.
the receiver proceeded to gather and liquidate the estate assets,which included not only cash,stocks,and real estate,but also art,wine,and furniture.ultimately,the receiver was successful in converting most of the estate assets to cash.at one point the estate value exceeded.nevertheless,the receiver reported that the total assets held in the e state are worth less than of the total claims filed against the e state.rec.br.at.
although some claimants suggested that the receiver distribute the seized stock certificates or the proceeds of their sale directly to the owners of each particular certificate,the receiver rejected this suggestion as contrary to the court earlier order directing him to sell and not return stock.at.instead,the receiver suggested that the claimants share based upon the amount of their allowed claim.id.
almost two years after the estate was established,the irs submitted a proof of claim stating that the estate owed taxes in the amount of plus interest.the original proof of claim identified the estate as a designated settlement fund dsf,but an amended version identified it as a qualified settlement fund qsf.the receiver objected to the proof of claim on the ground that the estate was not taxable as either a dsf or qsf.
the court then ordered appointment of a special master the master to recommend a final resolution of all claims asserted against the estate,including the tax claim.after briefing and argument the master issued a report concluding that the estate was not a qsf and recommending denial of the tax claim.the district court adopted the master report and recommendation.
the united states appeals.appellees are the receiver and the group claimants claimants,a set of claimants for whom the district court appointed counsel.the group claimants,who had separate counsel,have settled and are not parties on appeal.
ii.jurisdiction 
in the order being appealed,the district court addressed the irs tax claim without addressing the individual claims of the investors.we entered a order directing the parties to file memoranda regarding the appealability of the district court order,because only final orders are appealable as of right,and,in general,an order is not final unless it disposes of all remaining claims,see ashley creek phosphate chevron usa,cir.in their memoranda the parties agreed that immediate appeal was available under the collateral order doctrine.see cohen beneficial indus.loan.the jurisdictional issue was then referred to the merits panel.before we heard oral argument,however,the parties asked the district court to certify its order as final and appealable under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court,by order dated may,issued the requested certification.
on appeal neither party questions our jurisdiction.nor do we.if the district court original order was not a final order under the collateral order doctrine,it became a final order when the district court properly certified it under rule b.after obtaining certification under rule b,a party need not file a second notice of appeal.w e will deem the notice of appeal to ripen as of the date of certification and will accept jurisdiction pursuant to the savings provision of fed.a.lewis goodrich,cir en banc.our jurisdiction being secure,no further discussion is necessary.
iii.the merits 
the united states claims that the estate is a taxable entity,subject to tax as a qsf on any income generated by assets in the estate.appellees,on the other hand,dispute that the estate is a qsf,arguing,in essence,that the estate assets should be treated as if owned by the claimants to whom those assets will ultimately be distributed.because those claimants are german citizens,a treaty exempts them from united states taxes on capital gains and other investment income.thus,the stakes are high.
treasury regulation,entitled qualified settlement funds,and accompanying regulations,and constitute an effort to deal with the various tax questions that arise when an independent settlement fund is created to pay a debtor liabilities.the proper approach to taxation of financial transactions involving such a fund is not immediately apparent.the transactions could be treated as if the assets still belonged to the person who contributed the assets to the fund or as if the assets belonged to those to whom the assets would ultimately be distributed,or the fund itself could be treated as a taxpayer that owns the assets.other questions that may arise include when can a debtor who contributes to the fund take a tax deduction for its contribution assuming that the contribution is otherwise deductible when the payment is made into the fund,when a claimant receives payment,or at some other time or when does the claimant recognize income see generally ellen harrison gary wilcox,settlement fund final regs.answer many questions,but problems still exist,tax ellen harrison,irs fills void on tax treatment of settlement funds with generally favorable rules,tax.
in this case,treatment of the estate as a qsf appears to provide no benefit to those who contributed to the estate or those who will receive distributions from it only the irs stands to gain.but often treatment of a settlement fund as a qsf benefits a taxpayer.for example,one who contributes funds to a qsf may be able to take a deduction that would otherwise not be available until the funds are distributed to claimants.see c.in the following discussion it will be helpful to keep in mind that the qsf regulations were designed to cover a host of circumstances,not just the specific,and rather unusual,circumstances presented here.
section c defines a qsf as follows 
a fund,account,or trust satisfies the requirements of this paragraph c if 
it is established pursuant to an order of,or is approved by,the united states,any state including the district of columbia,territory,possession,or political subdivision thereof,or any agency or instrumentality including a court of law of any of the foregoing and is subject to the continuing jurisdiction of that governmental authority 
it is established to resolve or satisfy one or more contested or uncontested claims that have resulted or may result from an event or related series of events that has occurred and that has given rise to at least one claim asserting liability a rising out of a tort,breach of contract,or violation of law and 
the fund,account,or trust is a trust under applicable state law,or its assets are otherwise segregated from other assets of the transferor and related persons.
the united states contends that the estate is a qsf within this definition because the estate was established by a court order the purpose of the estate is to pay claims arising out of fraudulent transactions in violation of the securities laws and the estate assets are segregated from the assets of all other persons.appellees bear the burden of establishing the error in the irs determination of the tax due.see dolese comm r,cir.
appellees mount numerous attacks some by both appellees and some by only one on the contention that the estate should be treated as a qsf.first,they argue that the estate does not satisfy the regulation criteria for being a qsf.although they concede that the estate satisfies the requirements of subparagraph of c,they raise objections concerning the other subparagraphs.with respect to subparagraph,they claim that the court order was inadequate to establish a qsf because the order did not conform to a local court rule.and as for subparagraph,they argue that the estate does not resolve or satisfy claims because it will not extinguish them,and that none of the liabilities at issue here is the type of liability what we will call a predicate liability which a fund must resolve or satisfy for it to be a qsf.appellees further assert that the estate can not be a qsf because it does not have a transferor,as implicitly required by the regulations,and that a proposed treasury regulation indicates that funds like the estate are not meant to be treated as qsfs.
next,appellees challenge the validity of the regulations.they contend that the statute authorizing the qsf regulations is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power,that the qsf regulations go beyond what is permitted by the authorizing statute,and that the regulations can not be applied here because such application would violate a united states treaty with germany.finally,they argue that the estate should be taxed as a liquidating grantor trust and that its capital gains should be offset by the investors losses.
we now address each of the arguments.we review the district court interpretation of federal statutes and regulations de novo tribe of indian gaming comm n,cir internal citation omitted.the pertinent facts are undisputed.
does the estate satisfy the qsf criteria 
subparagraph 
a fund satisfies subparagraph of c if i t is established pursuant to an order of a court of law appellees do not dispute that the estate was established by an order of the district court.but claimants contend that the order could not have created a qsf because it did not conform to district of utah local rule b,which states 
order of the court.a designated or qualified settlement fund will be established by the clerk only on order of the court on motion and stipulation by all parties or on acceptance by the court of the terms of the settlement agreement.the court reserves the authority to designate its own outside fund administrator.
utah civ.b.they note that the estate was not created as a qsf by stipulation or settlement of all parties,as the local rule appears to require.
although we doubt that a local court rule could alter the requirements for a fund to be a qsf,we need not decide the matter.rule b is inapplicable here.it is merely a provision within local rule,which governs the deposit,receipt,and subsequent treatment of court registry funds,see utah civ.as does.the assets of the estate,however,were not deposited into the district court registry,but were held by the united states.
subparagraph 
the united states contends that the estate satisfies subparagraph of c because it was established to resolve or satisfy one or more contested or uncontested claims that have resulted or may result from an event or related series of events that has occurred and that has given rise to at least one claim asserting liability a rising out of a tort,breach of contract,or violation of law.reg.c.appellees challenge that contention on two grounds.one ground,supported by alternative arguments,is that the estate can not be a qsf because it does not extinguish the estate has far too little money to compensate the claimants fully and the claimants are not required to release anyone from liability.the alternative arguments are that one can not resolve or satisfy a claim without extinguishing it,and that the liabilities at issue are for the provision of services or property,and the regulations explicitly require that a fund extinguish those liabilities if it is to be considered a qsf.their second ground is that the liabilities at issue here can not be predicate liabilities for a qsf,because they do not a ris e out of a tort,breach of contract,or other violation of law,and are of a type explicitly excluded by the regulation from being predicate liabilities.we now address their arguments.
failure to extinguish liabilities 
i resolve or satisfy 
claimants assert that the estate can not resolve or satisfy claims unless the claims are extinguished,either by full payment or release.the united states concedes that a claim can not be satisfied unless it is extinguished and that distributions from the estate will neither fully pay the victims claims nor result in releases from liability by the victims.it argues,however,that resolve in this context means only to reach a decision about.
we take a different approach.subparagraph requires that a qsf be established to resolve or satisfy one or more claims.reg.c.in our view,the words established to are the key.when we say that a program has been established to do something,we do not necessarily mean that the program will fully accomplish that task,or even that we expect the task to be fully accomplished.we may be merely stating the aim,the direction,of the program.one could say that the war on poverty was established to eradicate poverty or that the united nations was established to end military conflict,even though partial success would be considered a victory.more closely in point,mediation programs,even settlement conferences,can be said to be established to settle disputes yet no one expects all disputes to be settled,and partial resolution would be welcome.
of course,an institution established to do something may invariably accomplish that task.courts are established to resolve disputes and,for better or worse,they do so.the point here is only that the phrase established to resolve or satisfy claims is ambiguous.it may mean that all claims are to be resolved or satisfied or it may mean only that the institution is directed toward that end,and partial resolution or satisfaction,or even failure,is a potential result.to determine the meaning of this ambiguous language,we look for clues elsewhere in the regulations.see oxy usa,babbitt,cir en banc court deciphers the meaning of a particular statutory provision by considering the language and structure of the statute as a whole.
one compelling clue comes from the section of the regulations dealing with liabilities for the provision of services or property.the section general rule is that such a liability can not be the predicate liability for a qsf unless the fund extinguishes the liability,although there is a limited exception for liabilities under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla.the language is as follows 
resolve or satisfy requirement liabilities to provide services or property.except as otherwise provided in subsection below,a liability is not described in paragraph c of this section the section describing the requirement generally if it is a liability for the provision of services or property,unless the transferor obligation to provide services or property is extinguished by a transfer or transfers to the fund,account,or trust.
cercla liabilities.a transferor liability under cercla to provide services or property is described in paragraph c of this section if following its transfer to a fund,account or trust the transferor only remaining liability to the environmental protection agency if any is a remote,future obligation to provide services or property.
reg.f emphasis added.that the drafters chose specifically to require extinguishment when the transferor has an obligation to provide services or property suggests that extinguishment is not generally required.indeed,if we were to reach the opposite the phrase resolve or satisfy creates a requirement for all predicate specific requirement would be rendered superfluous,a result to be avoided,see oxy usa,at we must avoid,whenever possible,a statutory interpretation that would render superfluous other provisions in the same enactment.internal quotation marks omitted.
claimants respond that because a fund does not need to extinguish completely a transferor liability for the provision of services or property when that liability arises under cercla,the drafters found it necessary to reiterate in the provision that complete extinguishment is generally required.a dispositive problem with this theory,however,is that the purported clarification comes before the exception has been announced.we can not believe that the drafters were so obtuse.
moreover,there is a reason why the regulations distinguish between obligations to pay money and obligations to provide services or property.as the irs explained when the final qsf regulations were promulgated,paragraph f was added to maintain consistency with the general rules set forth in regarding when an taxpayer can claim a deduction.see settlement funds.under h b a liability of the taxpayer to provide property or services is not incurred until the taxpayer provides such property or services.so,for example,a taxpayer that assumes in an obligation to remove a drilling platform in does not incur the removal cost until the actual removal in,even if it prepaid most of the removal cost to a service company in.see reg.d ex.
example in the regulation also illustrates that extinguishment is not generally required.e xamples set forth in regulations remain persuasive authority so long as they do not conflict with the regulations themselves.cook comm r,cir.the example states 
in a class action brought in a united states federal district court,the court holds that the defendant,corporation x,violated certain securities laws and must pay damages in the amount of million.pursuant to an order of the court,corporation x transfers million in cash and transfers property with a fair market value of million to a state law trust.the trust will liquidate the property and distribute the cash proceeds to the plaintiffs in the class action.the trust is a qualified settlement fund because it was established pursuant to the order of a federal district court to resolve or satisfy claims against corporation x for securities law violations that have occurred.
reg.k.significantly,the trust was a qsf despite the deposit of million less than the court had awarded.claimants seek to avoid the import of this example by arguing that because the assets in the example were transferred p ursuant to an order of the court,the defendant satisfied or discharged the judgment and would have been insulated from actions to recover the remaining million under.b.they suggest that the deficiency was attributable to a compromise in lieu of an appeal,or the corporation lack of additional assets.claimants argument,however,is founded on pure speculation.example nowhere states that the court ordered the transfer of only million,that the parties compromised,or that corporation x lacked sufficient assets to satisfy the entire judgment.nor can we see any reason for the example to speak of a million payment,rather than the full million,if the million fully absolved the defendant of liability.we can only infer that the drafters created the million deficiency specifically to illustrate that a fund can qualify as a qsf even if it does not completely extinguish a transferor liability.
reinforcing our conclusion further is a comparison of the qsf regulations with the earlier statute creating the entity known as a designated settlement fund dsf,an entity which we will have reason to discuss later in more detail.the statute provides that to be a dsf,a fund must both have the principal purpose of resolving and satisfying claims,d d,and extinguish completely the taxpayer tort liability with respect to those claims,id.d a.if extinguish completely and resolve and satisfy were synonymous,there would have been no need to include both phrases in the dsf statute.and if resolve and satisfy does not necessarily mean completely extinguish in the dsf statute,it is logical to conclude that resolve or satisfy,the phrase used in the qsf regulations,also stands for something less than complete extinguishment.
in light of the section,example,and the dsf statute,we hold that the qsf regulations do not create a requirement.thus,the estate can still be a qsf even though the victims will not be completely compensated for their injuries and their claims may therefore survive.
ii liability for the provision of services or property 
as previously noted,a liability for the provision of services or property can not be the predicate liability for a qsf unless the transferor obligation to provide services or property is extinguished by a transfer or transfers to the purported qsf.reg.f.the receiver contends that this provision applies when the basis of liability underlying the claim arises from the sale of property or services.rec.br.at.because the victims claims arise out of the sale of securities and the provision of brokerage services,he reasons,they would therefore come within the provision.
we disagree.paragraph f does not speak of the source of the liability.rather,it comes into play when the transferor has an obligation to provide services or property.perhaps there was at one time an obligation with respect to some of the victims to provide them with the securities they had paid for,but that is not the obligation addressed by the estate.after the plan to return securities to wellshire on behalf of the victims was terminated,the estate was created to compensate the victims for their financial losses.the obligations being satisfied at least in part by the estate were the obligations to refund the purchase price of the securities.the estate purpose was not to pay for services or property to be provided to the victims.therefore,paragraph f is not applicable.
predicate liabilities 
appellees contend that the liabilities here do not a ris e out of a tort,breach of contract,or violation of law,as required by reg.c,and are in fact liabilities excluded by g.
i arising out of a tort,breach of contract,or violation of law 
on the first point,appellees appear to argue as follows the claims here sound in restitution,since the sole purpose is to refund,to the extent possible,the victims original investments and a cause of action for restitution does not arise out of a tort,breach of contract,or violation of law.we are not persuaded.we agree that the victims have a cause of action for restitution often called unjust enrichment.but even if liability for unjust enrichment does not come within the language of the qsf regulations,an issue we need not address,the fact that the victims have such claims is unimportant because a claim for unjust enrichment can coexist with a claim sounding in tort,contract,or violation of law.see,restatement third of restitution and unjust enrichment cmt.a tentative draft,in the case of a contractual transfer,the consequences of fraudulent inducement may be simultaneously a part of contract law and of the law of restitution.here,the fraudulent transactions give rise not only to claims for unjust enrichment,but also to claims in fraud and contract,as well as claims for securities fraud.and for each of these claims a potential remedy is refunding the amount of the original investment.see dan dobbs,law of remedies ed fraud id.contract id.securities fraud.thus,the victims claims result from event s that ha ve given rise to claim s asserting liability a rising out of a tort,breach of contract,or violation of law.reg.c.
ii excluded liabilities 
as for appellees claim that the qsf regulations explicitly exclude the liabilities here from being the predicate for treating the estate as a qsf,they rely on the exclusions in reg.g g.
before addressing each exclusion,we reject the receiver suggestion that the united states waived its right to respond to these and other arguments when it did not discuss them in its opening brief.these arguments do not relate to the basis of the district court ruling they raise potential alternative grounds for affirming that ruling.when an appellee raises in its answer brief an alternative ground for affirmance,the appellant is entitled to respond in its reply brief.see sadeghi ins,cir.
section g excludes obligation s to refund the purchase price of,or to repair or replace,products regularly sold in the ordinary course of the transferor trade or business.in our view,this provision does not apply here because the word products,as used in the provision,refers to tangible goods,not intangibles like investments in securities.this is one of the common usages of the word.see,restatement third of torts products liability a a product is tangible personal property distributed commercially for use or consumption.warranty act the term consumer product means any tangible personal property which is distributed in commerce and which is normally used for personal,family,or household purposes.and this usage fits the context.consider the three obligations referenced in the provision.certainly,businesses do not repair intangibles,and an obligation to replace one is rare,if not nonexistent.to be sure,there are occasions,as in this case,when a business can incur an obligation to refund the purchase price of an intangible.but this provision was intended to prevent taxpayers from taking advantage of favorable tax treatment of qsfs when dealing with certain regularly recurring liabilities,settlement funds,and any enterprise that regularly incurs obligations to refund the purchase price of intangibles obligations that are most likely to result from fraud or a statutory violation is better referred to as a racket than by the regulation terms trade or business.
if the intent were to include intangibles,we believe the drafters would have used language specifically conveying that meaning.we note that in the immediately preceding paragraph,the drafters used the word property.see f liabilities to provide services or property.use of the word product in paragraph g suggests a narrower focus.the liabilities here do not arise out of the sale of tangible goods and are therefore not encompassed by this provision.
in their petition for rehearing en banc,appellees argue that certificated securities are tangible.but the enterprises of brown and kuhlen were not in the business of selling stock certificates they were selling investments.we are confident that g does not apply to the circumstances of this case.in re oakley,cir currency is not tangible property for purposes of indiana debtor exemptions.
turning to g,it excludes obligation s of the transferor to make payments to its general trade creditors or debtholders that relate to a title or similar case.as the united states acknowledges,a receivership is a similar case.see a a ii.nevertheless,the victims are neither general trade creditors nor debtholders of any of the perpetrators of the fraud or their enterprises.
addressing first the term general trade creditors,the word general,when used to modify creditor,simply means unsecured.see black law dictionary ed.and the term trade creditors refers to those to whom a debt is owed for the provision of goods or perhaps goods or services used in the conduct of one business.see,david pearce,the dictionary of modern economics trade credit is c redit extended by a trader or producer to his customers through terms of sale which allow payment at some time after the actual transfer of the goods pt,supp.i,a federal reserve board official staff interpretation of regulation b,relating to the equal credit opportunity act,states the term trade credit generally is limited to a financing arrangement that involves a buyer and a as a supplier who finances the sale of equipment,supplies,or inventory shock robert shock,the wall street dictionary trade credit is a n account that a supplier keeps for the company buying its goods or services in re stratford of texas,cir their indebtedness was to trade creditors,suppliers of goods and services for these operations.thus,the victims are not general trade creditors.
as for the term debtholders,it does not refer to just any creditors owed a debt,but only to those who hold a debt instrument.see gretchen morgenson campbell harvey,the new york times dictionary of money and investing.the victims are not debtholders.
our rejection of an overly expansive interpretation of the terms general trade creditors and debtholders is supported by the statement in the final regulations that liabilities are not excluded from the coverage of the qsf regulations just because they are associated with a title or similar case 
the final regulations exclude claims of general trade creditors and debtholders that relate to a title or similar case,or to a workout.however,qualified settlement fund treatment remains available for other liabilities such as tort liabilities irrespective of whether the liability,for example,relates to a title case.
settlement funds.in sum,appellees can not find relief in g.
other arguments that the fu
