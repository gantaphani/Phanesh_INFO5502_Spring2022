in,the commodity futures trading commission filed a complaint alleging that esfand baragosh was a controlling person of noble wealth data information services and several related companies collectively noble wealth,which operated as a sham futures exchange in violation of the commodity exchange act.see et.west,amended by commodity futures modernization act cfma,stat.the district court entered a default judgment against the companies and subsequently granted summary judgment to the commission against baragosh.the court ordered baragosh to make restitution of plus pre and interest,and assessed a civil penalty of plus interest against him.cftc noble wealth data info,d.the court also issued several injunctions against baragosh.on appeal,baragosh argues that the commission lacked jurisdiction to regulate noble wealth activities,and,in any event,that he was not a controlling person of noble wealth and therefore is not liable for noble wealth illegal activities.we affirm in part,and vacate and remand in part.
noble wealth,which was incorporated in california in,has never been designated as a contract market for the trading of foreign currency futures contracts nor ever registered with the commission in any capacity.in,the company opened an office in atlanta,georgia,and began to operate the foreign currency trading scam at issue in this suit.in,it expanded the scam by opening an office in bethesda,maryland and it expanded again in,to a third office in duluth,georgia.
to lure its victims,noble wealth placed help wanted ads in general circulation newspapers,claiming that it was looking for persons to be trained to become consultants.those who replied were invited to visit noble wealth,and ultimately encouraged to attend a training program.the program consisted of four sessions,each no longer than two hours,during which videotapes describing investment strategies and the mechanics of trading currency through noble wealth were shown.trainees were told that they could become traders by opening an account of or more with noble wealth,and were urged to solicit their families and friends to open accounts and become customers of noble wealth.
to whet the trainees appetites,noble wealth distributed brochures informing them that its traders had earned returns as high as in a few days,in one month,in three months,and in six months.the brochures explained that these exceptional returns were possible because noble wealth had contacts in the interbank market,allowing it to offer the best quotation for clients all over the world.assertedly,trades would be placed through noble wealth hong kong subsidiary noble wealth hk,which the brochures described as a licensed financial brokerage house with daily turnovers in excess of million dollars.finally,the brochures promised that customer accounts would be overseen by highly trained investment consultants.
those who opened an account were entitled to use noble wealth trading floor,where rows of computer monitors were set up to display current prices of various foreign currencies.when a trader saw a desirable price,he or she completed a noble wealth order ticket describing the number of contracts to be bought or sold,the foreign currency to be traded,and the price reflected on the computer monitor.the trader brought the ticket to a noble wealth employee called a dealer,who assertedly called noble wealth hk for a price quote and then relayed the quote to the trader.if the trader accepted the price,the dealer completed the order ticket by filling in the execution price for the trade.periodically,noble wealth issued detailed account statements,which purported to track commissions,fees,and movements in the value of customer contracts.
this was all an elaborate hoax.noble wealth hk was not a licensed brokerage house,and there is no evidence that noble wealth actually purchased any foreign currency contracts that corresponded to customer orders.rather,as baragosh testified at the hearing in which the commission sought a preliminary injunction,noble wealth maryland office passed its traders currency contract orders to a head dealer at noble wealth hk who attempted to match customer buy and sell orders every half hour.in other words,noble wealth operated a bucket shop,taking the opposite side of a customer order rather than openly and competitively executing the order on an exchange.noble wealth customers lost the bulk of the funds they invested,which were diverted to pay operating expenses,salaries and commissions,and the personal expenses of noble wealth employees.
baragosh oversaw training and recruitment at the georgia and maryland offices.he placed noble wealth help wanted ads,appeared in its training videos,walked the floor advising the traders on strategy,and exhorted traders to trade,trade,trade.in return,baragosh received a personal commission of two dollars for every trade executed at noble wealth.
the commission charged and the district court found that baragosh and the companies had misappropriated customer funds and committed fraud in violation of a i iii bucketed customer orders in violation of a iv and offered to sell commodity futures contracts other than on a board of trade designated as a contract market in violation of a.only baragosh appeals.
baragosh principal contention on appeal is that congress did not intend noble wealth admittedly fraudulent activities to be regulated by the commodity exchange act cea or the act.resolving this question requires an understanding of the cea history and purpose.
from its enactment in through all periods material to this case,the cea required futures contracts on certain commodities to be traded only on public exchanges,termed contract markets.see commodity exchange act,stat,amending grain futures act,stat.compare a west same.see also lynn stout,why the law hates speculators regulation and private ordering in the market for otc derivatives,duke.contract markets,in turn,were required to conduct business according to standards set forth in the act.two of those standards are important in this case.
first,the cea contained measures designed to protect both small investors and the market as a whole.see cea,stat.at making it unlawful for persons associated with a contract market to cheat or defraud,willfully to make or cause to be made any false report or statement or false record,or willfully to deceive or attempt to deceive by any means whatsoever.these measures complemented and strengthened existing provisions that already applied to futures trading in grain markets.see grain futures act,c,stat.at requiring contract markets to adopt internal rules prevent ing dissemination by the board or any member thereof,of false or misleading or knowingly inaccurate reports concerning crop or market information or conditions that affect or tend to affect the price of grain.
second,the cea made it unlawful for any member of a contract market to bucket an order.see cea d,stat.at.bucketing is commonly done by a bucket shop a business that allows customers to speculate on movements in commodity prices by entering into contracts with the shop rather than by finding a trading partner on the floor of an exchange.see armando belly,the derivative market in foreign currencies and the commodity exchange status of futures contracts,tul.in effect,a bucket shop assumes the risk of the transaction that would be assumed by the market in an exchange transaction.id.such shops are viable only so long as they maintain a rough balance between the value of their buy and sell contracts and customers pay any debts they owe.when a shop miscalculates,as inevitably occurs,its owners are likely to close shop without settling accounts.id.in the first decades of the twentieth century,the common law disfavored bucket shops by refusing to enforce their contracts with speculators,and many state legislatures imposed civil or criminal penalties on bucket shop operators.stout,why the law hates speculators,duke at.federal law effectively banned bucket shops from grain futures trading beginning in,see future trading act,a,stat.grain futures act,stat.at,and the cea extended the prohibition to several new commodity markets.william stein,the exchange trading requirement of the commodity exchange act,vand,reviewing history of bucket shop prohibition.
in,the cea provision and its new rules were amended,so that they applied not only to persons associated with contract markets but also to any person s acting in or in connection with any order to make,or the making of futures contracts in a regulated commodity.see an act to amend the commodity exchange act,a,stat,emphasis added,relevant sections codified as amended at a i iv.
over time,the number of covered commodities was also enlarged.when it was first enacted in,the cea applied only to futures markets in a few agricultural commodities,such as grain,butter,eggs,and irish potatoes.cea a,stat.at.over the next several decades,congress expanded the act reach commodity by commodity wool tops in fats and oils,cottonseed,cottonseed meal,peanuts,soybeans,and soybean meal in wool in onions in and livestock,livestock products,and frozen concentrated orange juice in.belly,derivative market in foreign currencies,tul.at.by,congress decided that the growing importance of futures markets merited a comprehensive regime of regulation.see,reprinted in,noting that many large and important futures markets we re completely unregulated by the federal government and that the value of futures trading had already substantially exceed ed the value of securities trading on the various stock exchanges.
therefore,the legislature modified the cea in two important respects.first,congress expanded the cea jurisdiction to include futures trading on all other goods and articles and all services,rights and interests in which contracts for futures delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.commodity futures trading commission act of,stat,amending cea currently codified at west supp.second,congress created a new commission,the commodity futures trading commission,invested with broad power to enforce the act.see merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,curran,d noting that the commission was authorized to investigate complaints and grant reparations for violations of the law seek injunctive relief alter or supplement a contract market rules and direct a contract market to take whatever action was deemed necessary by the commission in an emergency.according to the house committee on agriculture,these changes were intended to significantly increase public confidence in the futures markets by providing the same protection to the unregulated commodity customers that is now afforded the regulated commodity customers,at.
citing the same objective,the senate expressly identified foreign currency futures trading as an activity it intended to bring within the act 
while the futures markets in a number of agricultural commodities have been regulated in varying degrees since,many large and important futures markets are completely unregulated by the federal government.these include the highly sensitive silver market and markets in a number of foreign currencies.a person trading in one of these unregulated futures markets should receive the same protection afforded to those trading in the regulated markets.
reprinted in at emphasis added.while the bill was pending,however,the department of treasury sent a letter to the senate committee with jurisdiction over the bill,expressing concern about the effect that cea regulation could have on one part of the foreign currency futures market.the letter advised the committee that 
v irtually all trading in foreign currencies in the united states is carried on through an informal network of banks and dealers.this dealer market,which consists primarily of the large banks,has proved highly efficient in serving the needs of international business in hedging the risks that stem from foreign exchange rate movements.the participants in this market are sophisticated and informed institutions,unlike the participants on organized exchanges,which,in some cases,include individuals and small traders who may need to be protected by some form of governmental regulation.
id.at emphasis in original.
treasury argued that regulation by the new commission would only burden and confuse traders in the informal dealer market without improving market fairness or transparency.id.at.to protect this segment of the market,treasury proposed an amendment that would make clear that the commission jurisdiction over foreign currency futures was limited to organized exchanges.id.at.the suggested amendment provided,in pertinent part,that n othing in this act shall be deemed to govern or in any way be applicable to transactions in foreign currency unless such transactions involve the sale thereof for future delivery conducted on a board of trade.id.
it appears that the senate committee was persuaded.except to delete puts and calls for securities from the list of exempted transactions,the committee accepted the proposed language without change so that the text adopted has come to be known as the treasury amendment.in its report,the committee repeatedly stated that the amendment was intended to protect banks and other sophisticated traders by exempting all foreign currency transactions not on organized exchanges 
t he committee amendment provides that interbank trading of foreign currencies and specified financial instruments is not subject to commission regulation 
also,the committee included an amendment to clarify that the provisions of the bill are not applicable to trading in foreign currencies and certain enumerated financial instruments unless such trading is conducted on a formally organized futures exchange.a great deal of the trading in foreign currency in the united states is carried out through an informal network of banks and tellers.the committee believes that this market is more properly supervised by the bank regulatory agencies and that,therefore,regulation under this legislation is unnecessary.
likewise,the committee believes that regulation by the commission of transactions in the specified financial instruments,which generally are between banks and other sophisticated institutional participants,is unnecessary,unless executed on a formally organized futures exchange.
id.at emphasis added.
the senate committee report was not congress final word on the treasury amendment.a conference committee subsequently met to reconcile house and senate versions of the proposed legislation,and apparently dropped the senate committee distinction between and trading.instead,the conference committee report explained that the treasury amendment provides that interbank trading of foreign currencies is not subject to commission regulation.conf,reprinted in,emphasis added.with this understanding,congress enacted the amendment language that had been submitted by the senate.
baragosh and the commission agree that the noble wealth transactions were in foreign currency and that the treasury amendment,therefore,exempted these transactions from regulation under the cea unless the transactions were conducted on a board of trade.a west.
from its inception through the time of the events at issue here,the cea,like its statutory predecessors,included an exceedingly broad definition of board of trade.thus,during all relevant periods,the statute provided that the term board of trade meant any exchange or association,whether incorporated or unincorporated,of persons who are engaged in the business of buying or selling any commodity or receiving the same for sale on consignment.west,amended by west supp.compare future trading act,stat.cea predecessor statute board of trade is any exchange or association,whether incorporated or unincorporated,of persons who shall be engaged in the business of buying or selling grain or receiving the same for sale on consignment.this definition encompassed virtually every situation in which futures were or ever could be traded.see,cftc frankwell bullion,cir almost all transactions in futures contracts could be characterized as occurring on a board of trade involving informal associations of people engaged in the business of buying and selling commodities.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the breadth of this definition evidences congress general purpose to regulate futures trading in covered commodities as fully as possible.but,of course,for over five decades foreign currency was not a covered commodity.when congress determined to regulate foreign currency in,it did so with the specific understanding that certain between banks and other sophisticated institutional participants not conducted on a formally organized futures exchange would not be subject to regulation under the cea.see,reprinted in at.hence,the treasury amendment.see i.
using the broad statutory definition of board of trade in construing the treasury amendment would,as one of our sister circuits recently noted,render the treasury amendment meaningless.frankwell bullion,at.if the definition were inserted,the amendment would exempt all futures transactions in foreign currency from the cea unless such transactions were conducted on any exchange or association whether incorporated or unincorporated of persons who are engaged in the business of buying or selling any commodity or receiving the same for sale or consignment.in effect,the amendment first clause would exempt all foreign currency transactions from the cea,and its second clause would sweep all,or almost all,such transactions back in.
such an interpretation would be directly at odds with a cardinal rule of statutory construction that a statute should be interpreted so as not to render one part inoperative.mountain states pueblo of santa ana,d quoting colautti franklin,d.we are particularly loathe to violate this rule in construing the treasury amendment,because the supreme court has recently made plain that it does not regard the amendment as surplusage.see dunn cftc,d rejecting an interpretation of the treasury amendment that would have left it without any significant effect at all because legislative enactments should not be construed to render their provisions mere surplusage.citation omitted.
this use of in interpreting the treasury amendment would also frustrate the amendment very purpose.congress broad purpose in enacting the treasury amendment was to provide a general exemption from cftc regulation for sophisticated foreign currency trading.dunn,at.to insert in the amendment would eliminate this general exemption from cftc regulation.id.
perhaps for these reasons,not even the commission suggests that definition should be inserted wholesale into the treasury amendment to eliminate the amendment exemption and provide the commission with jurisdiction over all foreign currency trading.rather,like baragosh,the commission looks to the purpose and history of the treasury amendment to discern the scope of the exemption.however,the parties use the same tools of statutory construction to reach very different results.
baragosh,relying heavily upon the treasury letter and senate report,contends that congress intended to exempt all futures trading unless such trading is conducted on a formally organized futures exchange,reprinted in at.recently,the ninth circuit adopted a position similar to that urged by baragosh.see frankwell bullion,at we find that the legislative history,the senate committee report and the treasury letter conclusively determines that congress intended the term board of trade in the treasury amendment to mean.
in reply,the commission concedes that the treasury department and the senate committee on agriculture may have intended to exempt all trading,but argues that the conference committee report,which neither baragosh nor the frankwell bullion court discuss,better describes congress intent.although we respect the view of our sister circuit,we are persuaded for the reasons that follow that the commission position on this question is correct.
a conference committee report is generally acknowledged as the best guide to legislative intent short of the statute itself,because it represents the final statement of terms agreed upon by both houses of congress.davis lukhard,cir.moreover,in this case,the conference committee account of the treasury amendment also accords with congress broader purpose in passing the amendment.see food and drug admin.brown williamson tobacco,d noting that courts strive to interpret each statute as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme,and to fit,if possible,all parts into an harmonious whole citations omitted.
when congress amended the cea in,its main purpose was to extend the act regulatory protections to previously uncovered futures markets,so as to provide viable market s in which the public can have confidence,reprinted in at.see also id.at a person trading in one of the unregulated markets should receive the same protection afforded to those trading in the regulated markets.senate comm.on agric.and forestry,commodity futures trading commission act of at statement of chr.talmadge i t was the intent of the conference committee to fill all regulatory gaps.near the core of those regulatory protections was a ban on bucket shops and firm hostility toward fraud and manipulation,both of which had been part of the cea and its predecessors for more than fifty years.see,a west prohibiting futures trades outside contract markets a i iv west prohibiting fraud and bucketing west requiring contract markets to adopt rules.
if congress had enacted a broad loophole for foreign currency trading,through which bucket shops and fraudulent marketing could freely escape regulation,it would have left the foreign currency market substantially unprotected and undermined its basic purpose with respect to that market.although obviously the treasury department did persuade congress to protect sophisticated individuals and institutions from regulatory interference by the commission,we would expect congress to have enacted an exemption no larger than necessary.and this,the conference committee report tells us,is exactly what congress did.
of course,the exempted interbank market consists of more than banks.when legislators discussed this market,they spoke of an informal network of banks and tellers,or of banks and other sophisticated institutional participants,reprinted in at emphasis added.likewise,the treasury letter referred to a network of banks and dealers,or sophisticated and informed institutions.id.at,emphasis added.what distinguished interbank market participants was not their institutional form,but their wealth,experience in the market,and knowledge of finance.they could trade in informal networks among themselves,while the general public was able to trade foreign currency futures only with the assistance of formal institutions that provided standard contracts,margin trading,and a means of finding other traders.id.
accordingly,as we have previously held,it wa s the nature of the trade whether a standardized trade within an organized market or an individually negotiated private deal that determine d whether a trade wa s within the act.salomon forex,tauber,cir.transactions in foreign currency were not subject to commission jurisdiction in the period at issue in this case if they were,customized,negotiated,bilateral transactions between sophisticated financial professionals.id.but they were subject to its jurisdiction if they were small,standardized,offered,and mass marketed to individuals under this standard,the trades at noble wealth were certainly not exempted by the treasury amendment,but rather included within the cea jurisdiction.
finally,we note that after this litigation began,congress enacted the commodity futures modernization act cfma,to clarify the jurisdiction of the commodity futures trading commission over certain retail foreign exchange transactions and bucket shops that may not otherwise be regulated.cfma,stat.under the cfma,the commission has jurisdiction over foreign currency futures offered to or entered into with any person who is not an eligible contract participant.cfma,stat.at,codified at b ii west supp.among those not eligible to be contract participants are persons with less than million in total assets or million,if the purpose of the transaction is to manage risk rather than to speculate on movements in price,and who are not registered as futures or securities professionals.cfma,stat.at,codified at w
