the united states securities and exchange commission in conjunction with citigroup global markets,citigroup appeals from the november,order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york rakoff,refusing to approve a consent decree entered into by the parties and instead setting a trial date.our court stayed that order and referred the matter to a merits panel for consideration of the underlying questions.citigroup global markets,cir.we now hold that the district court abused its discretion by applying an incorrect legal standard in assessing the consent decree and setting a date for trial.
background 
complaint and proposed consent judgment.
in october,the filed a complaint against citigroup,alleging that citigroup negligently misrepresented its role and economic interest in structuring and marketing a fund,known as the class v funding iii the fund,and violated sections a and of the securities act of the act.the complaint alleges that citigroup exercised significant influence over the selection of million worth of the fund assets,which were primarily collateralized by subprime securities tied to the already faltering housing market.citigroup told fund investors that the fund investment portfolio was chosen by an independent investment advisor,but,the alleged,citigroup itself selected a substantial amount of negatively projected assets in which citigroup had taken a short position.by assuming a short position,citigroup realized profits of roughly million from the poor performance of its chosen assets,while fund investors suffered millions of dollars in losses.
shortly after filing of the complaint,the filed a proposed consent judgment.in the proposed consent judgment,citigroup agreed to a permanent injunction barring citigroup from violating act sections a and disgorgement of million,which the asserted were citigroup net profits gained as a result of the conduct alleged in the complaint prejudgment interest in the amount of million and a civil penalty of million.citigroup also agreed not to seek an offset against any compensatory damages awarded in any related investor action.citigroup consented to make internal changes,for a period of three years,to prevent similar acts from happening in the future.absent from the consent decree was any admission of guilt or liability.
the also filed a parallel complaint against citigroup employee brian stoker.see brian stoker,civ.jsr.the stoker complaint alleged that stoker negligently violated sections a and of the act in connection with his role in structuring and marketing the collateralized debt obligations in the fund.
ii.proceedings before the district court.
the district court scheduled a hearing in the matter,and presented the and citigroup with a list of questions to answer.the questions included 
why should the court impose a judgment in a case in which the alleges a serious securities fraud but the defendant neither admits nor denies wrongdoing 
given the statutory mandate to ensure transparency in the financial marketplace,is there an overriding public interest in determining whether the charges are true is the interest even stronger when there is no parallel criminal case 
how was the amount of the proposed judgment determined in particular,what calculations went into the determination of the million penalty why,for example,is the penalty in this case less than of the million penalty assessed in goldman sachs co what reason is there to believe this proposed penalty will have a meaningful deterrent effect 
the proposed judgment imposes injunctive relief against future violations.what does the do to maintain compliance how many contempt proceedings against large financial entities has the brought in the past decade as a result of violations of prior consent judgments 
why is the penalty in this case to be paid in large part by citigroup and its shareholders rather than by the culpable individual offenders acting for the corporation if the was for the most part unable to identify such alleged offenders,why was this 
how can a securities fraud of this nature and magnitude be the result simply of negligence 
both the and citigroup submitted written responses to the district court questions.on november,the district court conducted a hearing to explore the questions presented.a few weeks later,the district court issued a written opinion declining to approve the consent judgment.citigroup global markets,d citigroup i.the district court stated that 
before a court may employ its injunctive and contempt powers in support of an administrative settlement,it is required,even after giving substantial deference to the views of the administrative agency,to be satisfied that it is not being used as a tool to enforce an agreement that is unfair,unreasonable,inadequate,or in contravention of the public interest.
id.at.it found that the proposed consent decree 
is neither fair,nor reasonable,nor adequate,nor in the public interest because it does not provide the court with a sufficient evidentiary basis to know whether the requested relief is justified under any of these standards.purely private parties can settle a case without ever agreeing on the facts,for all that is required is that a plaintiff dismiss his complaint.but when a public agency asks a court to become its partner in enforcement by imposing injunctive remedies on a defendant,enforced by the formidable judicial power of contempt,the court,and the public,need some knowledge of what the underlying facts are for otherwise,the court becomes a mere handmaiden to a settlement privately negotiated on the basis of unknown facts,while the public is deprived of ever knowing the truth in a matter of obvious public importance.
id.footnotes omitted.
the district court criticized the relief obtained by the in the consent decree,comparing it unfavorably with settlements entered in bank of america,civ.jsr,wl,and in goldman sachs et,civ.bsj,docket july.see citigroup i,d at.in both bank of america and goldman sachs,the district court noted,the parties stipulated to certain findings of facts.without such an evidentiary basis in this case,the district court reasoned,the court is forced to conclude that a proposed consent judgment that asks the court to impose substantial injunctive relief,enforced by the court own contempt power,on the basis of allegations unsupported by any proven or acknowledged facts whatsoever,is neither reasonable,nor fair,nor adequate,nor in the public interest.id.at.thus,the district court concluded 
an application of judicial power that does not rest on facts is worse than mindless,it is inherently dangerous.the injunctive power of the judiciary is not a remedy to be invoked at the whim of a regulatory agency,even with the consent of the regulated.if its deployment does not rest on facts cold,hard,solid facts,established either by admissions or by trials it serves no lawful or moral purpose and is simply an engine of oppression.
the district court refused to approve the consent judgment,and instead consolidated this case with the stoker action and ordered the parties to be prepared to try both cases on july.
iii.prior proceedings before this court.
the and citigroup filed immediate notices of appeal.the also moved in the district court for an emergency stay pending the outcome of the appeal,but before the district court could decide the stay motion before it,the sought an emergency stay in our court.as an alternative basis for relief,the also filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to set the order aside.
prior to our court ruling on the stay motion and mandamus petition,the district court issued its decision denying the motion for a stay.citigroup global markets,d citigroup ii.the district court reasoned that our court lacked jurisdiction to hear an interlocutory appeal from the denial of approval of a consent judgment.id.at.as to the proposal to file a writ of mandamus as an alternative to a statutory appeal,the district court similarly found that such action would not divest it of jurisdiction,and,consequently,declined to consider the request for a stay.id.at.
our court disagreed,granting the motion for a stay pending before us.citigroup global markets,cir citigroup iii.we concluded that the demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits,because the district court did not accord the judgment adequate deference.id.at.as both parties before us advocated for approving the consent order,we ordered counsel appointed to advocate for the district court order.id.at.before us now is the merits appeal.
we review the district court denial of a settlement agreement under an abuse of discretion standard.see wang,f d,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law,made a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or rendered a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.lynch city of new york,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
appellate jurisdiction.
the argues that we have jurisdiction to consider this interlocutory appeal pursuant to a.we agree.section a states in relevant part 
a t he courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from 
interlocutory orders of the district courts of the united states,or of the judges thereof,granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions,or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions 
because a was intended to carve out only a limited exception to the rule,we have construed the statute narrowly to ensure that appeal as of right under a will be available only in circumstances where an appeal will further the statutory purpose of permitting litigants to effectually challenge interlocutory orders of serious,perhaps irreparable,consequence.carson am.brands,internal quotation marks omitted.thus,u nless a litigant can show that an interlocutory order of the district court might have a serious,perhaps irreparable,consequence,and that the order can be effectually challenged only by immediate appeal,the general congressional policy against piecemeal review will preclude interlocutory appeal.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
in carson,the consent decree at issue permanently enjoined an employer and a union from discriminating against african american employees,required changes to the way seniority and benefits were awarded,established hiring goals,and granted job bidding preferences.at.the carson court found the district court refusal to approve the consent decree constituted irreparable harm because 
the district court made clear that it would not enter any decree containing remedial relief provisions that did not rest solidly on evidence of discrimination and that were not expressly limited to actual victims of discrimination.in ruling so broadly,the court did more than postpone consideration of the merits of petitioners injunctive claim.it effectively foreclosed such consideration.having stated that it could perceive no vestiges of racial discrimination on the facts presented,and that even if it could,no relief could be granted to future employees and others who were not actual victims of discrimination,the court made clear that nothing short of an admission of discrimination by respondents plus a complete restructuring of the class relief would induce it to approve remedial injunctive provisions.
id.at internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,the carson court found that b ecause a party to a pending settlement might be legally justified in withdrawing its consent to the agreement once trial is held and final judgment entered,the district court order might thus have the serious,perhaps irreparable,consequence of denying the parties their right to compromise their dispute on mutually agreeable terms.id.at footnote omitted.finally,by delaying approval of the consent decree,the plaintiffs were losing access to the specific job opportunities and the training and competitive advantages that would come with those opportunities.id.at.
in new york dairylea cooperative,the parties entered into a settlement to resolve a civil antitrust action,cir.the settlement included a provision labeled injunction that 
would enjoin dairylea from participating in any agreement to fix the price of milk or allocate customers during the next six years dairylea also agreed to allow new york access to its books,records and personnel and to publicize,among its employees,the terms of the arrangement for the purpose of ensuring dairylea compliance with the decree provisions.
id.at.we found that the proposed injunction did not meet the requirements of carson because the settlement agreement proposed minimal injunctive relief defendants were enjoined from violating the law.id.at.the parties argued that because the proposed settlement would enjoin dairylea from participating in any conspiracy to fix prices or allocate customers,the order disapproving the settlement is in effect the denial of an injunction.id.we disagreed 
taken to its extreme this argument would render the disapproval of every proposed settlement appealable.it would be a simple matter for the settling parties to include in the agreement an injunctive provision forbidding one party from violating the law.the mere existence of an injunctive clause,therefore,can not be sufficient to render the disapproval of a proposed settlement agreement appealable.
thus,to bring an interlocutory appeal from a district court denial of settlement approval,a party must demonstrate that the district court,by refusing to approve a settlement,effectively denied a party injunctive relief and in the absence of an interlocutory appeal,a party will suffer irreparable harm.grant local,cir.that standard is satisfied here.the rejected consent decree provided for two types of injunctive relief enjoining citigroup from violating provisions of the act in the future,and requiring citigroup to undertake steps aimed at preventing future occurrences of securities fraud,and periodically demonstrate compliance to the.the also demonstrated irreparable harm unlike the court in dairylea,here the district court expressed no willingness to revisit the settlement agreement with the parties,instead setting a trial date.see,grant,at it bears repeating that the carson court relied heavily on the district court warning that it would never approve a settlement similar to the one the parties made.citing carson,at.we are satisfied that our court may exercise jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal.
ii.the scope of the consent decree.
we quickly dispense with the argument that the district court abused its discretion by requiring citigroup to admit liability as a condition for approving the consent decree.in both the briefing and at oral argument,the district court pro bono counsel stated that the district court did not seek an admission of liability before approving the consent decree.with good is no basis in the law for the district court to require an admission of liability as a condition for approving a settlement between the parties.the decision to require an admission of liability before entering into a consent decree rests squarely with the.as the district court did not condition its approval of the consent decree on an admission of liability,we need not address the issue further.
iii.the scope of deference.
we turn,then,to the far thornier question of what deference the district court owes an agency seeking a consent decree.our court recognizes a strong federal policy favoring the approval and enforcement of consent decrees.wang,at.to be sure,when the district judge is presented with a proposed consent judgment,he is not merely a rubber stamp.levine,cir.the district court here found it was required,even after giving substantial deference to the views of the administrative agency,to be satisfied that it is not being used as a tool to enforce an agreement that is unfair,unreasonable,inadequate,or in contravention of the public interest.citigroup i,d at.other district courts in our circuit view t he role of the court in reviewing and approving proposed consent judgments in enforcement actions as restricted to assessing whether the settlement is fair,reasonable and adequate within the limitations congress has imposed on the to recover investor losses.cr intrinsic investors,llc,d,quoting cioffi,d,see also united stat
