opinion of the court 
santander merchant bank limited appeals the district court denial of its.b motion for reconsideration of the final judgment that excluded santander from the settlement of the underlying securities fraud action brought by investors against cendant.specifically,santander claims that the district court erred in failing to apply correctly the standards for determining excusable neglect in denying santander proof of claim which was mailed three days late.
cendant counters santander appeal on numerous grounds,only one of which is left to us to consider in this appeal,the other claims having been resolved against cendant in our opinion in a related case,in re cendant corporation prides litigation,cir cendant sole remaining is that the district court properly denied santander the ability to participate in the settlement because santander failed to demonstrate excusable neglect.on the facts before us,we find that the district court decision in concluding that santander did not demonstrate that excusable neglect caused the delay was not consistent with the sound exercise of its discretion.we will,therefore,reverse.
because related litigation is already the subject of at least three published opinions,each exhaustively setting forth the procedural and factual background,we will not do so here,but instead refer interested parties to these prior dispositions we set forth only those facts crucial to a resolution of the disputes here 
this appeal is one of several which arise out of the large securities fraud class action cendant prides litigation involving cendant and its former officers.in june,the district court approved a million settlement of the cendant prides class action litigation.under the terms of the stipulation of agreement of settlement and compromise the stipulation,cendant agreed to distribute one right,with a theoretical value of,for each prides owned as of the close of business on april.see also in re cendant.prides,d at to collect the rights each prides owner was required to submit a valid proof of claim by june.under the terms of the settlement hearing order,a settlement administrator,valley forge administrative services,was to verify the proofs of claim.the rights,which are publicly traded,expire on february,when,in combination with the current prides,they will be exchanged for new prides.
class members who wished to participate in the settlement were asked to submit a completed proof of claim form by prepaid first class mail postmarked on or before june,addressed to the administrator as set forth in the notice.the class notice further provided that proofs of claim would be deemed to have been filed when posted,if mailed by first class mail or air mail,postage prepaid,and addressed in accordance with the instructions given proofs of claim filed otherwise would be deemed to have been filed when actually received by the administrator.
the record in this case shows that on june,two days before the mailing deadline,douglas preston,the general counsel and chief compliance officer of santander investment securities,finalized a proof of claim form on behalf of appellant santander merchant bank for prides worth,at the settlement value,approximately million.preston delivered the proof of claim form to his assistant,iris figueroa,for mailing to the administrator by postage first class mail,certified with return receipt requested.preston saw figueroa place the completed proof of claim form in an envelope,address the envelope as provided in the claim form instructions and affix a certified mail sticker to the package.figueroa delivered the envelope to santander mail department and instructed the mailroom staff to mail the envelope immediately by first class certified mail.a member of the mailroom staff informed figueroa that he would take the package to the post office that day,and figueroa reported back to preston that the package had been mailed.thus,santander believed that its proof of claim form had been mailed on june,two days before the deadline.
though unknown to preston at the time,santander proof of claim languished unattended in the mailroom for a week on june,a new outside manager arrived to oversee and manage mailroom services.upon his arrival,the manager discovered a large quantity of undelivered outgoing mail in the mailroom,including several pieces of certified mail,which he processed.the proof of claim form was apparently among the undelivered mail discovered on june,and it was sent out that day.at this time,apparently neither preston nor the legal department knew that a mailroom problem had occurred or had any knowledge or notice that santander claim had not been mailed on june.
on september,however,santander received a letter from the administrator advising that its claim was being denied because it had been received by the administrator after deadline for filing.that letter said nothing about the claim being mailed or postmarked late.santander was advised by the administrator to write to the clerk of the court explaining the reason for the delay.
thus,when the administrator advised santander in writing that its claim had been rejected as untimely because it had been received after june,preston believed that this was an administrative error on the administrator part and that the error would be corrected by the court.santander wrote to the clerk of the court,explaining that the delay in receipt of the proof of claim may have been occasioned by use of certified mail and that santander believed it had mailed the proof of claim on time and that it had to explain late receipt,not late mailing.
on october,the district court issued an opinion and order denying cendant motion to disallow proofs of claim and granting class plaintiffs for enlargement of the time to file or to cure proofs of claim.the district court specifically found that an enlargement of the time to file or correct proofs of claim would not prejudice cendant.the district court extended the deadline for submitting or curing deficiencies in proofs of claim from june,to september,required a showing of excusable neglect for any delay,and directed lead counsel for the class to furnish the district court with the reasons for delay advanced by rejected claimants.apparently,santander did not receive notice regarding the court decision of october.
despite not having received the notice,santander wrote to the clerk of the court,on november,to inquire into the status of its claim.that letter reads in pertinent part 
we are writing to request information on the status of our claim with regard to the matter.on september,we responded to a letter received from valley forge administrative services,whereby we affirmed that santander investment securities,on behalf of santander merchant bank,limited,had met the deadline for submission of its proof of claim form.
therefore,at this time,we would appreciate receiving information on the status of our claim.
if we do not hear from you within the next days,this confirms that our status in the claim has been accepted.
this letter reflected santander understanding that it had timely filed its claim.santander did not receive any response to its november letter 
on january,the district court denied santander claim for being late with insufficient reason for delay.after receiving the district court decision on january,santander communicated with class counsel and the administrator and asked to review the file with respect to its claim.the administrator faxed a copy of the postmarked envelope in which santander claim had been sent.thus,santander learned that its proof of claim form had been postmarked on june,week after it had been delivered to the mailroom for mailing and three business days after the original filing deadline.santander claims that this was the first notice that it had that the proof of claim form had not been mailed on june.preston thereafter investigated the reason for the delay in mailing and learned that its own mailroom problem caused the delay.
the district court final judgment was entered on february.on march,three weeks after the district court entry of final judgment on santander claim,santander moved in the district court that the judgment be vacated under rule b on the grounds of excusable neglect.santander had only discovered in late january that the claim had been denied due to late mailing rather than late receipt,and had set to work to determine the cause of the late mailing and to try to remedy the rather severe situation which it faced,that is,being excluded from the settlement.the rule b motion cited,inter alia,its mailroom sabotage and good faith efforts to determine the origins of the delay.the district court held a hearing on march,the following day.
the district court entered an order on march,denying santander claim for the reasons stated at oral argument,which had been held on march.
on appeal,santander challenges the district court denial of its rule b motion to permit it to participate in the underlying settlement.specifically,santander asserts on appeal that in refusing to excuse its delay in the mailing of its proof of claim,the district court failed to apply properly the standards for determining excusable neglect outlined in pioneer investment services brunswick.ptrshp,d had the district court properly applied the law,insists santander,it would have excused the delay and permitted santander to participate in the settlement,based upon the following factors,among others the district court finding of no prejudice to cendant the delay de minimis length the delay lack of impact on judicial proceedings santander diligent efforts to file on time,its reasonable belief that it had done so,and its diligent efforts to follow up on its claim the erroneous notice from the settlement administrator that the claim had been received late,rather than late and santander unchallenged good faith.
in response,cendant maintains that the district court decisions here should be affirmed for several reasons including that at the time the district court disallowed the claim,the only excuse santander provided was that sometimes certified mail can be delayed in reaching its destination santander excusable neglect theory was not presented to the district court at that time,and so should now be deemed waived santander did not offer the requisite extraordinary circumstances for rule b relief and in particular,did not take timely action to investigate or explain the reason for its late proof of claim and the mailroom events plaguing santander were unproved,and even if they had been proved,they were santander own responsibility.in sum,cendant claims that santander does no more than attack the district court decision as inequitable,and asserts that rule b relief must be grounded on extraordinary circumstances,and not merely because a movant believes the decision to be unfair.
our examination requires a analysis for purposes of the rule b motion whether santander delay in bringing its mail room sabotage theory to the district court attention was excusable and on the merits whether the mail room sabotage theory provides a valid reason for its late submission of its proof of claim.the first inquiry regards the district court denial of santander rule b motion for reconsideration of the final judgment that excluded santander from the settlement.we review the district court denial of the rule b motion for abuse of discretion.in re envntl.energy,cir.we have held as to abuse of discretion,generally,that an abuse of discretion arises when the d istrict c ourt decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.oddi ford motor,cir citation omitted.an abuse of discretion may also occur when no reasonable person would adopt the district court view.id.finally,we will not interfere with the d istrict c ourt exercise of discretion unless there is a definite and firm conviction that the court committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.id.if we conclude,as we do,that the district court decision was not consistent with the sound exercise of its discretion,the second question arises whether excusable neglect excuses santander delay in submitting the proof of claims.this involves a review of the matter de novo,applying the law to the facts.id.
a.the rule b motion 
our first inquiry is whether santander delay in bringing its mail room sabotage theory to the district court attention was excusable.we conclude that it is.preston misunderstanding of the august letter informing him that the claim had been received late was understandable.santander prompt response to the august letter and its initiative in sending another letter in november establish that it was not derelict in discovering that its proof of claim had been postmarked late.
b provides,in pertinent part 
rule.relief from judgment or order 
b mistakes inadvertence excusable neglect newly discovered evidence fraud.on motion and upon such terms as are just,the court may relieve a party or a party legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for the following reasons mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect or any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.the motion shall be made within a reasonable time,and for reasons,and not more than one year after the judgment,order,or proceeding was entered or taken.
emphasis supplied.
in pioneer inv,supra,the supreme court delineated the analysis required for a finding of excusable neglect made applicable to rule b though pioneer was a bankruptcy case and held that courts are permitted,where appropriate,to accept late filings even where caused by inadvertence,mistake,or carelessness,as well as by intervening circumstances beyond a party control.at the outset,the supreme court pronounced that the inquiry is essentially equitable and necessitates considering a situation totality 
because congress has provided no other guideposts for determining what sorts of neglect will be considered excusable,we conclude that the determination is at bottom an equitable one,taking account of all relevant circumstances surrounding the party omission.
while all relevant circumstances are properly considered,the supreme court specifically delineated four factors 
these include the danger of prejudice to the debtor,the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings,the reason for the delay,including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant,and whether the movant acted in good faith.
id.in the wake of pioneer,we have imposed a duty of explanation on district courts when they conduct excusable neglect analysis.in chemetron jones,cir,we addressed the bankruptcy rule that permits courts to accept claims when the was due to excusable neglect.in chemetron we held that the bankruptcy court analysis failed to adequately consider the totality of the circumstances presented.id.at.specifically,we faulted the court for failing to make additional relevant factual findings,including the danger of prejudice to the debtor,the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings,the reason for the delay,and whether the movant acted in good faith.id.at.the panel remand ed the issue to the bankruptcy court,with directions to undertake a more comprehensive and thorough determination of whether the totality of the circumstances support claimants defense of excusable neglect.see also,at faulting a district court for not making specific findings as to prejudice.
in our view,the district court decision here suffers from the same defects identified in chemetron and.on santander rule b motion,the district court should properly have entertained an analysis of the factors constituting excusable neglect to determine whether santander had met them.to fail to do so is a failure on the part of the district court to properly apply the law to the facts of this case and provides grounds for reversal on the basis of abuse of discretion.see,at abuse of discretion where ruling below founded on error of law or misapplication of law to facts.here,the district court did not apply the supreme court enunciated factors for excusable neglect,even when santander urged it to do so at the oral argum
