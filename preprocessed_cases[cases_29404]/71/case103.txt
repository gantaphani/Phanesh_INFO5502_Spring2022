fife involvement 
fife agreed to manage and invest brite business funds,in return for which he would receive a commission.in the sec investigation,fife testified that his duties were to administer the bank accounts that he had signatory power over and to develop a balance sheet enhancement program with leverage d funds sent in to be used for financial projects.fife balance sheet enhancement program involved pooling investors money and then leveraging the money by purchasing treasury bills in order to qualify for third world development projects.the profits from the investment in the third world development projects would then be distributed to the investors.fife claimed that investors would make returns of between and percent per year.these returns,however,were not guaranteed because of risks involved.
in october,fife established a brokerage account at the rhode island branch office of raymond james financial services,raymond james,a securities,in the name of brite.fife was the signatory on the account,and fife acquaintance,dennis herula herula,was the designated registered representative.approximately million of the million raised for brite was deposited into this account 
mary lee capalbo capalbo,an attorney and the wife of herula,established a separate brokerage account at raymond james entitled the mary lee capalbo.special client account capalbo account.capalbo was the signatory on this account.fife transferred million from the brite account at raymond james into the capalbo account at raymond james.these transfers occurred through five transactions between april and september after these transfers,million remained in the brite account at raymond james under fife supervision.
of the million remaining in the brite account at raymond james,million was returned to investors approximately million in principal plus promised return allegedly has been lost.al bloushi has received only of his million investment,and rheaume has received only from its million investment as of september,all of the investment money under fife control in the brite account at raymond james had been transferred out.the money deposited in the capalbo account was used to purchase shares in a money market mutual fund.an additional investor,monlezun,invested million raising the total amount of investor funds in the capalbo account at raymond james to million monlezun received only from his million investment.
from june to november,million of brite investor funds was paid to various entities including seaview tamini sullivan puffin brite,commonwealth,four star and al bloushi.additional transfers in the amount of million were made to the mary lee capalbo special client account at citizens bank.
rheaume agreement 
brite entered into an agreement in march with rheaume holdings agreement.the agreement stated that brite will attempt to pay benefits on a best efforts basis at a minimum average over a day period of per week of the amount invested.according to the agreement,the first payment should have occurred twelve international banking days from the receipt of rheaume deposit by raymond james.
on may,fife wrote a letter to rheaume ensuring the safety,security,monitoring and auditing of our client funds is and always will be my primary function.so without hesitation i state to you that absolutely your deposit is safe,secure,unencumbered,will not be invested without your authorization,can not be moved,or withdrawn without your approval.with regard to the enhancement program,fife stated,i myself have been successful for the past six months doing the same placement of funds.the letter further represented that there would be no risk of loss and that rheaume would receive benefits from its investment in the next two weeks.
almost immediately after rheaume investment was in fife control,fife began transferring funds from the brite account at raymond james into the capalbo account at raymond james.these funds were transferred without rheaume knowledge or authorization.the funds in the capalbo account were invested in securities without rheaume knowledge or authorization,and funds in the capalbo account were thereafter transferred into another capalbo account at citizen bank without rheaume knowledge or authorization.moreover,fife no longer had direct control over the investments since he was not a signatory on the accounts.
in july,robert curl curl,rheaume representative,requested a report of the balance in rheaume account.fife forwarded letters from herula to curl on raymond james letterhead reporting rheaume investment plus accrued interest in the brite account at raymond james.however,these reports were false since the funds in the brite account were nearly depleted.after several months,curl requested the return of rheaume funds.fife told curl that the money could not be returned because raymond james worried about large sums of cash coming in and going out of an account in a short period of time.this statement was false.
a few months later,fife suggested to rheaume that it transfer its million investment plus accrued interest in the brite account at raymond james to an account at charles schwab in order to facilitate a swift return.in december,fife advised curl that the money was transferred to a capalbo account at charles schwab.charles schwab account statements were forwarded to rheaume by fife.
throughout,fife,herula,and capalbo sent curl forged charles schwab account statements showing upwards of million in the account.curl was told that rheaume investment plus accrued interest was now pooled with other investor funds in the capalbo account at charles schwab,and these funds would eventually be transferred to fife trading program at seaview.these funds,however,were never moved to charles schwab 
after these funds were allegedly placed in the charles schwab account,curl again requested the return of rheaume funds.fife then advised curl that the national association of securities dealers nasd had frozen the account.the nasd,however,never froze this account.fife offered to use rheaume money in other finance deals once the nasd released the money in the charles schwab account.fife stated that he would be able to use rheaume money to generate excellent returns on other project finance deals.
khan and fife were business partners in seaview.seaview was loaned of brite investor money from fife.seaview costs were obtained from brite.when brite dissolved,brite money was moved into an account at seaview.seaview offered the same type of balance sheet enhancement program that fife envisioned for brite investors.
khan involvement 
khan engages in project financing and project development work.as fife partner at seaview,khan engaged in various tasks on behalf of the entity.khan wrote a letter to herula describing the investment program regarding the leveraging of monies.once leveraged through balance sheet enhancement,the money would be used towards project finance.khan signed several letters directed to potential investors in the balance sheet enhancement program.the sec claims that these letters were intentionally aimed to mislead potential investors.there is no proof that these letters were mailed however,a similar proposal was mailed to al bloushi,one of brite investors.
in december,khan sent letters to al bloushi and his representative in an attempt to convince al bloushi to invest additional funds in the amount of million dollars in a private placement project finance program.one letter promised that al bloushi would receive a guaranteed return of per year,without any risk.in addition,al bloushi would receive a reward for holding the investment for a year and a day.this reward included a return on the day of the trading cycle and an return on the investment that was to be paid in four installments of each.
in the sec investigation,khan testified that he told al bloushi representative that if an investment were made,he was guaranteed a return.this representation was material since project finance is very risky.if a project finance investment fails,then the investor receives nothing.khan testified that t he risks are high,the rewards are high.there a relationship on every,every transaction.there tremendous amount of risks involved there tremendous amount of rewards to be made.the investor has to be a sophisticated investor.although khan testified that he informs investors of the risks of project finance,these risks were not included in the project proposal sent to al bloushi.

iii.discussion 
the sec has authority under the securities exchange act to bring an action in district court to enjoin individuals from engaging in acts or practices constituting a violation of any provision of the securities laws.d.in aaron sec,d,the supreme court stated that the district court shall grant such an injunction upon a proper showing.id.at.the requisite elements of a proper showing include,at a minimum,proof that a person is engaged in or is about to engage in a substantive violation of either one of the acts or of the regulations promulgated thereunder.id.at.
in this circuit,a preliminary injunction may be granted if the movant shows a likelihood of success on the merits,a risk of irreparable harm,a favorable balance of equities,and that the injunction would be in the public interest.langlois abington hous,cir.the sine qua non of a preliminary injunction analysis is whether the plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits of its claim.weaver henderson,cir.
in the instant case,the district court applied the criteria mandated by the second circuit in sec preliminary injunction actions,see sec unifund sal,cir,and failed to consider the risk of irreparable harm.unlike the second circuit,we have not removed irreparable harm from the preliminary injunction inquiry in sec preliminary injunction actions.sec world radio mission,cir reversing the district court finding that the denial of injunctive relief will not cause any harm to the public,irreparable or otherwise see also sec lehman brothers,cir finding that there was no obvious harm in allowing appellant lienholder to maintain the escrow allegedly secured by debtor through unlawful insider trading.although the district court failed to consider irreparable harm in granting the preliminary injunction,the essential that the sec is likely to succeed on the merits of its met.weaver,at aaron,at.the district court found that fife misrepresented the nature of the investment program,its overall risk,and the status of funds after they were placed with brite,and that the sec established that khan engaged in a course of business that would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser.moreover,t he district court amply supported finding of the likelihood that future violations would occur would ordinarily,without more,entitle plaintiff to a preliminary injunction.world radio mission,at.the district court here found that the sec would likely succeed in showing such future violations because of the nature of fife and khan occupations,their claims of ignorance as to the scheme,the misappropriation of large amounts of investor funds,the recency of their alleged conduct,and the continuing existence of the accounts and entities used to perpetrate the alleged scheme in this case.we may affirm the district court grant of a preliminary injunction and asset freeze on any grounds supported by the record.aldridge cross,cir quoting greenless almond,cir.the record sufficiently establishes the harm caused plaintiff without the injunction,in light of the plaintiff likelihood of eventual success on the merits,outweighs the harm the injunction will cause appellants.saldana,cir emphasis in original accord commonwealth of massachusetts watt,cir world radio mission,at to the extent that a defendant can show harm,this must be discounted by the degree that a plaintiff can show likelihood of success.accordingly,we must affirm the preliminary injunction and asset freeze unless the district court abused its discretion.
