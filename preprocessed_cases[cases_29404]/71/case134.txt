plaintiffs a corporation,partnership,and seven annuity trusts grats controlled by florida residents angela and arthur williams appeal from an october,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york sidney stein,judge,dismissing their amended complaint for failure to state a claim.plaintiffs allege that they suffered losses in excess of million when,from may through march,they refrained from selling their shares of citigroup stock based on the fraudulent and negligent misrepresentations of defendants citigroup and citigroup executives.defendants,arguing that the district court erred by addressing the adequacy of plaintiffs substantive claims as holders of the shares during a period of decline in share value according to defendants,delaware law mandates that such claims be brought in a shareholder derivative action,not as direct claims as plaintiffs have done.
if defendants are correct,plaintiffs who are no longer citigroup shareholders lack standing to maintain this suit.the proper characterization of plaintiffs claims as direct or derivative calls for an interpretation of an unsettled area of delaware law in which there appear to be conflicting decisions,and we anticipate that the resolution of this issue will have significance well beyond the instant suit.see.accordingly,we respectfully certify to the delaware supreme court the question whether,under delaware law,holder claims such as those plaintiffs attempt to assert are properly brought in a direct or derivative action.
background 
in,arthur williams founded an insurance company that by had become very successful and merged with travelers group.in,travelers group merged with citibank to become citigroup.in the merger,williams acquired million shares of citigroup common stock,then valued at approximately million,or per share.by early,for tax,estate and purposes,the shares had been transferred to a partnership,a corporation,and various grats controlled by arthur and his wife,angela.am.compl.
in may,williams made a plan to sell his entire citigroup position,based on the shared recommendation of his financial advisors at that time.in the advisors view,the citigroup stock price was then close to the top for the and it was a good time for williams to sell.id.he began implementing this plan on may,when he sold one million of his million shares at per share.
against the counsel of his advisors and despite his plans to sell,williams delayed executing his sales of the remainder of his shares when,later in,citigroup stock price declined as the markets began to experience volatility from the subprime mortgage crisis.id.williams believed that citigroup had little downside risk and its shares were likely being dragged down by the fortunes of other players and that once the market understood the different and far superior risk posture of citigroup,its shares would recover and he could complete his planned sale as intended.id.plaintiffs allege that williams formulated this belief in reliance on citigroup public statements and financial reports that concealed the full extent and impairment of billions in toxic assets,including collateralized debt obligations backed by subprime assets.id.see also.plaintiffs further allege that citigroup gave investors the impression that it was reducing and prudently managing its risks,which was simply not true.id.
in the sixteen months that followed his initial sale of one million shares,williams continually tried to choose the appropriate time to complete the liquidation of his position in order to minimize his damages.id.but,allegedly misled by citigroup misrepresentations in conference calls,investor slideshows,earnings releases,public filings and statements from senior officers,williams held on to his remaining million shares as the stock price plummeted to per share.id.he considered selling in december,on august,and on december.id.it was not until march,however,by which time william sic faith in the truthfulness of the company had finally been erased,that he sold his remaining million shares at a price of per share.id.plaintiffs maintain that,had williams received truthful and accurate information from citigroup,he would have sold his entire position on may,when the true value of the stock was id.
williams thus calculates that his reliance on citigroup misrepresentations resulted in losses to him,his wife,and their controlled entities of over million.
ii.procedural background 
having filed their original complaint in december,in july plaintiffs filed the amended complaint at issue here.in it,they seek damages for negligent misrepresentation and for common law fraud.defendants moved to dismiss,arguing first that plaintiffs lack standing because under delaware law their claims are derivative,and second,that under new york law the alleged misrepresentations are not actionable.
in a opinion and order,the district court granted defendants motion and dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice.ahw inv.citigroup,d.applying delaware law,the district court first reject ed defendants contention that the claims are in reality derivative claims brought on behalf of citigroup.id.at.it recognize d a tension in the delaware precedent,but nevertheless concluded that plaintiffs,not citigroup,are the victims of citigroup and the officer defendants alleged deception,and therefore plaintiffs are the ones with standing to sue.id.at.the district court then conducted a conflict of laws analysis and concluded that new york law as opposed to florida law,as urged by governed the substance of plaintiffs claims.applying new york law,the court determined that both the negligent misrepresentation and the fraud allegations failed to state a claim accordingly,it dismissed the complaint.
this appeal and followed.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b,drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.roth citimortgage,cir per curiam.
on appeal,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by applying new york,not florida,law to their claims,and that,even applying new york law,their fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims were sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.defendants dispute these contentions and argue in their that,contrary to the district court conclusion,plaintiffs claims are properly considered derivative rather than direct.
if we accept defendants argument,then the district court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the sufficiency of plaintiffs claims,and we must affirm the dismissal of the amended complaint without further considering plaintiffs claims.see franchise tax bd.of cal.alcan aluminum,noting that the question whether an individual shareholder is suing to enforce his own rights versus those of the corporation presents an issue of prudential standing.the lack of prudential standing would present an independent basis for dismissing the complaint.id.we therefore turn our attention first to the issues raised in defendants.
tooley and its application to plaintiffs claims 
in diversity cases such as this,federal courts look to the laws of the forum state in deciding issues regarding conflicts of law.wall csx transportation,cir.plaintiffs filed their complaint in the southern district of new york therefore,we examine the law of new york,the forum state,to determine which state substantive law governs the dispute.
under new york law,we look to the law of the state of incorporation when adjudicating whether a claim is direct or derivative.see galef alexander,cir seidl am.century,d,aff,app x cir.because citigroup is incorporated in delaware,delaware law controls whether plaintiffs claims are properly characterized as direct or derivative.plaintiffs mount no challenge to this conclusion.
the leading delaware supreme court case on the dichotomy is widely acknowledged to be tooley donaldson,lufkin jenrette.like the district court here,however,we perceive some tension between tooley and later state court decisions primarily lower court decisions,but also one decision of the delaware supreme court that tooley.before considering how these later cases may have affected tooley import,we first review tooley in some detail,since it is central to our inquiry.
in tooley,minority shareholder plaintiffs sought damages from the corporation on the basis of allegations that members of the corporation board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to the corporation by agreeing to delay closing a proposed merger for days,thereby depriving minority shareholders of use of the funds they were to receive upon closing for that period.id.at.the court of chancery dismissed the action,concluding the plaintiffs claim was derivative,not direct.it reasoned that the wrong alleged did not cause plaintiffs a special injury that is,a wrong that is separate and distinct from that suffered by other shareholders.tooley donaldson,lufkin jenrette,no.civ.nc,wl,at.ch,internal quotation marks omitted.the special injury requirement was then used in delaware courts to differentiate between direct and derivative claims,including claims that alleged breach of duty to shareholders through a defendant corporation alleged misrepresentations.see,manzo rite aid,no.civ.nc,wl,at.ch,concluding that a plaintiff must identify some resultant injury that affects some shareholders disproportionately to their pro rata stock ownership to state a direct claim based on the depriv ation of accurate information upon which to base investment decisions,aff.
on tooley appeal from the court of chancery decision,however,the delaware supreme court expressly disapprove d the use of the concept of special injury as a tool in distinguishing between direct and derivative claims.tooley,at.the court held instead that whether a stockholder claim is derivative or direct must turn solely on the following questions who suffered the alleged harm the corporation or the suing stockholders,individually and who would receive the benefit of any recovery or other remedy the corporation or the stockholders,individually id.at emphasis in original.when deciding whether a claim is properly viewed as direct or derivative,it instructed,a court should look to the nature of the wrong and to whom the relief should go.id.at.
turning back to the williamses complaint,we see that tooley test suggests that the williamses may bring their claims directly.with regard to who suffered the alleged harm,it is true that in a general sense both plaintiffs and citigroup suffered harm when the company share price fell over time as the extent of its investment in assets came to light.but the harm for which plaintiffs seek recovery is more particularized it arises from their detrimental reliance on what they cast as defendants misrepresentations,made through personal and direct communications to them,not merely public announcements.see,am.compl.describing the decision not to sell as being based on arthur williams personal and direct communications with senior citigroup officers id.seeking relief for having been the recipients of multiple misrepresentations and omissions of material fact and alleging that defendants knew their statements to plaintiffs concerning citigroup subprime exposure were false at the time they were made.
because the harm alleged is inextricably linked to defendants misstatements and the asserted breach of a duty of disclosure,the harm from the alleged misrepresentations may be said to have been suffered by the suing stockholders,individually,not by the corporation.and the complaint alleges that the misstatements were made in an attempt to cover up the harm already done to the corporation,not to have themselves caused the harm further decoupling the harm allegedly suffered by the williamses and that sustained by the corporation.
and as to the second tooley question,it seems that the williamses,not citigroup,would receive the benefit of any recovery.the complaint alleges that,as a direct result of defendants fraudulent statements and plaintiffs reliance thereon,plaintiffs suffered approximately in compensatory damages.id.theirs is fundamentally an action for compensatory damages,and if any party were to recover damages for the asserted misrepresentations if actionable at all,it would be plaintiffs it would be a strange outcome indeed for citigroup to pay itself for losses sustained by certain shareholders arising from alleged misrepresentations made to those shareholders by the company and its officers.thus,our response to the second tooley question also appears to support plaintiffs argument that they may bring their claims directly.
in sum,tooley suggests that the williamses have stated direct claims.if tooley were the only decision of the delaware courts relevant to this action,we would likely conclude that plaintiffs may bring these claims directly.
ii.delaware courts more recent application of tooley 
subsequent developments in the delaware courts application of tooley give us pause,however.as detailed below,in a number of cases the delaware chancery court has found that claims that would be direct under the tooley test must nonetheless be brought derivatively because the claims are not independent of any alleged injury to the corporation,tooley,at.relying on the same language from tooley,a recent delaware supreme court case may have given new life to the special injury requirement that was earlier disavowed in tooley.we think that these developments have major implications for whether,under delaware law,in general,and the williamses in particular,have stated direct or derivative claims.
in gentile rossette,for example,the delaware supreme court reviewed an action brought by a group of minority shareholders against the corporation directors and chief executive officer for breach of fiduciary duty related to an alleged overpayment to the ceo.the court held that when a claim is based on any dilution in value of the corporation stock,the claim is generally derivative,because the loss of value is merely the unavoidable result of the reduction in the value of the entire corporate entity.id.at applying tooley to a claim of corporate overpayment for an asset.
similarly,in in re morgan chase.shareholder litigation.ch,aff on other grounds,the plaintiff stockholders filed what they contended were direct claims based on the defendant company alleged overpayment in a merger with another bank,id.at.plaintiffs complained that the value of their shares was diluted by virtue of the overpayment,and that this was the type of harm that would give rise to a direct action under tooley.id.at.the court of chancery looked to the heart of the complaint and found that t he plaintiffs,if they were harmed at all,were harmed indirectly and only because of their ownership in jpmc.id.at.therefore,the court concluded,the plaintiffs claim is derivative.id.at.
these cases suggest that the tooley test may now have evolved and that the williamses claims here,which are tied to the dramatic plunge in the value of citigroup stock between and,might not be correctly treated as direct under delaware law.
the delaware supreme court decision in feldman cutaia,lends support.in feldman,the plaintiff alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties when approving a merger agreement that resulted in an allegedly improper payout to company executives.id.at.in affirming the court of chancery dismissal of feldman claim as derivative,the delaware supreme court observed the following,writing four years 
where all of a corporation stockholders are harmed and would recover pro rata in proportion with their ownership of the corporation stock solely because they are stockholders,then the claim is derivative in nature.the mere fact that the alleged harm is ultimately suffered by,or the recovery would ultimately inure to the benefit of,the stockholders does not make a claim direct under tooley.in order to state a direct claim,the plaintiff must have suffered some individualized harm not suffered by all of the stockholders at large.
feldman thus casts doubt on the viability of plaintiffs claims in two ways.first,the williamses seek recovery for losses sustained as a result of the diminution of value in their citigroup stock over a certain period.these are losses experienced by all of the corporation stockholders who h
