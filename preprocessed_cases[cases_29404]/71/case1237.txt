donna yun is married to david yun,the president of scholastic book fairs,a subsidiary of scholastic corporation scholastic,a publisher and distributor of children books whose stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market system and whose option contracts are traded on the chicago board options exchange.on january,david attended a senior management retreat at which scholastic chief financial officer revealed that the company would post a loss for the current quarter,and that before the quarter ended,the company would make a public announcement revising its earnings forecast downward.he cautioned the assembled executives not to sell any of their scholastic holdings until after the announcement,which would likely result in a decline in the market price of scholastic shares,and warned them to keep the matter confidential.approximately two weeks later,on february,scholastic chief financial officer informed david that the negative earnings announcement would be made on february.
over the weekend of february,david and donna discussed a statement of assets that he had provided her in connection with their negotiation of a division of assets.david explained to donna that he had assigned a value to his scholastic options listed on the asset statement,even though scholastic stock was then trading at per share,because he believed that the price of the shares would drop following scholastic february earnings announcement.he also told her not to disclose this information to anyone else,and she agreed to keep the information confidential 
the following tuesday,february,donna went to her place of real estate office located in a nearby housing development the office was a small sales trailer,approximately eleven by thirteen feet,that donna shared with other real estate agents,including jerry burch.during the late morning or early afternoon,donna telephoned sam attorney assisting her in negotiating the division of her office to discuss david statement of assets.while she was speaking to weiss,burch entered the office to gather materials for a real estate client.standing three to four feet from donna,burch heard her tell weiss what david had said about scholastic impending earnings announcement and that david expected the price of the company shares to fall.as he testified at trial,burch did not learn enough from what he overheard to feel comfortable trading in scholastic stock.
that evening,donna and burch attended a real estate awards banquet at the isleworth country club.donna,burch,and another agent,maryann hartmann,carpooled to the reception.all three stayed at the reception for three hours and left together.
the next morning burch called his broker and requested authority to purchase put options in scholastic when the broker advised burch that he knew of no new information indicating the price of scholastic stock would decline,burch stated that based on information he had obtained at a cocktail party,he nonetheless wanted to purchase the put options.the broker warned burch of the risks of trading in options,and cautioned him about insider trading prohibitions despite these warnings,between the afternoon of february and midday on february,burch purchased in scholastic put options,which was equal to of his total income for the previous year and nearly half the value of his entire investment portfolio 
after the stock market closed on february,scholastic announced that its earnings would be well below the analysts expectations.when the market opened the next day,the price of scholastic shares had dropped approximately percent to per share.burch then sold his scholastic puts,realizing a profit of percent return on his investment.within hours,the sec commenced an investigation of burch trades to determine whether insider trading had occurred.the investigation culminated in the present lawsuit.in a complaint,the sec alleged that donna and burch had violated section b of the exchange act and rule and sought both legal and equitable relief 
there are two theories of insider trading liability the classical theory and the misappropriation theory.the classical theory imposes liability on corporate insiders who trade on the basis of confidential information obtained by reason of their position with the corporation the liability is based on the notion that a corporate insider breaches a duty of trust and confidence to the shareholders of his corporation.united states,d.the misappropriation theory,on the other hand,imposes liability on outsiders who trade on the basis of confidential information obtained by reason of their relationship with the person possessing such information,usually an insider the liability under the latter theory is based on the notion that the outsider breaches a duty of loyalty and confidentiality to the person who shared the confidential information with him.id.at.at 
not only are the insider and the outsider forbidden from trading on the basis of the confidential information they have received,they are forbidden from tipping such information to someone else,a tippee,who,being fully aware that the information is confidential,does the trading in other words,the insider and outsider are forbidden from doing indirectly what they are forbidden from doing directly to establish liability,however,the sec need not show that the tippee actually traded for the tipper and gave him the profits of the trades all the sec needs to show is that the tipper received a benefit,directly or indirectly,from his disclosure.see dirks,at.at.
this is a case.the sec prosecuted it under the misappropriation theory of insider trading liability.its complaint alleged that donna was an outsider who had a fiduciary relationship with david and that she breached that duty when she divulged to burch confidential information,which david had given her,for her direct indirect benefit because of her business relationship and friendship with burch.under these circumstances,the complaint alleged,donna was liable under section b of the exchange act and rule to disgorge the profits burch realized from the put options trades.because burch knew of donna breach of her fiduciary duty to david,but nonetheless traded on the confidential information she gave him,he,too,was liable under b and rule.
the separate answers filed by donna and burch admitted that burch engaged in the alleged put options transactions,but denied any violations of b or rule.in short,the answers denied that a fiduciary relationship existed between the yuns and asserted,alternatively,that if donna owed david a fiduciary duty not to disclose scholastic financial situation,she did not breach it because she did not expect to benefit directly or indirectly from the disclosure to burch 
the case was tried to a jury on the issues framed by the complaint and these answers.at the close of the evidence,the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.the court took the motions under advisement.after the jury returned its verdicts,the defendants renewed their motions pursuant to rule b,reiterating the grounds stated in their previous motions the evidence failed to establish a fiduciary relationship between david and donna yun concerning scholastic financial earnings and if such a relationship existed,donna did not breach it by disclosing the earnings information to burch for the purpose of obtaining a direct or indirect benefit the court denied their motions.sec yun,d.
the defendants now appeal,attacking the district court judgment on two grounds.first,they contend,as they did in moving for judgment as a matter of law,that the evidence was insufficient to establish a violation of b or rule.second,and alternatively,they contend that the district court erred in instructing the jury on essential elements of the sec claims.such error,they maintain,is not harmless therefore,they should be afforded a new trial.we address these two grounds in order.
in assessing the district court ruling on appellants motions for judgment as a matter of law,we first consider whether donna owed david a duty of loyalty and confidentiality not to disclose the revised earnings information he had received in confidence.
as stated supra,to prevail in an insider trading case,the sec must establish that the misappropriator breached a duty of loyalty and confidentiality owed to the source of the confidential information.certain business relationships,such as or clearly provide the requisite duty of loyalty and confidentiality.on the other hand,it is unsettled whether relationships,such as husband and wife,provide the duty of loyalty and confidentiality necessary to satisfy the misappropriation theory.the leading case on when a duty of loyalty and confidentiality exists in the context of family case relied on by the parties and the district court for the elements of a confidential united states chestman,cir en banc.
in a divided en banc decision,the second circuit held that marriage alone does not create a relationship of loyalty and confidentiality.id.at.either an express agreement of confidentiality or the functional equivalent of a fiduciary relationship must exist between the spouses for a court to find a confidential relationship for purposes of b and rule liability.since the spouses had not entered into a confidentiality agreement,the court turned its focus to determining what constitutes a fiduciary relationship or its functional equivalent.at the heart of the fiduciary relationship,the court declared,lies reliance,and de facto control and dominance.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.having so concluded,the court explained that the functional equivalent of a fiduciary relationship must share these qualities.id.at.applying the requisite qualities of reliance,control,and dominance to the husband and wife relationship at hand,the chestman majority held that no fiduciary relationship or its functional equivalent existed.the spouses sharing and maintaining of generic confidences in the past was insufficient to establish the functional equivalent of a fiduciary relationship.id.at.accordingly,the court decided that the defendants were not subject to sanctions for insider trading violations.
a lengthy dissent by judge winter,joined by four judges,took issue with the narrowness in which the majority would find a relationship of loyalty and confidentiality amongst family members,pointing out that under the majority approach,the disclosure of sensitive corporate information essentially could be avoided only by family members extracting formal,express promises of confidentiality.id.at.such an approach,in the view of the dissent,was unrealistic in that it expects family members to behave like strangers toward each other.id.moreover,the normal reluctance to recognize obligations based on family concern that litigation would exacerbate strained relationships and weaken the sense of mutual obligation underlying family inapplicable in insider trading cases because the suits are brought by the government.see id.at.given the circumstances of the case,the dissent concluded that a confidential relationship existed between the husband and wife which gave rise to a duty of loyalty and confidentiality on his part not to disclose the sensitive information 
we are inclined to accept the dissent view that the chestman decision too narrowly defined the circumstances in which a duty of loyalty and confidentiality is created between husband and wife.we think that the majority,by insisting on either an express agreement of confidentiality or a strictly defined relationship,ignored the many instances in which a spouse has a reasonable expectation of confidentiality in our view,a spouse who trades in breach of a reasonable and legitimate expectation of confidentiality held by the other spouse sufficiently subjects the former to insider trading liability.if the sec can prove that the husband and wife had a history or practice of sharing business confidences,and those confidences generally were maintained by the spouse receiving the information,then in most instances the conveying spouse would have a reasonable expectation of confidentiality such that the breach of the expectation would suffice to yield insider trading liability.of course,a breach of an agreement to maintain business confidences would also suffice 
for purposes of this case,then,the existence of a duty of loyalty and confidentiality turns on whether david yun granted his wife,donna,access to confidential information in reasonable reliance on a promise that she would safeguard the information.see sec sargent,cir t he misappropriation theory premises liability on a deception of those who entrusted him with access to confidential information.citing,at.at.if the sec presented evidence that david and donna had a history or pattern of sharing business confidences,which were generally kept,then donna could have been found by the jury to have breached a duty of loyalty and confidentiality by disclosing to burch the information regarding scholastic upcoming earnings announcement.similarly,if the sec presented evidence that donna had agreed in this particular instance to keep the information confidential,then donna could have been found to have committed the necessary breach of a duty of loyalty and confidentiality.
we conclude that the sec provided sufficient evidence both that an agreement of confidentiality and a history or pattern of sharing and keeping of business confidences existed between david and donna yun such that david could have reasonably expected donna to keep confidential what he told her about scholastic pending announcement.first,the sec presented evidence that donna explicitly accepted the duty to keep in confidence the business information she received.she testified that she considered the information confidential because,david always told me,anything that he talks to me in regards to the company is confidential and ca go past he or that she fully understood and agreed to the understanding of confidentiality is further manifested by the fact that she declined to disclose any information about david company to her attorney until she had absolute certainty that there was confidentiality with everything she was sharing with him.second,both david and donna testified that david repeatedly shared confidential information about scholastic with donna,including information regarding its sales goals.this certainly qualified as a history or pattern of sharing business confidences.overall,the sec presented evidence upon which a jury could find that a duty of loyalty and confidentiality existed between david and donna yun the sec therefore established the first element of a misappropriation theory claim.
having reached this conclusion,we turn to the question of whether the evidence was sufficient to show that donna breached her duty to david.according to the allegations of the complaint,the answer to this question depends on whether donna deliberately communicated the confidential information to burch for her direct indirect benefit because of her business relationship and friendship with burch.the sec to the position it assumed in its it did not have to prove that donna divulged the information for her own benefit all it had to show was that donna acted with severe recklessness.according to the sec,the intent to benefit element only applies in cases brought under the classical theory of liability the element has no application in cases brought under the misappropriation theory of liability.in other words,whether donna expected to benefit from the disclosure of the confidential information is irrelevant.
which position is one the sec took in its complaint and the appellants essentially take in this appeal or the one the sec advances an issue we have not been called upon to decide.several district courts have addressed the issue,though,with some requiring an expected and others holding that no showing of an expected benefit is necessary none of these courts,however,gave the issue more than perfunctory thought.after considering the policies underpinning the insider trading rules,we are led to the conclusion that the sec must prove that a misappropriator expected to benefit from the tip.
the origin of the benefit requirement is the supreme court decision in dirks sec,d.addressing a case brought under the classical theory of insider trading liability,the supreme court held that for a tippee to be liable,the tipper a corporate insider would have to intend to benefit personally from his disclosure of the confidential information to the tippee.the supreme court explained 
whether disclosure is a breach of duty therefore depends in large part on the purpose of the disclosure thus,the test is whether the insider personally will benefit,directly or indirectly,from his disclosure.absent some personal gain,there has been no breach of duty to stockholders.and absent a breach by the insider,there is no tippee breach.
id.at.at.the court went on to recognize that the gain does not always have to be pecuniary.a reputational benefit that translates into future earnings,a quid pro quo,or a gift to a trading friend or relative all could suffice to show that the tipper personally benefitted.id.at.at.since the insiders tippers in dirks,who disclosed the confidential information,did not do so for monetary benefit or to make a gift of valuable information,they did not personally gain,and the court concluded that they and the tippees were not subject to insider trading liability.id.at.at.
the sec submits that an analysis of the rationale behind dirks tipper benefit requirement demonstrates that the benefit requirement has no application in misappropriation cases.the sec argument proceeds in two steps.first,the sec points out that the benefit requirement is inextricably linked to determining whether an insider has breached a duty to corporate shareholders.second,the sec notes that the distinguishing feature of misappropriation theory cases is that the outsider owes no fiduciary duty to the corporate shareholders.put together,the sec contends,it is unnecessary in misappropriation cases that it show that an outsider intended to benefit from his disclosure since outsiders owe no duty to corporate shareholders to begin with,applying the dirks test to determine if there was a breach of a duty to those same shareholders would be nonsensical.
we recognize the plausibility of the sec logic,but are not because it constructs an arbitrary fence between insider trading liability based upon classical and misappropriation theories.in other words,we think the sec is unduly dichotomizing the two theories of insider trading liability.the sec approach essentially would allow the sec and the courts to ignore precedent involving the classical theory of liability whenever the sec brings its actions under a misappropriation theory,and vice versa the supreme court,however,has indicated that we should attempt to synthesize,rather than polarize,insider trading law.see,at.at stressing that the two theories are complimentary,each addressing efforts to capitalize on nonpublic information through the purchase or sale of securities.our goal should be like that of the court in,which sought to explain how the two theories work together to promote the policies underlying the securities laws.we will be explained requiring the sec to establish that the misappropriator intended to benefit from his tip will develop consistency in insider trading caselaw.
first,we note that there is no reason to distinguish between a tippee who receives confidential information from an insider under the classical theory and a tippee who receives such information from an outsider under the misappropriation theory.in either case,the tippee is under notice that he has received confidential information through an improper breach of a duty of loyalty and confidentiality.and should the tippee nonetheless trade on the confidential information,his potential liability would not vary according to the or which the case is prosecuted.finally,the harm to the securities market from such trading would not differ depending on whether the tippee received the confidential information from an insider or an outsider the integrity of,and investor confidence in,the securities markets are undermined by either method of insider trading.see id.at.at.
given that the position of a tippee is the same whether his tipper is an insider or an outsider,it makes scant sense for the elements the sec must prove to establish a b and rule violation to depend on the theory under which the sec chooses to litigate the case.see id.at.at.the tippee liability should be determined under the same principles.and for better or worse,the supreme court has required that the only way to taint a tippee with liability for insider trading is to find a with the fiduciary and that exists only if the tipper intends to benefit to equalize the position of tippees under both theories of liability,therefore,it is necessary to require an outsider who tips to have intended to benefit by his tip.
requiring an intent to benefit regardless of the theory of insider trading liability also serves to equalize the positions of tippers.since under both theories of liability the tipper is breaching a duty of loyalty and confidentiality by disclosing confidential information,and since the harm to marketplace traders is identical under either breach,it again makes scant sense to impose liability more readily on a tipping outsider who breaches a duty to a source of information than on a tipping insider who breaches a duty to corporate shareholders.
nevertheless,the sec urges us to hold that the breach by an outsider is unique from a breach by an insider.in the sec view,there is no need to show that the misappropriating outsider intended to benefit.a breach of duty to the principal occurs when the outsider makes unauthorized disclosure of the confidential information in a way that harms the principal the harm done to the principal constitutes a or not the outsider intends to profit from the unauthorized disclosure.we conclude,however,that no good reason exists to treat the two types of breaches differently.under the common law,a corporate insider breaches a duty of loyalty and confidentiality by disclosing confidential information rather than trading or tipping on that information just as much as a misappropriating outsider who discloses the information.and the harm to corporate shareholders under the classical theory could be just not than the harm to the source of the information under the misappropriation theory.yet,the supreme court in dirks held that such a disclosure is insufficient to constitute a breach for purposes of imposing classical insider trading liability for there to be a breach,the tipping insider must act with the goal of benefitting personally.to equate the positions of tippers,we find it appropriate to require the sec to show that a misappropriating outsider expected to benefit from the disclosure mere disclosure by itself is insufficient to constitute a breach 
we also think the sec position is inconsistent with the principle that b is not an breach of fiduciary duty ban,at.at citing santa fe,green,d.section b trains on conduct involving manipulation or deception.id.this manipulation or deception,fraud,is consummated when,the fiduciary uses the information to purchase or sell securities and thereby gain profits if the information is put to an other use,no breach has occurred for purposes of the securities laws.id.at.at.in other words,b does not catch all conceivable forms of fraud involving confidential information rather,it catches fraudulent means of capitalizing on such information through securities transactions.id.should we adhere to the sec approach of imposing liability merely because the outsider harmed the principal in some way,however,the outsider potentially could be liable for insider trading where not even the slightest intent to trade on securities existed when he disclosed the information 
our conclusion that the sec must establish that all tippers,both insider and outsiders,intend to benefit from their disclosure of confidential information is amply supported by language in.there,the court observed that an outsider who pretends loyalty to the principal while secretly converting the principal information for personal gain dupes or defrauds the principal.id.at.at emphasis added internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.likewise,an outsider who trades on the basis of material,nonpublic information,in short,gains his advantageous market position through deception.id.at.at emphasis added.in the same vein the misappropriation theory targets information of a sort that misappropriators ordinarily capitalize upon to gain profits through the purchase or sale of securities the theory catches fraudulent means of capitalizing on such information through securities transactions.id.emphasis added.finally,it is a fiduciary use of a principal information to purchase or sell securities that constitutes a breach of duty of loyalty and confidentiality id.at.at emphasis added.
all of the above quoted language from explicitly states or implicitly assumes that a misappropriator must gain personally from his trading on the confidential information.if we were to hold that a misappropriator who than liable even though he intends no personal benefit from his tip,then we would impose liability more readily for tipping than trading.such a result would be absurd,and would undermine the supreme court rationale for imposing the benefit requirement in the first place the desire to ensure that a tip rises to the level of a trade.see dirks,at.at the tip and trade resemble trading by the insider himself followed by a gift of the profits to the recipient.the better approach,in our view,is to follow dirks and ensure that an outsider who tips must have done so with the intent of benefitting from the tippee trading.
finally,and perhaps most importantly,the need for an identical approach to determining tipper and tippee liability under the two theories becomes evident when one realizes that nearly all violations under the classical theory of insider trading can be alternatively characterized as misappropriations see langevoort,supra note,at.to allow the sec to avoid establishing the personal benefit element simply by proceeding under the misappropriation theory instead of the classical theory would essentially render dirks a dead letter in this circuit.such an effect would be unwarranted,particularly in light of the fact that incorporated its principals with,rather than overruled,dirks 
requiring an intent to benefit in both classical and misappropriation theory cases equalizes the positions of tippers and tippees and is also consistent with supreme court precedent.perhaps the simplest way to view potential insider trading liability is as follows an insider who trades is liable an insider who tips rather than trades is liable if he intends to benefit from the disclosure an outsider who trades is liable an outsider who tips rather than trades is liable if he intends to benefit from the disclosure.
having concluded that the sec must prove that donna expected to benefit from disclosing the confidential information to position the sec took in its now consider whether the sec provided sufficient evidence for a jury reasonably to find such an expectation viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the sec,we conclude that the sec did so.
the showing needed to prove an intent to benefit is not extensive.the supreme court in dirks,after establishing the tipper benefit requirement,proceeded to define benefit in very expansive terms.the court declared that not only does an actual pecuniary gain,such as a kickback or an expectation of a reciprocal tip in the future,suffice to create a benefit,but also cases where the tipper sought to enhance his reputation which would translate into future earnings or to make a gift to a trading relative or friend.see dirks,at.at.
in this case,the sec presented evidence that the two appellants were friendly,worked together for several years,and split commissions on various real estate transactions over the years.this evidence is sufficient for a jury reasonably to conclude that donna expected to benefit from her tip to burch by maintaining a good relationship between a friend and frequent partner in real estate deals.see sargent,at finding evidence of personal benefit when the tipper passed on information to effect a reconciliation with his friend and to maintain a useful networking contact.accordingly,the sec has sufficiently established the second element of a misappropriation theory breach of a duty of loyalty and confidentiality.
having concluded that the evidence was sufficient to withstand appellants motions for judgment as a matter of law,we turn to the question of whether the district court erred in instructing the jury on the elements of the sec claims and,if error occurred,whether it was harmless the district court accepted the argument the sec advances here all it had to show to establish a breach of loyalty and confidentiality was that donna acted with severe recklessness in letting burch know what david had told her about scholastic anticipated earnings announcement.over appellants objections,the court instructed the jury as follows the sec must establish,by a preponderance of the evidence,that yun breached a fiduciary duty or other duty of trust and confidence to david yun by disclosing to burch material nonpublic information and t he communication of such information must be intentional,or severely reckless.the court rejected the appellants argument that the sec had to prove that donna acted out of a motive to benefit herself,and thus denied appellants proposed instruction,which stated t he disclosure has to be for the fiduciary personal benefit to constitute a breach.
our role in reviewing a trial court jury instructions is to assure that the instructions show no tendency to confuse or to mislead the jury with respect to the applicable principles of law.mosher,at internal quotation marks omitted.we will not disturb a jury verdict unless the charge,taken as a whole,is erroneous and prejudicial.id.as our previous discussion makes clear,the district court erred in accepting the sec position that whether donna anticipated a benefit was irrelevant.the question thus becomes whether the appellants were prejudiced.
the severely reckless instruction mentioned above,considered in the light of the court overall charge on the sec burden of proof,permitted the sec counsel to tell the jury that the case turned on whether donna tipped burch intentionally or severely recklessly.on three separate occasions,the sec counsel told the jury that it could find that donna breached a duty to her therefore violated b if it found that she intentionally or severely recklessly divulged the confidential information regarding scholastic 
i t enough that yun told burch the scholastic information at the party.she is then liable for intentionally tipping him or for acting with severe recklessness by revealing this highly confidential information 
if donna yun breached a duty to her husband because she intentionally or severely recklessly gave jerry burch this information,then they should both be found liable.
during the telephone call with the sec,yun claimed to specifically recall burch walking into the office during the february call with her attorney this admission is enough evidence f or your to find that at the very least,that she acted with severe recklessness by revealing the information when she saw burch was present.
we have little difficulty in concluding that the severely reckless instruction materially prejudiced the appellants such that they are entitled to a new trial given the court improper instruction and the sec heavy reliance on that instruction in arguing its case to the jury,it is likely that the jury found against appellants on the ground that donna acted with severe recklessness in disclosing the confidential information to burch.see christopher cutter,cir commenting that counsel strong reliance on an erroneous instruction in closing argument improperly guided the jury in its deliberations.it is also likely that whether donna disclosed the information for her personal benefit was not a factor in its deliberations 
rule of the federal rules of civil procedure provides the standard for harmless error.the rule states,in pertinent part 
no error in either the admission or the exclusion of evidence and no error or defect in any ruling or order or in anything done or omitted by the court or by any of the parties is ground for granting a new trial unless refusal to take such action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice.the court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.
the district court error,reinforced in the sec closing argument to the jury,affected the appellants substantial rights.under the circumstances,our failure to grant appellants a new trial would be inconsistent with substantial justice.we therefore vacate the district court judgment and remand the case for a new trial.
in conclusion,we affirm the district court decisions denying appellants motions for judgment as a matter of law.because we find prejudicial error in the district court instruction on the elements of the misappropriation theory of liability,we vacate the court judgment and remand the case for a new trial.
so ordered.
the district court opinion recites that the court imposed a penalty on each defendant.the court did so initially,but reduced the penalty to,apparently on its own initiative.
yun and burch also contend that the court erred in denying their motions for summary judgment.because,in our view,the evidence presented on summary judgment and on motion for judgment as a matter of law was the same in all material respects,our conclusion that the court did not err in denying the motions for judgment as a matter of law disposes of the summary judgment issues.
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the,here the sec,as we are required to do when reviewing the denial of a motion for summary judgment or judgment as a matter of law.see hyman nationwide mut.fire ins,cir.
david anticipated that donna would discuss this information with her attorney,but assumed her attorney would keep the information confidential.
the yun lived in an orlando,florida suburb.david office was in lake mary.donna office was in longwood.
a put option is an option contract that gives the holder of the option the right to sell a certain quantity of an underlying security to the writer of the option,at a specified price up to a specified date.the value of a put increases as the price of the stock decreases.
the broker,james whitley,advised burch that purchasing a put option is just a bet that could result in the loss of his entire investment.
some of the put options burch purchased expired within two days.the remaining options expired within a month.
in pertinent part,section b of the exchange act provides it shall be unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails,or of any facility of any national securities exchange b to use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any security not so registered,any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the sec may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors b.additional language was added to this subsection in but is irrelevant to the issues before us to its b rulemaking authority,the sec adopted rule,that provides,in pertinent part it shall be unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,a to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,or c to engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
in referring to the sec complaint,we actually refer to the sec amended complaint.as legal relief,the complaint sought the imposition of civil penalties pursuant to section a of the exchange act.as equitable relief,the complaint asked for an order enjoining the defendants from further violations of b and rule,directing them to disgorge the profits generated by burch trades,and directing burch to pay prejudgment interest.
in this opinion,the words confidential information mean material,nonpublic information.
this theory holds that a person commits fraud in connection with a securities transaction,and thereby violates b and rule,when he misappropriates confidential information for securities trading purposes,in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information,at.at.a person undisclosed,use of a principal information to purchase or sell securities is held to constitute a breach of duty of loyalty and confidentiality.id.
we think that a duty of loyalty and confidentiality is synonymous with a duty of trust and confidence,and,accordingly,we use the expressions interchangeably.
to join a to exploit the confidential information,and thereby subject to insider trading liability,a tippee must know,or have reason to know,that the tipper disclosed the information in breach of a fiduciary duty.see dirks sec,see also united states falcone,cir.
the seminal decision addressing tipper and tippee liability is dirks,at.at.in an action brought by the sec under the classical theory,the supreme court explained that tippee liability is based on a person role as a participant after the fact in the breach of duty that occurred when the tipping insider disclosed the information.id.at.quoting chiarella united states,d.that is,tippee liability arises only when the tippee joins his tipper in a to exploit the confidential information.if the tipper is found not to have breached a duty,then the tippee can not be held liable.courts which have considered the question of tipper and tippee liability in cases brought under the misappropriation theory have assumed that the approach taken in cases brought under the classical theory of liability applies.see,sec maio,cir.
the sec complaint used the words duty of trust and confidence to describe donna fiduciary duty to she would not share the confidential information he gave her about scholastic revised earnings forecast with anyone except her attorney.in this opinion,we treat the quoted words and the term fiduciary duty as synonymous.
the defendants answers also contained the affirmative defense of failure to state a claim for relief,which the court never addressed.
alternatively,the defendants moved the district court to grant them a new trial.a provides,in pertinent part a new trial may be granted in an action in which there has been a trial by jury,for any of the reasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted in actions at law in the courts of the united states the defendants motions for new trial specified no reason s for granting a new trial in this case.moreover,nowhere in their briefs to us do the defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion in denying their motions for new trial.we therefore make no further mention of the defendants motions for a new trial.instead,we focus our attention to the issues the defendants have raised in their briefs whether the district court erred in denying their rule b motions for judgment as a matter of law,and whether the court erred in charging the jury with respect to elements of the sec claims under b and rule.
