allen germain appeals from the district court final order approving the settlement of a securities class action lawsuit.germain,a class member in the instant action,is also a member of a class pursuing related litigation in canada canadian actions.germain is a canadian citizen who purchased his securities on the new york stock exchange nyse.germain argues that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claims of foreign stock purchasers or,in the alternative,should have declined jurisdiction as a matter of comity.in addition,germain argues that notice was inadequate and that the settlement is not fair,reasonable or adequate.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the decision of the district court.
cp ships cp ships or the company is a prominent container shipping company.it operates in several countries.the company is organized under the laws of canada and headquartered in london or gatwick,england.although officially headquartered in england during the class period january,to august,class period,crucial headquarters the relevant operations and personnel that were central to the fraud the accounting department and executive offices were located in tampa,florida.these accounting operations were micromanaged by defendant halliwell,first in his capacity as chief operating officer and later in his capacity as chief executive officer.halliwell was based in,and worked out of,the tampa office during the class period.roughly eighty percent of cp ships shares are traded on the toronto stock exchange tsx and roughly twenty percent are traded on the nyse.
from to,cp ships acquired nine different businesses.each business retained its own financial accounting system.in,cp ships instituted a single accounting platform sap over most of its businesses.after the sap implementation,the company announced that the transition had caused it to understate its operational costs.the company stock price dropped approximately percent on the nyse and percent on the tsx.the allegations in the instant case and the canadian actions are both based on this occurrence.
the instant class action asserts claims for securities fraud in violation of section b and a of the exchange act.on april,the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to meet the heightened requirements for pleading scienter under the private securities litigation reform act of pslra.the plaintiffs appealed to this court.while the appeal was pending,the parties agreed to settle for million.this is a small fraction of the original losses of to million alleged in the complaint.the settlement class includes the claims of some foreigners but specifically excludes the claims of canadian citizens who purchased cp ships stock on the tsx.
after notices of settlement were published,an objector,earl downey,argued that the settlement would prevent some members of the canadian class from pursuing their action in canada.the district court ultimately issued an order concluding that downey lacked standing to challenge the settlement.nonetheless,the plaintiffs issued a supplemental notice supplemental notice addressing some of his concerns.it included additional information about the canadian actions,including the contact information of the counsel in the canadian actions.there was an opportunity to opt out of the class after the supplemental notice.
on september,allen germain filed the instant objections to the settlement objections.the district court overruled the objections and approved the settlement.germain appealed.we first address subject matter jurisdiction,and then address germain merits challenges to the notice and to the fairness of the settlement.
standard of review 
the existence of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law we review de novo.pintando hous.agency,cir per curiam.this court reviews a district court approval of a settlement agreement for an abuse of discretion,christo padgett,cir,bearing in mind that p roponents of class action settlements bear the burden of developing a record demonstrating that the settlement distribution is fair,reasonable and adequate,holmes continental can,cir.
discussion 
subject matter jurisdiction 
first,we must determine whether germain raised a facial or factual attack on the existence of subject matter jurisdiction.then,we will address the question of jurisdiction itself.
a facial challenge 
a litigant generally may raise a court lack of jurisdiction at any time in the same civil action,even initially at the highest appellate instance.kontrick ryan,d.however,the parties may admit the existence of facts which show jurisdiction,and the courts may act judicially upon such an admission.ry.ramsey,wall.see also united states harty,cir although challenges to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time,the appellants argument is a factual challenge not raised before the district court.this court has repeatedly stated that arguments raised for the first time on appeal are waived.internal citations and quotations omitted 
thus,there are two types of challenges to the existence of subject matter jurisdiction.a facial attack on the complaint requires the court merely to look and see if the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a basis of subject matter jurisdiction,and the allegations in his complaint are taken as true for the purposes of the motion.mcelmurray consol.gov t of county,cir internal quotations and alterations omitted.factual attacks,on the other hand,challenge the existence of subject matter jurisdiction in fact,irrespective of the pleadings,and matters outside the pleadings,such as testimony and affidavits are considered.id.internal quotations omitted.in a factual challenge,the district court must give the plaintiff an opportunity for discovery and for a hearing that is appropriate to the nature of the motion to dismiss.williamson tucker,cir 
we conclude that germain raised only a facial challenge before the district court.germain did not advise the district court that he intended to raise a factual challenge.nor did germain request discovery or an evidentiary hearing.it is also clear from the transcript of the final approval hearing that germain was raising only a facial challenge to the complaint furthermore,the district court opinion expressly treats germain attack as facial,and he did not file a motion for reconsideration stating that he intended to mount a factual attack on the complaint 
furthermore,germain has not at any time expressly challenged any facts determinative of subject matter jurisdiction.as discussed below,the allegations in the complaint establish that substantial fraudulent activity occurred at cp ships tampa,florida,accounting office.on appeal,germain challenges only facts tangential to that conclusion.there is no evidence in the record to suggest that the district court in fact lacked subject matter jurisdiction rubin buckman,cir eisler stritzler,cir we will not remand simply to allow germain to embark on a fishing expedition.
accordingly,we turn to germain facial attack on the existence of subject matter jurisdiction.although germain himself,a canadian citizen,bought his securities on the nyse,he not only challenges the district court jurisdiction over similar plaintiffs,but also challenges the district court jurisdiction over other foreign investors who purchased on the tsx.
the allegations in the complaint 
it is well recognized that the securities exchange act is silent as to its extraterritorial application.itoba lep group plc,cir.thus,
w hen,as here,a court is confronted with transactions that on any view are predominantly foreign,it must seek to determine whether congress would have wished the precious resources of united states courts and law enforcement agencies to be devoted to them rather than leave the problem to foreign countries.
bersch drexel firestone,cir.the provisions and purposes of the securities exchange act serve as a guide.
the courts have reached two broad conclusions with respect to transnational securities frauds.first,it is consistent with the statutory scheme to infer that congress would have wanted to redress harms perpetrated abroad which have a substantial impact on investors or markets within the united states.morrison austl.bank,cir internal quotations omitted.second,congress did not mean the united states to be used as a base for fraudulent securities schemes even when the victims are foreigners bersch,at.
these principles have been distilled into two jurisdictional tests the conduct test and the effects test.berger,cir.the court asks whether the wrongful conduct occurred in the united states,and whether the wrongful conduct had a substantial effect in the united states or upon united states citizens.id.at.where appropriate,the two parts of the test are applied together because an admixture or combination of the two often gives a better picture of whether there is sufficient united states involvement to justify the exercise of jurisdiction by an american court.morrison,at internal quotations omitted.we conclude that the complaint alleges ample facts sufficient to establish subject matter jurisdiction under the conduct test over unnamed foreign class members who purchased on the tsx accordingly,we need not address the effects test.
jurisdiction exists under the conduct test when substantial acts in furtherance of the fraud were committed within the united states.berger,at internal quotations omitted.t he test is met whenever the defendant activities in the united states were more than merely preparatory to a securities fraud conducted elsewhere and the activities or culpable failures to act within the united states directly caused the claimed losses.id.internal quotations omitted.
the second circuit decision in berger is instructive.defendant michael berger formed an offshore investment company the fund organized under the laws of the british virgin islands.id.at.the fund maintained a brokerage account at a located in ohio and the majority of its assets and securities were held in the united states.id.berger,working in new york,created fraudulent account statements and forwarded them to the fund administrator in bermuda.id.at.the fund administrator,operating in bermuda,relied on these fraudulent calculations to prepare and mail monthly account statements to investors applying only the conduct test,the second circuit held that subject matter jurisdiction clearly exists over berger actions.id.at.clearly,the fraudulent scheme was masterminded and implemented by berger in the united states.id.
the circumstances of the instant case are analogous.cp ships is a foreign corporation.however,the complaint alleges that the sap conversion project occurred in the company tampa,florida,accounting offices,where key caused costs to be understated.the tampa offices then transmitted this false data to the company foreign offices,where it was incorporated into allegedly false and misleading financial statements that were disseminated from abroad.accordingly,we conclude that subject matter jurisdiction exists over cp ships actions.the allegedly fraudulent scheme was masterminded by halliwell and other executives operating out of tampa,and implemented in substantial part by those executives in tampa.
germain seeks to dissuade us.under the conduct test,germain asserts the accounting activity in tampa was merely preparatory to the creation and dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements outside the united states and the creation and dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements outside the united states rather than the manipulation of accounting information in tampa directly caused the claimed losses.for support,germain relies on the second circuit decision in morrison australia bank,cir.
in morrison,the plaintiffs brought a class action against,inter alia,national australia bank nab and its wholly owned american subsidiary homeside lending homeside.the plaintiffs alleged that homeside,a mortgage service provider,manipulated its internal books and records and sent false numbers from homeside florida headquarters to nab australia the allegedly false numbers were incorporated into public statements and disseminated from australia.id.at.the second circuit held 
the actions taken and the actions not taken by nab in australia were,in our view,significantly more central to the fraud and more directly responsible for the harm to investors than the manipulation of the numbers in florida.
id.at.after noting that homeside was merely a wholly owned,operational subsidiary,the court elaborated 
the responsibilities of nab australian corporate headquarters,on the other hand,included overseeing operations,including those of the subsidiaries,and reporting to shareholders and the financial community.nab,not homeside,is the publicly traded company,and its by lawyers,accountants,and primary responsibility for the corporation public filings,for its relations with investors,and for its statements to the outside world.
nab executives possess the responsibility to present accurate information to the investing public and to the holders of its ordinary shares in accordance with a host of accounting,legal and regulatory standards.when a statement or public filing fails to meet these standards,the responsibility,as a practical matter,lies in australia,not florida.
in other words,while homeside may have been the original source of the problematic numbers,those numbers had to pass through a number of checkpoints manned by nab australian personnel before reaching investors.while homeside rigging of the numbers may have contributed to the misinformation,a number of significant events needed to occur before this misinformation caused losses to investors.this lengthy chain of causation between what homeside did and the harm to investors weighs against our exercising subject matter jurisdiction.
id.at.in holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over foreign plaintiffs who purchased on foreign exchanges,the second circuit placed primary reliance on the fact that all the executives with responsibility for ensuring the accuracy of information provided to the investing public operated out of australia,and all of the actions of those executives in verifying such information occurred in australia.in addition,the second circuit relied upon the lengthy chain of causation between the american contribution to the misstatements and the harm to investors.id.at.in other words,those numbers had to pass through a number of check points manned by nab australian personnel before reaching investors.id.at.
we conclude that the instant case is distinguishable.the complaint in this case alleges 
defendant halliwell was chief operating officer and a director and member of the executive committee of cp ships during the class period.from may through the end of the class period halliwell served as the company chief executive officer he was based in,and worked out of the company tampa offices throughout the class period d efendant halliwell made materially false and misleading statements contained in the company releases signed the company materially false and misleading sec filings.
complaint at.the complaint continues 
although cp ships is officially headquartered in england,most headquarters the relevant operations and personnel which were central to the misconduct in this case throughout the class located in the company offices in tampa,florida.the tampa offices contained,inter alia,the company accounting department and the executive offices on the floor which housed key cp ships executives,including ceo halliwell.
complaint at.in paragraph,the complaint alleges that the sap conversion project occurred in tampa.this standard accounting platform was implemented in january,and was used in the may,press release to excuse or explain the initial revelation that the financial results for had to be revised.this press release is challenged in the complaint as being false and misleading it allegedly buried and downplayed the needed revision,both understating the significance thereof,and misleadingly stating that it did not affect the company outlook.this may,press release,and the related statements and sec filings,were issued after halliwell had been promoted from his chief operating officer position to chief executive officer of the company,an
