introduction 
defendants,cibc world markets cibc and daniel miller,appeal from an order denying a petition to compel arbitration of employment and defamation claims brought by plaintiff,michael mcmanus.on appeal,we conclude that the order denying the petition to compel arbitration must be reversed the dispute between the parties must be arbitrated but that plaintiff may not be required to pay certain costs of the arbitration.
ii.background 
cibc is a national investment bank and of securities.cibc is a member of the national association of securities dealers,nasd and the new york stock exchange nyse.the nasd and the nyse are organizations that exercise a primary supervisory role over the securities market and its participants,subject to oversight by the securities and exchange commission sec.upon being hired by cibc as a director of its consumer growth division,plaintiff signed two arbitration agreements.the first arbitration agreement was contained in an offer letter agreement dated january,and it provides all disputes arising out of your employment or the termination of your employment at cibc world markets,including any statutory claims based upon discrimination,will be submitted to and resolved exclusively by a panel of arbitrators from the nasd dispute resolution,or the new york stock exchange.all discovery in any such dispute will be in accordance with california state court procedures.all such disputes will be governed by california law.in agreeing to arbitration of your claims,you recognize that you are giving up your right to a court or jury trial.the second arbitration agreement was in the uniform application for securities industry registration or transfer form.all applicants must sign the form agreement to arbitrate as a condition of employment in order to register with nasd and nyse.page,paragraph of form provides i agree to arbitrate any dispute,claim or controversy that may arise between me and my firm,or a customer,or any other person,that is required to be arbitrated under the rules,constitutions,or of the sros indicated in item as may be amended from time to time and that any arbitration award rendered against me may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
on january,plaintiff filed a complaint in superior court against cibc in which he asserted five causes of action violation of labor code section et,for failure to pay wages first promissory estoppel second wrongful termination in violation of public policy third defamation fourth and violation of labor code sections and involving the alleged failure to provide the opportunity to inspect and permit copying of personnel documents fifth.plaintiff asserted the defamation claim against miller,who was a financial analyst at cibc.the complaint alleged that plaintiff was terminated for conduct which arose after miller arranged a beach party for cibc employees.plaintiff became intoxicated at the party.as a result,miller drove to plaintiff home.the two men were accompanied by miller wife.miller and plaintiff subsequently walked into a bar.miller and plaintiff began to fight while in the bar.according to the complaint,the millers falsely accused plaintiff of sexually harassing miller.plaintiff alleged that this alleged conduct was used as a pretext for firing him to avoid paying him salary and bonuses as promised.plaintiff also alleged that a false police report was filed against him regarding the incident with the millers.
on february,cibc filed a motion to compel arbitration of the dispute based on the two aforementioned agreements.miller joined in the motion to compel arbitration.plaintiff opposed the motion to compel arbitration on the ground the aforementioned agreements were unenforceable because they were substantively and procedurally unconscionable under california law.plaintiff argued the arbitration agreements were procedurally unconscionable because they were presented on a take or leave it basis his declaration demonstrated,as a prerequisite of employment,he was required to sign the form and the offer letter and he was told that he would not be hired unless he signed both documents.
on march,the trial court granted the motion to compel arbitration.on april,plaintiff filed a mandate petition with this court.mcmanus superior court.cibc and miller did not file a response to the petition.on june,we issued an order to show cause to the superior court which stated in part y ou are ordered to show cause why the relief prayed for in the petition for writ of mandated filed april,should not be granted.see mercuro superior court th,d doctor associates,casarotto,fn,d perry thomas,d,fn,art.vi,cl.we did not issue an alternative writ of mandate.on july,in response to the order to show cause,the trial court set aside and vacated its march,order granting the motion to compel arbitration.the trial court then entered a new order denying the motion to compel arbitration.on july,we discharged the order to show cause and dismissed the petition for writ of mandate as moot.thereafter,defendants filed a timely notice of appeal from the order denying the motion to compel arbitration.
iii.discussion 
introduction 
defendants contend the united states arbitration act mandates this dispute be arbitrated.the employment contract is between an investment bank and a director of consumer growth,which involves commerce,and,as such is subject to the limited preemptive effect of the united states arbitration act,circuit city stores,adams,d terminix companies,dobson,d perry thomas,supra,at.there is a public policy in favor of arbitration under federal and state law.moses cone hospital mercury const,d armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,california law,like federal law,favors enforcement of valid arbitration agreements armendariz,supra,hereafter.
the united states arbitration act provides in relevant part,a written provision in any contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction,or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof,or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract,transaction,or refusal,shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.see eeoc waffle house,d.thus,an arbitration contract must be enforced according to its terms but is nevertheless subject to state law defenses applicable to all contract disputes under general contract law principles,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability.doctor associates,casarotto,supra,at.terminix companies,dobson,supra,at.a state court may not invalidate arbitration agreements under state laws that are only applicable to arbitration provisions.doctor associates,casarotto,supra,at.terminix companies,dobson,supra,at.a legislative enactment that is unique to an arbitration agreement which invalidates a duty to arbitrate a dispute is invalid under the supremacy clause because this might allow state courts to avoid the preemptive effect of the united states arbitration act.perry thomas,supra,at.southland keating,d.not only are state legislatures barred from enacting laws that single out arbitration clauses,but courts may not,in assessing the rights of litigants,judicially construe an agreement to arbitrate differently from nonarbitration agreements.doctor associates,casarotto,supra,at,fn.perry thomas,supra,at,fn.the question of whether a valid agreement to arbitrate exists is determined by reference to state law applicable to contracts generally.perry thomas,supra,at.chan drexel burnham lambert,d.if the extrinsic evidence is undisputed,an appellate court reviews an arbitration contract de novo to determine whether it is legally enforceable.mercuro superior court,supra,th at,d flores transamerica homefirst,th,d.
b.the unconscionability issue 
plaintiff argues the motion to compel arbitration was properly denied because the two arbitration clauses were unenforceable on the ground they were unconscionable,code civ.civil code section sets forth standards for unconscionability as follows if the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract,or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause,or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.
courts analyze the unconscionability standard in civil code section as invoking elements of procedural and substantive unconscionability.kinney united healthcare services,th,d stirlen supercuts,th,d.the procedural element of unconscionability focuses on whether the contract is one of adhesion.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,mercuro superior court,supra,th at,d.procedural unconscionability focuses on whether there is oppression arising from an inequality of bargaining power or surprise arising from buried terms in a complex printed form.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,mercuro superior court,supra,th at,d.the substantive element addresses the existence of overly harsh or terms.little auto stiegler,cal th,d,armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.an agreement to arbitrate is unenforceable only if both the procedural and substantive elements are satisfied.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,mercuro superior court,supra,th at,d.however,armendariz held,t he more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.cal th at,d,see also kinney united healthcare services,supra,th at,d.
preemption 
defendants argue the california definition of unconscionability and the requirements of armendariz are preempted to the extent that they conflict with the federal system of arbitration created by the sec adoption of form and its signature requirements and the commission approval of the nasd and nyse arbitration rules.pursuant to its regulatory authority,the sec has approved the arbitration procedures of nasd and nyse,which are at issue in this case.express,mcmahon,d see nicholson cpc intern.cir.the sec has also approved amendments to the nasd and nyse arbitration procedures that exempt employment discrimination claims.nasd code of arbitration procedure rule nyse rule.under federal and state law,plaintiff was required to sign the form,with the nasd or nyse,and to be bound by the sec arbitration procedures.of,tit.
there is a division of authority concerning the application of state law unconscionability principles as they relate to broker employment agreements which require mandatory arbitration under procedures that have been approved by the sec.there is authority that state law unconscionability principles may be considered in determining whether execution of the form renders the agreement unenforceable.see koveleskie sbc capital markets,cir,concluding that execution of form as a condition of employment was not an unconscionable contract of adhesion but considered the issue under illinois law hope superior court d.stock broker agreement requiring mandatory arbitration was contract of adhesion see also baker aubry d.question of the existence of valid agreement to scope and construction of arbitration clause determined by federal law but existence of valid agreement to arbitrate under form determined under state law see also duffield robertson stephens cir,concluding arbitration clause was invalid because form presented on take basis.
by contrast,a number of decisions give substantial deference to the fact that the sec has approved of mandatory arbitration procedures and conclude that agreements are not unconscionable without reference to state law principles.see seus john nuveen,cir,concluding terms of form are not so as to be oppressive cohen wedbush,noble,cooke,cir,overruled on related ground in ticknor choice hotels,cir,federal public policy favoring arbitration coupled with the extensive regulatory oversight performed by the sec in this area,compel the conclusion that agreements to arbitrate are not unconscionable as a matter of law heily superior court d.former stockbroker employee could not assert state law contract unconscionability principles to oppose mandatory arbitration of claims under nyse which were not unconscionable under the united states arbitration act tonetti shirley d.california adhesion contract principles are inapplicable to enforcement of arbitration provision see also stirlen supercuts,supra,th at,d noting that california courts are unwilling to impose different criteria of unconscionability issue in securities industries cases because it has been so heavily litigated in federal courts.
most of the cases which have concluded the form was not unconscionable as a matter of law have relied on gilmer lane,d.in gilmer,the plaintiff,a securities employee,was required to register with the nyse as a condition of employment.his registration application contained the form application mandating arbitration of disputes.id.at.gilmer addressed the employee contention the arbitration agreement was unenforceable because of unequal bargaining power between employers and employees.id.at.gilmer stated mere inequality in bargaining power,however,is not a sufficient reason to hold that arbitration agreements are never enforceable in the employment context.relationships between securities dealers and investors,for example,may involve unequal bargaining power,but we nevertheless held in rodriguez de quijas,d and express,mcmahon,supra,at,d that agreements to arbitrate in that context are enforceable t he faa purpose was to place arbitration agreements on the same footing as other contracts.thus,arbitration agreements are enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocations of any contract.of course,courts should remain attuned to claims that the agreement to arbitrate resulted from the sort of fraud or overwhelming economic power that would provide grounds for revocation of any contract.citation.there is no indication in this case,however,that the employee,an experienced businessman,was coerced or defrauded into agreeing to the arbitration clause in his registration application.as with the claimed procedural inadequacies discussed above,this claim of unequal bargaining power is best left for resolution in specific cases.id.at,italics added.
thus,rather than concluding that the form was not unconscionable as a matter of law,gilmer stated that the issue was best left for resolution in specific cases.see lagatree luce,forward,hamilton scripps th,d reviewing cases since gilmer and stating that execution of the form as a condition of employment is not invalid per se but noting that an unconscionability claim is best left for resolution in specific cases.this case by case approach is consistent with authorities holding state law adhesion contract principles may be relied upon to invalidate arbitration agreements without violating the united states arbitration act if they are applied to contracts in general.doctor associates,casarotto,supra,at.terminix companies,dobson,supra,at.volt infor.sciences leland stanford,d perry thomas,supra,at.see also ticknor choice hotels,supra,at armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.there is no preemption by the united states arbitration act unless the state legislation or judicial decisional authority is aimed at arbitration agreements.doctor associates,casarotto,supra,at.ticknor choice hotels,supra,at in all situations where arbitration provisions are placed upon the same footing as other contracts,state law applies.
procedural unconscionability 
application of the above stated principles shows that the arbitration clauses are procedurally unconscionable in that they are adhesive.the evidence established that as a condition of employment,plaintiff was required to sign the form to be registered to sell or trade securities.under federal and state law,plaintiff was required to register with the nasd and nyse.as a result,plaintiff was subject to the nasd and nyse arbitration procedures.of,tit,see fn.ante.plaintiff was advised he would not be hired if he did not sign the form.the court of appeal has held,when the weaker party is presented the clause and told to take it or leave it without the opportunity for meaningful negotiation,oppression,and therefore procedural unconscionability,are present.szetela discover bank th,d mercuro superior court,supra,th at,d see also ferguson countrywide credit industries,cir.because the employee was bound by the offer letter and the form as a condition of employment,the arbitration agreements are adhesive.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,mercuro superior court,supra,th at,d.the fact that the arbitration clauses are adhesive does not as a matter of law render them unenforceable.rather,as noted above,a sliding scale is invoked whereby the more procedurally oppressive the arbitration clause is,the less evidence of substantive unconscionability is required to warrant the conclusion that the agreements to arbitrate are unenforceable.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,mercuro superior court,supra,th at,d.
defendants argue that because plaintiff was required by the two aforementioned regulations to sign the forms requiring he arbitrate his claims,no procedural unconscionability finding can be utilized to bar enforcement under the provisions of united states arbitration act.here is the problem with that contention.as noted previously,united states code,title section,requires an arbitration agreement be enforced subject to state law defenses,including unconscionability,applicable to all contracts.doctor associates,casarotto,supra,at.terminix companies,dobson,supra,at.civil code section,which has been construed to permit a finding of procedural unconscionability when a contract is offered on a take it or leave it basis by a party with greater bargaining power,applies to all contractual clauses including agreements to arbitrate.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,pardee construction superior court th,d kinney united healthcare services,supra,th at,d stirlen supercuts,supra,th at,d westlye look sports,th,d carboni arrospide th,fn,d appalachian ins.mcdonnell douglas d.perlin morse signal devices d.hence,the preemptive effect of the united states arbitration act found in title,united states code,section,is limited by california contractual unconscionability law which applies to all contracts and contractual clauses.the fact that an employee in the securities industry is required to enter into an agreement on a basis with no opportunity for negotiation on the issue of arbitration does not alter the scope of the preemptive effect of title,united states code,section,as limited by california contractual unconscionability law.in fact,as noted previously,title,united states code,section expressly recognizes that a duty to arbitrate can be vitiated by a state contractual unconscionability law when it applies to all contracts.as will be noted,in this case,california contractual unconscionability law does not bar the enforcement of the present arbitration clauses or otherwise frustrate the limited preemptive effect of title,united states code,section.
substantive unconscionability 
a plaintiff contentions 
plaintiff argues that the agreements are substantively unconscionable because there is an unlawful fee allocation scheme there is no neutral selection of arbitrators but mandatory nasd or nyse arbitration with the exception of statutory discrimination claims for which nasd modified its rules,there is no requirement that the arbitrator be a lawyer or judge there are no discovery rights the arbitrators are not required to state reasons for the award and there is no mutual obligation to arbitrate.we address each of these arguments in the order in which they are presented.
b the costs of arbitration 
it is unlawful to require an employee who is bound by a mandatory employment arbitration agreement to pay the costs of arbitration.little auto stiegler,supra,cal th at,d,armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.in armendariz,the california supreme court stated,w hen an employer imposes mandatory arbitration as a condition of employment,the arbitration agreement or arbitration process can not generally require the employee to bear any type of expense that the employee would not be required to bear if her or she were free to bring the action in court.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,orig.italics see fittante palm springs motors,th,d.with regard to the arbitration of statutory claims,armendariz concluded that it is an insufficient judicial response to hold that the fees may ultimately be cancelled because such a system poses a significant risk of chilling the exercise of statutory rights.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,see fittante palm springs motors,supra,th at,d.
in this case,plaintiff may be obligated to pay a deposit of plus per anticipated hearing session.this is beyond any expense that an employee would be required to bear if the action was brought in court.because the fee provision created a risk that the employee would be required to pay unreasonable costs at the time the employer imposed mandatory arbitration clauses as a condition of employment,it was unenforceable,little auto stiegler,supra,cal th at,d,armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.
c the selection of arbitrators 
plaintiff contends the arbitration clauses are substantively unconscionable because of the mandatory arbitrator selection process.plaintiff reasons that a process whereby a claimant has no right to consent to an arbitrator is substantively unconscionable.relying on mercuro superior court,supra,th at pages,d,plaintiff argues the selection process suffers from the repeat player effect in that the employer repeatedly appears before the same group of arbitrators.mercuro concluded that the process at issue conveyed distinct advantages over the individual employee.mercuro superior court,supra,th at,d.although under the circumstances in mercuro the agreement was unconscionable,our division seven colleagues concluded that the repeat player effect was insufficient in itself to render an arbitration agreement unconscionable.id.at,d accord,armendariz,supra,cal th,d.one of the circumstances found to be unconscionable in mercuro were that under procedures by the national arbitration forum,eight such arbitrators were eligible to serve as arbitrators within the applicable rules.mercuro superior court,supra,th at,d.in addition,the arbitrator was selected by the national arbitration forum and the employee was not permitted to participate in the selection process,at,d.
plaintiff has presented no evidence that the nasd or nyse arbitration procedures would entail a repeat player effect.moreover,in this case,employees are allowed to participate in the selection process.nasd code of arbitration procedures,rules b nyse,rule.the rules provide that the arbitrators must disclose circumstances that might preclude an objective and impartial determination including financial and personal interests in the outcome.nasd code of arbitration procedures,rule nyse,rule.the employment histories of the arbitrators are made available to the parties.nasd code of arbitration procedures,rule nyse,rule see fn,supra.each party is given one peremptory challenge and an unlimited number of challenges for cause.nasd code of arbitration procedures,rule a nyse,rule.in addition,the agreement provides that the arbitrator and the arbitration provider are subject to standards through of california ethics standards for neutral arbitrators in contractual arbitration.further,the arbitrators are subject to disclosure duties pursuant to code of civil procedure section an award must be set aside if the arbitrator neglects to disclose a ground for disqualification as required by code of civil procedure section or fails to recuse himself or herself upon receipt upon a recusal demand.code civ,subd.a.plaintiff has not established that these comprehensive selection procedures render the agreement substantively unconscionable.gilmer lane,supra,at parr superior court d.
d the fact there is no requirement the arbitrator be a lawyer or a retired judge 
plaintiff argues,with the exception of statutory discrimination claims for which nasd has modified its rules,there is no requirement that the arbitrator be a lawyer or judge.without citation to any authority,plaintiff argues only a lawyer or retired judge can evaluate his statutory wage claims in the complaint.judicial suspicions about the competency of arbitral tribunals may not inhibit enforcement of the arbitration provisions subject to the limited preemptive effect of the united states arbitration act.mitsubishi motors soler,d,mcmahon,supra,at.it is firmly established that the arbitral forum can adequately protect an employee statutory and other rights.gilmer lane,supra,at.koveleskie sbc capital markets,supra,at seus john nuveen,supra,at.
e the discovery procedures 
plaintiff claim that he has no discovery rights lacks merit.there are extensive discovery procedures under nasd and nyse providing for document production,information exchanges,and subpoenas.nasd code of arbitration procedures,rule nyse,rule further,under the nasd and nyse rules,an arbitrator retains broad powers to resolve prehearing disclosure disputes including directing production of documents,issuance of subpoenas,and appearances of witnesses.nasd code of arbitration procedures,rule d e nyse,rule d e.further,plaintiff third cause of action is for wrongful termination in violation of fundamental public policy.armendariz deems the provisions of code of civil procedure section as incorporated into an arbitration clause involving a fair employment and housing act claim.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,see craig brown root,th,d.the california supreme court has explicitly held the armendariz requirements also apply to a claim for wrongful termination in violation of fundamental public policy.little auto stiegler,supra,cal th at,d.no showing has been made that the discovery procedures are substantively unconscionable.see gilmer lane,supra,at.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.
moreover,we disagree with plaintiff the deposition and interrogatory procedure set forth in nasd,rule f,which applies to large or complex cases,renders the arbitration agreements unenforceable.nasd,rule f provides arbitrators are authorized to order,at the request of a party,the deposition of,or the propounding of interrogatories to,persons who may possess information relevant to the disposition of an eligible matter and who may not be available to testify at the hearings.unless otherwise agreed to by the parties,depositions or interrogatories shall be limited to determining and preserving testimony and facts relevant to the determination of the matter,not for conducting discovery.unless otherwise agreed to by the parties,interrogatories shall be limited to twenty questions,including parts and subparts.arbitrators are authorized to order depositions or site review.the arbitration agreement in the offer letter specifically provides all discovery will be conducted in accordance with california state court procedures.accordingly,the parties have already agreed that they are bound by california civil discovery act code civ,et so that nasd,rule f is inapplicable to this case.no substantive unconscionability finding is warranted on inadequate discovery grounds.
f the written opinion 
plaintiff further contends that the arbitrators are not required to provide a reasoned award because,under nasd,rule g,the parties must specifically agree that the award be accompanied by a statement of reasons or basis for the award.this argument lacks merit because nasd,rule g provides in its entirety the award of the arbitrators shall be in the form prescribed in rule.in addition,all parties may specifically agree that the award shall be accompanied by a statement of reasons or basis of the award.nasd,rule requires that all arbitration awards be in writing.the awards must contain a summary of issues,a description of the award,and a statement of any other issues resolved.ibid.the awards must be made available to the public.ibid.likewise,nyse,rule specifically provides for arbitration awards to be in writing and summary of the issues.in addition,under both nasd,rule and nyse,rule,a verbatim transcript of the proceedings must be maintained.see gilmer lane,supra,at.fn.finding such procedures to be sufficient to ensure that under limited judicial review of whether arbitrators comply with the requirements of the law,mcmahon,supra,at.nasd,rule g does not render the arbitration agreements substantively unconscionable.
g the mutual obligation to arbitrate 
plaintiff contends that nasd,rule is substantively unconscionable because injunctive relief is exempted from the arbitration agreement.plaintiff claims that the exemption creates a unilateral right because the employer is the party most likely to bring such a request.an arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable if it requires the employee but not the employer to arbitrate claims.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.if the employer imposes the arbitration agreement as a condition of employment,it is not sufficient that the employer agrees to be bound by the arbitrator resolution of the employee claims.id.at,d.
in this case,the offer letter provides,all disputes arising out of your employment or the termination of your employment will be submitted to and resolved exclusively by a panel of arbitrators from the nasd dispute resolution,or the new york stock exchange.this language creates a mutual obligation to compel cibc to arbitrate any claims against the employee.little auto stiegler,supra,cal th at pp,fn,d,hour fitness,superior court th,d.in addition,as plaintiff concedes,nasd and nyse rules contain language which mutually bind the parties to arbitration.nasd code of arbitration procedures,rule nyse,rule a see also gilmer lane,supra,at.desiderio national of securities dealers,cir.
furthermore,mercuro superior court,supra,th at pages,d,upon which plaintiff relies,does not support his argument that the existence of an injunctive relief exemption from arbitration renders the present agreement unenforceable.in mercuro the arbitration agreement excluded certain injunctive relief claims involving intellectual property violations,unfair competition,or unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets or confidential information.there is no such exemption in this case to render the agreements substantively unconscionable.see little auto stiegler,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
severability 
defendants contend that any unconscionable provisions may be severed from the agreement,thereby allowing the arbitration to proceed.an agreement to arbitrate may be enforced if the unconscionable provisions can be severed from the agreement.little auto stiegler,supra,cal th at,d,armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.the overreaching inquiry in such cases is whether the interests of justice will be furthered by severance.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,beynon garden grove medical group d.in armendariz,the court held the basic principles of severability that emerge from civil code section and the case law of illegal contracts appear fully applicable to the doctrine of unconscionability.courts are to look to the various purposes of the contract.if the central purpose of the contract is tainted with illegality,then the contract as a whole can not be enforced.if the illegality is collateral to the main purpose of the contract,and the illegal provision can be extirpated from the contract by means of severance or restriction,then such severance and restriction are appropriate.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,see blake ecker th,d.
as we concluded above,the arbitration clauses are procedurally unconscionable because they must be executed as a condition of employment.however,the arbitration agreements,specifically the execution of form,are mandated by federal and state law.the agreements are substantively unconscionable in that,at the time of execution,they created the risk that the employee would be required to pay costs prohibited by armendariz,supra,cal th at pages,d,and little auto stiegler,supra,cal th at pages,d.plaintiff has failed to demonstrate the existence of additional substantive unconscionable provisions in the arbitration procedures or that the agreements were permeated with unfairness.thus,with the exception of the cost provision,the arbitration agreements are otherwise enforceable.the arbitration agreements are not so permeated with unconscionable provisions that it can not be saved.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,compare mercuro superior court,supra,th at,d.accordingly,the unconscionable provision requiring payment of the fees can be severed from the arbitration agreements.little auto stiegler,supra,cal th at,d,saika gold th,d beynon garden grove medical group,supra,d at.
judicial notice of federal lawsuit 
plaintiff has requested we take judicial notice of a complaint filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california by the nasd dispute resolution against the california judicial council,chief justice ronald george,and other judicial council members.the lawsuit was brought to challenge the applicability of new arbitrator disclosure requirements to nasd and nyse arbitrations.it has been dismissed under eleventh amendment grounds and is on appeal before the ninth circuit.nasd dispute resolution,judicial council d.plaintiff asserts that the federal court appeal has been brought to delay resolution of the lawsuit because the nasd and nyse have been refusing to process arbitration matters due to the adoption of the code of civil procedure section and the ethical standards for neutral arbitrators in contractual arbitration promulgated by the judicial council.of course,plaintiff inability to have an arbitrator appointed is subject to the right to petition the court to appoint an arbitrator.code civ.in any event,the federal lawsuit is not relevant to the issues raised by the appeal.accordingly,the judicial notice request is denied.navellier sletten cal th,fn,d,thompson department of corrections cal th,fn,d.
iv.disposition 
the order denying the petition to compel arbitration is reversed.the trial court is to enter a new order granting the motion to compel arbitration consistent with the views concerning arbitration costs set forth in this opinion.defendants,cibc world markets and daniel miller,are entitled to their costs on appeal from plaintiff,michael mcmanus.
i concur in the result.i do so because the record does not suggest to what extent the employment agreement and the cost provision of the arbitration clause or of the applicable arbitration rules were negotiable.the supreme court in armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,armendariz stated,we conclude that when an employer imposes mandatory arbitration as a condition of employment,the arbitration agreement or arbitration process can not generally require the employee to bear any type of expense that the employee would not be required to bear if he or she were free to bring the action in court.thus,although arbitration clauses imposed in employment contracts generally are subject to certain cost least in some types of may be employment agreements to which armendariz requirements for arbitration do not apply.the supreme court rejection of a approach to arbitration costs little auto stiegler,cal th,d,concerned evaluations of provisions,not whether the employment arrangement was subject to the minimum procedure requirements set forth in armendariz.
code of civil procedure section states,a written agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy thereafter arising is valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.code of civil procedure section states in pertinent part on petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy,the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists,unless it determines that a the right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner or b grounds exist for the revocation of the agreement 
nasd code of arbitration procedure rule states in pertinent part a except as provided in paragraph b,a dispute,claim,or controversy eligible for submission arising out of the employment or termination of employment of such associated person s with such member,shall be arbitrated under this code b a claim alleging employment discrimination,including a sexual harassment claim,in violation of a statute is not required to be arbitrated.such a claim may be arbitrated only if the parties have agreed to arbitrate it,either before or after the dispute arose.nyse rule states in part a any dispute shall be arbitrated under the constitution and rules of the new york stock exchange,f any claim alleging employment discrimination,including any sexual harassment claims,in violation of a statute shall be eligible for submission to arbitration under these rules only where the parties have agreed to arbitrate the claim after it has arisen.
code of federal regulations section states in relevant part no registered broker or dealer shall effect any transaction in,or induce the purchase or sale of,any security unless any natural person associated with such broker or dealer who effects or is involved in effecting such transaction is registered or approved in accordance with the standards of training,experience,competence,and other qualification standards including but not limited to submitting and maintaining all required forms established by the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association california code of regulations,title,section states in part the procedures set forth in this section are applicable to licensed pursuant to subdivisions a and b of section of the code.a upon employment of an individual as an agent,a shall obtain a properly executed application for registration,on the uniform application for securities industry registration and transfer form revised form b a who registers its agents with the national association of securities dealers regulation,the nasdr,shall upon the employment of an individual as an agent,file the form,through the central registration depository the crd of the nasdr in accordance with its procedures the filing of form with the crd does not constitute an automatic approval through the crd.should not consider an agent registration through the crd approved until approved by the commissioner and the approval has been received through the crd.if requested by the commissioner,additional information,documentation or details pertaining to the form or properly executed fingerprint cards of the agent must be filed directly with the commissioner within days from the date of the request.in accordance with section,the form may be abandoned if the commissioner does not receive the requested information within the time prescribed.the commissioner shall reject through the crd an abandoned form file an amendment to the form through the crd within days when there are any changes to the information contained in the original form.if the form is being amended due to a disciplinary occurrence,a copy of the amendment shall be filed with the commissioner upon request.
