these,there are two,but for all practical purposes they may be treated as us to determine whether virtual shares in an enterprise existing only in cyberspace fall within the purview of the federal securities laws.sg,a dominican corporation,and its affiliate,sg trading collectively,sg or defendants,asseverate that the virtual shares were part of a fantasy investment game created for the personal entertainment of internet users,and therefore,that those shares do not implicate the federal securities laws.the securities and exchange commission the sec,plaintiff below and appellant here,counters that substance ought to prevail over form,and that merely labeling a website as a game should not negate the applicability of the securities laws.the district court accepted the defendants view and dismissed the sec complaint.sec sg,d.concluding,as we do,that the sec alleged sufficient facts to state a triable claim,we reverse.
background 
we take the facts as alleged in the sec first amended complaint shorn,however,of empty rhetoric.aulson blanchard,cir.
the underlying litigation was spawned by sg operation of a stockgeneration website offering denizens an opportunity to purchase shares in eleven different virtual companies listed on the website virtual stock exchange.sg arbitrarily set the purchase and sale prices of each of these imaginary companies in biweekly rounds,and guaranteed that investors could buy or sell any quantity of shares at posted prices.sg placed no upper limit on the amount of funds that an investor could squirrel away in its virtual offerings.
the sec complaint focused on shares in a particular virtual enterprise referred to by sg as the privileged company,and so do we.sg advised potential purchasers to pay particular attention to shares in the privileged company and boasted that investing in those shares was a game without any risk.to this end,its website announced that the privileged company shares would unfailingly appreciate,boldly proclaiming that t he share price of the privileged company is supported by the owners of sg,this is why its value constantly rises on average at a rate of monthly this is approximately annually.to add plausibility to this representation and to allay anxiety about future pricing,sg published prices of the privileged company shares one month in advance.
while sg conceded that a decline in the share price was theoretically possible,it assured prospective participants that under the rules governing the fall in prices,the share price for the privileged company can not fall by more than in a round.to bolster this claim,it vouchsafed that shares in the privileged company were supported by several distinct revenue streams.according to sg representations,capital inflow from new participants provided liquidity for existing participants who might choose to sell their virtual shareholdings.as a backstop,sg pledged to allocate an indeterminate portion of the profits derived from its website operations to a special reserve fund designed to maintain the price of the privileged company shares.sg asserted that these profits emanated from four sources the collection of a commission on each transaction conducted on its virtual stock exchange the spread on the virtual shares the skillful manipulation of the share prices of eight particular imaginary companies,not including the privileged company,listed on the virtual stock exchange and sg right to sell shares of three other virtual companies including the privileged company.as a further hedge against adversity,sg alluded to the availability of auxiliary stabilization funds which could be tapped to ensure the continued operation of its virtual stock exchange.
sg website contained lists of purported big winners,an internet bulletin board featuring testimonials from supposedly satisfied participants,and descriptions of incentive programs that held out the prospect of rewards for such activities as the referral of new participants,sg representation that it would pay,or of the referred player highest of the first three payments and the establishment of affiliate websites.
at least united states domiciliaries,paying real cash,purchased virtual shares in the virtual companies listed on the defendants virtual stock exchange.in the fall of,over in participants funds was deposited into a latvian bank account in the name of sg trading.the following spring,more than was deposited in estonian bank accounts standing in the names of sg and sg perfect,respectively.
in late,participants began to experience difficulties in redeeming their virtual shares.on march,these difficulties crested sg unilaterally suspended all pending requests to withdraw funds and sharply reduced participants account balances in all companies except the privileged company.two weeks later,sg peremptorily announced a reverse stock split,which caused the share prices of all companies listed on the virtual stock exchange,including the privileged company,to plummet to of their previous values.at about the same time,sg stopped responding to participant requests for the return of funds,yet continued to solicit new participants through its website.
the sec undertook an investigation into sg activities,which culminated in the filing of a civil action in federal district court.the sec complaint alleged,in substance,that sg operations constituted a fraudulent scheme in violation of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.see securities act of a,c,a,c offer,sale,or delivery of unregistered securities id.a,a fraud in offer or sale of securities securities exchange act of b,b sec rule,fraud in connection with purchase or sale of securities.the sec sought injunctive relief,disgorgement,and civil penalties.
the district court entered a temporary restraining order subsequently converted to a preliminary injunction blocking sg operation of the website pendente lite.the court also instituted an asset freeze that infrigidated approximately.the sec success was after some skirmishing,not relevant here,the district court granted sg motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cognizable claim on the ground that the virtual shares were a clearly marked and defined game lacking a business context.see sec sg,d at.the sec immediately appealed,and we issued a stay keeping both the preliminary injunction and the asset freeze in place for the time being.
these appeals hinge on whether the district court erred in ruling that transactions in the privileged company shares did not constitute transactions in securities.in the pages that follow,we explore the makeup of that particular type of security known as an investment contract examine the district court rationale and apply the tripartite investment contract test to the facts as alleged.because the lower court dismissed the sec first amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief might be granted.b,we conduct a de novo review,accepting as true all factual averments and indulging all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.aulson,at.if the facts contained in the complaint,viewed in this favorable light,justify recovery under any applicable legal theory,we must set aside the order of dismissal.conley gibson,d aulson,at.
ii.the legal landscape 
these appeals turn on whether the sec alleged facts which,if proven,would bring this case within the jurisdictional ambit of the federal securities laws.consequently,we focus on the type of security that the sec alleges is apposite here investment contracts.
investment contracts.
the applicable regulatory regime rests on two complementary pillars the securities act of,and the securities exchange act of.these statutes employ nearly identical definitions of the term security.see securities act of a,a securities exchange act of a,a.congress intended these sweeping definitions,set forth in an appendix hereto,to encompass a wide array of financial instruments,ranging from investment vehicles,stocks and bonds to much more arcane arrangements.sec joiner leasing.included in this array is the elusive,essentially protean,concept of an investment contract.
judicial efforts to delineate what what is investment contract are grounded in the seminal case of sec howey.the howey court established a tripartite test to determine whether a particular financial instrument constitutes an investment contract and,hence,a security.this test has proven durable.under it,an investment contract comprises the investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits to be derived solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.id.at.this formulation must be applied in light of the economic realities of the transaction.united hous,forman,d tcherepnin knight,d futura dev.centex,cir.in other words,
substance governs form,and the substance of an investment contract is a interest in a common enterprise that,through the efforts of the promoter or others,is expected to generate profits for the security holder,either for direct distribution or as an increase in the value of the investment.

the supreme court has long espoused a broad construction of what constitutes an investment contract,aspiring to afford the investing public a full measure of protection.howey,at.the investment contract taxonomy thus embodies a flexible rather than a static principle,one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.id.at.
the howey test has proven to be versatile in practice.over time,courts have classified as investment contracts a kaleidoscopic assortment of pecuniary arrangements that defy categorization in conventional financial terms,yet nonetheless satisfy the howey court three criteria.see,id.holding that sale of citrus groves,in conjunction with service contract,qualifies as an investment contract teague bakker,cir same re purchase of life partnership in evangelical community long shultz cattle,cir same re and consulting agreement miller cent.chinchilla group,cir same re chinchilla breeding and resale arrangement.
b.the district court rationale.
we pause at this juncture to address the district court rationale.relying upon a dictum from howey discussing the many types of instruments that in our commercial world fall within the ordinary concept of a security,at.quoting legislative history,the district court drew a distinction between what it termed commercial dealings and what it termed games.sec sg,d at.characterizing purchases of the privileged company shares as a clearly marked and defined game,the court concluded that since that activity was not part of the commercial world,it fell beyond the jurisdictional reach of the federal securities laws.id.in so ruling,the court differentiated sg operations from a classic ponzi or pyramid scheme on the ground that those types of chicanery involved commercial dealings within a business context.id.
we do not gainsay the obvious correctness of the district court observation that investment contracts lie within the commercial world.contrary to the district court view,however,this locution does not translate into a dichotomy between business dealings,on the one hand,and games,on the other hand,as a failsafe way for determining whether a particular financial arrangement should or should not be characterized as an investment contract.howey remains the touchstone for ascertaining whether an investment contract the test that it prescribes must be administered without regard to nomenclature.see int l of teamsters daniel,d see also forman,at.warning against reliance on the names that may have been employed by the parties to identify a particular investment william shakespeare,romeo juliet,act,sc.circa a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.as long as the howey test is satisfied,the instrument must be classified as an investment contract.howey,at.once that has occurred,it is immaterial whether the enterprise is speculative or or whether there is a sale of property with or without intrinsic value.id.it is equally immaterial whether the promoter depicts the enterprise as a serious commercial venture or dubs it a game.
a fairly recent supreme court opinion demonstrates that the commercial world to which the howey court alluded actually encompasses the total universe of financial instruments available to investors,rather than the subset of financial instruments envisioned by the district court,commerce as opposed to games.in that case,justice marshall wrote 
in defining the scope of the market that it wished to regulate,congress painted with a broad brush.it recognized the virtually limitless scope of human ingenuity,especially in the creation of countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits,and determined that the best way to achieve its goal of protecting investors was to define the term security in sufficiently broad and general terms so as to include within that definition the many types of instruments that in our commercial world fall within the ordinary concept of a security.congress therefore did not attempt precisely to cabin the scope of the securities acts.rather,it enacted a definition of security sufficiently broad to encompass virtually any instrument that might be sold as an investment.
reves ernst young,d citations omitted.this expansive language,coupled with congress sweeping definitions of security,persuade us to reject the district court use of howey commercial world reference as a limiting principle.
to sum up,howey supplies the appropriate template for identifying investment contracts within the overarching ambit of the federal securities laws.contrary to the district court conclusion,this template admits of no exception for games or gaming.thus,the language on sg website emphasizing the nature of buying and selling virtual shares of the privileged company does not place such transactions beyond the long reach of the federal securities laws.
iii.administering the tripartite test 
what remains is to analyze whether purchases of the privileged company shares constitute investment contracts.we turn to that task,taking the three howey criteria in sequence.
investment of money.
the first component of the howey test focuses on the investment of money.the determining factor is whether an investor chose to give up a specific consideration in return for a separable financial interest with the characteristics of a security.daniel,at.we conclude that the sec complaint sufficiently alleges the existence of this factor.
to be sure,sg disputes the point.it argues that the individuals who purchased shares in the privileged company were not so much investing money in return for rights in the virtual shares as paying for an entertainment commodity the opportunity to play the stockgeneration game.this argument suggests that an interesting factual issue may await participants were motivated primarily by a perceived investment opportunity or by the visceral excitement of playing a game.nevertheless,this case comes to us following a dismissal under rule b,and the sec complaint memorializes,inter alia,sg representation that participants could firmly expect a profit monthly on purchases of the privileged company shares.that representation plainly supports the sec legal claim that participants who invested substantial amounts of money in exchange for virtual shares in the privileged company likely did so in anticipation of investment gains.given the procedural posture of the case,no more is exigible to fulfill the first part of the howey test.
common enterprise.
the second component of the howey test involves the existence of a common enterprise.before diving headlong into the sea of facts,we must dispel the miasma that surrounds the appropriate legal standard.
the legal standard.courts are in some disarray as to the legal rules associated with the ascertainment of a common enterprise.see generally ii louis loss joel seligman,securities regulation ed.many courts require a showing of horizontal type of commonality that involves the pooling of assets from multiple investors so that all share in the profits and risks of the enterprise.see sec infinity group,cir,cert.denied,d sec life partners,wals fox hills dev,cir revak sec realty,cir curran merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir,aff on other grounds,d.other courts have modeled the concept of common enterprise around fact patterns in which an investor fortunes are tied to the promoter success rather than to the fortunes of his or her fellow investors.this doctrine,known as vertical commonality,has two variants.broad vertical commonality requires that the of all investors be dependent upon the promoter expertise.see villeneuve advanced bus.concepts,cir,aff en banc,cir sec koscot interplanetary,cir.in contrast,narrow vertical commonality requires that the investors fortunes be interwoven with and dependent upon the efforts and success of those seeking the investment or of third parties.sec glenn turner,cir.
courts also differ in the steadfastness of their allegiance to a single standard of commonality.two courts of appeals recognize only horizontal commonality.see wals,at curran,at.two others adhere exclusively to broad vertical commonality see villeneuve,at koscot,at.the ninth circuit recognizes both horizontal commonality and narrow vertical commonality.see hocking dubois,cir en banc.to complicate matters further,four courts of appeals have accepted horizontal commonality,but have not yet ruled on whether they also will accept some form of vertical commonality.see infinity group,at life partners,at teague,at revak,at.at least one of these courts,however,has explicitly rejected broad vertical commonality.see revak,at.
thus far,neither the supreme court nor this court has authoritatively determined what type of commonality must be present to satisfy the common enterprise element.we came close in rodriguez,in which we hinted at a preference for horizontal commonality.there,promoters selling parcels of land made strong and repeated suggestions that the surrounding area would develop into a thriving residential community.at.although we held that the financial arrangement did not constitute a security,we implied that an actual commitment by the promoters to develop the community themselves,coupled with the buyers joint financing of the enterprise,could constitute a common enterprise.see id.
the case at bar requires us to take a position on the common enterprise component of the howey test.we hold that a showing of horizontal pooling of assets from multiple investors in such a manner that all share in the profits and risks of the the test.this holding flows naturally from the facts of howey,in which the promoter commingled fruit from the investors groves and allocated net profits based upon the production from each tract.see howey,at.adopting this rule also aligns us with the majority view and confirms the intimation of rodriguez.last,but surely not least,the horizontal commonality standard places easily ascertainable and predictable limits on the types of financial instruments that will qualify as securities 
applying the standard.here,the pooling element of horizontal commonality jumps off the screen.the defendants website stated that the players money is accumulated on the sg current account and is not invested anywhere,because no investment,not even the most profitable one,could possibly fully compensate for the lack of sufficiency in settling accounts with players,which lack would otherwise be more likely.thus,as the sec complaint suggests,sg unambiguously represented to its clientele that participants funds were pooled in a single account used to settle participants transactions.therefore,pooling is established.
of course,horizontal commonality requires more than pooling alone it also requires that investors share in the profits and risks of the enterprise.the sec maintains that two separate elements of sg operations embody the necessary sharing.first,it asserts that sg was running a ponzi or pyramid scheme dependent upon a continuous influx of new money to remain in operation and argues that such arrangements inherently involve the sharing of profit and risk among investors.second,the sec construes sg promise to divert a portion of its profits from website operations to support the privileged company shares as a bond that ties together the collective fortunes of those who have purchased the shares.while we analyze each of these theories,we note that any one of them suffices to support a finding of commonality.
we endorse the sec suggestion that ponzi schemes typically satisfy the horizontal commonality standard.in infinity group,investors contributed substantial sums of money to a trust established by the defendants and received in exchange a property transfer agreement guaranteeing stupendous annual rates of return.at.the economic guarantees were based upon the trust purported performance experience,financial connections,and ability to pool large amounts of money.id.at.participants were promised that investing in the trust was a proposition,and that their cash infusions would be repaid in full upon demand.id.at.expected profits were a function of the number of capital units held pursuant to the contract with the trust in turn,the number of capital units allocated to each investor was directly proportional to the size of his or her investment.id.at.on these facts,the third circuit held that horizontal commonality existed,emphasizing that under the plan terms each investor was entitled to receive returns directly proportionate to his or her investment stake.id.at.
sg virtual shares bear striking factual similarities to the financial instruments classified as investment contracts in infinity group.sg flat guaranteed return applied to all privileged company shares,expected returns were dependent upon the number of shares held,the economic assurances were based on the promoter ability to keep the ball rolling,the investment was proclaimed to be free from risk,and participants were promised that their principal would be repaid in full upon demand.like the third circuit,we think that these facts suffice to make out horizontal commonality.
in all events,sg promise to pay referral fees to existing participants who induced others to patronize the virtual exchange provides an alternative basis for finding horizontal commonality.the sec argues convincingly that this shows the existence of a pyramid scheme sufficient to satisfy the horizontal commonality standard.the most instructive comparison is to sec int l loan network.a key element of the defendants elaborate,multifaceted,financial distribution network in that case was a pyramid sales program in which participants stood to receive commissions on membership fees paid by individuals whom they recruited,plus lesser commissions on sales by those recruited by their recruits.id.at.the court of appeals ruled that this structure satisfied the requirements of horizontal commonality.id.at.in the process,it relied heavily upon the fact that the network generated income only through constant expansion of membership,which depended on individual recruiting and the appeal of the promoter larger marketing campaign.id.
like the investors in int l loan network,stockgeneration participants who recruited new participants were promised bonuses worth of the recruit payments.taking as true the sec plausible allegation that the sine qua non of sg operations was the continued net inflow of funds,the investment pool supporting the referral bonus payments was entirely dependent upon the infusion of fresh capital.since all participants shared in the profits and risks under this pyramidal structure,it furnishes the sharing necessary to warrant a finding of horizontal commonality.
we will not paint the lily.we conclude,without serious question,that the arrangement described in the sec complaint fairly can be characterized as either a ponzi or pyramid scheme,and that it provides the requisite sharing to support a finding of horizontal commonality.taking as true the sec allegation that sg ability to fulfill its pecuniary guarantees was fully predicated upon the net inflow of new money,the fortunes of the participants were inextricably intertwined.as long as the privileged company continued to receive net capital infusions,existing shareholders could dip into th
