defendant darin demizio demizio or darin was convicted in,following a jury trial in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,john gleeson,judge,on one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud and securities fraud,in violation of,and,and on one count of making a false statement,in violation of a.he was sentenced principally to months imprisonment,to be followed by a term of supervised release,and was ordered to pay million in restitution.during the pendency of his original appeal from the judgment of conviction and from the denial of a posttrial motion for acquittal or a new trial,see united states demizio,cr,wl,at july,demizio i,the united states supreme court decided skilling united states,d,which interpreted narrowly the scope of prohibition against wire fraud.this court dismissed the appeal without prejudice and remanded to the district court to consider the effect of skilling in the first instance.on remand,the district court concluded that the evidence to support demizio conspiracy conviction was sufficient even in light of skilling,and that although under skilling there was an error in the jury charge,the error was harmless and did not warrant a new trial.see united states demizio,cr,wl,at,demizio ii.
on appeal,demizio contends principally that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conviction of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in light of skilling and that he is therefore entitled to a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy count,or that he is entitled to a new trial on that count because the court instructions to the jury erroneously permitted conviction on an impermissible theory of fraud.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
background 
in the securities industry,financial institutions and their customers sometimes participate in transactions such as short sales,sales of stock not then owned by the seller that require them to borrow securities from other financial institutions.the present prosecution charged demizio principally with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud by causing his employer,morgan stanley.morgan stanley,to conduct transactions through intermediary firms in a manner that,at morgan stanley expense,caused large sums of money to be paid to demizio brother and father for little or no work.
the government evidence as to the transactions included the testimony of former employees of morgan stanley or complicit intermediary firms.taken in the light most favorable to the government,the evidence included the following.
stock loans 
in a typical transaction,the borrowing institution and the lending institution agree on,inter alia,the type and amount of collateral to be posted by the borrower.the collateral is cash or a cash equivalent that is typically of the market value of the loaned security and is retained by the lender for the life of the loan,which ranges from one day to multiple years.the lender invests the collateral in an instrument part of the resulting interest is retained by the lender,and part is rebated to the borrower the amounts retained and rebated are subject to negotiation.see trial transcript tr.
in order to obtain shares of the needed securities,a borrowing institution often uses an independent registered as an intermediary sometimes referred to as a conduit or conduit to locate an institution holding and willing to lend such shares.in addition,financial institutions interested in lending their stocks make that willingness known to other firms.conduit call financial institutions each day to determine what stocks the institutions want to lend or need to borrow and then try to find matching borrowers or lenders.after making a match,the conduit receives the borrowed shares from the lender and delivers them to the borrower,and receives the cash collateral from the borrower and passes it to the lender.during the life of the loan,interest is earned on the collateral the lender retains part and periodically sends the remainder the rebate to the conduit the conduit retains part of the received rebate and sends part to the borrower.see,tr,government exhibit gx.
if the conduit can not find the borrower or lender needed to complete a transaction,it calls a finder.finder firms are not registered dealers and thus can not deliver stock,but they can contact potential borrowers and lenders to try to find the missing component.if the finder succeeds,the conduit pays the finder firm a fee,consisting of part of the rebate that the conduit receives from the lender.see,tr.
to facilitate stock borrowing and lending,financial institutions frequently have securities lending departments.during the period relevant to this case,morgan stanley the largest securities lender in the united states,controlling approximately percent of the domestic volume had such a department.demizio was employed in morgan stanley department from through between december and december,he was head of the domestic desk.
payments to demizio relatives for little or no work 
in its transactions,morgan stanley used as intermediaries but did not pay fees directly to finders.see tr.id.at morgan stanley was allowed to deal with finders.demizio made arrangements with several firms,including some that were finders,to make payments to his father brother as if they were finders for little or no work,in exchange for those firms receiving business from morgan stanley.the firms included garban corporates llc garban and freeman securities company,freeman,which were conduit,and clinton management clinton and tyde,tyde,which were finder firms.
a former employee of garban,lisa pompili,testified that that firm did a great deal of business with morgan stanley from about to.in the early,t o keep its morgan stanley business,garban would have to do its trades with darin and add his father,robert demizio or robert,as the finder,in on tickets,the rudimentary transaction records for rebate.tr.putting robert in on tickets meant a dd ing him in for a rebate,a portion of garban profit.id.at.in connection with the transactions for which he received commissions,robert demizio,did v ery little work ten percent,if that much.id.at.
in about,robert demizio ceased to be a finder and joined a different brokerage firm.demizio thereafter required garban,in order to maintain its business with morgan stanley,to share its rebates with cd management,a finder firm started by demizio brother craig demizio or craig.from then until about,when craig ceased to be a finder,the procedure at garban was the same as it had been with demizio father.pompili testified that on morgan stanley transactions,whether morgan stanley was a borrower or a lender,we would basically put craig in on tickets for a rebate.id.at see,id.at.craig did little or no work on these transactions.see id.at.
occasionally,garban would be forced to take craig out of the ticket because the spread between the rebate rate garban received from the lender and the rate it was required to relay to the borrower was too small to share.tr.when this occurred,craig would complain,and garban would call or get a call from darin to see what happened,and then we would get our rate adjusted from darin so we could have enough of a profit to share with craig,to put craig back in on our tickets.id.at see,id.at demizio would pay garban a little bit more to have garban put his brother craig on a ticket.
a former vice president of freeman,richard evangelista,testified that demizio approached him in the mid and offered to give freeman more business from morgan stanley if freeman would give a portion of the profits that it made to demizio brother,craig.id.at.demizio made it clear that,in return,craig was going to participate in the business that much.id.at.evangelista agreed to demizio proposal,despite knowing that the arrangement was illegal.it was cheating morgan stanley out of profits.id.evangelista also testified that during the period when freeman was sharing its finder fee profits with craig,there were times when,although demizio was aware that the going rate on the street for lenders to pay on a particular stock was around one percent darin would call me and tell me he had that stock to lend and would pay a rate of four,five five percent.id.at.
freeman benefited from the agreement to share its profits with craig because its business increased immensely.tr.and as a result of the arrangement,craig was paid between and a month as finder fees.see id.at.he performed only about percent of the work needed to earn such fees.see id.at.
robert johnson testified that tyde was a finder firm he started in about at the suggestion of demizio,his best friend,who promised to give him business from morgan stanley.peter sherlock,a former morgan stanley trader who was supervised by demizio,testified that demizio asked me if i could do business with with bobby johnson,you know,talk to him every day,try to do trades with him.id.at.accordingly,sherlock like demizio himself gave johnson lists of stock that morgan stanley wanted to lend or borrow see id.at since morgan stanley did not pay finders directly,it was incumbent upon johnson like any other finder to find a conduit who w ould pay and collect with them and then send it to morgan stanley through a id.at.
johnson testified that a majority of tyde business came from morgan stanley some percent in the beginning,increasing to percent within a few years.sherlock testified that there were occasions on which demizio identified stocks for johnson to lend and caused morgan stanley to pay a higher rebate rate than necessary because johnson was to be paid finder fees on the loan.see id.at.
johnson testified that in demizio asked him to hire demizio father robert and pay robert commissions on the business from morgan stanley.demizio subsequently told johnson that johnson would have to do robert work b ecause his father did have the drive or desire to do it any longer tr.but that johnson would have to continue to pay robert commissions.thereafter,demizio father would go to the tyde office once or twice a week and spend his time chatting with family and friends on the telephone.johnson paid demizio father for morgan stanley business in accordance with instructions from demizio as if robert had brought in the morgan stanley business or had worked on the transactions,although robert did practically none of the work.id.at see id.at was doing any work id.at when johnson passed on finder fees to robert demizio,they were generally for transactions on which robert did no work id.in the beginning,robert did about percent,and then later on,he did virtually nothing.
in,demizio told johnson that demizio brother craig was making a lot of money and he needed help.id.at.demizio asked johnson to help craig b y putting him in on tickets.id.at.demizio acknowledged that craig was not knowledgeable about the finder business and was incapable of doing the transactions himself demizio said johnson would have to do all the work on those transactions as well.id.at.johnson agreed because of his friendship with demizio and because it would mean more money for johnson.id.at.
demizio arrangements with clinton,another finder firm,were described by sherlock.sherlock first learned of freeman with craig from evangelista.when freeman went out of business in,sherlock told demizio he knew evangelista had been cutting craig in on the morgan stanley rebates tr.at sherlock suggestion,demizio made similar arrangements with clinton principal,tony lupo see,see also id.at if tony makes on the trades,he cuts a check for to craig demizio craig was involved in getting paid but not involved in finding the stocks.
the government introduced exhibits showing that from january through january,payments from tyde to robert demizio company,boblin boblin,and from garban,freeman,clinton,and tyde to craig demizio or his company,cd management,totaled approximately million see,gx.
c.the charges,the jury instructions,and the verdict 
in the mid,the federal bureau of investigation fbi began an investigation into fraud in the securities lending industry,focusing on whether finders were paying kickbacks to employees at brokerage firm securities lending desks.clinton was investigated,and its checks to cd management led to inquiries about craig and robert demizio and eventually led to demizio.see tr.johnson company tyde too came under scrutiny,as a finder that had written checks to cd management and to robert demizio company,boblin.the investigation began to zero in on whether or not brokers on the securities lending desk at morgan stanley were receiving kickbacks.id.at.
in january and september,fbi special agents interviewed demizio,represented by counsel,in the presence of prosecutors and sec investigators.focusing on the years,as that was the period during which cd management and boblin were receiving checks,the agents asked demizio whether he had any outside business arrangements with johnson.demizio responded that he did not.in fact,however,in addition to the agreement that johnson would pay robert demizio in exchange for receiving business from morgan stanley,without robert having to perform work to earn that money,demizio and johnson had invested in a modeling agency together.
demizio was indicted in and was eventually charged in a superseding indictment indictment with one count of conspiring,in violation of,to commit securities fraud,prohibited by,and to commit wire fraud,prohibited by and count one and one count of making a false statement to the fbi,in violation of a count two.most relevant for purposes of this appeal,prohibits the use of interstate wire communication for the purpose of executing any scheme or artifice to defraud,or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises,and provides that the term scheme or artifice to defraud includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.the indictment alleged that,notwithstanding the fact that it was morgan stanley practice not to pay finder fees in connection with transactions,demizio,along with others,
devised and executed a scheme to cause his family members,craig demizio and john doe,robert demizio who died in,to receive money,typically in the form of finder fees and rebates,in connection with transactions involving securities borrowed from or loaned to morgan stanley,without regard to whether those transactions were in morgan stanley best interests and without regard to whether craig demizio and john doe had performed any legitimate finder services in connection with the transactions.
indictment.the indictment alleged,inter alia,that demizio and others violated by conspiring 
to execute a scheme and artifice to defraud morgan stanley and others and to deprive morgan stanley of its right to the honest services of its employee,darin demizio,in connection with securities of issuers with a class of registered securities contrary to title,united states code,sections and and 
to devise a scheme and artifice to defraud and obtain money and property from morgan stanley and others by means of materially false and fraudulent pretenses,representations and promises,and to deprive morgan stanley of its right to the honest services of its employee,darin demizio,and for the purpose of executing such scheme and artifice,to transmit and cause to be transmitted,by means of wire communication in interstate and foreign commerce,writings,signs,signals,pictures and sounds,contrary to title,united states code,sections and.
indictment.
the evidence at trial included the testimony and exhibits described in parts and above,which the government contended showed kickbacks paid,at the instance of demizio,to his father and brother.demizio contended that the payments to his father and brother were not kickbacks.he argued that craig and robert did exchange for the fees they were paid that,at worst,the evidence showed that demizio helped steer morgan stanley business to companies that employed his relatives and that such steering was not within the scope of the prohibition against wire fraud.he asked the court to instruct the jury that if it found that this conduct involved not kickbacks or bribery but only,the jury must,in order to convict,find also that these incidents could have caused detriment to the employers.
the court declined to give the requested charge,noting that the authorities demizio cited in support of his request involved the steering of business to firms in which the defendant had an ownership interest the court saw no basis in the evidence for the requested charge here,as there was no indication that demizio had such an interest in the firms he caused to make payments to his relatives.with respect to the component of the charged conspiracy,the court instructed the jury,inter alia,that the government alleged that there existed a scheme or artifice to defraud morgan stanley of its right to the honest services of darin demizio or to obtain the money of morgan stanley by means of false or fraudulent pretenses tr,using wire communications and interstate commerce to further that scheme id.at.although the district court elaborated on other elements of wire fraud and of the conspiracy charge,it did not define or otherwise suggest any limitation on the meaning of honest services.see,id.at.
the jury found demizio guilty on both counts of the indictment.demizio moved for a judgment of acquittal or a new trial on several grounds,including his contention that the jury,if properly instructed,could have found that his conduct did not deprive morgan stanley of his honest services within the meaning of.the district court denied the motion.see demizio i,wl.demizio was sentenced principally to two concurrent month terms of imprisonment,to be followed by a term of supervised release,and,in an amended judgment,was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of million.
d.the initial appeal and the remand 
demizio appealed,and moved in this court for a stay of his appeal in light of the pendency of several cases before the supreme court involving interpretation of the meaning of honest services in.we granted the stay after the supreme court decided skilling,we lifted the stay,dismissed the appeal without prejudice,and remanded to the district court for a determination of the effect of skilling in the first instance.
on remand,after inviting and receiving supplemental briefing,the district court declined to grant a judgment of acquittal or a new trial based on skilling.the court reasoned that although skilling interpreted honest services in as encompassing only kickbacks and bribery,that interpretation did not require the court to disturb demizio conviction because the entire case had been tried on the theory that demizio conspired with others to have morgan stanley business directed to finders in exchange for his brother and father receiving kickbacks,and the trial evidence was sufficient to support the guilty verdict on count one on that basis.see demizio ii,wl,at.further,although the court instructions to the were correct under second circuit law when erroneous in light of skilling because they did not cabin honest services as required by skilling,the court concluded,as discussed in part.below,that given the government reliance on a kickback theory throughout,the ample evidence to support findings of kickbacks,and the absence of any instructions to the jury suggesting that it could find guilt on any theory other than kickbacks,the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,see id.at.
following demizio ii,demizio appeal was redocketed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,demizio contends principally that he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal on count one,arguing that the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove an fraud conspiracy.he contends that 
a a payment in the private sector qualifies as a kickback only when the recipient does not perform any work other than the conferral of business in connection with the payment,and robert and craig did perform work b a payment in the private sector qualifies as a kickback only when it is the employee who receives the payment,and darin never received any money from the alleged schemes and c there is no violation of without nondisclosure of material information to the employer by the employee,and robert involvement with tyde was fully disclosed.
demizio brief on appeal at emphases added.alternatively,demizio contends that he is entitled to a new trial because the court instructions to the jury did not explain the limitations on the concept of honest services as used in,as thereafter interpreted by the supreme court in skilling.demizio also asks that,if he is granted an acquittal or a new trial on count one,he be granted a new trial on count two on the ground of prejudicial spillover.
for the reasons that follow,we reject demizio challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence on count one,and we conclude that the skilling error in the instructions to the jury on that count was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.demizio conditional request for a new trial on count two is therefore moot.
sufficiency of the evidence in light of skilling 
the wire fraud statute prohibits the use of wire communications to facilitate any scheme or artifice to defraud,or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises.t he term scheme or artifice to defraud in includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.section was enacted in response to the supreme court decision in mcnally united states,d,which had held that,the mail fraud statute paralleling,proscribed only schemes for the deprivation of tangible property rights,not of intangible rights to honest services.see skilling.at.although congress enacted to clarify that the prohibitions against wire fraud and mail fraud schemes encompass deprivations of honest services,the term honest services is not defined in the statute.
in skilling,addressing a contention that was void for vagueness,the supreme court concluded that the section is not unconstitutionally vague to the extent that it covers schemes involving bribery and kickbacks.the court reasoned that fraudulent schemes involving bribery and kickbacks had long been held to be within the scope of and,and that in enacting in the wake of mcnally to proscribe fraudulent schemes for deprivation of the intangible right of honest services,congress no doubt intended to reach at least schemes to defraud involving bribes and kickbacks.at emphasis in original.the skilling court concluded that can not be interpreted to reach an amorphous category such as cases.at,and that the section criminalizes only the core of the case law,id.at emphasis in original.
a kickback scheme typically involves an employee steering business of his employer to a third party in exchange for a share of the third party profits on that business.see,black law dictionary ed defining kickback as the return of a portion of a monetary sum received,esp.as a result of coercion or a secret agreement.we reject at the outset demizio suggestion that,in determining whether the evidence against him was sufficient under,we should ignore cases involving public officials see demizio brief on appeal at.the skilling court noted that although cases most often involved bribery of public officials,private sector fraud had been recognized at least as early as.see.at.the court analyzed cases involving public officials as well as cases involving employees in the private sector in deciding the appeal brought by skilling himself,a employee and it noted that while the principal federal bribery statute,generally applies only to federal public officials,application to fraud reaches misconduct that might otherwise go unpunished.at.
we also reject demizio argument that kickbacks a do not include payments made to entities other than the employee who steers his employer business to a third party in exchange for those payments,and b do not include payments of large sums of money to those recipients so long as they perform some minimal amount of work.although the kickback amount frequently is paid directly to the employee who steered the contract,the scheme is no less a kickback scheme when the employee directs the third party to share its profits with an entity designated by the employee in which the employee has an interest.for example,as noted in skilling,see.at,a statute prohibiting kickbacks with respect to federal contracts defined kickback,in part,to include any money,thing of value,or compensation of any kind which is provided,directly or indirectly,to a prime contractor or its employee for the purpose of rewarding favorable treatment in connection with a subcontract relating to a prime contract.although that section was amended and recodified as in and omitted the phrase directly or indirectly,see,the legislative history explained that no substantive change was intended,see,at,and that the words directly or indirectly we re omitted as unnecessary,id.at.
in this vein,payoff schemes have been viewed as involving kickbacks when the defendant has directed that the contracting party profit be shared with family,friends,or others loyal to the defendant.see,united states mcdonough,cir kickback scheme involved payments to corporation owned by defendant wife united states hausmann,cir kickback arrangement required payments to,inter alios,individuals who had provided miscellaneous personal services to hausmann or his relatives and charities that hausmann supported emphases added united states margiotta,cir involving kickbacks to brokers selected by political leaders of local election districts in the town who were loyal to margiotta id.margiotta contrived the appointment of a certain insurance agency to be the municipality broker,and the agency agreed to set aside of the insurance commissions and other compensation it received,to be distributed to licensed insurance brokers and others designated by margiotta united states laspina,cir ibm employee defendant steered business to a company that paid the kickbacks in the form of commissions to schultz,the defendant paramour who had been handed her job as a sales representative with the company without discussion or a resumé and who then split those commissions with the defendant.see generally skilling.at citing as a classic kickback scheme one in which a state official,in exchange for routing the state business through a middleman company,arranged for that company to share its commissions with entities in which the official had an interest emphasis added.
in light of these authorities,and the failure of demizio to cite any authority to support his constrained conception of kickbacks,we reject his contention that a payment in a scheme does not qualify as a kickback unless the defendant employee himself or herself receives the payoff.the evidence overwhelmingly established that demizio directed morgan stanley business to companies that agreed to pay commissions to his father brother,in whom demizio plainly had an interest.
further,there was evidence from which it could be inferred that the payoffs benefited demizio himself financially.for example,johnson testified demizio asked him to pay commissions to demizio brother craig because demizio said craig was making a lot of money and he needed help.tr.johnson also testified that he formed tyde in at the suggestion of demizio,who asked him to hire demizio father robert in.see id.at.sherlock testified that around that time see id.at,demizio was complaining to sherlock that robert was hurting for money and was requesting money from demizio see id.at.
as the district court reasoned,the jury could have reasonably concluded that demizio benefited indirectly from the payments to his father and brother because he would otherwise have had to support them financially.by instead arranging for them to obtain substantial payments for little or no work,he relieved himself of the obligation to assist the individuals using his own wealth.demizio ii,wl,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we also find meritless demizio contention that a scheme involves kickbacks only if the payoff recipient does not perform any work in return for being paid demizio brief on appeal at.although often the recipient does not in fact do any work,the scheme qualifies as a kickback scheme where the recipient receives inordinate amounts of money for doing minimal work.see,united states mcdonough,at upholding conviction where scheme involved kickbacks to the appellant totaling nearly,for which he performed almost no work laspina,at affirming conviction involving kickback scheme in which the defendant mistress received hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions for which she did very little work united states bryant,cir upholding conviction under,and for fraud involving a bribery conspiracy in which the defendant was given a job meaning he provided only minimal or nominal services united states urciuoli,cir upholding conviction under and for fraud involving a bribery conspiracy in which a coconspirator was hired by a municipality to perform work for which municipal officials believed he lacked the requisite skills,and for which he received an ample and increasing salary for limited and decreas ing work.
we agree with the district court view that the rule advocated by demizio,that so long as any work at all is done by the recipient of a share of the contracting party profits,that payoff is not a kickback demizio brief on appeal at would be untenable,allowing p otential fraudsters to shield themselves from criminal liability merely by performing some token labor in exchange for what would otherwise be an illegal kickback.demizio ii,wl,at internal quotation marks omitted.and we agree with the district court that 
there was ample evidence from which a reasonable jury could have inferred that the payments to robert and craig were kickbacks.they performed work on no more than to percent of the transactions for which they were paid.the work they did perform was of minimal quality and difficulty,and there was even evidence that they were not competent to perform work as finders.in exchange for this work,they received in excess of million in payments.while demizio was free to argue to the jury that these payments were in exchange for legitimate work,the jury reasonably found otherwise.
finally,we reject demizio contention that the government evidence was insufficient to show fraud,that morgan stanley was unaware of his kickback schemes.johnson testified to the existence of a code that demizio would use with johnson to discuss these transactions that demizio said he wanted to use code because he did want the people seated next to him to hear him instruct ing johnson to put his brother in on tickets,b ecause morgan stanley did not want him to deal with his brother.tr.evangelista testified that he and demizio did not discuss the arrangement for freeman to pay his brother craig in front of other people,and evangelista did not tell the other traders at freeman about the arrangement because it was illegal and darin did want anybody else to know about it.id.at.evangelista also testified that demizio told him that if anyone found out about the arrangement demizio would deny the whole thing.id.at.and sherlock testified that when the fbi investigation was underway,demizio told him not to tell morgan stanley attorneys about craig arrangement with clinton.see id.at see also id.at with respect to each of their respective meetings with morgan stanley attorneys,sherlock and demizio conferred in order to make sure that their answers matched.
as the district court found in its ruling,a t best,the evidence supports an inference that some morgan stanley employees may have been aware of certain aspects of demizio arrangements with companies that were paying robert and craig finder fees.but there wa s no evidence that anyone whose knowledge may be imputed to morgan stanley was aware of the kickback scheme.demizio ii,wl,at.
in sum,we conclude that the district court properly denied demizio motion for a judgment of acquittal.the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find that demizio conspired to commit wire fraud by means of having intermediary firms pay kickbacks to his father and brother in connection with morgan stanley transactions for which his father and brother performed little or no work.
b.the error in the jury charge harmless error analysis 
following our remand,the district court noted that the parties agreed that,in light of skilling,the court erred in not instructing the jury that in order to find demizio guilty of c
