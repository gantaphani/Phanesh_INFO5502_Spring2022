investors who purchased stock in brought this consolidated securities action under sections and of the securities act of against defendants,its directors,its controlling shareholder trilogy software,and its investment bankers collectively pcorder,alleging that the registration statements filed with the securities and exchange commission were false and misleading.the district court concluded that,with one exception,the investors lacked section standing because they could not trace their stock to the registration statements in question.finding the remaining investor claims moot,the court dismissed all of the claims and denied a motion to intervene.we affirm.
pcorder conducted an initial public offering of stock on february,and a secondary public offering on december.in connection with each offering pcorder filed a registration statement with the sec.
several holders of stock filed multiple lawsuits against pcorder under section of the securities act of,which provides a right of action to any person acquiring shares issued pursuant to an untrue registration statement the plaintiffs alleged that the registration statements were false and misleading by indicating that had a viable business plan,had an ability to generate and report accurate operating and financial information,and was not competing with trilogy software for revenue.the district court consolidated the actions and appointed lead plaintiffs the lead plaintiffs sought to have a class action certified and have themselves designated as class representatives.
in its october,order denying class certification the district court first found that none of the lead plaintiffs purchased their stock during the public is,they were aftermarket purchasers however,it held that section is available not only to those who purchased their stock during the relevant public offerings,but also to aftermarket purchasers as long as the stock is traceable back to the relevant public offering 
the district court then considered whether lead plaintiffs beebe,burke,and petrick could trace their stock back to either of the two public offerings.the district court found that the approximately million shares issued in the ipo were registered in a stock certificate in the name of cede,the nominee of the depository trust company.the court found that,on april,when beebe purchased of these street name shares,the pool of street name stock still contained only the ipo stock.therefore,because all of his stock was necessarily ipo stock,beebe was able to satisfy the traceability requirement and establish standing.
in contrast,the court concluded that standing was lacking for burke and petrick.by the end of june when burke purchased shares,the court found that,insider entered the street name certificate and intermingled with the ipo shares,but that ipo shares still comprised of the pool.subsequent to the december,secondary public offering,burke made additional purchases and petrick also purchased a number of shares at a time when ipo and spo shares collectively po stock constituted of the market.appellants expert acknowledged that there is no way to track individual shares within a pool once it becomes contaminated with outside shares.
in light of the intermingling of po and stock in the market at the time of their though po stock was the overwhelming district court held that burke and petrick could not demonstrate that their shares were traceable to the public offering registration statements.in reaching this conclusion,the court considered expert testimony indicating that,given the number of shares owned by each lead plaintiff and the percentage of po stock in the market,the probability that each lead plaintiff owned at least one share of po stock was very nearly however,the court held that this did not satisfy the traceability requirement because the lead plaintiffs must demonstrate all stock for which they claim damages was actually issued pursuant to a defective statement,not just that it might have been,probably was,or most likely was,issued pursuant to a defective statement.the district court noted that,o therwise,all persons who held stock in street name on and after the offering date could claim a proportional interest in the shares.
having found that burke and petrick lacked section standing,the court concluded that they could not serve as class representatives and denied class certification we rejected a request for an interlocutory appeal 
on may,the district court granted pcorder motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b the district court reiterated its conclusion that beebe had standing to sue under section,but that burke and petrick did not.it concluded that the other plaintiffs,barry pinkowitz,jerry krim,and jean schwartz burke,also lacked standing because they too could not trace their stock back to the public offerings the court dismissed all of these claims without prejudice.the court then dismissed beebe claim as moot because pcorder had offered beebe a settlement equal to his full recovery under the statute.having disposed of the suits,the district court denied a motion to intervene by three individuals intervenors and entered final judgment in favor of pcorder.appellants challenge the district court rulings regarding standing and the motion to intervene.the denial of class certification is not before us.
in general,we review a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to rule b de novo a case is properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction when the court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case.in considering a challenge to subject matter jurisdiction,the district court is free to weigh the evidence and resolve factual disputes in order to satisfy itself that it has the power to hear the case.we review the district court jurisdictional findings of fact for clear error the denial of a motion to intervene as of right is reviewed de novo the denial of a permissive motion to intervene is reviewed for abuse of discretion 
appellants argue that burke,burke,and petrick can establish section standing by proffering nothing more than statistics indicating a high mathematical probability,based on the number of shares purchased by each individual and the number of po shares in the market,that at least some of their shares were issued pursuant to the challenged registration statement.we disagree 
we turn first to the language of the statute in general,the securities act of securities act is concerned with the initial distribution of securities.section of the securities act,imposing civil liability for public offering of securities pursuant to a false registration statement,permits any person acquiring such security to sue while section liability provisions are virtually absolute liability for corporate issuers for even innocent material misstatements its standing provisions limit putative plaintiffs to the narrow class of persons consisting of those who purchase securities that are the direct subject of the prospectus and registration statement.
in rosenzweig azurix,we recently held that aftermarket purchasers do not inevitably lack standing the district court here foreshadowed this in holding that section language suggests a much broader class of potential plaintiffs than those who literally purchased their shares in the challenged offering.indeed,the plain language of the statute confers standing on any person acquiring such security,and there is no reason to categorically exclude aftermarket purchasers,so long as the security was indeed issued under that registration statement and not another.as such,aftermarket purchasers seeking standing must demonstrate the ability to trace their shares to the faulty registration as one court explained 
t o be able to take advantage of the lower burden of proof and almost strict liability available under,a plaintiff must meet higher procedural standards.the most significant of the procedural standards is the requirement that a plaintiff be able to trace the security for which damages are claimed to the specific registration statement at issue 
in rosenzweig,we further held that this traceability requirement is satisfied,as a matter of logic,when stock has only entered the market via a single offering we did not speculate on what other methods might be available to satisfy the traceability requirement for aftermarket purchases,but we were careful to note the supreme court concern that the securities act remain anchored to its original purpose of regulating only public offerings.
appellants,as aftermarket purchasers,assert that they can also demonstrate standing by showing a very high probability that they each have at least one po share.appellants argue that their statistical determinations,being over,demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence,that it is more likely than not,that their shares are traceable to the public offerings in question.
we are persuaded that accepting such statistical tracing would impermissibly expand the statute standing requirement.because any share of stock chosen at random in the aftermarket has at least a chance of being tainted,its holder,according to appellants view,would have section standing in other words,every aftermarket purchaser would have standing for every share,despite the language of section,limiting suit to any person acquiring such security.as the district court found,it is likely that any street name shareholder can make a similar claim with regard to one share.this can not be squared with the statutory is,with what congress intended.we decline the invitation to reach further than the statute.
the fallacy of appellants position is demonstrated with the following analogy.taking a united states resident at random,there is a chance that she will be from somewhere other than wyoming does this high statistical likelihood alone,assuming for whatever reason there is no other information available,mean that she can avail herself of diversity jurisdiction in a suit against a wyoming resident surely not 
in limiting those who can sue to any person acquiring such security,congress specifically conferred standing on a subset of security owners unless of course,as in rosenzweig,all shares in the market are po shares.to allow appellants to satisfy the tracing requirement for aftermarket standing in this case with the proffered statistical methodology would contravene the language and intent of section.
appellants urge this court to not hew the statutory line,contending that to do so,in light of current market conditions,effectively precludes recovery under section that there is no reason to express a preference for the interests of defendants over plaintiffs.appellants point out that,given the fungible nature of stocks within a street name certificate,it is virtually impossible to differentiate po shares from shares.
however,as we have explained,section is available for anyone who purchased directly in the offering and any aftermarket purchasers who can demonstrate that their shares are traceable to the registration statement in when,as with beebe,there had only been one offering at the time of purchase when congress enacted the securities act of it was not confronted with the widespread practice of holding stock in street name that appellants describe as an impediment,absent our acceptance of statistical tracing,to invoking section that present market realities,given the fungibility of stock held in street name,may render section ineffective as a practical matter in some aftermarket scenarios is an issue properly addressed by congress.it is not within our purview to rewrite the statute to take account of changed conditions.in the words of one court,appellants arguments may have the sound ring of economic reality but unfortunately they merely point up the problems involved in the present scheme of statutory regulation.
it is,therefore,perhaps not surprising that we failed to locate any court,nor did appellants point to any,that found section standing based solely on the statistical tracing theory espoused today.given that the statute has been in existence for over years and such elementary statistical calculations have been around for centuries,it is difficult to conclude that this is a coincidence.we note that a handful of lower courts have rebuffed similar attempts by plaintiffs in one case,kirkwood taylor,the district summarily affirmed by the eighth the fungible mass method whereby every purchaser is deemed to own a pro rata portion of po shares for the purpose of determining section standing because all persons who held stock in street name on and after the offering date could claim a proportional interest in the shares,the court held that the logical extension of plaintiffs fungible mass theory would effectively circumvent the tracing requirement.similar concerns persuade us to reject today attempt at statistical tracing.
in barnes osofsky the second circuit confronted an intermingled stock pool not unlike the one we face today.in that case,two individuals challenged the settlement of a class action alleging section violations in a secondary public offering.the challengers,who purchased stock after the spo,were unable to trace a portion of their shares to the spo as opposed to the preexisting shares on the market.they objected to a provision of the settlement limiting the benefits of the settlement to persons who could establish that they purchased securities issued in the spo the court was not deterred by the reality that this eliminated those who purchased after the issuance of the allegedly incomplete prospectus but could not so trace their purchases,because section extends only to purchases of the newly registered shares.while not addressing the question before us today,barnesis nonetheless instructive.plaintiffs in that case urged a broad reading of section to cover anyone purchasing stock after the or not it was traceable to the spo.not unlike the concerns expressed by appellants in the instant case,the plaintiffs in barnesargued as follows 
o nce it is agreed that is not limited to the original purchasers,to read that section as applying only to purchasers who can trace the lineage of their shares to the new offering makes the result turn on mere accident since most trading is done through brokers who neither know nor care whether they are getting tainted or clean shares i t is often impossible to determine whether previously traded shares are clean or tainted,and that tracing is further complicated when stock is held in margin accounts in street names since many brokerage houses do not identify specific shares with particular accounts but instead treat the account as having an undivided interest in the house position 
the court rejected these arguments and rejected the plaintiffs broad reading of section standing requirement as inconsistent with the statutory scheme and contrary to the legislative history.the same is true of appellants view today.
appellants reliance upon the fourth circuit opinion in friends of the earth gaston is misplaced.rather,this case offers support to pcorder.in gaston,the clean water act specifically provided standing for persons having an interest which is or may be adversely affected.this language,chosen by congress,confers standing on a broad category of potential plaintiffs who can claim some sort of injury,be it actual or threatened,economic or noneconomic.in fact,congress has indicated that this provision confers standing to enforce the clean water act to the full extent allowed by the constitution.as such,gaston illustrates congress ability to provide for standing based on risk,confined only by the strictures of article iii 
while article iii sets the minimum requirements for standing,congress is entitled to impose more exacting standing requirements for the vindication of federal statutory rights if it wishes.here the legislature chose to go to the full extent of article iii in conferring standing on any person with an interest which is or may be adversely affected.
here,by contrast,congress conferred standing on those who actually purchased the tainted stock,not on the whole class of those who possibly purchased tainted,to put it another way,are at risk of having purchased tainted shares.unlike the standing conferred by congress in the clean water act,appellants here can not meet the statutory standing requirement of section merely by showing that they jumped into a potentially polluted pool of stock 
appellants are surely correct in pointing out that,at some level,all evidence is probabilistic.as we have explained,however,this does not answer the question before us today.in concluding that appellants attempt to statistically trace is incompatible with the standing requirement of section,we cast no shadow on the use of statistical evidence in general.we recognize,for example,the widely accepted use of dna evidence in criminal in capital murder proof must be beyond a reasonable doubt while both are rooted in statistical calculations,at least two distinctions between dna evidence and the statistics presented by appellants come to mind.first,in most trials,dna evidence does not stand alone here,appellants have relied exclusively on a presentation of background statistics.second,in any case,dna evidence is more particularistic than the statistics here.dna analysis seeks to establish a match between the dna of a particular individual a suspect and a mystery sample from a crime scene,essentially by quantifying and narrowing the universe of possible sources of the dna in contrast,appellants evidence merely demonstrates the probability that anyone with x number of shares will possess some tainted shares.it says nothing about the shares that one particular individual actually owns.the more particularized nature of dna is further evident from the fact that a nonmatch between any band of the suspect dna and the corresponding band of the questioned sample conclusively eliminates the suspect as the source of that sample.there is no such analog in the general statistics before us today.
unquestionably,principles of probability are powerful tools,when deployed in appropriate tasks.unquestionably,the statistics in this case indicate a high probability that a person purchasing a given number of shares will obtain at least one tainted share.however,these general statistics say nothing about the shares that a specific person actually owns and have no ability to separate those shares upon which standing can be based from those for which standing is improper.the task before the district court was to determine,by a preponderance of the evidence,whether and in what amount a plaintiff shares are tainted,not whether the same number of shares drawn at random would likely include at least one tainted share.understood in this light,statistical tracing is not up to the task at hand.
in sum,aftermarket purchasers seeking section standing must demonstrate that their shares are traceable to the challenged registration statement.we are not persuaded that the statistical tracing method advanced today is sufficient to satisfy this traceability requirement.
appellants argue that the district court erred in denying the motion to intervene.we disagree.
as a preliminary matter,we note that this is not a case where intervention is sought for the purpose of appealing the denial of class certification indeed,appellants have chosen in this appeal not to challenge the class certification denial thus,the prerequisite of an intervention that there be an existing suit within the court jurisdiction depends here on the individual claims that none of the individual claims remained viable on february,when the motion to intervene was filed,disposes of the attempt at intervention.
as we have explained,by october,the district court had correctly made clear that only beebe had standing.furthermore,the district court held that,as of january,beebe individual claims were rendered moot because pcorder offered beebe a settlement equal to the statutory limit on his damages appellants do not dispute that a full settlement offer,even if refused,would dispose of beebe individual claims instead,appellants contend that beebe claims were not fully satisfied because the involuntary settlement imposed by the district court did not include prejudgment interest.the statute,however,does not require prejudgment interest,and such an award of interest is up to the district court discretion the district court concluded that it would deny any request from beebe for prejudgment interest because the delay in the payment of his award was due to his meritless motion for class certification.we are not persuaded that the district court abused its discretion in denying prejudgment interest.therefore,as we are not faced on appeal with a challenge to the denial of class certification,in the absence of viable individual claims,we are not persuaded that the district court erred in denying intervention 
for the foregoing reasons the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
bret beebe,gene burke,and david petrick were appointed lead plaintiffs,along with two other individuals who subsequently dropped out of the suit and are not part of this appeal.
the aftermarket,also termed the secondary market,is the securities market in which previously issued securities are traded among investors.black law dictionary ed.
krim,at.we have since adopted the traceability test and allowed such aftermarket purchasers to establish standing in section cases.see rosenzweig azurix,cir.
appellants expert arrived at the odds of getting at least one po or tainted share using elementary principles of binomial probability.see generally paul hoel,introduction to mathematical statistics ed,cited in castaneda partida,d see also vuyanich republic bank of dallas,vacated,cir.the expert treated the purchase of shares as a series of independent random draws from the stock pool similar to flipping a weighted coin once for each share,and calculated the probability that at least one of the shares would be tainted according to the following formula shares,where po is the percentage of po stock in the market and shares is the number of shares owned.for example,at the end of june,when burke had purchased shares,po shares specifically ipo shares constituted of the street name certificate.therefore,the probability that he owned at least one po share was,or very nearly.

the district court further concluded as an independent ground for not certifying the class or appointing the representatives that even if each of the lead plaintiffs had standing to sue under section,they were each,including beebe,unqualified to be class representatives because they were,for other reasons,not able to fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.id.at.
