ii.background 
dunne was engaged by panworld minerals international,panworld to perform panworld financial audit for the calendar year.on april,dunne completed the audit of panworld,signed the audit report,and mailed the audited financial statements and the audit report to panworld.panworld mailed a form report,which included the audit report and audited financial statements,to the sec on april.the sec received the form report on may.
on april,a utah federal grand jury returned a superseding,indictment against robert weeks weeks,the president and principal executive officer of panworld david hesterman hesterman,a panworld consultant and dunne arising out of their activities in connection with panworld.counts i through iii of the indictment involved only weeks and hesterman and are not relevant to this appeal.count iv of the indictment charged weeks and hesterman with violations of the securities exchange act by falsely stating in panworld annual report filed with the sec that the company had acquired an interest in a project in montana known as washington gulch placer project.
count v,the only count naming dunne,began by realleg ing and incorporat ing relevant factual allegations of counts i,iii,and iv.count v further alleged that 
defendant terrence dunne audited the financial statements included in panworld annual report.dunne signed an audit opinion for the financial statements stating his audit of panworld was done in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards gaas and the financial statements were presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap.however,dunne knew from the terms of the october,contract that panworld acquired no interest in washington gulch,and therefore,knew that the financial statements were not presented in accordance with gaap.dunne took no steps to satisfy the requirements of generally accepted auditing standards to determine if the washington gulch interest was properly included in the panworld financial statements,and the defendant dunne did not acquire competent evidential matter as required by gaas that showed the acquisition of the washington gulch interest by panworld on october.
on or about may,in the central division of the district of utah,and elsewhere,terrence dunne,in a matter within the jurisdiction of the sec,an independent agency of the executive branch of the united states,did make a materially false,fictitious,and fraudulent statement and representation in that the defendant terrence dunne did certify that the financial statements for panworld for the year ending december,were presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap,and audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards gaas,when,as the defendant then and there well knew,such was not the case all in violation of.
dunne moved to dismiss count v of the superseding indictment on the grounds that it was barred under the statute of limitations.establishing a statute of limitations for noncapital offenses.dunne argued that the statute of limitations began to run when he mailed the audit report to panworld on april,and thus expired before the april,indictment was filed.the government opposed dunne motion,arguing that the superseding indictment was timely because the charged crime was not complete until the documents containing the false statements were actually submitted to the sec on april,and the crime charged in the indictment was the republication of the financial statements by panworld when it submitted them to the sec.
the district court referred the case to a magistrate judge pursuant to b b.in recommending that dunne motion be denied,the magistrate judge agreed with the government that the charged crime was not complete until the false statement was sent by panworld to the sec.focusing on the elements of the charged offense,the magistrate judge noted there were two elements relating to the time when the offense was committed.the magistrate judge concluded that the first element,the making of a false statement,occurred on april,when dunne submitted the audit report and the audited financial statements to panworld.as for the second temporal element,that the false statement concern a matter within the jurisdiction of an agency of the united states,the magistrate judge concluded that this occurred on april,when panworld mailed the form report,including dunne false statements,to the sec.the magistrate judge concluded that because the superseding indictment was returned on april,it was timely under.
dunne objected to the magistrate judge report and recommendation,arguing that the sec had jurisdiction over him when he signed and mailed the audit report to panworld on april.dunne also argued that when he was engaged in march by panworld to perform the audit,the sec obtained jurisdiction over him.
the government responded to dunne objections,arguing that the charged crime was not completed upon dunne signing and mailing the audit reports to panworld because,without submission to the sec,there is no potential the false statements could impede a governmental function.further,the government argued,merely because an agency may have jurisdiction over an individual who appears before it,statements made by that individual do not automatically concern matters within the jurisdiction of the agency for purposes of.
in considering dunne objections,the district court concluded the controlling question was at what point in time did dunne audit report and audited financial statements concern a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal department or agency under.the district court rejected the government assertion that the false statements were not brought within the sec jurisdiction until panworld mailed the statements to the sec because the government argument ran counter to the principle that false statements need not be submitted to the government agency before is violated.the district court also disagreed with the government assertion that dunne submitted his audit report to panworld pursuant only to a private contract.relying on the securities exchange act and its implementing regulations,the district court concluded 
that where,as here,a corporate entity retains the services of an independent certified public accountant,as required by federal law,for the preparation of financial statements required to be submitted to the sec,which financial statements require the certification of the accountant,and the form,matter,and substance of which statements is dictated by federal law and regulation,and the accountant prepares such materials with the knowledge of the nature of the relationship and does so with the belief that his or her work will ultimately be forwarded to the sec,the accountant financial statements concern a matter with the jurisdiction of a federal department or agency when the statements are transmitted to the corporate entity.
the district court further rejected the government argument that dunne offense was committed when panworld submitted the form because it would result in the final element of the crime being committed by panworld.the district court acknowledged that when a defendant is charged with aiding and abetting,the final commission of the aiding and abetting crime may lie with a third party,but noted that,for whatever reason,dunne was not charged with aiding and abetting and the government argument looking to panworld conduct for a determination of when dunne committed a substantive crime has n
