following a drop in the share price of invivo therapeutics holdings corporation invivo common stock,investors filed suit against the company and its former chief executive officer ceo,frank reynolds,alleging securities fraud in violation of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of exchange act,b and a,as well as the securities and exchange commission sec rule.on behalf of himself and a putative class of shareholders,lead plaintiff edmond ganem ganem alleges that invivo and reynolds inflated the value of invivo common stock for about five months in by issuing false or materially misleading press releases concerning the approval of human clinical trials for a new medical device the company was developing,by,inter alia,failing to identify the caveats and conditions imposed by the food and drug administration fda for the clinical trials.the district court,in a opinion,granted defendants motion to dismiss the complaint.we affirm,agreeing with the district court that ganem has failed to allege false or misleading statements sufficient to state a claim under section b and rule,and,having failed to plead a viable claim of a primary violation,ganem control person claim against reynolds under section a was also properly dismissed.
factual background 
according to invivo annual report to the sec form,which was filed in early march,the company focuses on develop ing and commercializ ing new technologies for the treatment of spinal cord injuries.the report identified invivo lead product under development as biopolymer scaffolding,a device that would attach to a patient body at the point of a spinal injury to prevent additional damage to the spinal cord.the report outlined the company strategy for marketing the device,including the steps for securing the required approval from the fda.
the report explained that invivo would first need to obtain an investigational device exception ide to permit it to conduct human clinical trials.such a clinical study was a prerequisite for obtaining either approval pma or a humanitarian device exemption hde,either of which would permit the company to sell the product in the united states.invivo stated that it plan ned to conduct an initial clinical study to evaluate the device in five spinal cord injury patients with acute thoracic injuries.we are also planning a larger human study in acute spinal cord injury patients after the initial study is completed.
in the report,invivo qualified the above statements,noting that statements such as statements about our plan to conduct an initial clinical study to evaluate our product are necessarily contingent because they involve substantial known and unknown risks.invivo stated that t he start of clinical trials can be delayed or take longer than anticipated for many and varied reasons,many of which would be outside of our control.
on march,the acting director of the fda office of device evaluation sent an letter to invivo.because ganem claims rely on the proposition that invivo later misrepresented the content of the letter,we quote from it at some length 
the fda has reviewed your amendment to your ide application to conduct an early feasibility study your application to begin your study is approved with conditions you may begin your investigation,using a revised informed consent document which corrects deficiency number and,at an institution in accordance with the investigational site waiver granted below.your investigation is limited to institutions and subject.
your ide application has been approved with conditions as a staged study you may enroll one subject at this time.you should follow this subject for months before requesting approval for an additional subject,who should also be followed for three months before requesting another subject.this will result in a total of subject s enrolled over a minimum month period.
a feasibility study is a preliminary study which is not expected to provide the primary support for the safety and effectiveness evaluation of a medical device for the purposes of a marketing application.fda believes that additional modifications,as outlined in study design considerations below,are needed for your study design to support a future study.
this approval is being granted on the condition that,within days from the date of this letter,you submit information correcting the following issues.
the fda listed thirteen issues for which it required further information before the initial study could begin then,under study design considerations,the fda stated that w e recommend,but do not require,that you modify your study to address the following issues so that it could support a future study,listing eight specific issues 
the following week,on april,invivo issued the press release at the heart of ganem complaint 
invivo therapeutics receives approval from fda for first human trial using biomaterials for traumatic spinal cord injury 
invivo therapeutics holdings today announced that the food and drug administration fda has approved the company investigational device exemption ide to begin human studies to test its biopolymer scaffold product,a technology developed to treat patients with acute,traumatic sci.
with this approval,invivo intends to commence a clinical study in the next few months that will test safety and performance of its biopolymer scaffold in five patients.the company expects the study to occur over approximately months.there are currently no treatment options approved by the fda,or in clinical trials,to intervene directly in the spinal cord following sci.the trial will be conducted at multiple hospitals,and work to gain institutional review board irb approval at massachusetts general hospital in boston is already underway.
w hen conducting a study,it is imperative to take the time to get it right,because any mistakes can lead to years of lost time for the scientists and patients that follow,said frank reynolds,invivo chief executive officer.
continued reynolds,over the next month or so,we plan to finalize the details of our study,and we expect to have all data to the fda by the end of.we will be conducting an open label study,and so we look forward to keeping the public aware of its progress.
the press release did not reveal that fda approval was conditional,or list any of the conditions,or explain that the fda had recommended changes to the study protocol in order to allow the staged study to support future studies.the release did,however,contain a safe harbor statement indicating that certain statements in the press release were covered by the exchange act statutory safe harbor for statements.the safe harbor statement explained that the covered statements included those related to the expected approval of the fda to conduct human clinical trials for the company products,the expected commencement date of any approved human clinical trials,the expected size of the pilot study,the expectation that the scaffold product will be regulated under an hde pathway,and the expected acceleration of commercialization of the company products resulting therefrom,which were subject to a number of risks and uncertainties,including risks and uncertainties relating to the company ability to obtain fda approval to conduct human clinical trials.the release also referred to invivo form,which described the potential risks in more detail.
ganem alleges that the price of invivo stock increased as a result of the apparent good news contained in the press release.historical stock prices cited by both parties indicate that there was a relatively high volume of trading on monday,april,after the press release the previous friday.that day,the stock price rose from per share to per share.
ganem also points to alleged misrepresentations in another press release from may.in that release,reynolds was quoted as saying w e are off to a great start for and continue to successfully accelerate our plans.it also reiterated some of the statements made a month earlier in april,the fda approved invivo investigational device exemption ide application to begin human studies to evaluate its biopolymer scaffold product for acute traumatic sci t he product will be evaluated in five patients.the company expects to commence the study in and submit data to the fda by the end of.the may release contained a safe harbor statement similar to the one in the april release.ganem does not allege any change in invivo stock price resulting from the may release.
finally,on august,before regular trading hours,invivo issued a press release titled invivo therapeutics updates clinical plan.that release said 
the company now expects that,based on the judgment of new management,it will enroll the first patient during the first quarter of.
under the conditions of the fda approval of the investigational device exemption,the pilot trial will be staggered such that each patient will be followed for three months prior to requesting approval to enroll the next patient.because the company must obtain fda approval to enroll each subsequent patient,the company anticipates that from the date of the first enrolled patient,it will take at least months to complete enrollment.consistent with fda guidance,the company then expects to conduct a pivotal study with a control group to obtain fda approval to commence commercialization under a humanitarian device exemption.
interim ceo michael astrue was quoted as saying while the study will take additional time,we look forward to bringing this important therapy into the clinic.
ganem alleges that invivo stock price dropped in reaction to the revised start date and estimated time for completion of the clinical trial revealed in this press release.historical stock prices show that an unusually high volume of trading started on friday,august,and continued from monday,august through the end of the class period on august.the stock price fluctuated during those four trading days,ultimately dropping from per share at the opening of trading on august to at the close of trading on august.
procedural background 
ganem brought this action against invivo and its former ceo,reynolds,on behalf of a putative class consisting of all persons and entities who purchased the common stock of invivo from april,through august,inclusive,all purchasers of stock between the dates of the initial announcement of the clinical trial and the press release nearly five months later that revealed problems with the timeline for the trial.the operative amended complaint asserted two claims first,that invivo and reynolds deceived investors into buying common stock at high prices,artificially boosted by the false or misleading press releases,in violation of b of the exchange act,b,and rule promulgated thereunder,and,second,that reynolds is liable as a controlling person under a of the exchange act,a.
the district court rejected both claims,concluding that ganem had failed adequately to plead material misrepresentations or scienter supporting a claim under b and rule,and that,absent a primary violation under b,ganem derivative control person claim against reynolds must be dismissed.battle constr,invivo therapeutics holdings,supp.we focus on the claim under b and rule the b claim we review a dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo.sec tambone,cir.en banc.we accept as true all allegations in the complaint and make all reasonable inferences in favor of the pleader.id.

analysis of the claims.
ganem claims that the statements in invivo april and may press releases about the projected timeline for the preliminary study were materially false or misleading.specifically,with regard to the start date of the study,the april release expressed the intention that the study begin in the next few months,and the may release predicted it would start in.regarding the duration of the study,the april release said that invivo expects the study to occur over approximately months.as for the end date of the study,the april release said we expect to have all data to the fda by the end of,and the may release predicted that invivo would submit data to the fda by the end of.
ganem claims that invivo failure to mention the details of the fda approval letter rendered these statements materially false or misleading.he cites three allegedly material omissions the fda requirement that invivo satisfy a number of conditions within days including correcting the informed consent form before testing could begin on the first human subject the fda recommendation that invivo modify its study design so that the preliminary study could serve as the basis for approval of a larger study and the fda requirement of a staged study,in which separate fda approval was required for each of five stages.
according to ganem,the fda conditions,recommendations,and requirement of a staged study inevitably prevented invivo from following through on its stated timeline.he alleges that defendants failed to disclose in the april and may press releases that the fda approval of the clinical study included conditions that made it impossible to complete the study in months or to submit data to the fda by the end of,as represented.am.compl.in short,ganem theory of material misrepresentation is that invivo omissions about the content of the fda approval letter rendered the company temporal predictions materially misleading.
like the district court,however,we readily conclude that none of the challenged statements is false or misleading.we discuss each of the allegedly false or misleading statements in turn.
commencement of the clinical trial.
ganem contends that invivo misrepresented the imminence of the commencement of the study when the company reported in april that it would begin in the next few months and in may that it was expected to begin in.according to ganem,the start date provided by invivo would be impossible to achieve given the conditions imposed by the fda,thus making invivo optimistic statements materially misleading.however,as the district court found,any objective reading of the approval le
