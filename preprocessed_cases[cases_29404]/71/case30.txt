not all claims of wrongdoing by a company make out a viable claim that the company has committed securities fraud.this case is an example.
institutional investors,asserting claims on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the stock of defendant abiomed,brought suit against abiomed and two of its officers,michael minogue and robert bowen,alleging that all defendants committed securities fraud in violation of section b of the securities exchange act of,b,and sec rule and that the individual defendants violated section a of the act,a.the alleged misleading statements and omissions concerned abiomed flagship product,a micro heart pump called the impella recover lp.the complaint alleges that defendants told investors that its policy was to avoid marketing of the impella,when in fact defendants were orchestrating and engaged in widespread market promotion.and when the food and drug administration fda initiated inquiries into the company marketing tactics,defendants told investors that it was cooperating with the agency and working to resolve a few discrete issues,when in fact the company was trivializing the concerns and continuing to market.
the district court dismissed the complaint on the ground that plaintiffs had not pleaded facts giving rise to a cogent and compelling inference of scienter,as is required under the private securities litigation reform act of pslra.stat.simon abiomed,fds,wl,citation omitted.
we affirm.the district court correctly held that the pleadings are insufficient to establish the requisite inference of scienter.even assuming that plaintiffs plausibly alleged that defendants made false or misleading statements which had a material effect on abiomed stock matter that is far from have not sufficiently alleged that defendants made those statements with the conscious intent to defraud or a high degree of recklessness.aca fin.guar.advest,cir quoting aldridge cross,cir.
factual background 
we draw the following statement of facts from plaintiffs amended class action complaint and from materials defendants filed in the district court in support of their motion to dismiss 
a.the parties 
defendant abiomed is a company employing approximately people which develops,manufactures,markets and sells medical devices designed for circulatory support.minogue is abiomed ceo,and bowen is its cfo.plaintiffs are a class of entities and individuals who purchased abiomed stock from august,to october,the class period.
the allegations in the complaint are based in part on interviews with confidential witnesses who are former employees of abiomed.confidential witness worked in a support position as a clinical representative from march until april.according to,abiomed employees were in close proximity to one another,and minogue and bowen were very leaders.
the impella,a percutaneous micro heart pump with an integrated motor and sensors that can pump up to liters of blood per minute,is abiomed most important product.in fiscal year fy,of abiomed revenues came from sales of impella products,and most of that revenue came from the sales of the impella.the impella main competitor is the balloon pump iabp,which is much cheaper and more widely used than the impella.
b.the fda regulation of medical devices 
the fda regulates the labeling and marketing of medical devices pursuant to the food,drug,and cosmetics act fdca.under section k of the fdca,the agency can clear a device that is substantially equivalent in safety and effectiveness to an existing approved device and thereby allow the device to be used for the same intended purposes.the fda may also grant an investigational device exemption ide to a company to allow it to use a device in a clinical study to test its safety and efficacy.
under fda regulations,a company is not allowed to market a device for a use for which it has not been is,an use.however,the fda does not prohibit physicians and hospitals from use of medical devices,and a medical device company is allowed to respond to unsolicited requests from physicians for information regarding uses of the company products.fda regulations also prohibit a company with an ide from representing that the device is safe and effective for the purpose for which it is being tested.
c.the protect ii and recover ii studies 
in august,abiomed received an ide from the fda that allowed it to begin a clinical trial comparing the performance of the impella to that of the iabp during percutaneous coronary interventions pcis,commonly known as angioplasties the protect ii study.the study purpose was to measure major adverse events suffered by patients days after the pci procedure.
on december,abiomed terminated the protect ii study after finding that the impella did not achieve superior outcomes compared with the iabp at the day endpoint.however,abiomed continued to collect and analyze data from the study,and the study eventually yielded exploratory results suggesting a possible benefit for the device at days.the study was published in september in circulation,a medical journal.
in march,abiomed received an ide for a second study the recover ii study designed to compare the impella to the iabp in hemodynamically unstable patients undergoing a pci due to an acute myocardial infarction ami,more commonly known as a heart attack.the recover ii study was suspended in september and eventually terminated due to insufficient enrollment.
k clearance for the impella,the alleged pervasive scheme of off label marketing,and the fda response 
in june,pursuant to the k process,abiomed received clearance from the fda to market and commercially distribute the impella for partial circulatory support for up to six hours.under fda regulations,to repeat,abiomed was not permitted to market or promote the impella for any other use.plaintiffs allege that defendants flouted these regulations and engage d in widespread improper promotion and marketing of the impella.they make the following specific allegations in support of that claim.
the january untitled letter 
on january,the fda sent abiomed an untitled letter objecting to certain of abiomed activities promoting the impella.untitled letters are intended to address alleged regulatory violations that do not meet the threshold for regulatory significance warranting a warning letter.they do not include a warning that a company failure to take prompt corrective steps could lead to an enforcement action.simon,wl,at citing food drug,regulatory procedures manual advisory actions,wl,at.
the fda stated that abiomed had improperly promot ed the impella for high risk pci and ami and represented that the impella was superior to the iabp in those uses.essentially,in the fda view,abiomed promotional materials represented that the device was effective for uses for which it was being tested under the protect ii and recover ii ides,which constituted a violation of fda regulations.
abiomed responded to the fda letter on march,stating that it now recognize d that the challenged promotions had made improper efficacy claims and that it would revise its marketing materials in order to remove the offending statements.abiomed also represented that it had strengthened its review process for promotional materials.
the fda viewed this response as inadequate,however,and abiomed made further changes to its advertisements and reviewed its marketing materials and website to ensure that there were no other materials beyond those identified by the fda that made improper safety or efficacy claims.on april,the fda wrote abiomed stating that its response appear ed adequate and that no further action was necessary.abiomed did not publicly disclose this correspondence with the fda at that time.
the june warning letter 
over a year later,on june,the fda issued an official warning letter to abiomed stating that the company marketing materials continued to improperly compare the impella to the iabp and promote the device for uses.a warning letter is a step above an untitled letter in the fda enforcement hierarchy.it communicates that the fda believes the regulated entity has committed a violation of regulatory significance but does not commit the fda to taking enforcement action.simon,wl,at citing food drug,regulatory procedures manual advisory actions,wl,at.
the warning letter criticized an abiomed magazine advertisement that pictured a hand puncturing a red balloon and suggested that the impella was superior to the iabp for circulatory support in the cath lab.the fda letter also complained about the abiomed slogan,recovering hearts,saving lives,which the fda stated would require a study under an ide to evaluate whether the device could salvage heart tissue and muscle.finally,the agency took issue with a claim at a conference of cardiovascular physicians that the impella could improve hemodynamics and cardiac output in ami shock patients,since those indications also needed to be supported with a study performed under an ide.
the warning letter was posted on the fda website.an abiomed spokeswoman stated publicly that the letter addresses specific promotional items from we are working with the fda to ensure all of our promotional materials comply with the agency moving forward.according to,however,abiomed senior management did not take the warning letter seriously and trivialized the fda concerns,a senior quality compliance and validation engineer at abiomed from april through march,likewise said that abiomed did change anything after being notified by the fda.
in july,at abiomed request,the fda held a clarification call with abiomed to discuss the warning letter.the fda reminded abiomed of the impella very limited clearance and told them to refrain from comparing the device to the iabp.one agency member noted that abiomed should have had some awareness of the issues given the january untitled letter.
in august,abiomed sent a formal response letter to the fda discussing the actions it had taken to address the fda concerns.the company stated that it would not run the balloon advertisement again and would ensure that the advertisement did not exist on abiomed website,and that it had removed materials related to the cardiovascular conference from the website.the letter also stated that abiomed would put into place a plan to prevent future violations.abiomed did not receive any correspondence from the fda for several months.
the off label marketing allegedly continues 
plaintiffs allege that,even in the wake of the june warning letter,abiomed continued to engage in pervasive marketing of the impella beyond its fda cleared indications.for example,during a february episode of the cnbc program mad money,minogue suggested that the impella could be used in patients experiencing heart attacks,and he held up an iabp and an impella side by side and stated that the latter was cost effective.also,abiomed made repeated claims in sec filings and conference calls regarding the efficacy of the impella based on the results of the protect ii study.
plaintiffs also allege that abiomed trained its sales and clinical staff to compare the impella to the iabp and to prompt and steer physicians to ask about uses of the impella.and,a clinical representative at abiomed from february until february,said they were provided with talking points about the protect ii study and encouraged to discuss the superiority of the impella over the iabp.stated that abiomed senior management knew abiomed did not have the clinical studies to support the claims they were making,an account manager at abiomed from september until the end of march,relayed similar concerns to senior management and was blown off,a director of clinical operations for abiomed from february until november,stated that abiomed promoted the impella for use in procedures that take longer than six hours,a clinical representative in cardiology at abiomed from august until september,stated that abiomed help ed doctors identify candidates to use the impella on,including pci patients.
on february,abiomed and the fda had a meeting,in part to discuss abiomed improper marketing practices.plaintiffs allege that abiomed never disclosed the true purpose of this meeting,instead stating in a later filing with the sec that the meeting was held to present the final results of the protect ii study and to discuss other unrelated matters.
the april letter 
in april,the fda sent another letter to abiomed asserting that its promotional materials were still improperly marketing the impella.the fda noted that the abiomedimpella youtube channel included several videos discussing unapproved uses of the impella,and that the company website contained a link to patient stories describing unapproved uses of the device.the agency also objected to minogue statements on the mad money episode.the letter stated that these examples represent ed a fraction of the objectionable claims regarding the impella,and the agency threatened enforcement action absent prompt and effective corrections.
abiomed disclosed this fda letter in its k,filed with the sec on june.the company announced that it had received a follow up letter from the fda stating that some of our promotional materials continued to market the impella in ways that are not compliant with fda regulations and that it was cooperating with the fda in addressing its concerns.
the august meeting with the fda and subsequent compliance audits 
on august,the fda and abiomed met again,again at abiomed request.t he primary objective of the meeting was to present abiomed actions to the warning letter and maintain compliance and then have a discussion as to whether abiomed was meeting fda requirements.after abiomed detailed the measures it was taking to ensure compliance with the regulations,an fda representative suggested that abiomed take a step back because h e saw the corrective actions as too targeted,and not addressing the whole labeling program.another representative commented that the fda did not think of the clearances of the product in the same way abiomed does.the fda was frustrated because it felt that regulatory violations were happen ing repeatedly.minogue responded that abiomed had to comply,and will comply,but that,because abiomed was such a small company,it was critical to market the device.an fda representative opined that it would involve walking a fine line to stay in compliance while marketing.the meeting closed with the fda admonishing abiomed that it took the matter very seriously,that a warning letter is the last communication given,and that abiomed needed to do a systemic review of its procedures in order to give the agency a systemic response for compliance.
in the late summer of,the fda conducted a compliance audit of abiomed,and abiomed simultaneously conducted its own internal audit.after those audits,abiomed pulled its marketing and training materials for compliance reasons and did not put up replacement materials for several months.the replacement materials,according to,were extremely limited compared to what they had previously for example,they no longer included slides about the protect ii study.abiomed confirmed in a letter to the fda dated august,that it understood its prior approach to compliance was too narrow in focus and so was adopting a broad,systemic approach to address the issues raised by fda.this approach included destroy ing the impella marketing brochures cited by fda,stopp ing distribution of all marketing labeling,recall ing all marketing labeling held by abiomed field personnel,and stopp ing any planned updates to all labeling and the abiomed website.
the attorney office investigation 
on november,abiomed disclosed that the attorney office for the district of columbia had begun an investigation into its marketing and promotional practices regarding the impella.abiomed also maintained its impella revenue guidance at approximately for the fiscal year,despite growth through the first half of the year,implying a marked slowdown during the second half of the year minogue disclosed the fda compliance audit in a conference call conducted the same day and stated that abiomed ha d taken extensive actions to correct its noted compliance issues identified in its annual report.abiomed stock price fell from per share to per share on november,a drop of approximately.
the february fda close out letter 
on february,the fda issued a close out letter to abiomed stating that the agency had completed its evaluation of abiomed corrective actions taken in response to the warning letter and had determined that abiomed had adequately addressed those violations.abiomed stock price recovered from the november fall.as of may,the stock was trading at per share.
defendants allegedly false and misleading statements 
plaintiffs allege that,between august,and october,defendants made specific false and misleading statements that deceived the investing public and caused the plaintiffs to purchase abiomed stock at artificially inflated prices.these statements fall into three principal categories.
first,plaintiffs allege that several of defendants statements about the growth of impella product revenues were false and misleading because abiomed failed to disclose that the reported revenue growth was substantially the result of marketing.defendants either provided no explanation for the growth or attributed the revenues to sources such as increased impella utilization in the cath lab.plaintiffs allege these statements were misleading because they failed to disclose that abiomed continued revenue was at risk should the company be forced to discontinue its marketing practices.defendants allegedly made these statements in an august press release and conference call announcing abiomed first quarter earnings in abiomed q in a november press release and conference call announcing abiomed earnings in abiomed q in a february press release and conference call announcing abiomed earnings in abiomed q in a may press release and conference call announcing abiomed earnings in abiomed form k and in an august press release and conference call announcing abiomed earnings.
second,defendants allegedly continued to compare the impella to the iabp based on the results of the protect ii study,even though fda regulations prohibited abiomed from doing so.for example,plaintiffs cite minogue statements in an august conference call that,according to the study,impella patients had significantly better outcomes at days relative to iabp patients.defendants allegedly made similar statements in abiomed q in abiomed q in a february press release and conference call concerning abiomed results on the february,episode of mad money in abiomed form k and in an august conference call.plaintiffs also allege that abiomed may disclosure of the february,meeting with the fda was false and misleading because it failed to disclose that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss abiomed improper marketing of the impella and the fda safety concerns with the device related to the protect ii study.
third,plaintiffs allege that many of defendants statements concerning the regulatory between abiomed and the fda were false and misleading.defendants claimed that abiomed policy was to refrain from marketing and that abiomed was taking steps to resolve the fda concerns,but in fact abiomed was engaged in widespread marketing and promotion of the impella and was not properly addressing the fda issues.in particular,plaintiffs cite the following statement,some version of which was contained in abiomed q,q,and q 
although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered promotion of our products,the fda or another regulatory agency could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in promotion.in june,we received a warning letter from the fda stating that some of our promotional materials marketed the impella for uses that had not been approved by the fda.we have cooperated with the fda in addressing its concerns and believe that we have resolved the matter without any penalties.although we believe that this issue has been resolved,if similar matters come up in the future,we may not be able to resolve them without facing significant consequences.
abiomed form k,filed on june,used similar language,and added 
i n april,we received a follow up letter from the fda stating that some of our promotional materials continued to market the impella in ways that are not compliant with fda regulations.we are cooperating with the fda in addressing its concerns.while we hope to be able to resolve this matter without incurring penalties,we may not be able to resolve it,or any similar matters that may come up in the future without facing significant consequences.such matters could result in reduced demand for our products and would have a material adverse effect on our operations and prospects.
finally,the complaint alleges that the certifications of minogue and bowen contained in the form qs and the form k were false and misleading because the forms did not fairly present in all material respects the financial condition of abiomed,including the reliance on marketing,and that the revenue and growth reported therein was the result of undisclosed,illicit and unsustainable marketing.
plaintiffs make additional allegations that they argue bolster the inference that defendants had the requisite scienter that is,that they had the conscious intent to defraud investors or acted with a high degree of recklessness.first,they contend that minogue,bowen,and other senior abiomed executives sold an uncharacteristically large amount of stock during the class period.minogue allegedly sold shares of abiomed stock,representing of his holdings,for a total of from january through the end of the class period.bowen sold shares,representing of his holdings,for during that period,after having sold no stock before january.plaintiffs cite similar figures for five other abiomed executives,who collectively earned approximately million by selling stock during this period.
defendants counter that many of the trades cited by plaintiffs were made pursuant to plans which were entered into before the class period august,to october,and minogue in fact increased his holdings of abiomed stock during the class period.defendants also counter that the reason bowen made no trades prior to the cited period was because he only became eligible to trade abiomed stock during that period.
plaintiffs also allege that,because the impella was part of abiomed core business,minogue and bowen must have been aware of the fact that abiomed was unlawfully promoting the device,and that the pervasiveness of the illicit and marketing and promotion of the impella further supports a strong inference of scienter.
distilled to its essence,plaintiffs complaint tells the following story for a month period,beginning with the fda untitled letter in january and ending with the fda close out letter in february,the fda repeatedly raised concerns that abiomed marketing of the impella did not comply with applicable regulations.abiomed responded to these concerns by making limited changes to its promotional tactics,but the fda was not satisfied until the summer of,when abiomed conducted an internal compliance audit and pulled all of its marketing and training materials,to be replaced with entirely new ones.confidential witnesses cited in the complaint state that abiomed senior management was aware that its promotional practices before that audit were in violation of fda regulations and willfully chose not to alter them.we note that might raise issues under fda regulations.
what raises securities law concerns,according to plaintiffs,is that management allegedly misled investors during this period by failing to attribute the growth in impella revenues to unlawful marketing practices improperly comparing the impella to the iabp by touting the results of the protect ii study stating that it had a policy of not engaging in marketing and stating that abiomed was taking steps to address the agency concerns,when in fact the company was engaged in intentional and pervasive marketing,contrary to its stated policy.
ii.litigation procedural history 
on november,two individuals filed a complaint on behalf of all purchasers of abiomed stock during the class period.simon,wl,at.in february,the district court appointed the two appealing institutional investors as lead plaintiffs,and the lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on may.id.
on april,the district court,in a thorough opinion,granted defendants motion to dismiss.the court found that plaintiffs had plausibly alleged that abiomed engaged in marketing practices and that those practices materially affected the stock price.id.at.it also held that the plaintiffs had plausibly alleged several actionable misrepresentations abiomed statements that its policy was to refrain from marketing abiomed statements that impella revenue growth was attributable to particular primary source s other than uses and abiomed statements about the protect ii study t o the extent they were made to promote marketing.id.at.however,the court found that the complaint allegations of scienter were not cogent and compelling,as is required for pleadings in securities fraud cases.id.at.the court also dismissed plaintiffs a claims because such a violation depend s on an underlying violation of the exchange act.id.at.

application 
plaintiffs allege that defendants made the following misrepresentations that deceived investors statements about growth in impella revenues that did not disclose that the growth was due to marketing statements about the day results of the protect ii study that improperly compared the impella to the iabp statements that abiomed had a policy of not engaging in marketing and statements that abiomed was taking steps to address the fda concerns,when in fact the company was engaged in intentional and pervasive marketing,contrary to its stated policy.plaintiffs counsel conceded at oral argument that plaintiffs case depends on the first,third,and fourth categories of statements.statements in the second category are simply examples of improper marketing those are relevant to this case only insofar as they show that the defendants statements that they were not engaged in marketing were untrue 
we therefore focus on defendants statements about increased impella revenues and their statements that abiomed policy was to comply with fda regulations concerning marketing and that the company was taking steps to address the agency concerns regarding promotion of the impella.we address the statements first,then turn to the statements regarding abiomed interactions with the fda,and finally address the complaint insider trading allegations.
statements regarding increased revenues 
we assume arguendo that the district court correctly found that plaintiffs had alleged enough to survive dismissal on claims that abiomed provided false explanations for impella revenue growth.see simon,wl,at.we hold that the statements are not actionable on scienter grounds.we do address the strength of the materiality of the statements because t he question of whether a plaintiff has pled facts supporting a strong inference of scienter has an obvious connection to the question of the extent to which the omitted information is material.waters,at.if it is questionable whether a fact is material or its materiality is marginal,that tends to undercut the argument that defendants acted with the requisite intent or extreme recklessness in not disclosing the fact.id.
the materiality of the impugned omission here abiomed failure to state that some of the increased revenues were due to marketing is marginal at best.plaintiffs contention that the omission would have mattered to a reasonable investor depends on a long chain of inferences,most of which are not sufficiently substantiated by the allegations in the complaint.
first,we would have to infer that,of the of abiomed revenue due to sales of impella products,a substantial portion is due to sales of the impella.the complaint alleges that the impella accounted for most of that revenue,but provides no specifics.second,we would have to infer that,of the revenues from the impella,a substantial portion was due to purchases for use by health care professionals.the complaint provides no indication of the proportion of impella use that was.third,we would have to infer that,of the revenues from use,a substantial portion of that use was due to marketing of the device,and,further,that the portion was so significant as to undercut the company projected growth figures.and fourth,we would have to infer that the resulting undercutting of the growth figures was substantial enough to have a material effect on the stock price.again,the complaint provides no basis in fact for making these inferences.
plaintiffs do allege that promotion was widespread,but they do not state or even suggest what proportion of sales were made as a result of such efforts,or the significance of the contribution of those sales to abiomed stock price.the marginal materiality of the alleged statements and omissions concerning revenues weighs against an argument that defendants here possessed the requisite scienter.see waters,at 
plaintiffs attempt an argument that defendants made statements about abiomed revenues with the intent to deceive investors or with reckless disregard as to whether investors would be deceived.the argument is undercut by the fact that abiomed explicitly warned investors both a that the fda might disagree with the company assessment of the legality of its marketing practices and b that,if the fda took enforcement action against it,that could result in reduced demand for our products and would have a material adverse effect on our operations and prospects.see genzyme,at noting that a corporation informative disclosures undercut any inference of fraudulent intent on the part of defendants waters,at a ttempts to provide investors with warnings of risks generally weaken the inference of scienter.alteration in original quoting ezra charitable trust tyco int l,cir.
further,the company did not withhold information about the fda concerns once the fda issued a warning letter abiomed promptly disclosed receipt of the june warning letter and stated repeatedly throughout the class period that the fda could disagree with abiomed position that its marketing was lawful and conclude that we have engaged in promotion.abiomed did not promise a positive resolution of the matter rather,it acknowledged that if similar matters come up in the future,we may not be able to resolve them without facing significant consequences.these are not the actions of a company bent on deceiving investors as to their future earnings prospects 
under plaintiffs theory of the case,abiomed should have affirmatively admitted widespread wrongdoing rather than stating that the outcome of its regulatory with the fda was uncertain.that would be a perverse result such an admission would have been misleading,since the marketing issues had the potential to be resolved with no adverse action from the fda.we made a similar point in in re boston scientific.securities litigation,cir,where we noted that a company may behave irresponsibly if it issues an ominous warning about an uncertain risk that had not yet been adequately investigated.id.at quoting carpenters pension annuity funds biogen idec,cir.there must be some room for give and take between a regulated entity and its regulator 
statements about abiomed policy with respect to off label marketing and its interaction with the fda 
again,we assume arguendo that abiomed had an actual policy or practice of marketing,while its public statements were that its policy was to refrain from such marketing,simon,wl,at,and that defendants stated that they were cooperating with the fda when they were not doing so.but we conclude that plaintiffs have failed to allege that defendants made these statements with the requisite scienter.
first,there are abiomed substantial disclosures about its correspondence with the fda.as said,these disclosures undercut any inference of scienter.plaintiffs brief glosses over these disclosures in an effort to make the case for scienter more compelling.according to the brief,abiomed said that it did not engage in marketing and that all of the fda concerns had been resolved.but this characterization is inaccurate,both as to the complaint and as to what the actual statements were.the complaint actually says that abiomed stated its policy was to refrain from statements that could be considered promotion,but that the fda could disagree with abiomed view on that question and that while it believe d the issue had been resolved,it could come up again in the future and could entail significant consequences.in resolving this appeal,we focus,as did the district court,on the allegations of the complaint,not on plaintiffs characterization of those allegations.
other evidence supports abiomed argument that it was not involved in a scheme to defraud investors but rather in finding a solution amenable to the fda while meeting its need to market its products.it was abiomed which asked for meetings with the fda.and an agreement was reached.the fda in fact sent a letter in february saying that abiomed corrective actions undertaken in response to the june warning letter had adequately addressed the fda concerns.this significantly undercuts any inference that defendants purposefully or recklessly misled investors about the extent of abiomed cooperation with the fda.
scienter is not established because there were statements from confidential witnesses that abiomed management was in fact intentionally violating fda regulations.these witnesses said that abiomed senior management knew that abiomed was improperly marketing the impella,did not take the fda warnings seriously,and blew off the concerns of employees the confidential witnesses are not described with sufficient particularity for their statements to give rise to the requisite strong inference of scienter on the part of abiomed and its management.as the district court noted,none of the witnesses were in senior management positions,and they appear to have had relatively little ongoing contact with senior management.simon,wl,at,and did not even work at abiomed during the class period and so would not have had firsthand knowledge of the state of mind of abiomed management during that period.and,and,who stated that the training and marketing materials abiomed provided were improper under fda regulations,did not identify the time period to which most of their statements related.biogen idec,at discounting probative value of observations by confidential sources in part because the sources did not disclose when those observations were made.the cws statements are also undermined by the fact that the fda eventually closed out its investigation of abiomed without taking any action adverse to the company.
more fundamentally,even if the cws statements plausibly suggest that abiomed was acting improperly,they do not show that defendants statements about company policy and the fda inquiries were made with conscious intent to defraud or recklessly.as we said in waters,t he key question is not whether defendants had knowledge of certain undisclosed facts,but rather whether defendants knew or should have known that their failure to disclose those facts present ed a danger of misleading buyers or sellers.at third alteration in original emphasis added citation omitted quoting greebel,at.for example,statements,far from suggesting an intent to defraud investors,suggest instead that abiomed was aggressively marketing the impella every which way in order to sell more units 
insider trading allegations 
the plaintiffs allegations of insider trading do not alter our conclusion as to lack of scienter.depending on context,allegations of insider trading may offer some support for inferences of scienter.waters,at.the vitality of the inference to be drawn depends on the facts,and can range from marginal to strong.id.quoting greebel,at.for stock sales by corporate officials to bolster an inference of scienter,the trading must be,a t a minimum,unusual,well beyond the normal patterns of trading by those defendants.id.at quoting greebel,at internal quotation marks omitted accord greebel,at sales must be out of the ordinary or suspicious.
here,the trading cited in the co
