relief janet schaberg,sued under the name janet walsh,is the former wife of stephen walsh,a defendant in actions brought by the commodity futures trading commission the cftc and the securities and exchange commission the sec together,the agencies alleging violations of the provisions of the commodity exchange act and the securities exchange act.the agencies claim that,among other violations of securities law between and,walsh and his paul greenwood misappropriated from funds they managed for various investors as much as million dollars.the agencies seek disgorgement of this money.although the agencies allege no wrongdoing by schaberg,they seek disgorgement of whatever proceeds from the fraudulent scheme are in her possession.
the district court george daniels,judge entered ex parte restraining orders freezing the bulk of schaberg assets.subsequently,by decision and order,the district court converted the restraining orders to preliminary injunctions,prohibiting schaberg from transferring,disposing of or otherwise encumbering essentially any of her assets without the approval of the court.
in these appeals,schaberg argues that the district court abused its discretion in issuing the injunctions,since,she contends,the frozen property is not subject to disgorgement in the proceedings against her husband.in opposition,the sec and cftc not only contest schaberg arguments but also contend that we lack jurisdiction to hear these appeals.
we conclude that we have jurisdiction to hear these appeals.we further conclude,however,that determining whether schaberg assets are properly subject to a freeze by the district court in these proceedings requires us to assess whether schaberg has a legitimate claim under new york law to the property she acquired in her separation from stephen walsh.since this inquiry addresses unsettled and significant issues of state law,we certify,pursuant to a and cir,two questions to the new york court of appeals.
background 
janet schaberg was married to stephen walsh from until.over this period,walsh was either a substantial shareholder in or a management partner of a number of business enterprises,including champion sportswear,tanger malls and the new york islanders hockey team.as a couple,the walshes also purchased,and sometimes sold,a number of real estate properties,including condominiums in florida and new york city,and houses in port washington,new york.during the marriage,schaberg only employment was as an unpaid volunteer for a series of charitable organizations.
between august and february,more than million dollars was wired from accounts registered to walsh and greenwood investment firm,wg trading investors,to accounts registered in schaberg name.this money was used to pay the walshes bills,including their children college tuition and household expenses.the agencies allege that these transfers represented the fraudulent misappropriation of investor funds.
the walshes separated in and began divorce proceedings in early.schaberg and walsh negotiated the terms of their separation for some time,finally signing a property settlement and separation agreement on november.under the terms of the agreement,schaberg conveyed her ownership interest in a jointly held port washington house to walsh,while she received sole ownership of condominiums in new york city and in florida.the agreement also provided that schaberg retained,and walsh waived all claim to,nearly million dollars held in several checking accounts,and that walsh agreed to pay schaberg a total of million dollars,first in biannual installments of through,and then in biannual installments of through.in executing the agreement,both parties waived their rights to any distributive award or equitable distribution with respect to property acquired by the other either before or during the marriage.
in february of,the cftc and sec each filed complaints in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,alleging a fraud by walsh,his partner paul greenwood,and various investment vehicles they controlled.both complaints sought monetary penalties and other forms of injunctive relief from the named defendants,as well as the disgorgement of gains plus interest from the defendants and the relief defendants alike.the complaints named schaberg as a relief defendant,along with other entities believed to be in possession of proceeds from the fraud,and sought disgorgement from her of the funds.
at the outset of the action,on february,the agencies moved by orders to show cause for preliminary injunctions and temporary restraining orders freezing the assets of the defendants and relief defendants and appointing a receiver.the district court immediately issued temporary restraining orders appointed a receiver in both actions,and,on march,held oral argument on the motions for preliminary injunctions.on may,the court granted both agencies motions for preliminary injunctions freezing the assets of the primary defendants.in the sec case,the district court converted the temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction freezing one of schaberg bank accounts as a relief defendant,and ordered her to provide discovery,including deposition testimony,concerning her finances.on may,the district court ordered schaberg to provide discovery in the cftc proceedings.
on august,the district court issued a decision and order,granting the cftc motion for a preliminary injunction with respect to schaberg assets.the court found that the agency had met its burden of demonstrating both that it was likely to succeed in ultimately tracing schaberg assets to the proceeds of the fraud and also that schaberg lacked a legitimate claim to the property.accordingly,the district court converted the temporary restraining order in the cftc case into a preliminary injunction,freezing schaberg assets in her bank and brokerage accounts.although the district court did not place schaberg assets in receivership,schaberg was prohibited from transferring,disposing of,or otherwise encumbering any of her real property,jewelry or art without prior notice to the agencies and the receiver,and approval of the court.
on august,the district court issued an order detailing the preliminary injunction in the cftc case,in accordance with the august order.the district court also issued a revised preliminary injunction in the sec case,conforming the earlier,narrower injunction in the sec case to the broader terms of the august order.on august,schaberg petitioned the court for the emergency release of funds to pay her living expenses and legal fees.the district court referred this petition to the receiver for a recommendation.
schaberg then appealed to this court.since these appeals were filed,some funds have been released to schaberg and to her creditors by the district court upon the recommendation of the receiver,although schaberg remains without access to the vast majority of her assets.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
schaberg notices of appeal together identify four orders of the district court for which she seeks review the court february,order granting a temporary restraining order in the sec case the court august,decision and order,converting the temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction in the cftc case the court august,preliminary injunction in the cftc case and the court order referring schaberg application for release of funds to the receiver.schaberg asserts that this court has jurisdiction to review these interlocutory orders under a,which applies to orders of the district courts granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions.
the agencies,however,contend that this provision does not extend jurisdiction to review the orders appealed from here.the agencies assert that,despite its plain language,a grants appellate courts jurisdiction only over interlocutory orders that concern serious injunctions they rely on carson american brands,in which,they claim,the supreme court held that a litigant relying on a must demonstrate that the order appealed from has serious,perhaps irreparable,consequence.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.they further contend that this court has implicitly adopted this interpretation of carson.since schaberg is able to access her funds with the permission of the district court,and since she continues to have use of her personal property,the agencies argue,the injunctions appealed from here do not have alone,and are therefore immune from appellate review.
we are not persuaded that interlocutory orders indefinitely freezing essentially all the assets of a relief defendant lack serious consequence simply because they allow her access to her funds at the court discretion.but even accepting this dubious contention arguendo,the agencies claim that we lack jurisdiction over these appeals is without merit.
the agencies argument rests on fundamental misunderstanding of the supreme court decision in carson,as well as of a previous decision of this court.in carson,the supreme court considered whether an order of a district court declining to enter a proposed consent decree was an interlocutory order appealable under a.see id.at.the court held that,even though the district court did not explicitly refuse to grant an injunction,its decision was appealable nonetheless since prospective relief was at the very core of the proposed consent decree,id.at,and the district court refusal to enter it would have serious,perhaps irreparable,consequence,id.at.carson serious consequence test applies only to situations where the jurisdictional grant of appellate jurisdiction under a is extended to orders that,while not explicitly interlocutory orders granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions,have the practical effect of such orders.carson does not impose an additional serious consequence requirement for appellate jurisdiction over orders that explicitly grant,continue,modify,refuse or dissolve injunctions and thereby meet the plain terms of the statute.see atwood turnkey drilling,petroleo brasileiro,cir carson does not apply to orders specifically granting or denying injunctions.
the decision of this court on which the agencies rely is likewise inapposite.the agencies cite our statement in hbe leasing frank,cir,that o ur cases have not made clear whether a showing of serious consequences is always required for an interlocutory appeal pursuant to section a.this statement in a footnote can not be read as a holding that a showing of serious consequence is required for us to have jurisdiction to review a decision granting or denying an injunction.however,even to the degree that this bit of dicta suggests some uncertainty about the law,it must be interpreted in context.in frank,we applied carson serious consequence test in determining that the court direction to a party to remove liens on a particular property was immediately appealable,even though it was not explicitly an injunction,because it had the practical effect of granting injunctive relief.id.at.what was appealed in frank was not an explicit interlocutory injunction,but rather a portion of what was denominated by the district court a judgment.we determined that we had jurisdiction under a only after determining that we lacked jurisdiction under,since the judgment appealed from was not final as required by the latter provision.see id.at.the statement relied upon by the agencies,therefore,must be read as an expression of doubt concerning whether the carson test must be applied in all circumstances where jurisdiction under a is asserted over orders that are not explicit interlocutory injunctions.we were not questioning whether serious consequences must be shown by a party seeking to appeal an explicit interlocutory grant of injunctive relief.accordingly,frank is fully reconcilable with our conclusion that carson imposes no additional serious consequence test for appellate jurisdiction under a over interlocutory orders explicitly granting injunctions 
we are satisfied,therefore,that we have jurisdiction over the district court orders converting its temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction and its further order elaborating the preliminary injunction.we proceed,therefore,to the substance of schaberg appeals 
ii.the preliminary injunctions 
the sec and cftc proceed against schaberg as a relief defendant.a relief defendant is a person who holds the subject matter of the litigation in a subordinate or possessory capacity as to which there is no dispute.sec colello,cir,quoting sec cherif,cir.such a person may be joined in a securities enforcement action to aid the recovery of relief,provided she has no ownership interest in the property which is the subject of litigation.sec george,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also sec cavanagh,cir cavanagh ii cherif,at.district courts have the power to order disgorgement from a relief defendant upon a finding that she is in possession of funds and lacks a legitimate claim to those funds.sec cavanagh,cir cavanagh i.to obtain a preliminary injunction freezing the assets of such a relief defendant,the agencies must demonstrate only that they are likely ultimately to succeed in disgorging the frozen funds.see also sec unifund sal,cir holding that the sec need not show the likelihood of a recurring violation of securities law to obtain an injunction freezing the assets of a named defendant,since such an injunction aims only to preserve the sec opportunity to collect funds.
we review a grant of a preliminary injunction freezing assets for abuse of discretion.cavanagh i,at.a district court necessarily abuses its discretion if it applies legal standards incorrectly or relies upon clearly erroneous findings of fact,or proceeds on the basis of an erroneous view of the applicable law,verio,cir internal quotation marks,citations and brackets omitted.
schaberg contends primarily that the district court erred in determining as a matter of law that she lacked a legitimate claim to the frozen funds,and therefore that an injunction was authorized under cavanagh she claims instead that she acquired her assets pursuant to the separation agreement she executed with walsh in their divorce proceedings,and that by executing this agreement she became a good faith purchaser for value of the assets.therefore,she asserts,she has a legitimate claim and her assets are not subject to disgorgement in the action against her.
we agree with schaberg that if she received her assets only when they were transferred to her pursuant to the separation agreement and if she is a good faith purchaser for value,then her assets are immune from disgorgement.district courts may only require disgorgement of the assets of a relief defendant upon a finding that she lacks a legitimate claim.see cavanagh i,at accord janvey adams,cir sec ross,cir cftc kimberlynn creek ranch,cir cherif,at.while we have not developed explicit guidelines for what qualifies as a legitimate claim,we have held that the receipt of property as a gift,without the payment of consideration,does not create a legitimate claim sufficient to immunize the property from disgorgement.see cavanagh i,at see also george,at holding that a relief defendant must disgorge a diamond ring given to her as a gift because the money used to buy it was obtained through fraud.while we have not directly addressed the issue,our sister courts of appeal have held that relief defendants who have provided some form of valuable consideration in good faith in return for proceeds of fraud are beyond the reach of the district court disgorgement remedy.see janvey,at holding that creditors whose loans were repaid by defendant in sec enforcement action had sufficient legitimate ownership of the funds so as to preclude being treated as relief defendants kimberlynn creek ranch,at r eceipt of funds as payment for services rendered to an employer constitutes one type of ownership interest that would preclude proceeding against the holder of the funds as a relief defendant.on this basis,we conclude that if schaberg truly is a good faith purchaser for value of the assets in her question of new york state law,see butner united states,as a general rule,p roperty interests are created and defined by state law.her assets would not be subject to disgorgement in a proceeding against her former husband.
schaberg argument that she holds her assets as a good faith purchaser for value proceeds in two steps first,she argues that the district court erred in focusing its analysis on transfers of investor funds to her checking accounts over the course of her marriage.these transfers,she contends,were not to her,but rather to her and walsh together,and the money,even after the transfers,was not her individual property,but rather part of the marital estate.schaberg asserts that this money was transferred to her only by the separation agreement she executed with walsh.second,schaberg contends that because she relinquished valuable claims to the walsh marital estate in this negotiated and separation agreement,she holds whatever she derived from the agreement as a good faith purchaser for value.evaluating schaberg argument involves addressing two substantial questions of new york state law.
new york domestic relations law 
the first prong of schaberg argument is that the district court erred in concluding that she received money separately while she was married,since this money was jointly held marital property.as she notes,new york domestic relations law drl defines marital property as all property acquired by either or both spouses during the marriage and before the execution of a separation agreement or the commencement of a matrimonial action,regardless of the form in which title is held.see musso ostashko,cir explaining that,since marriage is an economic partnership,new york law provides that all its proceeds should be divided equitably upon dissolution.although the money was held in an account in her name,she maintains,it was the benefit of the marital estate,to pay expenses that were not hers alone,but of the marital unit.accordingly,she asserts that it was only when pursuant to the execution of a separation agreement with walsh in she was permitted to retain the remaining funds in her checking accounts,that the funds were transferred from the marital estate,a transfer which could serve to give rise to a legitimate claim.
in opposition,the agencies contend that the monies misdirected from investor accounts to schaberg checking accounts never became marital property,and accordingly could not be transferred from the marital estate to schaberg by means of the separation agreement.they argue that drl implicitly extends the marital estate only to property obtained lawfully.if the proceeds of the fraud never became part of the marital estate,schaberg could not have acquired them in her separation agreement,and her only claim to ownership would be based on receipt of the funds while she was married.under cavanagh i,this receipt of the funds without consideration would be insufficient to defeat the agencies disgorgement claim.
we agree with schaberg that a separation agreement can serve as a conveyance from the marital estate to divorcing individuals within the meaning of new york real property law,which defines conveyance to include every written instrument,by which any estate or interest in real property is created.see fdic malin,cir.accordingly,if the funds at issue were part of the marital estate,her agreement with walsh did create an interest in the funds for her individually.see id.
we are unable to determine,however,whether drl defines marital property to include the proceeds of fraud.on the one hand,the plain language of the statute suggests that marital property should include such assets section b c defines marital property as all property acquired by either or both spouses during the marriage and before the commencement of a matrimonial action,regardless of the form in which title is held.no new york authority supports the agencies contention that the word acquired implicitly includes a requirement of lawfulness.furthermore,new york courts are clear that the term marital property is to be broadly construed,see price price,n,and that the law favors the inclusion of property within the marital estate,see burns burns,
on the other hand,a lower court decision in new york suggests that the new york court of appeals might not extend definition of marital property to include any assets misappropriated from investor funds over the course of the walshes marriage.in a divorce proceeding between a couple that jointly operated an unlawful loansharking enterprise,a new york supreme court held that the proceeds of an illegal business are not marital property.lapaglia lapaglia.kings cnty.the court reasoned that,as a matter of public policy,the fruits of a criminal enterprise are not subject to equitable distribution.id.
furthermore,we believe that since new york has no binding authority on this question,the new york court of appeals may be swayed by persuasive authority from other states.the supreme court of colorado has held that the marital estate does not include proceeds of fraud.see in re marriage of allen.in allen,an employer sued its employee to recover embezzled funds and then sued the exployee to recover that portion of the embezzled funds that she received pursuant to a property settlement agreement executed in their divorce.the argued that she was entitled to keep the assets of the fraud,because she was a good faith purchaser for value by virtue of the settlement agreement.the court,however,rejected this argument,finding that t he property was never truly a marital asset and should never have been subject to the allens property division negotiations.id.at.the court concluded that there was no reason to enhance a spouse interest in misappropriated property merely because the marriage is later dissolved.id.similarly,a new jersey court has held that illegally obtained funds were not properly subject to equitable division.see sheridan sheridan.ch.div.
since the new york court of appeals has not been presented with a case similar to allen,we are uncertain how it would address the issue of whether the proceeds of fraud can be considered marital property.accordingly,we certify this question to that court does marital property within the meaning of new york domestic relations law include the proceeds of fraud 
new york debtor and creditor law and 
even if schaberg separation agreement served to transfer the marital assets to her individual ownership,our analysis still requires a second step we must determine whether this transfer made schaberg a good faith purchaser for value according to the terms of new york debtor and creditor law dcl.this inquiry also presents a substantial issue of new york state law,and thus we certify a second question to the new york court of appeals.
dcl provides that a creditor whose claim has matured may have a conveyance set aside against any person,other than a good faith purchaser for value,defined as a purchaser for fair consideration without knowledge of the fraud.schaberg contends that she meets this definition because the assets were transferred to her without notice of their source,and she paid fair consideration,which is defined by dcl as given when in exchange for property,as a fair equivalent therefor,and in good faith,property is conveyed or an antecedent debt is satisfied.schaberg argues that she paid fair consideration because,in return for the receipt of her property in the agreement,she agreed that she would never seek through court proceedings or otherwise a distributive award or an award of equitable distribution with respect to any other property acquired by her husband over the course of their marriage 
schaberg relies upon fdic malin,cir.in malin,we held that a judgment creditor could not set aside as fraudulent under dcl a conveyance of a house from a husband,leonard malin,to his wife,phyllis malin,in a separation agreement.we determined that phyllis interest in the house was protected,since it was transferred to her before the date of the creditor judgment lien,she had no notice of the fraud,and she paid fair consideration for the property according to the terms of dcl.id.at.our determination that phyllis paid fair consideration turned on the findings that the separation agreement represented a bargained for exchange in which the wife relinquished rights and remedies otherwise conferred by law,the
