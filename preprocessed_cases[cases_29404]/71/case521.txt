factual background 
this case began as six separate proposed class actions,all of which were brought by shareholders alleging they suffered damages as a result of being induced to purchase shares of alpharma common stock on the basis of false or misleading statements made by the company and its top executives.on march,the district court consolidated these actions,appointed maverick capital,as lead plaintiff,and ordered the filing of a consolidated amended complaint 
plaintiffs filed the consolidated amended class action complaint the complaint on june.in the complaint,plaintiffs seek to represent investors who purchased alpharma stock between april,and october.they allege that the company and four of its executives caused the issuance of materially false and misleading financial results during the proposed class period,thereby artificially inflating the value of the company common stock.plaintiffs further allege that these misstatements were the result of improper accounting procedures which inflated the company reported revenue,net income,and earnings per share.
as stated above,plaintiffs seek to represent a proposed class of investors who purchased shares of alpharma stock during the class period.defendant alpharma,is a multinational corporation that produces pharmaceuticals for both animal and human use.its domestic headquarters is located in fort lee,new jersey.at all times relevant to the complaint,the company common stock traded on the new york stock exchange.alpharma sold a total of million of common stock to underwriters during the class period.
defendant einar sissener is alpharma chairman.sissener served as chief executive officer ceo between june and june,and then as chairman of the office of the chief executive from june to december.he signed alpharma form annual report for.the complaint alleges that he,together with relatives,owns sufficient voting shares to effectively control the company.
defendant ingrid wiik assumed the position of president and ceo in january and became a director in february.she too signed the company form annual report for.wiik sold percent of her shares in alpharma for a total of during a four day period in the first week of august when the value of alpharma stock was near its high point of per share.
defendant jeffrey smith served as alpharma vice president and chief financial officer cfo at all times relevant to the complaint.he signed the form annual report for,as well as each of the form quarterly reports issued during the proposed class period.during the first week of august,smith sold percent of his holdings in the company for a total of.
defendant bruce andrews served as president of alpharma animal health division ahd during all times relevant to the complaint.andrews sold percent of his shares in the company for a total of during the first week of august 
substantive allegations 
the primary basis for the proposed class action is plaintiffs allegation that the financial results released by defendants during the class period were the product of accounting irregularities which caused alpharma to report inflated revenue figures.these revenue figures,in turn,affected the accuracy of its net income and earnings per share calculations,thereby fueling an increase in the value of the company stock during the class period.
more specifically,plaintiffs allege that the individual defendants violated both generally accepted accounting principles gaap and alpharma own revenue recognition policy by recording ahd sales as revenue even though the products sold were not shipped to customers until as long as six months after the purported sale.in practice,this meant that ahd customers had agreed to purchase alpharma products but delayed receipt and payment until subsequent quarters.the purchased products were then put on customer hold and shipped to a warehouse until the customers were ready to receive and pay for them.these began when andrews became president of the ahd in may and had allegedly become part of alpharma corporate culture by the beginning of the class period.as a result,plaintiffs allege that defendants either knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that instances would arise in which customers would later refuse to receive and pay for orders already recognized as revenue in previous quarters,they had failed to disclose that essentially sapped future demand for the company products,and the use of encouraged the creation of fictitious sales.
alpharma restated its results for the full year,each quarter during,and the first two quarters of following the close of trading on the nyse on october.in its press release,the company placed the blame for the overstatements on employees in the brazil division of the ahd and noted that,after a full investigation,it was convinced that the problem had not spread beyond brazil prior to the announcement on october,the stock traded at.by the time the nyse closed the following day,the value of alpharma shares had fallen to.
in placing the blame for this drop in share price on the individual defendants,plaintiffs allege in their complaint 
each of the individual defendants by virtue of his or her executive and managerial positions with the company,directly participated in the daily management of the company,and was directly involved in the operations of the company at the highest level,and was privy to confidential proprietary information concerning the company and its business and operations,and revenue recognition policies.the individual defendants were involved or participated in drafting,producing,reviewing disseminating the false and misleading statements alleged in the complaint.
they further assert that the individual defendants had a duty to promptly disseminate truthful and accurate information with respect to alpharma and to promptly correct any public statements issued by or on behalf of the company that had become false or misleading.plaintiffs allege this duty was violated when defendants knowingly or recklessly disregarded the fact that the misleading statements and omissions would adversely affect the integrity of the market for the company stock and would cause the price of the company common stock to become artificially inflated.
details of ahd 
alpharma ahd conducts business with its customers through a staff of sales representatives.at all times relevant to the complaint,these sales representatives were supervised by regional sales managers.the sales managers reported to randy maclin,ahd vice president of sales and marketing within the united states,and loren williams,vice president of sales and marketing for ahd in latin america.in a typical transaction,sales representatives would provide the company customer service department csd with the details of the purchase,including whether the product was to be shipped,picked up,or placed on customer hold.the csd would then enter the transaction into the company business planning and control system bpcs,which allocated inventory for the sale and created an invoice.each warehouse would conduct a monthly inventory,the results of which were submitted to alpharma headquarters in new jersey.however,the brazil division of ahd did not use the bpcs.instead,it recorded sales by sending copies of sales reports and financial statements directly to alpharma new jersey headquarters,which then entered the data into the bpcs.further,michael weaver,ahd vice president of finance and one of andrews subordinates,made monthly trips to brazil to review sales records and audit inventory.based on these facts,plaintiffs allege that personnel in alpharma new jersey headquarters were aware of or should have been aware of and able to access sales results from its brazilian operations.
beginning when he became president of the ahd in may,andrews is alleged to have engaged in a number of questionable practices,including telling ahd staff that he would take whatever action was necessary to raise alpharma stock price,firing ahd sales representatives and managers and replacing them with former from his prior employer,and no longer seeking input from sales representatives as to appropriate yearly sales quotas.this last action was relevant,as bonuses were tied to the staff ability to meet the sales goals set by andrews.plaintiffs allege that these purportedly unrealistic sales targets caused employees to engage in questionable activities such as the described above.because the number of products on customer hold could be determined from an examination of bpcs entries,plaintiffs conclude that examination of such entries did or could have alerted defendants to the fact that ahd was inflating its results by,essentially,shipping to itself.
the complaint goes on to detail a number of setbacks and expensive acquisitions which purportedly weighed on the company and pressured executives to increase revenue in ahd.plaintiffs allege that,as a result of these difficulties,the use of spread beyond ahd.specifically,they assert that knut moksnes and laritz valderhaug,the president and senior controller of the aquatic animal health division aahd,asked aahd controllers to record unreceived cash as accounts receivable despite the fact that the products in question had not yet been shipped to the customer.this resulted in the resignation of one aahd controller,who cited her concerns during an exit interview,which,she believes,was documented and placed in her personnel file at alpharma new jersey headquarters.the complaint further alleges that loren williams,who served until october as ahd vice president of sales and marketing for latin america,resigned over similar disagreements with management but that williams is unable to assist plaintiffs counsel due to a agreement.
statements made during the class period 
first quarter of 
the class period began on april,when alpharma announced results for the first quarter of.the company issued a press release which highlighted the marked improvement in revenues,net income,and earnings per share compared to the first quarter of.because a report issued by a wall street analyst following the announcement of first quarter results mentioned increased sales in latin america and southeast asia,plaintiffs allege that defendants were aware that the market was attributing alpharma apparent success to international operations,including specifically latin america.
the company filed its form for the first quarter of with the securities and exchange commission sec on may,this form,signed by vice president and cfo smith on behalf of himself and the company,contained the same inflated numbers as the april press release.these numbers were revenue of,net income of,and earnings per share of cents.in its october,restatement,alpharma lowered revenue by,net income by,and earnings per share by one cent.

fourth quarter and full year 
the company fourth quarter and full year results for were issued on february.the accompanying press release highlighted both quarterly and yearly growth in revenue,net income,and earnings per share.the earnings per share number exceeded expectations for the twelfth consecutive quarter.highlighting this fact,sissener issued the following statement 
alpharma has now achieved consecutive quarters of growth above the goals we have set.i am pleased with these exceptional results,which i believe reflect the success of the focused growth strategies we have established and of the efforts of our employees all around the world.the record results are particularly gratifying because they were achieved as we continued to make and successfully absorb significant strategic acquisitions that are an integral part of our growth strategy.

f.the discovery of the accounting irregularities 
plaintiffs assert that the internal investigation of the accounting irregularities described by alpharma would have taken a significant amount of time to complete and that the company must therefore have been aware of the accounting irregularities occurring in brazil long before the public announcement on october.they further claim that employees in the company new jersey headquarters were notified of incidents of improper accounting by paulo andreoli,a technical sales manager in ahd brazil division.andreoli allegedly was told that there would be no investigation into his allegations.however,plaintiffs contend that the information submitted by andreoli was reviewed or available for review by all defendants,and in particular,defendant andrews,president of ahd.as an example of the activities occurring at alpharma,plaintiffs allege that the brazil division december sales report contained nineteen fraudulent sales,eighteen of which occurred three days before the end of the quarter and reflected sales activity that was grossly out of line with the sales made during the rest of the month.
quoting a and instruction,plaintiffs further allege that defendants had a duty under applicable sec regulations to disclose in periodic reports filed with the sec known trends or any known demands,commitments,events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on a company sales revenues,income or liquidity,or cause previously reported financial information not to be indicative of future operating results.additionally,plaintiffs assert that defendants had a duty to make full and prompt announcements of material facts regarding the company financial condition.they allege that these duties were violated by defendants issuance of financial results that violated both gaap and alpharma own revenue recognition policy.as noted by the district court,this section of the complaint is followed by additional allegations of scienter which add nothing of substance to the claims described above.
plaintiffs rule and section a claims 
the allegations lay the groundwork for the two counts asserted in the complaint.count i is brought against all defendants pursuant to rule.in broad terms,it asserts that defendants acted both individually and collectively to defraud investors by making materially false or misleading statements in connection with the sale of the company stock.count ii alleges that the individual defendants were controlling persons of alpharma,and thus violated section a of the securities exchange act of,et the exchange act,by causing the section b violation described in count 
ii.procedural history 
as noted above,the complaint was filed on june,following consolidation of the six initial proposed class actions pending against alpharma.on may,the district court,concluding that plaintiffs failed to state a claim under either rule or section a,dismissed the complaint with prejudice pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.plaintiffs motion for reconsideration was denied by the district court on august,and this appeal followed.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
plaintiffs filed this proposed class action pursuant to sections b and a of the exchange act,b and a.as such,the district court exercised jurisdiction over this case pursuant to.we have jurisdiction to review the final judgment of the district court pursuant to.
our review of the district court dismissal of the complaint pursuant to rule b is plenary.brown philip morris,cir.as the district court did,w e must accept as true all of the factual allegations in the complaint as well as the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from them,and may dismiss the complaint only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.id.we similarly exercise plenary review over the district court interpretation of the applicable federal securities laws.in re rockefeller center properties.sec,cir.however,we review the district court denial of plaintiffs alternative request for leave to amend the complaint for abuse of discretion.see in re nahc.sec,cir in re burlington coat factory sec,cir.
iv.discussion 
plaintiffs argument is straightforward.they contend that the district court erred in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and,in the alternative,that the court abused its discretion in failing to grant them leave to amend.we begin our analysis with an overview of the relevant pleading requirements and then address in turn each of plaintiffs assignments of error.
the gravamen of the complaint is the rule claim asserted against all defendants in count thus,we begin by noting that section b prohibits the use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,of any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe in re ikon office solutions,cir quoting b.section b is enforced through rule,which creates a private cause of action for investors harmed by materially false or misleading statements.in re advanta.sec,cir.specifically,rule makes it unlawful for any person t o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made in light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.in re ikon,at quoting b.
in order to state a claim pursuant to rule,plaintiffs must allege that defendants made a misstatement or an omission of a material fact with scienter in connection with the purchase or the sale of a security upon which plaintiffs reasonably relied and that plaintiffs reliance was the proximate cause of their injury.id.in so doing,the private securities litigation reform act pslra,et,requires plaintiffs to specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.b b of particular significance here,the pslra also requires that the applicable mental state be pled with particularity.in re advanta,at.specifically,it states,in relevant part,as follows 
in any private action arising under this chapter in which the plaintiff may recover money damages only on proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind,the complaint shall,with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter,state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.
b.the requisite strong inference of fraud may be established either a by alleging facts to show that defendants had both motive and opportunity to commit fraud,or b by alleging facts that constitute strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.in re burlington coat factory,at.the appropriate sanction for complaints which fail to meet these requirements is dismissal.in re advanta,at citing b a.
in addition to the requirements contained in the pslra,plaintiffs also must comply with those set forth in federal rule of civil procedure b.id.rule b provides,in relevant part,that plaintiffs alleging fraud must state the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake with particularity.b.however,plaintiffs may generally allege m alice,intent,knowledge,and other condition of mind of a person.id.as applied to rule claims,rule b requires a plaintiff to plead a specific false representation or omission of material fact knowledge by the person who made it of its falsity ignorance of its falsity by the person to whom it was made the intention that it should be acted upon and that the plaintiff acted upon it to his damage.in re rockefeller center properties,at citation and internal quotations omitted gsc partners cdo fund washington,cir.further,rule b requires plaintiffs to identify the source of the allegedly fraudulent misrepresentation or omission.id.in sum,rule b requires,at a minimum,that plaintiffs support their allegations of securities fraud with all of the essential factual background that would accompany the first paragraph of any newspaper story that is,the who,what,when,where and how of the events at issue.id.at quoting in re burlington coat factory,at gsc partners at.importantly,to the extent that rule b allowance of general pleading with respect to mental state conflicts with the pslra requirement that plaintiffs state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind,b,the pslra supersedes rule b as it relates to rule actions.in re advanta,at.
here,the primary basis for the district court dismissal of the complaint was plaintiffs failure to adequately plead the essential element of scienter.we have previously defined scienter in the context of securities fraud as a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate or defraud,or,at a minimum,highly unreasonable conduct,involving not merely simple,or even excusable negligence,but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it.in re ikon,at citations and internal quotations omitted.in order to properly plead scienter under the pslra,plaintiffs must alleg e facts establishing a motive and an opportunity to commit fraud,or set forth facts that constitute circumstantial evidence of either reckless or conscious behavior.in re advanta,at quoting weiner quaker oats,cir in re digital island securities litigation,cir.in so doing,plaintiffs must allege facts that could give rise to a strong inference of scienter general allegations that defendants knew or recklessly disregarded the false nature of the statements at issue are insufficient.in re burlington coat factory,at.
plaintiffs pleading scienter through motive and opportunity must support their allegations with facts stated with particularity that give rise to a strong inference of scienter.in re advanta,at quoting b.thus,under the pslra,catchall allegations that defendants stood to benefit from wrongdoing and had the opportunity to implement a fraudulent scheme are no longer sufficient,because they do not state facts with particularity or give rise to a strong inference of scienter.gsc partners,at.plaintiffs attempting to satisfy their burden of pleading scienter by alleging facts establishing recklessness must allege a statement involving not merely simple,or even inexcusable negligence,but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,and which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it.in re advanta,at citation and internal quotations omitted.it is against this backdrop that we examine the complaint at issue here.
dismissal of the complaint 
plaintiffs rule claim 
as noted above,the district court held that plaintiffs failed to adequately plead the essential element of scienter,and thus failed to state a claim under the federal securities laws.in particular,the court concluded that the allegations contained in the complaint failed to satisfy the strict pleading requirements of rule b and the pslra.in reaching this conclusion,the district court noted that the complaint merely imputes scienter to the individual defendants as a result of their positions within the company,and thus fails to establish that either they or,by extension,the corporation were involved with the accounting irregularities occurring in ahd brazil division.
on appeal,plaintiffs assert that the complaint adequately pleads scienter by alleging both recklessness and motive.more specifically,they contend they have demonstrated recklessness by alleging that defendants violated gaap as well as alpharma internal revenue recognition policy,and that whistleblowers within ahd brazil division reported the use of and questionable accounting practices to alpharma new jersey headquarters where it could be accessed by the individual defendants.they argue that motive and opportunity are established by their allegations regarding the defendants sale of stock during the class period.
we disagree.turning first to the issue of recklessness,we concur with the district court conclusion that,at bottom,plaintiffs allegations rest primarily upon the premise that the individual defendants are liable simply by virtue of the positions they hold within the company.we recently rejected similar allegations in in re advanta,holding that g eneralized imputations of knowledge do not satisfy the scienter requirement regardless of the defendants positions within the company.at.rather,plaintiffs must allege an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,in order to establish recklessness.id.at.as explained below,they fail to do so here with respect to any of the four individual defendants.
the complaint fails to allege that sissener,wiik,or smith were involved in any way with the violations of gaap and alpharma revenue recognition policy occurring in brazil.the allegations against andrews similarly fail.as defendants note,the complaint fails to identify any made pursuant to andrews instruction.rather,plaintiffs simply allege that andrews set lofty quarterly sales goals and then pressured sales representatives to meet them we hold that such conclusory allegations are insufficient to state a claim under the applicable pleading requirements.see in re burlington coat factory,at holding that even under a relaxed application of rule b,boilerplate and conclusory allegations will not suffice rather,accompany their legal theory with factual allegations that make their theoretically viable claim plausible emphasis deleted see also kushner beverly enterprises,cir holding that allegations that defendants designed and implemented improper accounting policies failed to state a claim for securities fraud in the absence of allegations of particular facts demonstrating how the defendants knew of the scheme at the time they made their statements of compliance,that they knew the financial statements overrepresented the company true earnings,or that they were aware of a gaap violation and disregarded it rote allegations that the defendants knowingly made false statements of material fact fail to satisfy the heightened pleading standard of the reform act.citation and internal quotations omitted.further,allegations that williams,andrews subordinate,knew of the irregularities occurring in brazil provide an insufficient basis upon which to impute knowledge to andrews.see kushner,at holding that an allegation that someone involved in the relevant scheme reported to one of the named defendants was not specific enough to support a strong inference that the defendant knew of or participated in the fraudulent practice while it was occurring.
indeed,w hile under rule b all inferences must be drawn in plaintiffs favor,inferences of scienter do not survive if they are merely reasonable rather,inferences of scienter survive a motion to dismiss only if they are both reasonable and strong inferences.in re navarre.sec,cir citation and internal quotations omitted.such clearly can not be said here.thus,the district court correctly concluded that the complaint fails to link alpharma executives or any of the named individual defendants to the brazil incidents.
