factual allegations 
the following narrative is taken from the allegations in thompson complaint.because the district court dismissed the complaint under rule b,we assume that all of the allegations in the complaint are true.
from january through may,thompson worked as the chief financial officer cfo of,a publicly traded company.thompson resigned from in may because of highly questionable accounting and auditing practices at the company.more specifically,she resigned because of the refusal of officers and directors to make proper disclosures to the securities and exchange commission.compl.when thompson resigned,she forwarded her resignation from to the securities and exchange commission enforcement division because of her concerns of illegal conduct at.id.
immediately after thompson resigned as cfo in may,filed a civil suit against her.the suit was filed in an attempt to protect the chief executive officer ceo of,angelo tullo,who was then subject to criminal investigation by several federal agencies.id.thompson filed counterclaims in september.and tullo were both represented by the arizona law firm lewis and roca l r.
in about june,while representing an alter ego of in an attempt to purchase assets of a company in bankruptcy,attorneys at l r became aware that tullo was a target of a criminal investigation with several federal law enforcement agencies.id.tullo criminal matters were never disclosed in any securities and exchange commission filings.id.during the pendency of the civil litigation between thompson and,from may through april,attorneys at l r vehemently denied any and all knowledge of a criminal investigation targeted at angelo tullo.id.see id.
thompson and entered into settlement negotiations to resolve civil suit against thompson.on april,the parties entered into a settlement memorandum.id.under the settlement,thompson was to receive a substantial amount of common stock in.in part,the agreement was based upon the false representation by l r attorneys that t here in fact was no criminal investigation targeted at the ceo of,angelo tullo.id.yet on april,l r attorneys knew that there was a criminal investigation targeting tullo.id.on that day,thompson made it clear to all parties,including the lewis and roca defendants that she intended to sell as much of her stock as soon as possible.id.according to the memorandum,the settlement was to be executed on april.
moments before the final settlement documents in the yp civil litigation could be executed,the l r attorneys withdrew from the yp litigation due to an undisclosed conflict that they had purportedly just discovered.id.because of the withdrawal of the l r attorneys,was required to obtain new counsel and to postpone the execution of the settlement.a settlement was ultimately finalized on may,with the assistance of new counsel.three days later,on may,tullo was indicted on counts of fraud,conspiracy,money laundering,and orchestrating a ponzi scheme.id.as a result of tullo indictment,the value of the common stock that thompson received under the settlement plummeted in value.id.
the l r attorneys made their false representations that tullo was not subject to criminal investigation with knowledge of their falsity.id.however,thompson did not know of the falsity of the communications and representations by the l r attorneys.id.a s a result,she relied upon the communications and representations of the l r attorneys and thought they had been truthful.id.if the stock thompson received under the settlement had not lost value as a result of tullo indictment,it could have been valued at more than one million dollars.id.
ii.proceedings in the district court 
in april,thompson and her four children filed suit in federal district court against the law firm of lewis and roca,three individual partners in lewis and roca,and two spouses of those partners collectively the l r defendants,and against the capitol detective agency.thompson brought one federal claim under section b and rule the section b claim,and numerous claims under state law.the district court dismissed the section b claim and several of the claims with prejudice under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court dismissed several other claims without prejudice under rule b.finally,the district court dismissed the last remaining state law claim under c.thompson paul,d.after the district court had entered an order dismissing all of her claims but before entry of final judgment,thompson moved for reconsideration asking the district court to certify a question of state law to the arizona supreme court.the district court denied the motion.
thompson raises two questions on appeal.these questions are relevant only to possible liability of the l r defendants.no question relevant to liability of defendant capitol detective agency is before us on appeal.first,thompson contends that the district court erred in dismissing her claim under section b because it incorrectly relied on state rather than federal law.second,thompson contends that the district court erred in denying her request to certify the question of state law.we discuss her contentions in turn.

iv.discussion 
thompson section b.attorney liability under section b 
in dismissing with prejudice thompson claim under section b,as well as her claims for fraudulent misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation and professional negligence,the district court wrote 
a cause of action against opposing counsel for statements made during litigation is strictly limited to actions alleging malicious prosecution,also known as wrongful institution of civil proceedings.linder brown herrick,dismissing claims of fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress against opposing counsel for failure to state a claim.an attorney duty to a nonclient arises only if the nonclient is an intended beneficiary of the attorney services.wetherill basham.an adverse party is not an intended beneficiary of the adverse counsel client.lewis swenson,internal quotation omitted.imposition of a duty to an individual,other than an intended beneficiary would offend public policy by plac ing an attorney in a position where his own interests would conflict directly with his client interests.id.additionally,as a matter of law and common sense,thompson had no right to rely on statements made by the attorneys opposing her.linder,at.
a section b action requires justifiable reliance on alleged misrepresentations.atari ernst whinney,cir.the securities laws create liability for misrepresentation only in the event of a substantial likelihood that the misrepresentation significantly altered the total mix of information that the investor possesse d.id.at.if the investor already possesses information sufficient to call the representations into question,he can not claim later that he relied on or was deceived by the lie.id.as noted above,thompson had no right to rely on statements made by the attorneys opposing her.linder,at.
d at all material in brackets,except the,in the original.
it is apparent from this passage that the district court dismissed thompson section b claim because,in the court view,she had no right under arizona law to rely on opposing counsel statements,even though those statements were made in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.the district court reliance on state law in deciding the section b claim may be seen clearly in the last sentence in the second quoted paragraph,the only paragraph specifically directed to section b liability.relying on linder,a decision of the arizona supreme court,the district court wrote,thompson had no right to rely on statements made by the attorneys opposing her.for the reasons that follow,we hold that the district court erred in relying on arizona law in deciding whether thompson had a right under section b to rely on the statements of the l r attorneys.we hold,further,that thompson has stated a claim for relief under rule b.
before we proceed with the substance of our analysis,we pause to say that the district court was not well served by the attorneys who appeared before it.the attorneys representing the l r defendants argued in the district court that the standard governing alleged misrepresentations by attorneys in section b cases is a standard,and that arizona law does not provide for attorney liability to third parties.the attorneys representing thompson spent most of their brief in the district court,and all of their oral argument in that court,contending that arizona law does provide for attorney liability to third parties.thompson attorneys argued in their district court brief that the l r attorneys were liable under section b under federal law,but the only cases they cited were chiarella united states,d,generally dealing with liability under section b,and paracor finance,capital,cir,setting forth the factors for determining whether a person has a duty under section b to disclose information.neither chiarella nor paracor discusses the circumstances under which attorneys can be liable under section b.
sometime after losing in the district court and before writing their appellate brief,thompson attorneys discovered a number of cases that deal directly with attorney liability under section b.if they had cited to the district court the cases they now cite to us,that court may well have indeed,likely would have reached the correct conclusion in this case.thus,it is apparent to us that by erroneously framing the question of attorney liability under section b as one basically controlled by state law and then failing to cite the federal cases on point,the parties invited the district court to engage in its state law analysis.because,however,thompson attorneys briefly argued that the liability of the l r attorneys should be determined under federal law,we conclude that thompson has not waived on appeal the argument that federal law provides the proper standard by which to determine attorney liability.indeed,the l r defendants do not contend that the argument has been waived in this court.
section b makes it unlawful t o use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.b.rule implements section b.the rule encompasses only conduct already prohibited by b.stoneridge inv.partners,llc,d.under rule,it is unlawful

c to engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.

the principle is well settled that federal law,rather than state law,governs the construction of all aspects of rule.huddleston herman maclean,cir citations and internal quotations omitted,rev in part on other grounds,d.section b is not an exception to the general rule that a claim which arises under a federal statute and implicates federal policy is appropriately decided under federal law.in re nucorp energy sec,cir.see also in re columbia gas,cir similar.federal statutory rights could be easily defeated if state law could be used to control the incidents of those rights and the defenses to them,takessian,cir.see also dura,broudo,d noting that a section b private damages action resembles,but is not identical to,tort actions for deceit and misrepresentation huddleston,at.similar blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d similar.
the supreme court has stated in general terms that an attorney may be liable under section b.any person or entity,including a lawyer,accountant,or bank,who employs a manipulative device or makes a material misstatement or omission on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable as a primary violator under,assuming all of the requirements for primary liability under rule are met.central bank of denver first interstate bank of denver,d first emphasis added.see also united states,d quoting central bank of denver.the precise question presented in this case is whether an attorney can be liable under section b for statements made to third is,to persons or entities other than the attorney clients.a number of circuit courts have answered yes to that question.
in rubin schottenstein,zox dunn,cir en banc,attorney barnhart represented medical designs,mdi in connection with the sale of mdi debt and stock.barnhart assured rubin,one of the prospective investors,that one of mdi lenders,star bank,would increase the amount of funding for mdi.barnhart also assured weiss,an attorney for rubin,that star bank would have no problem with the contemplated investment by rubin.however,in truth,mdi was already in default on a loan from star bank,and the contemplated investment in mdi would constitute further default.barnhart knew this,but told weiss that everything between mdi and star bank was fine,and discouraged him from contacting star bank.
the sixth circuit,sitting en banc,held that barnhart could be held liable under section b,even though he had been representing the seller,and even though his misrepresentations had been made to a prospective investor.the court wrote 
one fundamental question posed by this case is whether enterprising attorneys may gratuitously tout their clients securities unconstrained by the general duty imposed by the securities laws not to make materially misleading statements in connection with the sale of such securities.
there is nothing special about barnhart status as an attorney that negates his rule duty to disclose,a duty that ordinarily would devolve under rule upon a third party under these circumstances.although under rule b and its predecessor,only those individuals who had an affirmative obligation to reveal what was allegedly omitted can be held liable as primary participants in the alleged deception,a duty to disclose naturally devolves on those who have direct contacts with the other side.sec coffey,cir.direct contacts may take many forms id.at t he conversations between barnhart and the plaintiffs clearly were
