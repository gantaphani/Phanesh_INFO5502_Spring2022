defendants appellants anthony cuti and william tennant appeal from judgments of conviction following a jury trial in the district court for the southern district of new york deborah batts,judge this opinion addresses cuti claim that the district court erred in admitting testimony from two lay witnesses as to what the accounting treatment of certain fraudulent transactions would have been absent the fraud,and tennant claims that his conviction should be overturned for insufficient evidence to prove his knowledge of the fraud and that it was error for the district court to give a conscious avoidance jury instruction.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony of the witnesses and that tennant claims are without merit affirmed.
background 
cuti was the former president,chief executive officer,and board chairman of duane reade,a retail drugstore chain in the new york city metropolitan area.tennant was duane reade former chief financial officer or cfo and senior,who continued to consult for the company on real estate matters after his formal retirement.
the trial evidence,which we take as credited by the jury,showed that from to,cuti and tennant collectively,defendants executed a number of schemes to inflate the company earnings in quarterly and annual financial statements filed with the securities and exchange commission sec.
the principal scheme consisted of the fraudulent sale of real estate concessions and other rights that duane reade held in its storefront leases.when duane reade vacated a storefront with an unexpired lease,the right to the remainder of the lease term could have residual value and be sold back to the landlord or to a broker,especially when rental rates had risen.cuti and tennant,however,inflated earnings by fraudulently selling real estate concessions that were virtually worthless and surreptitiously repaying the purchasers through payments disguised as expenses.
cuti and tennant primary counterparty to the transactions in this scheme was the winick realty group winick realty,a commercial real estate brokerage firm and its subsidiaries collectively,the wrg entities.at trial,cory zelnik,a partner at winick realty,testified that in,the wrg entities paid for concessions in eight leases that duane reade had already sold,assigned away or planned to abandon and another for options to buy out duane reade from three leases that were of minimal value to winick realty.the defendants repaid the wrg entities for these outlays using a sham consulting agreement and padded brokerage fees.the revenue immediately recognized from these transactions helped duane reade bridge a gap between its true earnings and analysts expectations for the fourth quarter of.in subsequent quarters,the defendants continued to arrange other sham transactions to inflate company earnings and to repay the counterparties.
because duane reade recognized such significant income from these activities,its external auditor,pricewaterhousecoopers pwc,required the company to include in its financial statements filed with the sec,a note stating that the company had no side agreements with or other obligations to the transaction counterparties.at trial,the government produced evidence of side agreements and demonstrated,through witness testimony and voluminous documentation,how the defendants executed and concealed their fraudulent conduct from the company internal accountants,pwc,the sec,and the investing public.
as part of its case,the government called kevin hallinan,the pwc partner who was duane reade lead outside auditor,and john henry,tennant successor as cfo and the company chief accountant,to testify as to how they had accounted for the proceeds from the fraudulent transactions how they would have accounted for the transactions had they been aware of the full facts and how the material information that was withheld from them led to misstatements in the company financial statements.
the rules governing the accounting of real estate concession transactions,as hallinan and henry explained,are set forth under generally accepted accounting principles gaap including financial accounting standards board statement and sec staff accounting bulletin.in order for revenue generated from such a transaction to be recognized immediately,duane reade had to have negotiated with the counterparty at arms length,the transaction must have had value,to the extent the transaction relieved duane reade of its obligations under a lease agreement,the company could not be committed to enter into another lease with the same landlord,and the transaction could not create any further obligations for duane reade to perform.if any of the foregoing criteria were not satisfied,immediate revenue recognition would have been inappropriate.both the company internal accountants and outside auditors adhered to these rules in booking revenue from real estate concession transactions.at trial,the defendants did not dispute that these rules were appropriately and consistently applied.
to demonstrate the impact of the defendants deception on the preparation and review of the company financial statements,the government presented hallinan and henry with information that cuti and tennant had withheld,such as side letters to the transactions,and asked how the withheld information would have affected their accounting.in each instance,hallinan and henry replied that if they had been aware of the withheld information,they would not have recognized the full amount of the transaction proceeds as immediate revenue.defense counsel objected to the use of questions as eliciting inadmissible expert opinion testimony from fact witnesses.
in his defense,tennant asserted that,like hallinan and henry,he too was deceived by cuti fraudulent scheme and signed transaction documents without knowing that fraud was afoot so there was insufficient evidence of his criminal intent to support a conviction.he also objected to the district court inclusion of a conscious avoidance instruction in the jury charge,which he claimed was unwarranted and prejudicial.
these arguments are again raised on appeal and we consider them in turn.
discussion 
cuti claim as to the testimony 
cuti argues on appeal,as he did below,that the questions posed to hallinan and henry improperly elicited expert opinion testimony from witnesses.because both hallinan and henry,while professional accountants,were not qualified as experts,cuti insists that their testimony as lay witnesses was inadmissible.
we accord a district court evidentiary rulings deference,and reverse only for abuse of discretion.united states robinson,cir.a district court has abused its discretion if its ruling is based on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or if its decision can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.in re sims,cir.
the federal rules of evidence allow the admission of fact testimony so long as the witness has personal knowledge,see.while opinion testimony can be presented by either a lay or expert witness,see.the initial question is therefore whether the contested testimony should be characterized as fact or opinion.t he distinction between statements of fact and opinion is,at best,one of degree.beech aircraft rainey,d.we need not adopt verbatim judge posner observation that a ll knowledge is inferential,and the combined effect of federal rules of evidence and is to recognize this epistemological verity but at the same time to prevent the piling of inference upon inference to the point where testimony ceases to be reliable to acknowledge its essential truth.united states giovannetti,cir.
in this case,the inference that hallinan and henry were asked to make in answering the hypothetical questions was limited by the factual foundation laid in earlier admitted testimony and exhibits,the factual nature of the hypotheticals,and the witnesses reasoning,which was based on undisputed accounting rules.these limitations left little room for the witnesses to engage in speculation and ensured that their testimony fell near the fact end of the spectrum.
moreover,the witnesses,although not qualified as experts,were fact witnesses of a unique sort.each was a certified and experienced accountant personally familiar with the accounting of the transactions at issue.the hypothetical questions utilized facts that had been independently established in the record.if the facts as the witnesses had understood them were a and the true facts were b,it was not inappropriate to ascertain,from the very witnesses responsible for their accounting,whether b would have affected that accounting under the same,undisputed accounting rules.and,since the applicable accounting rules were explained in detail,the reasoning process that the witnesses employed in answering the hypotheticals was straightforward and transparent to the jurors,who could readily discern whether the responses given were reliable.
cuti also contests whether the witnesses had sufficient personal knowledge,as required by rule,to provide factual testimony.see.this rule makes personal knowledge a foundational requirement for fact witness testimony and is premised on the common law belief that a witness who testifies to a fact which can be perceived by the senses must have had an opportunity to observe,and must have actually observed the fact.advisory committee note.
however,personal knowledge of a fact is not an absolute to rule foundational requirement,which may consist of what the witness thinks he knows from personal perception.id.similarly,a witness may testify to the fact of what he did not know and how,if he had known that independently established fact,it would have affected his conduct or behavior.as this case illustrates,questions that present withheld facts to a witness are especially useful to elicit testimony about the impact of fraud.although we have not addressed the issue squarely,other circuits have permitted the use of hypothetical questions to inquire into the effect of a fraud.see,united states orr,cir united states laurienti,cir united states jennings,cir united states ranney,cir united states bush,cir.
it also bears noting that there was nothing in the prosecution questions or in the answers they elicited that prevented the defense from challenging the factual accuracy of the disputed testimony.indeed,cuti pointed out at trial that at least one document hallinan claimed not to have seen was actually recorded in a log of documents covered by pwc audit,and thus cuti was able to argue that the auditor could not have been deceived about the accounting for that transaction.cuti also questioned the materiality of the accounting distortions to the company overall financial statement by extracting an admission from hallinan that the fair comparison for the proceeds generated from the real estate concession transactions was to the company income and not to the considerably smaller net income figure.
while we hold that the challenged testimony was properly admitted as factual testimony,we alternatively hold that it is admissible as lay opinion under federal rule of evidence,which permits a lay witness to give an opinion if it is limited to one that is a rationally based on the witness perception b helpful to clearly understanding the witness testimony or to determining a fact in issue and c not based on scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge within the scope of rule.
cuti argues that the hypothetical questions posed to the witnesses violated each subsection of rule because hallinan and henry were asked to comment on facts that they had not personally perceived because their interpretation of evidence already admitted was not helpful to the jury and because the witnesses used specialized expertise and were not properly qualified as experts in accordance with rule.
cuti rule a objection is unpersuasive because,as discussed earlier,the witnesses were not testifying to the existence of facts,but simply acknowledging that knowledge of such facts,already admitted into evidence,would have caused them to alter their accounting treatment.their testimony was plainly helpful to the jury within the meaning of rule b.
cuti rule c contention also fails but requires a bit more elaboration.the advisory committee note on rule instructs that a witness testimony must be scrutinized under the rules regulating expert opinion to the extent that the witness is providing testimony based on scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge within the scope of rule.advisory committee note,amend.lay opinion under rule must be limited to opinions that result from a process of reasoning familiar in everyday life.id.
cuti insists that if hallinan and henry answers to the hypotheticals are characterized as opinion,they are necessarily expert opinion and must satisfy the qualification requirements of rule because the testimony involved the technical and specialized knowledge of the accounting profession.at first blush,the accounting rules involved in the recognition of revenue from real estate concession transactions appear technical and unfamiliar to everyday life,but those rules or their interpretation were not in question in this case.the only issue was whether the withheld facts would have altered the rules application.
we held in bank of china,branch nbm llc that a witness specialized knowledge,or the fact that he was chosen to carry out an investigation because of this knowledge,does not render his testimony expert as long as the testimony was based on his investigation and reflected his investigatory findings and conclusions,and was not rooted exclusively in his expertise,cir.however,if the testimony was not a product of his investigation,but rather reflected his specialized knowledge of the banking industry,then it was impermissible expert testimony.id.at.
a similar question arose in united states rigas,cir.there,an accountant with personal knowledge of a company books testified to the accounting impact of debt reclassifications,which the government had already established as fraudulent.we held that the accountant testimony was lay opinion because it did not address what the appropriate accounting technique should have been,but was instead simply offered to show what the amount of the debt would have been had the fraud not occurred.id.at.
the testimony in this case was not rooted exclusively in the witness expertise and did not address the soundness of the accounting rules.when the issue for the determination is reduced to impact whether a witness would have acted differently if he had been aware of additional information the witness so testifying is engaged in a process of reasoning familiar in everyday life.see.advisory committee note,amend.the testimony of hallinan and henry in response to the hypothetical questions was therefore also admissible as lay opinion.
united states garcia,cir,is not to the contrary.in that case,we held that an undercover law enforcement agent could not testify as lay opinion that,based on his knowledge gleaned from other drug interdiction cases,the defendant was a partner in the narcotics distribution conspiracy.such testimony was inadmissible because the opinion was based on specialized experience that the agent had accumulated from other cases and involved a specialized reasoning process not readily understandable to the average juror.nothing similar occurred here.these witnesses testified based only on their experiences with matters pertinent to this case,and their reasoning was evident to the jury.
cuti also challenges the admission of the contested testimony as undermining the presumption of innocence by assuming his guilt.in support of this argument,cuti highlights second circuit case law that forbids such questions in the of defense character witnesses.see,united states russo,cir united states oshatz,cir.
this argument fails because the challenged questions here were not directed at character witnesses and made no assumption of guilt.hallinan and henry were asked,for the most part,narrow questions on direct examination designed to assess the impact of the fraudulent omissions on their accounting treatment.the district court took pains to limit the hypotheticals to the impact of the withheld information and barred the witnesses fro
