factual and procedural history 
factsthe triggering event mark hurd sexual harassment scandal 
in the fall of,jodie fisher began working for hp as an independent contractor fisher contract required her to introduce significant clients to hurd at hp events held at hotels throughout the world.she worked in this capacity for approximately two years.
in the summer of,about nine months after fisher stopped contracting with hp,fisher attorney,gloria allred,sent a letter to hp board of directors.asserting claims of discrimination against both hurd and hp,allred alleged that hurd had sexually harassed fisher.in addition to the harassment allegations,allred wrote that hurd had given fisher confidential information about an impending merger.
hp board promptly launched an investigation.initially,hurd lied to the board about the nature and scope of his relationship with fisher and about his familiarity with fisher prior work in adult films.the investigation revealed that hurd and fisher spent more time together during hp events than hurd had represented.it also uncovered that hurd doctored expense reports on several occasions,claiming that he had eaten dinner with his bodyguard when he had in fact dined alone with fisher.at least twice,hurd expensed meetings with fisher when there had been no nearby hp event.some time before the investigation concluded,hurd admitted that he and fisher had a very close personal relationship.without having interviewed fisher or her attorney,the investigating law firm did not find evidence of sexual harassment or insider trading,but it concluded that hurd falsified expense reports and lied about his relationship with fisher.
hurd resigned from hp shortly after the investigation concluded.in a press release,hp acknowledged hurd knowing violation of hp code of conduct,confirming that sexual harassment allegations had been made and that an investigation found unethical behavior.hurd was quoted as saying,as the investigation progressed,i realized that there were instances in which i did not live up to the standards and principles of trust,respect and integrity that i have espoused at hp and which have guided me through my career.immediately following hurd resignation,the price of hp stock dropped,resulting in an alleged loss of billion to hp stockholders.
background hp ethics scandal 
a few years earlier,in,a major scandal erupted when a whistleblower informed several government agencies that hp had hired detectives to monitor the phone records and email accounts of hp directors,hp employees,and journalists to find the sources of leaks of company information to the press.criminal charges were brought against hp and general counsel.although hurd had been ceo throughout this time,having taken the position in,he was found free from wrongdoing.the scandal had the effect of bolstering his reputation for integrity.following the departure,hp integrated the roles of chairman and ceo and named hurd as the company first joint chairman and ceo.under hurd leadership,hp shares remained buoyant during the scandal,dipping only for a brief time during which hurd own involvement in the monitoring was questioned.
apparently as a result of the scandal,hp intensified its promotion of ethical behavior within the company.with hurd at the helm,hp reinforced the importance of its corporate code of ethics,the standards of business conduct sbc.through congressional testimony,press releases,investor briefings,and public letters to employees,hurd took many opportunities to proclaim hp integrity and its intention to enforce violations of the sbc.hp,its stockholders,and wall street insiders viewed hurd as one of hp most valuable assets,seeing his leadership as the scandal silver lining.
shareholders filed multiple derivative claims in the wake of the scandal,all of which were settled together in.hp made some promises regarding business ethics as part of the settlement,including appointing a lead independent director,tasked with implementing and enforcing the sbc appointing a chief ethics and compliance officer to report sbc violations appointing an ethics and compliance committee to oversee hp policies and procedures regarding compliance and ethics improving ethics and compliance training programs and strengthening the sbc,particularly in regard to whistleblowing.
defendants statements regarding business ethics 
hurd led the charge to strengthen and ensure compliance with the sbc.after hp redoubled its commitment to corporate ethics and before allred letter triggered the investigation into hurd relationship with fisher,hp revised the sbc.hurd wrote the introductory message,describing the importance of ethics and entreating hp employees to commit together,as individuals and as a company,to build trust in everything we do by living our values and conducting business consistent with the high ethical standards embodied within our sbc.
many of defendants representations regarding ethics and compliance were made outside of the class period.the scandal predated the class period,as did the strongest statements made by hurd and hp allegedly elevating the importance of the sbc.for example,retail wholesale points to a letter sent to employees,statements made during press conferences,and congressional testimony,all of which occurred during.it was during this time that defendants suggested having implemented a policy for sbc violations,informing employees that any violations of our standards are unacceptable to and we will take appropriate action.
the complaint alleges fewer instances of representations made during the class period.most notably,the sbc itself was updated and released,including hurd prefatory message.concurrently with the release of the updated ethical code,hp published the sbc on the portion of hp website.additionally,during this time,hp restructured its internal organization,creating procedures and positions designed to improve compliance and ethical conduct,and hp chief ethics and compliance officer stated that ethics and compliance were a competitive advantage for hp.
the sbc includes several provisions inconsistent with hurd relationship with fisher and its.retail wholesale draws attention to particular provisions within the sbc,all of which are stated affirmatively and in the present tense.for example,hp states in the sbc that w e maintain accurate business records and create business records that accurately reflect the truth of the underlying transaction or event.the sbc contains similarly worded statements regarding honesty cooperation with investigators using good judgment reporting misconduct treating others with respect avoiding unlawful discrimination refusing to tolerate harassment preserving assets avoiding conflicts of interest providing gifts appropriately preventing insider trading and protecting confidential information.
during the class period,hp also asserted that the strength of its business was tied to retaining executives such as hurd.in its k and q filings with the sec,hp included a risk factor the failure to hire executives and key employees or the loss of executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations.
procedural history 
cement concrete workers district council pension fund initiated this putative class action in the summer of,and filed its first amended complaint fac later in.plaintiffs claimed that defendants committed securities fraud in violation of the securities exchange act of.upon motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim filed by defendants hp and hurd,the district court dismissed the fac without prejudice,determining that the plaintiffs had failed to adequately allege materiality and falsity.
retail wholesale filed the second amended complaint sac shortly after the court first order granting dismissal.hp and hurd again moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim,and the district court again granted their motion,this time with prejudice,finding that any further amendments would be futile.as in its first order,the district court determined that retail wholesale claims could not survive because materiality and falsity had not been alleged.retail wholesale timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
section b of the securities exchange act of prohibits the use of any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance related to the purchase or sale of securities when the use violates the regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission sec.b.under the operative regulation,rule,it is unlawful for any person t o make any untrue statement of fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.b b.
to be viable,a claim brought under b and rule must contain six essential elements a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant scienter a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission economic loss and loss causation.matrixx initiatives,siracusano,quoting stoneridge inv.partners,llc.our discussion focuses on the first element whether there was a material misrepresentation or omission as that factor is the issue most hotly contested by the parties,and its resolution is dispositive of the case.
an actionable material misrepresentation or omission has two components.first,under the pslra and the federal rules of civil procedure,plaintiffs must allege a misrepresentation or a misleading omission with particularity and explain why it is misleading.b a b fed.civ.b.second,applying an objective standard,that misrepresentation or omission must have been material to investors.b a b.the materiality of the misrepresentation or an omission depends upon whether there is a substantial likelihood that it would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available for the purpose of decisionmaking by stockholders concerning their investments.basic levinson,quoting tsc,northway.
retail wholesale has raised two theories in support of its argument regarding this element.first,it asserts that there were material misrepresentations specifically,that defendants public statements about business ethics,particularly the sbc itself,were material representations made demonstrably false by their inconsistency with hurd conduct.second,it argues that there were material omissions,contending that defendants misled investors by failing to meet a duty owed to investors to disclose hurd unethical behavior.because neither defendants statements nor their omissions were misleading,both theories fail.
material misrepresentation 
retail wholesale argues that the sbc,bolstered by defendants express promotion of corporate ethics,gives rise to a finding of material misrepresentation.its claim is based in three factual allegations hp and hurd actively promoted the sbc and stated that hp had zero tolerance for sbc violations hurd sbc violations led to his resignation and hurd resignation caused hp stock price to drop.the court can not agree that,under the facts alleged in the complaint,defendants representations about ethics were materially misleading.
like the district court below,some courts that have considered whether a corporate code of ethics may give rise to a and rule claim have found that the claim failed for lack of materiality,never reaching falsity,see nathanson polycom,supp,cal,or reaching falsity only after first finding a lack of materiality,see in re yum brands.sec,supp.others have analyzed falsity first and not considered materiality after determining that no misleading representation or omission was made.see city of roseville emps.ret.sys horizon lines,supp.andropolis red robin gourmet burgers,supp.where a complaint arises from soft information,such as representations of compliance,the sixth circuit applies a wholly different analysis,considering scienter alongside materiality to determine whether a representation is an actionable misrepresentation.see in re omnicare.sec,cir.
the ninth circuit has not addressed how to determine whether statements made in or about an ethical code are actionable representations if the ethical code is violated.we approach this issue here by first analyzing falsity,to determine whether an ethical code and statements made about the code contain any misrepresentations of fact,and then,if there was a misrepresentation,determining its materiality that is,its significance to stockholder decisionmaking 
objective falsity 
a statement is misleading if it would give a reasonable investor the impression of a state of affairs that differs in a material way from the one that actually exists.berson applied signal,cir.quoting brody transitional hosps,cir.to be misleading,a statement must be capable of objective verification.or.pub.emps.ret.fund apollo grp,cir.for example,puffing expressing an opinion rather than a knowingly false statement of fact is not misleading.see also lloyd cvb fin,cir.in re cutera sec,cir.
defendants made no objectively verifiable statements during the class period.as one court has aptly written,a code of conduct is inherently aspirational.andropolis,supp.at.such a code expresses opinions as to what actions are preferable,as opposed to implying that all staff,directors,and officers always adhere to its aspirations.see id.
