background 
development of lemtrada 
prior to,defendant genzyme corporation genzyme was the owner of a promising drug called lemtrada.lemtrada had not yet been approved by the fda,but had shown potential as a treatment for victims of the advantage of lemtrada comes partially from its unique treatment cycle.while traditional ms treatments require a daily or weekly dosing regimen,lemtrada only requires two annual treatment courses.
in part because of lemtrada unique treatment design,genzyme used a study in its early clinical trials.in a study,either the researcher or the patient does not know which drug was administered.by contrast,in a study,neither the patient nor the investigator knows which drug was administered.lemtrada biannual treatment regimen effectively precluded the use of studies,as patients would realize they were being required to undergo treatment far less frequently than under their normal drug.in what appears to have been among its earliest public reports on its lemtrada clinical studies,genzyme stated in the new england journal of medicine in that it was relying solely on studies for the trials.
at least as far back as,the fda expressed concern about the use of studies for lemtrada,telling ilex the thenowner of lemtrada that was acquired by genzyme in in a teleconference that the use of studies in lemtrada early clinical trials would not provide substantial support for a bla.joint app x at.in,the fda again informed ilex in another teleconference that b ecause of study design issues,small sample size the clinical trial is unlikely to provide substantial support for an sbla.id.after genzyme acquired ilex,the fda reiterated in a telephone call that the early clinical trial will not be a pivotal study to support a license application.id.
in,the fda expressed more optimism for the drug approval based on the studies,saying that a rater blinded but patient not blinded study may be adequate if the effect is large,though the fda again noted that it would prefer,controlled studies,especially for the pivotal trials.id.at.in,the fda sent a letter strongly recommend ing genzyme use a placebo control in your pivotal trials,adding that t he acceptability of your study will be a matter of review.if your study results reveal an extremely large effect,then fda may potentially accept this design for the pivotal trials.id.notwithstanding this feedback,the fda permitted genzyme to enroll patients in phase iii clinical trials that were only studies.phase iii is the final phase of trials prior to submission of the drug for fda approval for public usage.
the fda concerns regarding the use of studies continued and were expressed to genzyme during the phase iii trials.according to the fda minutes of a meeting with genzyme,the fda expressed in march that it was concerned by the potential bias introduced by the absence of blinding of patients,and that the bias introduced by unblinding physicians and patients remains a significant problem which will cause serious difficulties in interpreting the results of the trial.id.at.and in,the fda reiterated in a meeting with genzyme that the lack of doubleblinding has consistently concerned us.the lack of blinding remains a major concern.id.at.the fda added that despite these previous concerns that have been communicated to you,there was little discussion of the unblinded design of the trials in the meeting material.id.at.
sanofi acquires genzyme 
defendant sanofi is a global pharmaceutical company engaged in the research,development,manufacturing,and marketing of healthcare products.in,sanofi began an effort to acquire genzyme.at the time,lemtrada market worth was estimated at billion worldwide.genzyme initially rejected sanofi offers,arguing that sanofi undervalued lemtrada business potential.partially as a result of this contention,genzyme and sanofi began to negotiate a deal whereby genzyme stockholders would be partially compensated by a financial instrument tied to the value of lemtrada.the two parties eventually agreed that each shareholder would receive a cash payment of per share,plus one cvr per share.the parties agreed to the terms of the acquisition and executed a merger agreement on february.
each cvr entitled the holder to cash payouts upon achievement of certain milestones connected to the success of lemtrada.the first milestone,called the approval milestone,entitled cvr holders to per cvr if the fda approved lemtrada for treatment of ms by march.the four other milestones,called the product sales milestones,entitled cvr holders to similar cash payments if lemtrada achieved certain levels of global net sales.in addition,the second product sales milestone,if met,compensated cvr holders an additional per cvr if lemtrada had failed to meet the approval milestone.the cvrs also contained a per share payout for production milestones related to other drugs.
sanofi initiated a tender offer on april,consisting of the per share and one cvr per share.the tender offer was followed by a merger on april.the offer and merger were conducted pursuant to a form f registration statement and a prospecture together,the offering materials.the offering materials incorporated,by reference,a number of genzyme prior sec filings containing statements regarding lemtrada,its clinical results,and its potential approval by the fda.specifically 
filed march,
estimated a probability that lemtrada would achieve the approval milestone.id.at.
the approval milestone is designed to trigger a payment to cvr holders in the event that the company receives fda approval of alemtuzumab for treatment of ms by march.company management currently anticipates product approval in the united states in the second half of.id.
form k filed march,
we are currently developing alemtuzumab for the treatment of relapsing remitting ms,or rrms,the most common form of ms we have completed enrollment in two phase clinical trials of alemtuzumab rebif a standard of care therapy for the treatment of rrms,from which we expect to obtain results in.fiveyear follow up data from our phase study continues to show durable treatment benefit.in,the fda granted alemtuzumab fast track status for the treatment of rrms.we anticipate product approval in the united states in the second half of.id.at.
form k filed january,
within genzyme product pipeline,three product approvals are expected by the end of including alemtuzumab for multiple sclerosis id.
form k filed february,based on promising phase data,alemtuzumab has the potential to become a new standard of care for multiple sclerosis treatment,a market that is expected to reach billion by.two phase trials are fully enrolled results of the trial in patients are expected,and results of the trial in patients are expected during the second half of this year.genzyme anticipates approval of the treatment in the second half of.id.at.
sanofi statements following the acquisition 
following its acquisition of genzyme,sanofi continued to speak optimistically about lemtrada.in its november,form k filing,sanofi announced its successful phase iii results for alemtuzumab lemtradatm in multiple sclerosis.id.the ceo of genzyme added that w e are very pleased with the results of the phase iii clinical trials which are unprecedented based on these positive results,we are on track to submit lemtradatm for review to and eu regulatory authorities in the first quarter of.id.at.sanofi later averred,in its march,form f 
the two phase iii studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of alemtuzumab were completed in.the first study demonstrated strong and robust treatment effect on the relapse rate endpoint vs rebif the second study demonstrated that relapse rate and sad were significantly reduced in ms patients receiving alemtuzumab as compared with rebif.in both cases,safety results were consistent with previous alemtuzumab use in ms and adverse events continued to be manageable.the dossier is scheduled to be submitted to fda review in the second quarter of.
sanofi continued to make similar statements endorsing the effectiveness of lemtrada,saying that patients taking lemtrada were more than twice as likely to experience a sustained reduction in disability over two years,id.at,and two pivotal phase iii studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of alemtuzumab were completed in,id.at.in a conference call with analysts on april,sanofi ceo noted that with regard to lemtrada,the data are nothing short of stunning.id.at.in another conference call with analysts on october,sanofi cfo stated that this will continue and probably somewhat amplify in the coming quarters as we prepare for the launch of lyxumia,thereafter for the launch of lemtrada,and sanofi ceo added,look at lemtrada i would say i actually very satisfied with where the progress is going.id.at.
on january,sanofi announced that the fda had accepted its sbla filing seeking approval of lemtrada.shortly thereafter,on february,sanofi ceo told analysts 
so i think it augurs well because this also says that we have a team,that should be in good position to launch lemtrada.it is obviously a huge opportunity that we have to be able to put significant new medicines into an important area like this is a market of some billion worldwide.
id.at.on october,sanofi ceo told analysts but quite honestly,i feeling pretty,pretty relaxed because if i look at our phase iii pipeline,there an awful lot of really good stuff in there we got aubagio and lemtrada rolling out.id.at.
d.the fda rejects lemtrada initial application 
on october,the fda announced it would conduct a hearing on november,regarding lemtrada application.on november,the fda advisory committee on peripheral and central nervous system drugs released the materials for the november hearing the briefing materials the three physicians reviewing lemtrada application in advance of the hearing all expressed concerns regarding lemtrada,and two of them referenced the failure to use studies 
in particular,marler has grave concerns that the failure to blind patients and treating physicians in the design of the trials introduced bias that confounds interpretation of their ostensible results.because of these issues,marler finds that the applicant has not submitted evidence from adequate and studies to support the effectiveness of alemtuzumab for treating multiple sclerosis 
yan also feels that troublesome design issues and the presence of bias in trials prevents reliance on their results,and that a valid,accurate,and interpretable effect on the two main clinical outcomes of interest,relapse rate and sustained accumulation of disability,has not been established.yan finds,like marler,that the applicant has not provided evidence from adequate and studies in this application and that such studies still need to be conducted to establish the effectiveness of alemtuzumab for the treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis.
id.at the briefing materials also detailed the fda communications with genzyme and sanofi regarding the use of clinical trials.
upon release of the briefing materials on november,the value of the cvrs dropped from per share to share,or more than.
on december,sanofi announced that it had received formal rejection of lemtrada from the fda and acknowledged that it did not anticipate that the cvr milestone of approval of lemtrada by march,will be met.id.at.the value of the cvrs dropped further on the news,falling to per share.
sanofi ceo said in a january,interview that the rejection was a total surprise,but added,t hat having been said,this is a drug that been approved by countries in the world.we seeing patients who have gone five years without a relapse.so we believe that the drug actually is working and it important for patients.id.at.
in april of,sanofi announced that it was engaged in discussions with the fda regarding lemtrada application,and on may,sanofi announced that the fda had accepted lemtrada for resubmission on november,the fda approved lemtrada for treatment of ms,well after the deadline for the approval milestone had passed.
procedural history 
two class action complaints were filed against defendants in december.the complaints were consolidated in february,and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on april,the cac.the putative class comprised all persons,other than defendants,who purchased cvrs between march,and november.the cac alleged violations of b and sec rule promulgated thereunder against all defendants,and a of the exchange act against the individual defendants.
on march,corporations filed a separate complaint the ag funds complaint,or agc alleging claims arising out of the same set of facts.these plaintiffs had either opted out of the class action or had acquired cvrs outside the class period.in addition to violations under b and a of the exchange act,the agc alleges violations under of the exchange act,and a of the securities act,and state blue sky laws.for purposes of this appeal,the operative differences between the complaints are 
the cac only alleges violations of the exchange act,requiring a showing of scienter,and 
the agc securities act claims encompass statements made by genzyme and sanofi in the offering materials.
both complaints allege,among other things,that by failing to disclose the feedback from the fda regarding the use of studies,defendants misled investors as to the likelihood of meeting the approval milestone,upon which the cvrs value partially depended,thereby artificially inflating the value of the cvrs the district court accepted these cases as related 
on june,defendants moved to dismiss both complaints for failing to state a claim,arguing that the complaints did not allege any materially false or misleading statements,there were no sufficient allegations of scienter,and their statements were protected as statements.on january,the district court granted defendants motion.
f.the opinion below the district court engelmayer,held in a thorough and thoughtful opinion that plaintiffs had failed to allege false or materially misleading statements.in re sanofi sec,d.with regard to the allegedly false or misleading statements of opinion,the court held,invoking the standard in fait regions financial,cir,that plaintiffs had failed to allege any facts suggesting that defendants did not genuinely believe what they were saying at the time they said it,and that there similarly had been no showing of objective falsity.d at.the court came to the same conclusion for each group of allegedly false or misleading statements of opinion.see id.at.
the court additionally held that,insofar as it was required,plaintiffs had failed to adequately allege scienter,saying that a t all relevant times,and without the benefit of hindsight,sanofi did not have reason to know that its public statements omitted or misrepresented material facts.id.at.the court also held that,in any event,defendants statements were protected by the private securities litigation reform act safe harbor provision,as they were accompanied by cautionary language and not made with actual knowledge of falsity.see,id.at 
after dismissing plaintiffs federal claims,the court declined to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction over plaintiffs remaining claims under state blue sky laws.id.at.finally,the court denied plaintiffs motion for leave to amend the complaint,noting that the deficiencies in the complaints were substantive and would not likely be cured upon amendment.id.at.judgment was entered against plaintiffs on january.this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review a district court dismissal of a complaint under.b de novo,accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.fait,at.the court must examine the complaint for facial plausibility,considering whether the factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.ashcroft iqbal,d citing bell atl.twombly,d.the court may also consider any written instrument attached to the complaint,statements or documents incorporated into the complaint by reference,legally required public disclosure documents filed with the sec,and documents possessed by or known to the plaintiff upon which it relied in bringing the suit.atsi commc ns,shaar fund,cir.
plaintiffs claims under b of the exchange act and rule promulgated thereunder require a showing of scienter.kleinman elan,cir by contrast,plaintiffs claims under and a of the securities act do not require a showing of scienter,reliance,or loss causation,and require plaintiffs to show only that defendants issued or signed a registration statement containing an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.a see also fait,at.claims under of the exchange act likewise need not allege scienter.ross robins,cir.
we see no reason to disturb the conclusions of the district court.however,after the district court opinion,the supreme court decided omnicare,which refined the standard for analyzing whether a statement of opinion is materially misleading.plaintiffs have urged us to reconsider the district court ruling in light of omnicare.we do so here,but conclude that even under omnicare standard,plaintiffs have failed to allege that defendants made materially misleading statements of opinion.
in omnicare,the supreme court held that where an investor has alleged that an issuer omitted stating material information and thereby rendered a statement of opinion misleading,
t he investor must identify particular and material facts going to the basis for the issuer about the inquiry the issuer did or did not conduct or the knowledge it did or did not omission makes the opinion statement at issue misleading to a reasonable person reading the statement fairly and in context.
at.this holding altered the standard announced by this court in fait,where we held that when a plaintiff asserts a claim based upon a belief or opinion alleged to have been communicated by a defendant,liability lies only to the extent the statement was both objectively false and disbelieved by the defendant at the time it was expressed.at citing.bankshares,sandberg,d.omnicare affirmed that liability for making a false statement of opinion may lie if either the speaker did not hold the belief she professed or the supporting fact she supplied were untrue.at.but omnicare went on to hold that opinions,though sincerely held and otherwise true as a matter of fact,may nonetheless be actionable if the speaker omits information whose omission makes the statement misleading to a reasonable investor.id.at.
the supreme court emphasized that meeting the standard under omnicare is no small task for an investor,and also provided guidance for applying its ruling.the court noted that a reasonable investor,upon hearing a statement of opinion from an issuer,expects not just that the issuer believes the opinion however irrationally,but that it fairly aligns with the information in the issuer possession at a time.id.at.the court provided an example if an issuer tells investors that we believe our conduct is lawful,an investor in such a situation likely expects such an assertion to rest on some meaningful inquiry rather than,say,on mere intuition.id.at.the core inquiry is whether the omitted facts would conflict with what a reasonable investor would take from the statement itself.id.at.
the court,however,cautioned against an overly expansive reading of this standard,noting that r easonable investors understand that opinions sometimes rest on a weighing of competing facts,and adding that a reasonable investor does not expect that every fact known to an issuer supports its opinion statement.id.the court went on to say that a statement of opinion is not necessarily misleading when an issuer knows,but fails to disclose,some fact cutting the other way.id.
the court also recognized the unique context in which securities claims arise.acknowledging the formality and legal weight of documents filed with the sec,the court noted that i nvestors do not,and are right not to,expect opinions contained in those statements to reflect baseless,judgments a t the same time,an investor reads each statement within such a document in light of all its surrounding text,including hedges,disclaimers,and apparently conflicting information.id.at.the court further stated that the investor takes into account the customs and practices of the relevant industry,and instructed that an omission that renders misleading a statement of opinion when viewed in a vacuum may not do so once that statement is considered,as is appropriate,in a broader frame.id.
allegedly materially misleading statements of opinion 
as the district court recognized,some of the statements at issue are not ones of opinion,and thus omnicare does not impact the court analysis with regard to those statements the district court analyzed three groups of statements of opinion 
six statements in the offering materials related to sanofi expectation that the fda would approve lemtrada prior to march,the cutoff date for the approval milestone 
a subset of statements made after the tender offer regarding the launch of lemtrada,such as that defendants were very satisfied with where the progress is going,they expect ed a decision on lemtrada by the end of the year,and they were feeling pretty,pretty relaxed and 
a subset of statements regarding lemtrada clinical trial results,such as that lemtrada demonstrated strong and robust treatment effect,the test results underscore d the tremendous promise that lemtrada holds,and w e are very pleased with the results of the phase iii study.
we analyze each group of statements in turn.
expected timing of fda approval 
the first set of statements is found exclusively in the offering materials.plaintiffs argue that by failing to disclose the fda repeated statements of concern about the use of studies,statements from defendants estimating a likelihood of achieving the approval milestone and projecting fda approval in late were materially misleading.
two points from omnicare are important here.first,the omitted facts must conflict with what a reasonable investor would take from the statement itself.at.there is no plausible allegation that the fda interim feedback conflicted with any reasonable interpretation of defendants statements about fda approval.though the fda had expressed concern about defendants testing methodology,it had also stated that any deficiency could be overcome if the results showed an extremely large effect.the record reflects,and the parties do not dispute,that lemtrada treatment effect was,in fact,large.there can be no conflict inferred from a statement of optimism consistent with the fda instructions as to the treatment results necessary for approval.
moreover,the supreme court emphasized the need to examine the context of an allegedly misleading opinion,id.at,and context is instructive here.plaintiffs are sophisticated investors,no doubt aware that projections provided by issuers are synthesized from a wide variety of information,and that some
