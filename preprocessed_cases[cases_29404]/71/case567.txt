this appeal centers on the adequacy of plaintiffs allegations under the private securities litigation reform act of pslra b.the district court concluded that plaintiffs failed to adequately plead scienter under the pslra heightened pleading standard and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.the court later denied plaintiffs rule e motion to alter or amend the judgment in which plaintiffs argued that,even if dismissal was appropriate,the court should have dismissed without prejudice and granted plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint.plaintiffs appeal these determinations.
on march,after this appeal was argued,we received notice that bearingpoint had filed a voluntary petition seeking relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code,et,in the southern district of new york.thereafter,on march,by reason of the automatic stay provision of a of the bankruptcy code,we entered an order staying proceedings in this appeal.the bankruptcy court modified the automatic stay on may,to permit us to render our decision.we therefore lift our stay and issue this decision.
we agree with the district court conclusion that plaintiffs failed to adequately plead scienter under the pslra,but we reverse the district court order denying plaintiffs rule e motion to alter or amend the judgment to permit amendment of the complaint.accordingly,we vacate the judgment.on remand plaintiffs will have the opportunity to file an amended complaint against the defendants.in addition,plaintiffs may take action,consistent with bankruptcy law and procedure,with respect to their claims against bearingpoint,a chapter debtor.

formerly known as kpmg consulting,llc,bearingpoint is a publicly traded management and technology consulting company.it completed an initial public offering in february and thereafter grew rapidly,acquiring more than thirty consulting businesses around the world in.bearingpoint struggled to integrate its acquisitions many were foreign concerns that had operated as private partnerships with no obligation to adhere to accounting standards applied to publicly held companies.bearingpoint also lacked the information technology infrastructure to manage its expanded business and keep track of client accounts.in short,bearingpoint lacked internal controls that were adequate to maintain reliable financial reporting and ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.bearingpoint has since acknowledged its failings in this regard.
in bearingpoint introduced a new financial accounting system known as oneglobe.oneglobe proved unreliable and aggravated bearingpoint problems with its internal controls.bearingpoint personnel did not receive the training necessary to operate the system.the lack of training led employees to select the wrong billing categories,which in turn led to inaccurate hourly billing rates.employees manually bypassed the oneglobe system on a routine basis,presumably correcting some errors but also creating the risk of human error and dishonesty.
certain of bearingpoint foreign acquisitions created special challenges that further strained its internal controls.in regional management of bearingpoint china and japan directed employees to inflate their utilization rates the percentage of consultant time actually charged to customers and other financial data.additionally,bearingpoint australia recorded revenue in for contracts that were not completed until.finally,the values of certain of foreign acquisitions decreased during the class period august,to april,causing the impairment of goodwill.
bearingpoint filed annual and quarterly financial reports with the sec on sec forms and and otherwise made public its financial information during the class period.at the end of each fiscal quarter bearingpoint typically issued a press release and filed an sec form with anticipated financial information.it would subsequently issue a form or with complete financial information along with each form and,the individual defendants signed certifications indicating that the reports did not contain any untrue statements of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made.see.plaintiffs allege that the foregoing financial statements were materially false and misleading because,among other things,they misstated bearingpoint revenues,net income,earnings per share,and goodwill.
in late bearingpoint reported problems,primarily in the germanic region,with respect to its internal controls over financial reporting.annual report form,at.in addition,the company form for the fiscal year ending june,disclosed that an independent accountant reported material weaknesses in certain aspects of its internal controls it reiterated those warnings in statements filed for periods ending september,filed november,and december,filed april.bearingpoint nevertheless expressed its confidence in the capability of its internal controls to provide for reliable financial reporting and in the accuracy of all financial statements previously reported.and the form filed for the period ending december,filed april,indicated that bearingpoint had resolved the material weaknesses reported in its last annual report on form t hese are no longer material weaknesses,but are considered to be reportable conditions.annual report form,at.
on november,bearingpoint filed financial information for the quarter ending september.but shortly thereafter bearingpoint management discovered that the form overstated its accounts receivable by million.bearingpoint corrected that error by filing a form on november,that otherwise affirmed the financial information reported in the original form.the form acknowledged,however,that internal controls had failed to timely identify the accounts receivable error and recognized that this failure amounted to a material weakness.bearingpoint further acknowledged that the company internal controls as of september,were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed to the sec is recorded,processed,summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec rules and forms.amended quarterly report form,at.
on november,blazer stepped down as chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of bearingpoint.a few days later,on november,falcone stepped down as executive vice president and chief financial officer.
bearingpoint reiterated problems with its internal controls in a december,form,filed in connection with a convertible debenture offering.the form noted that bearingpoint had not yet corrected the material weaknesses and reportable conditions previously identified.it continued to warn that those weaknesses might adversely affect ability to accurately report financial information.in late december and early january bearingpoint raised million by issuing subordinated convertible debentures.
bearingpoint was unable to file a timely form for the fiscal year ending december.this tardiness was announced in a form filed march,in which the company reiterated that it had identified material weaknesses in internal controls and warned that it might discover additional material weaknesses.bearingpoint also disclosed that recent downgrades in the company credit rating,changes in senior management,and underperforming foreign operations had caused the company to perform a goodwill impairment test.the results of the test,the company said,would require it to take a material impairment charge for the period ending december.it declined to estimate the amount of the charge.
on april,bearingpoint published a form warning that recent company financial statements were not reliable.specifically,bearingpoint warned that financial statements filed with forms for the periods ending june,and december,and forms for each of the three quarters of were not reliable.bearingpoint suggested that a restatement of its financial statements would likely be necessary and that the ultimate net adjustments w ould be material.current report form,at.bearingpoint further revealed that it would likely take a goodwill impairment charge of million to million in the fourth quarter of.it did not offer an expected date for the restatement of its financial data indeed it predicted further delay in the filing of its already tardy form and delays in the filing of forms that would be coming due in.the april,form also disclosed that bearingpoint was the target of an informal sec investigation into its accounting and financial reporting and that nine of twenty individuals in senior management positions had left bearingpoint or were in the process of leaving.these disclosures resulted in an immediate percent drop in bearingpoint stock prices,from a close of per share on april,to a close of per share on april.this drop occurred on a trading volume of more than times the stock average daily trading volume for the year preceding the disclosures.in re bearingpoint.sec,d.
in the following weeks several securities fraud actions were filed against bearingpoint and its officers in the eastern district of virginia.see in re bearingpoint.sec.these actions were consolidated,and plaintiffs were selected as lead plaintiffs pursuant to the pslra.the consolidated action was initially assigned to judge ellis,iii,who entered a scheduling order that,among other things,required plaintiffs to file an amended complaint by october,on the basis of bearingpoint representation that it expected to file its delinquent form and a restatement of earlier financial information by september.when bearingpoint was unable to meet the september,target,it informed the district court that it anticipated being able to file the form and restatement by late october.bearingpoint requested that the scheduling order deadlines be postponed accordingly.the district court refused to amend the scheduling order,but indicated that it would permit plaintiffs to amend their complaint when bearingpoint made sec filings with its financial statement and any restatement.in the meantime,on october,plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging that defendants knowingly or recklessly misrepresented bearingpoint financial condition by overstating earnings and assets in violation of federal securities laws.the district court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification on january.
bearingpoint ultimately filed its form for the fiscal year ending december,on january,after spending more than million to review contracts and other data.included as part of the form filing was the company restatement of previous financial statements together,the form and restatement.much of the company financial information published in sec filings in proved inaccurate.for example,bearingpoint form had represented that net income for that year was million or per share,but the form and restatement revealed that it was actually million or per share.the form for the first quarter of had represented net income of million per share,but bearingpoint had actually incurred a net loss of million per share.the forms for the second and third quarters of had similarly misstated or overstated net income by million and million,respectively.the form and restatement further disclosed that bearingpoint suffered goodwill impairment of million during.
plaintiffs moved to file a first amended complaint to incorporate the additional information provided in bearingpoint form and restatement.the motion was granted,and on march,plaintiffs filed the first amended complaint,the operative complaint that we consider in this appeal.incorporating the restated financial information,plaintiffs alleged that defendants knowingly or recklessly misstated bearingpoint financial condition during the class period in violation of b and a of the securities exchange act of,b,a,and sec rule.after defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b,the district court stayed the action pending the supreme court decision in tellabs,makor issues rights,d,which was expected to address the pleading standard for scienter allegations under the pslra.following the june,decision in tellabs,the district court lifted the stay and directed the parties to submit briefs on the impact of the new decision.
this action was reassigned to judge liam on july.thereafter,on september,the court granted defendants motion to dismiss,concluding that plaintiffs complaint failed to meet the scienter pleading requirements of the pslra.the court also concluded that granting leave to amend the complaint would be futile.in re bearingpoint,d at.the complaint was dismissed with prejudice.
plaintiffs filed a rule e motion to alter or amend the judgment on september.they argued that the district court had erred in dismissing the complaint and,alternatively,in failing to grant leave to amend.plaintiffs lodged a proposed second amended complaint with the district court on november.on november,the court denied the rule e motion,again concluding that the operative complaint failed to adequately plead scienter.the court also declined to permit amendment of the complaint.plaintiffs appeal the september,order dismissing the complaint and the november,order denying the rule e motion to alter or amend the judgment.
we review de novo the district court decision to dismiss under rule b.in re pec solutions.sec,cir.t o survive a motion to dismiss,private securities fraud actions must clear the hurdle of the private securities litigation reform act of pslra.b.id.the pslra imposes a heightened pleading standard for private securities fraud complaints.teachers ret.of hunter.
plaintiffs allege violations of b and a of the securities exchange act of and of sec rule.section b forbids the use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security of any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the sec may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.b.sec rule implements b by making it unlawful 
a to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,
b to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading,or 
c to engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
section b affords,by implication,a right of action to securities purchasers or sellers injured by its violation.tellabs,at.
a plaintiff in a b private action must typically prove a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant scienter a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission economic loss and loss causation that is,the economic loss must be proximately caused by the misrepresentation or omission.stoneridge investment partners,llc,d emphasis added.
pleading recklessness is sufficient to satisfy the scienter requirement.see pub.employees ret.ass of deloitte touche llp,cir.we have defined a reckless act in the b context as one so highly unreasonable and such an extreme departure from the standard of ordinary care as to present a danger of misleading the plaintiff to the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.id.quoting ottmann hanger orthopedic group,cir.in the present case the district court dismissed the operative complaint under rule b because it concluded that plaintiffs had failed to adequately plead scienter with respect to any of the alleged misstatements.in re bearingpoint,d at.
the pslra requires a plaintiff to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b tellabs,at.the plaintiff must plead facts rendering an inference of scienter at least as likely as any plausible opposing inference.tellabs,at.emphasis in original.according to tellabs,a rule b motion to dismiss a b action is to be analyzed as follows 
first,courts must,as with any motion to dismiss for failure to plead a claim on which relief can be granted,accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true 
second,courts must consider the complaint in its entirety,as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on rule b motions to dismiss the inquiry is whether all of the facts alleged,taken collectively,give rise to a strong inference of scienter,not whether any individual allegation,scrutinized in isolation,meets that standard.
third,in determining whether the pleaded facts give rise to a strong inference of scienter,the court must take into account plausible opposing inferences the strength of an inference can not be decided in a vacuum.the inquiry is inherently comparative how likely is it that one conclusion,as compared to others,follows from the underlying facts t he inference of scienter must be more than merely reasonable or permissible it must be cogent and compelling,thus strong in light of other explanations.a complaint will survive,we hold,only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.
tellabs,at.in sum,the reviewing court must ask when the allegations are accepted as true and taken collectively,would a reasonable person deem the inference of scienter at least as strong as any opposing inference id.at.
moreover,corporate liability derives from the actions of its agents.teachers,at.to the extent a plaintiff alleges corporate fraud,the plaintiff must allege facts that support a strong inference of scienter with respect to at least one authorized agent of the corporation.id.this court has not yet discussed the extent to which a plaintiff must identify that agent.see makor issues rights,tellabs,cir concluding that corporate scienter requires that a corporate agent acted with scienter,but that a plaintiff need not name the corporate agent who acted with scienter.additionally,to the extent a plaintiff alleges fraud claims against individual defendants,the plaintiff must allege facts supporting a strong inference of scienter as to each defendant.teachers,at.
the operative complaint the first amended complaint alleges that a number of bearingpoint statements made throughout the class period were misleading,including forms,and.plaintiffs argue that these statements were misleading because they contained financial information,including data about revenue,net income,and goodwill charges,that bearingpoint has since acknowledged was erroneous.in re bearingpoint,d at plaintiffs allege that defendants acted intentionally or recklessly in making misleading statements.
much of the financial information defendants published in forms and during the class period was erroneous,as acknowledged in the form and restatement.a form filed april,stated,for example,that bearingpoint had incurred a net loss of million per share during the transition period ending december.in fact,the company had suffered a million net loss per share.similarly,forms overstated bearingpoint net income by million for the first quarter of,million for the second quarter,and million for the third quarter plaintiffs allege that defendants acted knowingly or recklessly with respect to the falsity of these financial statements.
to evaluate whether plaintiffs factual allegations give rise to a strong inference of scienter,we first discuss whether they permit an inference of scienter,and if so,the persuasiveness of that inference.while we ultimately evaluate plaintiffs allegations of scienter holistically,we only afford their allegations the inferential weight warranted by context and common sense.see cozzarelli inspire pharm,cir explaining that courts should evaluate allegations of scienter in context.next,we will discuss whether a reasonable person would deem any inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.tellabs,at.
plaintiffs point first to their allegations that bearingpoint has admitted that its former senior management was incompeten t and otherwise contributed to the deficient tone at the top.plaintiffs argue that the tone at the top is a term of art that refers to an environment which encourages accounting fraud.appellant br.at.they contend that admissions about the tone at the top satisfy the scienter requirement because t hey necessarily were referring to fraud or,at a minimum,reckless conduct in implementing and maintaining adequate internal accounting controls and the resulting financial reporting.id.at.
defendants with respect to the company internal controls is a question distinct from the critical question here,which is defendants with respect to misstating or omitting material financial information in bearingpoint financial statements.those questions may align when a plaintiff alleges that corporate officers intentionally created an environment to facilitate their own accounting fraud.but in this case bearingpoint admissions fail to suggest that defendants intentionally created an environment conducive to accounting fraud the company simply admits that such an environment existed.such an admission fails to suggest that defendants acted with scienter when they issued bearingpoint and financial statements.
plaintiffs further allege that defendants were at least reckless as to the truthfulness of their financial statements because there were a number of red flags that must have alerted them to serious internal control deficiencies and the high risk that financial information derived under those internal controls was erroneous.plaintiffs primarily argue that it was widely known that the oneglobe financial reporting system responsible for tracking revenues,expenses,and employee time was unreliable and failed to properly integrate accounting systems used in foreign offices.bearingpoint employees at all levels and in all departments experienced significant problems with the oneglobe accounting system.bearingpoint employees manually bypassed the oneglobe system,correcting at least some of oneglobe errors but also presumably creating the risk of human error and fraud.plaintiffs ask us to infer from the breadth and gravity of oneglobe problems that high level corporate agents including blazer and falcone must have been aware of the problems and,consequently,could not have believed their internal controls adequate to produce reliable financial information.moreover,plaintiffs allege that blazer in fact spoke with a vice president on more than one occasion about oneglobe errors relating to her billing rate and the practice of manually bypassing the system.
plaintiffs do not include a timeline for their allegations or otherwise allege facts that imply defendants were aware of oneglobe problems prior to making or approving financial statements.and the financial reports submitted to the sec indicate that oneglobe was still being implemented as of the second quarter of.even if bearingpoint began introducing oneglobe earlier,problems may not have become obvious until after the program was fully implemented and was functional for some amount of time.further,it is relevant that defendants understood that bearingpoint employees were manually correcting oneglobe errors in some instances.we nevertheless recognize that the allegations permit an the weight of the inference is limited by the factors just oneglobe deficiencies and other internal control problems identified by the plaintiffs may have become sufficiently severe at some point during to raise a red flag about the reliability of bearingpoint financial information.
plaintiffs also point to the magnitude of the restatement.see in re microstrategy.sec,d,noting that a strong inference of scienter may arise from a dramatic misstatement.bearingpoint overstated net income and other financial data throughout the class period by significant amounts.it reported net income of million for the first quarter of,but it had actually suffered a net loss of million.it similarly indicated net income of million for the second quarter of,but it had actually suffered a net loss of million.in total the form and restatement extinguished more than million in reported profits.bearingpoint had to pay more than million and review nearly contracts to identify and correct these enterprise that resulted in approximately lines of adjustments to previous financial statements.
inferential weight may be attributed to the magnitude of these errors but only in the context of bearingpoint financial position.bearingpoint is a global corporation that produced revenues of million to million for each of the first three quarters of.as a general matter,courts should be wary when defendants focus on the size of revenues in an effort to minimize the materiality of misstatements of income or to suggest the defendant lacked motive to misstate income.see crowell ionics,d,characterizing the focus on revenue as an old chestnut that securities fraud defendants frequently try on judges and juries.but the size of bearingpoint revenue stream does bear on whether the misstatements of net income were of a size that bearingpoint officers must have known about them.in other words,an individual is more likely to realize that she is missing if she has in her bank account than if she has in her bank account.
plaintiffs further argue that the breadth of bearingpoint financial reporting problems ought to have alerted blazer and falcone to inaccuracies in the company financial reporting and other statements.see in re microstrategy,d at noting that inference of scienter becomes more probable as the violations of accounting rules become more obvious.bearingpoint and clients and violated contract terms,including agreed upon rates and charges.a consultant who helped review bearingpoint accounting reported that every single contract that he reviewed,contracts,were sic incorrect with regard to revenue recognition in some material way.we afford these allegations substantial weight,although we note that the company was in the middle of integrating the financial accounting information for thirty newly acquired consulting components worldwide.
plaintiffs also highlight accounting fraud within the asia pacific region throughout.bearingpoint australia fraudulently recorded million in revenue in that should not have been recorded until.and senior regional management in china and japan units directed employees to falsify utilization rates.however,there are no allegations that blazer,falcone,or other senior officers at bearingpoint headquarters directed the accounting fraud that occurred in the asia pacific region.instead,plaintiffs ask us to infer that senior officials like blazer and falcone would have known of the fraud and falsification.
plaintiffs also ask us to infer scienter from the fact that bearingpoint announced in its april,disclosure that nine out of twenty of its officers had left or were leaving the company.plaintiffs further note that the sec is formally investigating and has subpoenaed information about bearingpoint.but see cozzarelli,at indicating that allegation that sec is investigating defendants is too speculative to add much,if anything,to an inference of scienter.finally,plaintiffs argue that bearingpoint had a motive for falsifying information because it was able to issue million in subordinated convertible debentures in late december and early january.plaintiffs allege that bearingpoint sought to suppress information about its actual financial information and internal control problems in order to complete these private offerings.but see id.at noting that the motivations to raise capital are common to every company and thus add little to an inference of fraud.
defendants,for their part,point to bearingpoint disclosures concerning its internal controls during the class period,arguing that those disclosures weigh against an inference of scienter.it is appropriate to consider such disclosures,which in some contexts will indicate that the defendants were acting in good faith,but in other contexts will indicate that the defendants had knowledge of operational risks suggesting a lack of good faith.bearingpoint made several relevant disclosures during the class period.the form filed for the fiscal year ending june,filed september,disclosed material weaknesses and reportable conditions in bearingpoint internal controls,but only in seven limited areas importantly,the form moderated the weight of that disclosure by suggesting that bearingpoint had already put in place measures to correct identified weaknesses and by stating its confidence in the accuracy of financial statements contained in the form notwithstanding internal control deficiencies.the form for the period ending september,filed november,similarly mentioned and then moderated the import of certain limited internal control deficiencies.and the form filed for the transition period ending december,represented that bearingpoint had resolved all previously reported material weaknesses although the underlying conditions were still considered reportable conditions and most of the deficiencies previously considered reportable conditions.annual report form,at.it did identify one new material weakness 
the forms filed during the first three quarters of represented that aside from the several remaining reportable conditions and the single material weakness discussed in the december,form,the company disclosure controls and procedures are adequately designed to timely notify the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of material information relating to the company required to be disclosed in the company sec filings.see,quarterly report form,at may.
it was not until bearingpoint amended its form for the period ending september,in a form filed november,that the company disclosed that internal control deficiencies might compromise the reliability of financial reporting.specifically,the form stated that 
the company internal controls relating to overall financial review and analysis in the context of the closing process did not identify the error overstating accounts receivable in time to preclude a misstatement of the balance sheet items referred to above and related cash flow statement items.the company believes that this weakness in its internal controls relating to overall financial review and analysis in the context of the closing process is a material weakness.the company is evaluating the steps that must be taken to improve its procedures and controls in this area.
t he chief executive officer and the chief financial officer have concluded that as a result of the material weakness discussed above and certain reportable conditions that were disclosed in our transition report on form for the six months ended december,the company disclosure controls and procedures as of september,were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of,as amended,is recorded,processed,summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec rules and forms.
amended quarterly report form,at.this disclosure more meaningfully calls into question the reliability of financial information recorded,processed,summarized and reported under internal controls in place as of september.id.a subsequently filed december,form included similar disclosures 
a disclosure that meaningfully alerts investors to the risk that financial information is not accurate may suggest that the individuals responsible for the disclosure did not knowingly or perhaps not even recklessly misstate the underlying financial information.but bearingpoint disclosures made prior to november,continued to represent the reliability of bearingpoint financial information notwithstanding internal control problems.those disclosures do not lend themselves to any inferences one way or the other relating to scienter.later disclosures that timely raised questions about the reliability of financial information such as the november,disclosure lend weight to an inference that contemporaneous financial statements were made in good faith.such disclosures might normally suggest that earlier misstatements were likewise good faith mistakes,but there were changes at bearingpoint between november and november,that limit that inference.in particular,blazer departed bearingpoint effective november.
having discussed the relevant allegations of scienter and whether common sense or context diminish the inferential weight owed them,we proceed to evaluate whether a reasonable person would regard the inference that defendants knowingly or recklessly misstated or omitted material information at least as strong as the inference that bearingpoint officers were merely negligent with respect to those statements.see tellabs,at.we evaluate these allegations holistically,recognizing that allegations of scienter that would not independently create a strong inference of scienter might compliment each other to create an inference of sufficient strength to satisfy the pslra.
and first quarter financial statements 
a strong inference of scienter might arise when there are sufficient red flags to alert senior officers to the unreliability of statements about internal controls and financial information.see ottmann,at.the red flags alleged in this major internal control problems and misstatements of rise to a possible inference of scienter for statements made in and for the first quarter of.but it is also possible to infer that defendants were only acting negligently with respect to the accuracy of the contested statements.during and bearingpoint was struggling to integrate thirty acquisitions that included using a new financial reporting system,oneglobe.further,bearingpoint officers may not have had reason to know that oneglobe problems and other internal control deficiencies existed and were sufficiently severe so as to threaten the reliability of financial reporting.to the extent the record speaks to the timeline,it suggests that bearingpoint was still putting oneglobe into operation during the second quarter of,which ended june.absent additional allegations that bearingpoint officials had reason to know that the company financial information was inaccurate,we conclude that the inference of scienter is not as compelling as competing inferences for financial statements made during and for the first quarter of.
second and third quarter financial statements 
there is a stronger case for an inference of scienter for the form filed for the second quarter of filed august,because the record suggests that oneglobe problems could have manifested themselves by august,and because the financial report issued for that period misstated net income by a particularly large amount million.nevertheless,the allegations fail to establish that it is as likely as not that the alleged misstatements and omissions were obvious on august,to bearingpoint officials struggling to integrate recent worldwide acquisitions,manage thousands of employees,and account for billions in revenue.see zucco partners digimarc,cir although the allegations in this case are legion,even together they are not as cogent or compelling as a plausible alternative,that although digimarc was experiencing problems controlling and updating its accounting and inventory tracking practices,there was no specific intent to fabricate the accounting misstatements at issue here.instead,the facts alleged by zucco point towards the conclusion that digimarc was simply overwhelmed with integrating a large new division into its existing business.see also in re bearingpoint,d at noting that as of december,bearingpoint had about employees worldwide and billion in revenue.absent additional allegations suggesting that bearingpoint officials knew that oneglobe problems jeopardized the accuracy of their second quarter financial statements,the inference of scienter is not as compelling as competing inferences.the same analysis applies to the form for the third quarter of,filed on november.
november,form 
soon after filing the november form,bearingpoint management discovered that the form had overstated its accounts receivable by million and understated unbilled revenue by the same amount.the company filed a form on november,to correct that error but otherwise affirmed the november,announcement that the company had net income of million.bearingpoint net income that quarter was actually million,and plaintiffs allege that defendants either knew or were reckless with respect to the financial information in the amended third quarter financial form 
while the recently discovered large error lends some additional weight to an inference of scienter,the form also contained a disclosure indicating that bearingpoint officials suspected additional,serious internal control deficiencies.specifically,bearingpoint disclosure called into question its ability to timely record,process,summarize,and report financial information given internal controls in place as of september.as discussed above,under these circumstances,the disclosure made about internal control deficiencies lends some weight to the inference that defendants were not acting with scienter but rather were endeavoring in good faith to inform investors of their internal control and financial reporting problems.we decline to conclude that the inference of recklessness is at least as likely as the inference that bearingpoint agents including falcone were negligent or otherwise with respect to the accuracy of the net income reported.
december,form 
plaintiffs also allege that the december,form was misleading it omitted to inform investors that bearingpoint had overstated net income during the first three quarters of.but plaintiffs do not allege that defendants knew the amount of overstatements made in forms at the time the december,form was issued.indeed,the complaint recognizes that it took a great deal of time and resources to produce the restatement of that financial information.moreover,the form warned investors that had internal control deficiencies that threatened its ability to record,process,summarize and report financial information.current report form,ex,at.this disclosure suggests that defendants did not knowingly or recklessly fail to provide investors with complete information about prior misstatements.
blazer and falcone had already resigned from bearingpoint by the time this december,statement was issued.defendants thus question whether plaintiffs have adequately identified a corporate agent who acted with scienter in their allegations.we have held that allegations of corporate fraud must allege facts that support a strong inference of scienter with respect to at least one authorized agent of the corporation.teachers,at emphasis added.a complaint that alleges facts giving rise to a strong inference that at least one corporate agent acted with the required state of mind satisfies the pslra even if the complaint does not name the corporate agent as an individual defendant or otherwise identify the agent.most often,the complaint and documents incorporated into the complaint by reference will identify a corporate agent who acted with scienter.see teamsters local freight div.pension fund dynex capital,cir.but the particularity demanded under the pslra requires only that a plaintiff allege sufficient particularized facts that support a strong inference of scienter with respect to at least one authorized agent of the corporation.teachers,at.as the seventh circuit has explained,
i t is possible to draw a strong inference of corporate scienter without being able to name the individuals who concocted and disseminated the fraud.suppose general motors announced that it had sold one million suvs in,and the actual number was zero.there would be a strong inference of corporate scienter,since so dramatic an announcement would have been approved by corporate officials sufficiently knowledgeable about the company to know that the announcement was false.
makor issues rights,tellabs,cir see also southland sec.inspire ins.solutions,cir indicating that corporate scienter might be alleged by asserting that a corporate agent other than named individual defendants acted with scienter.when plaintiffs also name individual defendants,they must,of course,allege facts that support a strong inference that each individual defendant acted with at least recklessness in making the false statement.teachers,at emphasis in original see also makor issues rights,at distinguishing what is known as group pleading doctrine from possibility that plaintiffs might establish strong inference of corporate scienter without being able to name individuals who concocted the fraud.
evaluating the facts alleged,taken collectively,we decline to conclude that a strong inference can be drawn that blazer,falcone,or any other corporate agent acted with scienter in issuing any of the challenged financial statements.for each of the financial statements,plausible inferences are at least as likely as an inference that any defendant acted knowingly or recklessly with respect to the misstatements.we therefore agree with the district court scienter conclusions with respect to these statements.
plaintiffs also challenge a form filed march,which they allege was misleading with respect to the magnitude of goodwill impairment charges that bearingpoint would ultimately record for the quarter ending december,reported january.accounting standards consider goodwill impaired if the fair value of a reporting unit becomes lower than its carrying amount goodwill and other intangible assets,statement of fin.accounting standards,fin.accounting standards bd.goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually using a process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit.this first step is a screen for potential impairment,and the second step measures the amount of impairment,if any.id.at summary.accounting standards further require goodwill impairment testing between annual tests if circumstances change that are likely to produce an impairment.
bearingpoint announced in a march,form that during the fourth quarter of fiscal year,the company determined that a triggering event had occurred,which caused the company to perform a goodwill impairment test.current report form,at.it explained 
as a result of the impairment test,on march,the company determined that a material charge will be taken as of december,as a result of the impairment of its goodwill with respect to the operations in its europe,the middle east and africa emea segment we are unable at this time to provide an estimate of the amount or range of amounts of the impairment charge.however,the company may include an impairment charge of up to million without affecting its credit line.the actual amount of the impairment charge may be higher or lower than such amount.the company does not expect that the impairment charge will result in future cash expenditures.
id.plaintiffs allege that this statement is misleading with respect to the amount of the impairment charge.an april,form later estimated that the impairment was million to million,and the form and restatement ultimately recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million the march,statement is only misleading in a material respect if bearingpoint agents had reason to know that the goodwill impairment charge would be in a range that would likely exceed million.
plaintiffs submit that bearingpoint agents must have known that bearingpoint goodwill had been impaired by nearly million because bearingpoint had admitted to conducting at least the first step of a goodwill impairment test prior to march.plaintiffs read the language of the form to go further to establish that the company had already completed both steps of the goodwill impairment test as of march.the form stated that a triggering event caused the company to perform a goodwill impairment test and implied that at least part of the impairment test was completed.id.as a result of the impairment test,on march,the company determined that a material charge will be taken as of december.this language,in context,does not state that both steps of the goodwill impairment test were necessarily completed,and plaintiffs have not otherwise alleged that bearingpoint completed the second step of an impairment test by march.
but we agree with plaintiffs that the language of the form suggests that bearingpoint had conducted at least the first step of the goodwill impairment test prior to march.plaintiffs say that the first step of the test necessarily provides the range of any impairment,even if it fails to provide the exact amount of the impairment,which is calculated in the second step of the analysis.plaintiffs ask us to infer that at least one bearingpoint agent thus acted with scienter in approving the march,form.
defendants contend that the most reasonable inference based on the allegations and documents incorporated by reference is not that bearingpoint officials acted with scienter,but rather that they had insufficient information to disclose a range of impairment.
evaluating the allegations holistically,we conclude that plaintiffs failed to allege facts sufficient to give rise to a strong inference that any corporate agent acted with scienter in making the march,statement.even if the first step of the impairment test yielded some sort of range as to the amount of the impairment charge,we decline to infer based on the limited allegations and materials before us that corporate agents in fact knew or that it was obvious to them that the goodwill impairment charge would be within a meaningfully narrow range and likely to exceed million.further,the company provided investors a range the following month on april.it is certainly not dispositive that bearingpoint eventually reported accurate information.but we do consider that plaintiffs alleged bearingpoint was seeking to avoid a default on its credit weakened by the fact that bearingpoint clarified the allegedly misleading statement one month later.the impairment charge was based on events occurring in,and neither its range nor other relevant considerations were likely to change between march and april.on these facts,the most likely inference is that corporate agents lacked sufficient information to report a range of impairment until the april disclosure.in any event,evaluating the complaint holistically,inferences are more likely than any inference that bearingpoint agents knew that goodwill was impaired by more than million or recklessly disregarded information indicating an impairment of that magnitude.
for the foregoing reasons we agree with the district court conclusion,in its initial opinion and in its order denying relief under rule e,that plaintiffs failed in the operative complaint to adequately allege scienter under the pslra pleading requirements.the district court also dismissed plaintiffs claims under a of the exchange act,which imposes liability on each person who controls any person liable under any provision of this chapter.a.because the complaint fails to withstand a rule b motion with respect to the predicate violation of b,it also fails with respect to the a claims.our agreement with the district court analysis of the allegations in the operative complaint does not dispose of this case,however,as we demonstrate next.
we turn finally to the district court dismissal of the operative complaint with prejudice and its treatment of plaintiffs efforts to file a second amended complaint.plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by dismissing their complaint with prejudice rather than granting leave to amend.alternatively,they argue that the district court erred when it did not grant their rule e motion to alter or amend the judgment in order to allow them to file a second amended complaint.we review both determinations for abuse of discretion.see laber harvey,cir en banc in re pec solutions,at.
in challenging the dismissal with prejudice,plaintiffs argue that they filed an adequate motion for leave to amend their complaint prior to dismissal by requesting permission to amend in a footnote in their memorandum opposing the motions to dismiss,and indicating in oral argument that they were in a position to significantly bolster their allegation of scienter.plaintiffs also argue that,irrespective of whether they properly moved to amend their complaint,the district court erred in granting a dismissal with prejudice because the court failed to make a necessary determination a dismissal that operates with prejudice is warranted only when the trial court determines that the allegation of other facts consistent with the challenged pleading could not possibly cure the deficiency.belizan hershon,quoting firestone firestone,see also ostrzenski seigel,cir noting that a plaintiff should have every opportunity to cure a formal defect in a pleading eminence capital,llc aspeon,cir suggesting that these principles hold special force in the context of the pslra.because we conclude that the district court should have granted plaintiffs motion to vacate the judgment and allowed them to amend their complaint,we decline to decide whether the court erred in refusing to allow an amendment earlier in the proceedings.
after the district court dismissed their claims with prejudice,plaintiffs filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment in order to allow them to amend their complaint.thereafter,plaintiffs lodged a proposed second amended complaint with the district court,indicating they were prepared to immediately file this pleading in the event the court permits the filing of an amended complaint.the district court denied plaintiffs motion to alter or amend the judgment,thereby refusing to allow amendment of the complaint.the court also struck the proposed second amended complaint from the docket.
in laber harvey,cir,our en banc court outlined the framework and standards for considering a motion to amend a complaint.to begin with,we noted that t here is one difference between a a motion to amend the district court may not grant the motion unless the judgment is vacated pursuant to rule e or rule b.id.at.a conclusion that the district court abused its discretion in denying a motion to amend,however,is sufficient grounds on which to reverse the district court denial of a rule e motion.id.at.
we made clear in laber that a motion to amend is evaluated under the same legal standard grounded on rule a as a similar motion filed before judgment was entered.id.rule a directs that leave to amend shall be freely given when justice so requires.a.this directive gives effect to the federal policy in favor of resolving cases on their merits instead of disposing of them on technicalities.laber,at.our court therefore reads rule a to mean that leave to amend should be denied only when the amendment would be prejudicial to the opposing party,there has been bad faith on the part of the moving party,or amendment would be futile.id.in laber we offered guidance for evaluating these factors.first,w hether an amendment is prejudicial will often be determined by the nature of the amendment and its timing.id.at.second,delay alone is an insufficient reason to deny a motion to amend however,when a motion to amend is made,the further the case progressed before judgment was entered,the more likely it is that the amendment will prejudice the defendant or that a court will find bad faith on the plaintiff part.id.nothing in the pslra affects the standards governing either the pre or amendment of pleadings.see belizan,at.
in denying plaintiffs leave to amend,the district court merely repeated the reasons it had previously offered for dismissing the operative complaint.the district court made no determinations about prejudice,bad faith,or futility with respect to the proposed second amended complaint.that alone may constitute an abuse of discretion.see foman davis,d t he grant or denial of an opportunity to amend is within the discretion of the district court,but outright refusal to grant the leave without any justifying reason appearing for the denial is not an exercise of discretion it is merely abuse of that discretion and inconsistent with the spirit of the federal rules.of course,a district court failure to articulate its reasons for denying leave to amend does not amount to an abuse of discretion so long as its reasons are apparent.in re pec solutions,at.here,however,the only reasons mentioned by the district reasons the court had previously given for dismissing the operative complaint with not justify denying plaintiffs leave to amend.
the district court reiterated reasons largely appear to be related to the bad faith factor.it expressed concern that t his case was filed nearly two and one half years ago,and plaintiffs have had more than ample opportunity to plead their allegations with sufficiency.plaintiffs,however,were not responsible for any delay,and certain circumstances worked to their disadvantage as they attempted to conclude their work on a complaint.after the district court appointed plaintiffs as lead plaintiffs on july,the court ordered them to file an amended complaint by october,based on bearingpoint representation that it expected to file its delinquent form and restatement by september.when bearingpoint realized that it would be unable to meet the september target,it asked the district court to extend the scheduling deadlines.the court refused,and plaintiffs were required to file their amended complaint on october,without the benefit of critical information not yet disclosed by bearingpoint.see in re bearingpoint,d at describing form and restatement as long overdue.after bearingpoint filed its form and restatement on january,plaintiffs,with leave of court,promptly filed a first amended complaint on march.bearingpoint and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss on march,and the parties filed supporting briefs in accordance with a schedule set by the court.the motions to dismiss were under consideration by the district court until march,when the court,on its own initiative,stayed the case pending the supreme court decision in tellabs.
after the tellabs decision in late june,the district court lifted the stay,ordered and received briefing on the impact of tellabs on the motions to dismiss,heard oral argument,and dismissed the operative complaint on september.thus,the case had only been reactivated for a little over two months when the district court dismissed it with prejudice.nothing in the case history suggests that plaintiffs were responsible for any of the delay or wasted any opportunity to plead with the required specificity.
the district court also faulted plaintiffs for failing to file a formal motion to amend and said that plaintiffs did not identify additional allegations of scienter at oral argument on the motions to dismiss.here,the district court rationale does not take into account that the controlling decision,tellabs,was both new and challenging.tellabs was meant to resolve the disagreement among the circuits about how competing inferences should be evaluated in deciding whether allegations give rise to a strong inference of scienter.tellabs,of course,provided instruction,but when the motions in this case were argued,lawyers and courts alike were just beginning to explore how to follow tellabs that do not generate easy conclusions.see tellabs,at.
against this backdrop,the district court,near the beginning of oral argument on the motions to dismiss,asked plaintiffs counsel whether he would offer additional allegations with respect to scienter if the court said at the end of the hearing,you do have it.plaintiffs counsel replied that he would proceed to explain why he believed the current allegations were sufficient,but that he was in a position to significantly bolster the allegations.also,in their memorandum that was before the district court,plaintiffs had asked that amendment be permitted if the court concluded that the complaint was insufficient.plaintiffs counsel strategy of not submitting a formal motion to amend and instead arguing that the operative complaint was adequate can,of course,be questioned.nevertheless,the strategy does not in any way amount to bad faith,and it did not provide the district court with a basis for declining to examine the additional allegations offered in connection with the rule e motion to set aside the judgment to permit an amended pleading.
the district court did not consider whether defendants would be prejudiced if plaintiffs were granted leave to amend,and we see no basis for a finding of prejudice.plaintiffs simply seek to add specificity to scienter allegations in a situation where defendants are aware of the circumstances giving rise to the action.edwards city of goldsboro,cir noting that merely adding specificity to allegations generally does not cause prejudice to the opposing party laber,at see also davis piper aircraft,cir because defendant was from the outset made fully aware of the events giving rise to the action,an allowance of the amendment could not in any way prejudice the preparation of defendant case.moreover,in this case the amendment would occur while discovery is stayed pursuant to the pslra,b b.
the district court also failed to examine whether amendment of the operative complaint would have been futile.while we reach no conclusion as to whether the proposed second amended complaint satisfies the scienter pleading requirements,we believe that the allegations added to that complaint changed the analysis that ought to have been conducted by the district court.see steinburg chesterfield county planning comm n,cir.
specifically,the proposed amended complaint added allegations relating to the time frame in which red flags became obvious to blazer and falcone it alleges that oneglobe problems were well known and frequently discussed by the company senior accounting and executive staff beginning in early.defendant blazer,in particular,was a party to those discussions.emphasis added.moreover,senior employees,including the communications and content group leader and the public services group leader,refused to sign off on financial statements for their respective segments during the second and third quarters of because it was known that the financial data was not accurate due to the problems associated with oneglobe.blazer and falcone approved financial reports for those quarters notwithstanding that senior employees had refused to sign off on the same that allegedly alerted blazer and falcone to concerns about the accuracy of the statements.
these additional allegations,which the district court did not consider,appear to weigh in favor of an inference that blazer and falcone and thus bearingpoint acted with scienter.the allegations,as well as others added by plaintiffs to the proposed amended complaint,could therefore affect the analysis of whether plaintiffs can satisfy the heightened pleading requirements for scienter under the pslra 
because plaintiffs did not act in bad faith,their filing of an amended complaint would not prejudice defendants,and amendment would not be futile,the district court abused its discretion in denying plaintiffs rule e motion to alter the judgment in order to allow an amended complaint.
we emphasize that our decision today is not in any way meant to detract from the district court conscientious and thorough work in this case.
for the reasons stated,we agree with the district court determination that the allegations in the operative complaint do not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.we nevertheless reverse the district court november,order denying plaintiffs rule e motion to alter or amend the judgment for the purpose of allowing plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint.the judgment is vacated,and the case is remanded.after remand the district court will allow plaintiffs to file an amended complaint against the defendants within a reasonable time to be determined by the district court.in addition,plaintiffs may after remand take action,consistent with bankruptcy law and procedure,with respect to their claims against bearingpoint,now a chapter debtor.
order reversed,judgment vacated,and case remanded 
although i commend my good friend judge michael for his carefully crafted opinion in this case,i write separately to explain my concurrence in the judgment.his opinion for the panel majority reverses the district court denial of the plaintiffs request to alter or amend its judgment dismissing their first amended complaint the fac.as a result,the majority today vacates the court rule b dismissal for failure to plead scienter,and remands so that the plaintiffs can amend the fac.in my view,the fac sufficiently alleges scienter,and i would reverse the district court on that basis.although i would remand for further proceedings on the fac,i concur in the judgment.
the fac alleges two claims against the defendants first,a violation of b of the securities exchange act of the act,b,as well as sec rule,the b claim and second,a violation of a of the act,a the a claim.to be legally sufficient,a b claim must allege,inter alia,scienter.see stoneridge investment partners,llc,d.as the panel majority explains,the resolution of this appeal turns on the scienter element.
significantly,the private securities litigation reform act of the pslra impose d heightened pleading requirements for scienter in b actions.merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,dabit,d.pursuant thereto,a plaintiff is obliged to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b.the supreme court has further refined that standard,requiring a b claim to allege facts giving rise to a cogent and compelling inference of scienter that is strong in light of other explanations.tellabs,makor issues rights,d.like the district court,the majority concludes that,under tellabs,the fac failed to sufficiently allege scienter in the b claim,rendering both of the plaintiffs claims legally insufficient.as explained below,i disagree.
in evaluating whether a b claim should be dismissed under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to sufficiently plead scienter,we proceed according to the following analysis first,as with any rule b motion,we accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true second,we assess the complaint in its entirety,including any exhibits incorporated by reference and third,we take into account any plausible opposing inferences.tellabs,at.see also pub.employees ret.ass deloitte touche llp,cir.we are further obliged,in the words of the supreme court,to assess all the allegations holistically,which requires us to take collectively the allegations in the complaint and refrain from scrutiniz ing each allegation in isolation.tellabs,at.
after carefully weighing the plausible inferences that flow from the allegations of the b claim,we may only reverse the dismissal thereof if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inferences one could draw from the facts alleged.tellabs,at.the inference that the defendants acted with scienter need not be irrefutable,of the genre,or even the most plausible of competing inferences.id.internal quotation marks omitted.rather,an inference of scienter need only be cogent and compelling,thus strong in light of other explanations.id.in my view,a reasonable person would readily conclude that the allegations of the b claim,viewed holistically,create an inference of scienter at least as compelling as any opposing the possibility that the defendants were merely negligent.ante at.
as the supreme court has explained,scienter is the intention to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.tellabs,at.quoting ernst ernst hochfelder,d.importantly,scienter may be established by a showing of recklessness.ottmann hanger orthopedic group,cir.in the context of a b claim,we have defined recklessness as behavior that is
