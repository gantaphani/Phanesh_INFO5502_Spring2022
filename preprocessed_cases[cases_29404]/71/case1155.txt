this is a securities class action pursuant to section b of the securities exchange act of and rule,brought on behalf of class members who purchased imergent common stock between october,and october.the basis of the claim is improper revenue recognition that materially overstated revenues and earnings and,in august,led to a restatement of imergent financial statements for fiscal years,and.all claims against imergent and its directors have settled.the only remaining defendant is grant thornton,imergent independent auditor which expressed unqualified or clean opinions on imergent financial statements for those fiscal years.
contend that grant thornton actions relating to the revenue recognition its expression of unqualified opinions on the financial inflated the market price of imergent stock,causing them to suffer damages when the price declined upon news of the revenue recognition problems and restatement of earnings.aplt.br.

background 
for purposes of this appeal,we must take as true all factual allegations in the complaint.see tellabs,makor issues rights,d.imergent is an company that,inter alia,sold licenses for software designed to help small businesses engage in.roughly half of imergent revenue during the relevant period came from the sale of licenses on the basis of extended payment term arrangements eptas.aplt.br.under opposed to cash or credit card paid the purchase price in installments over a month period.imergent recognized of the revenue from epta sales on the date the license was delivered however,on average imergent collected only of the total purchase price.on its and forms,imergent disclosed that of its epta sales were uncollectible and recognized bad debt expense associated with these sales,which reduced its total income.further,imergent wrote off the uncollectible epta accounts against an allowance for doubtful accounts,with the allowance established at the time of sale.
companies must adhere to generally accepted accounting principles gaap when recognizing revenue in their publicly disclosed financial statements.see ganino citizens utils,cir explaining how gaap are established a incorporating gaap into sec disclosure requirements.under the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop the relevant gaap for our may immediately recognize revenue from software licenses sold on the basis of contracts so long as persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of the product has occurred the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable,barrie,cir applying sop as the relevant aicpa and gaap standard.probable has the same definition as used in fasb statement,accounting for contingencies.that statement defines probable as the future event or events are likely to occur.no gaap pronouncement establishes a percentage for probable collectibility under sop.
in,the sec sent a letter inquiring about imergent practices.imergent,after consulting with grant thornton,responded that its collection rate for eptas was around.the sec was satisfied with imergent response and took no further action.the figure,however,reflected the collection rate for executory collection rate for eptas upon completion of the entire term was projected to be.
in,the sec again inquired into imergent policy.in its response,imergent indicated that collection rates for eptas exceed ed and were therefore probably collectible under sop.the sec responded that in order to qualify as probable under sop,the collection rate must be substantially higher than.shortly thereafter grant thornton withdrew its audit opinions on imergent financial statements,and imergent was forced to alter its method of recognizing revenue and restate its financial statements for fiscal years,and.the restatements drastically lowered had been overstated by,and earnings became losses for each of the three years.aplt.br.not surprisingly,the stock price declined.
a company the responsible for the information contained in its financial statements and the propriety of its underlying accounting policies,including compliance with gaap.see deephaven private placement trading,grant thornton,cir.however,grant thornton is responsible for its audit reports,which contained its unqualified opinions on imergent financial statements for fiscal years,and.according to the complaint,grant thornton falsely represented that its audits had been conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards gaas and wrongfully issued opinions that the financial statements fairly presented imergent financial condition and results of operations in conformity with gaap,aplt.br.plaintiffs contend that,contrary to its unqualified opinions,grant thornton knew or was reckless in not knowing that imergent revenue recognition policy violated gaap.more specifically,plaintiffs allege that grant thornton knew or was reckless in not knowing that the collection rate on eptas did not meet the probable collectibility standard under sop.aplt.br.
a.the second amended complaint 
in march,plaintiffs brought suit against grant thornton and imergent.imergent promptly settled,and in january plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated complaint sac or complaint with grant thornton as the lone defendant.the complaint alleged that grant thornton violated section b of the securities exchange act of the exchange act and rule by recklessly certifying that imergent financial statements complied with gaap and that grant thornton audits complied with generally accepted auditing standards gaas.more particularly,plaintiffs alleged that grant thornton recklessly concluded that imergent collection rate on eptas satisfied sop probable collectibility standard.defendants moved to dismiss the complaint with prejudice.
the district court granted defendant motion to dismiss,holding that the complaint failed to raise a strong inference that grant thornton acted with scienter,as is required by the private securities litigation reform act of pslra.see in re imergent sec,wl.specifically,the court held that plaintiffs allegations fail to raise an inference of fraudulent intent that is cogent and as compelling as the competing inference that grant thornton was merely negligent.id.at.
plaintiffs timely appealed.they argue that the complaint properly alleged grant thornton reckless conduct,and that the district court erroneously held them to an intentional fraud standard.aplt.br.we review this issue de novo.alvarado,llc,cir.
b.the rule b motion 
after the district court dismissed the complaint,the public company accounting oversight board pcaob a private,nonprofit corporation created by the sarbanes oxley act to regulate auditors of publicly traded sanctions on two representatives of grant thornton for their role in the imergent audits.plaintiffs contend that the pcaob orders and documents referenced therein constitute evidence of grant thornton knowing or intentional misconduct.aplt.br.in light of this newly discovered evidence,plaintiffs moved under rule b for relief from the district court dismissal with prejudice,seeking leave to amend the sac to incorporate the new evidence.
the district court denied plaintiffs b motion on two grounds the orders were merely summaries of the pcaob allegations to which the grant thornton representatives had stipulated,not actual findings of fact and the documents referenced by the pcaob orders were not sufficiently important to change the outcome of court prior decision.see in re imergent sec,wl,at april.plaintiffs timely appealed.
we review for abuse of discretion a district court denial of a rule b motion,keeping in mind that rule b relief is extraordinary and may only be granted in exceptional circumstances.see zurich am.matrix,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.a district court abuses its discretion when it commits legal error.lyons jefferson bank trust,cir.
discussion 
dismissal of the second amended complaint.
under the pslra,to bring a claim for violation of a securities law under which plaintiffs may recover money damages only on proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind,the complaint must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b emphasis added.
in tellabs,the supreme court explained the pslra strong inference requirement.at.the court held that in order to give rise to a strong inference of scienter,
i t does not suffice that a reasonable factfinder plausibly could infer from the complaint allegations the requisite state of mind.rather,a court governed by the pslra must engage in a comparative evaluation it must consider,not only the inferences urged by the plaintiff,but also competing inferences rationally drawn from the facts alleged.
id.thus,t o qualify as strong within the intendment of the pslra,an inference of scienter must be more than merely plausible or must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.id.
the pslra heightened pleading standard applies to claims brought under the exchange act of and rule.see id.at.in the tenth circuit,to state a claim under section b of the exchange act and rule a plaintiff must allege a misleading statement or omission of a material fact made in connection with the purchase or sale of securities with intent to defraud or recklessness reliance and damages.city of philadelphia fleming,cir emphasis added citation omitted see also in re williams sec.subclass,cir listing substantially the same factors citing stoneridge inv.partners,llc,d.recklessness is defined as conduct that is an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,and which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it.fleming,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
our have developed a recklessness standard specifically for section b claims against outside auditors.see pub.employees ret.ass of deloitte touche llp,cir in re suprema specialties.sec,cir pr diamonds,chandler,cir dsam global value fund altriss software,cir.this standard is especially stringent,requiring a mental state so culpable that it approximates an actual intent to aid in the fraud being perpetrated by the audited company.pr diamonds,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.under this standard,outside auditors act recklessly only when 
the accounting practices were so deficient that the audit amounted to no audit at all,or an egregious refusal to see the obvious,or to investigate the doubtful,or that the accounting judgments which were made were such that no reasonable accountant would have made the same decisions if confronted with the same facts.
at internal quotation marks omitted citing in re worlds of wonder sec,cir quoting sec price waterhouse.
combining the pslra pleading standard with the exchange act scienter requirement,the sixth circuit has held that to properly allege a section b violation against an auditor or accountant,the complaint must identify specific,highly suspicious facts and circumstances available to the auditor at the time of the audit and allege that these facts were ignored,either deliberately or recklessly.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
in this case,we need not decide whether to adopt an standard for recklessness under the exchange act.under either standard,the complaint fails to meet the pslra heightened pleading requirement.
in examining the complaint,we must take the factual allegations as true.see tellabs,at.however,we need not take as true the complaint legal relevant here,plaintiffs repeated assertions that grant thornton acted recklessly.ashcroft iqbal,d citing bell atl.twombly,d.this is particularly true in this context because the pslra heightened pleading standard requires the complaint to allege,with particularity,facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter.b emphasis added.we must also view the entire complaint,and not just individual allegations in isolation.tellabs,at.
we have considered the complaint in its entirety.however,for purposes of our analysis it is helpful to identify those factual allegations most relevant to grant thornton scienter.these allegations are 
grant thornton knew the respective collection rates for all epta contracts at all relevant times and had continual access to and knowledge of imergent confidential business information.
at all relevant times,the aggregate collection rate for eptas was just above.
sop defines probable with reference to fasb statement,which defines probable as the future event or events are likely to occur.
the fasb staff implementation guide states that probable is a higher level of likelihood than more likely than not.
an accounting textbook suggests practitioners interpret probable to be in the range.
grant thornton had a lucrative relationship with imergent which generated huge fees and thus was particularly motivated to appease the client because their remuneration was directly tied to the fees generated from imergent.
grant thornton knew of the sec inquiry into imergent practices,but did not reveal that the collection rate was only or suggest revising the revenue recognition practices,but rather asserted to the sec that the collection rate was.and 
after the sec letter informing imergent that revenue collection had to be substantially higher than in order to recognize the revenue up front,grant thornton withdrew its support for imergent revenue recognition practices instead of providing support for its prior position.
even with these factual allegations,the complaint fails to give rise to a cogent and compelling inference that grant thornton actions constituted an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,fleming,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted,or that no reasonable accountant would have made the same decisions if confronted with the same facts.pr diamonds,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
as alleged in the complaint,grant thornton was fully aware of the facts surrounding imergent policy.indeed,in its public filings,imergent explained that approximately of the gross amount of all epta that we enter into will ultimately be determined to be uncollectible.grant thornton correctly identified the appropriate gaap.the problem,as alleged by the plaintiffs,came not in conducting the audit itself,but rather in applying the facts to the relevant without any support.in other words,plaintiffs allege that grant thornton was reckless in concluding that a collection rate for eptas constituted probable collectibility under sop without obtaining any secondary sources to support their interpretation.aplt.br.
plaintiffs identify two sources that indicate that the threshold for probable under sop may be greater than a fasb staff implementation guide,and an auditing textbook.
the fasb staff implementation guide indicates that application of the probable standard in the context of loan impairment requires judgment it does not mean virtually certain,but is a higher level of likelihood than more likely than not.citing fasb staff implementation guide,q a of fasb statements and to a loan portfolio.however,as the district court correctly noted,the fasb implementation guide is low on the hierarchy of sources used to interpret gaap.see in re imergent secs,wl at citing the meaning of present fairly in conformity with gaap,au am.inst.of certified pub.accountants.
the auditing textbook discusses the meaning of probable in the context of disclosing material loss contingencies.see wanda wallace,auditing ed.it states,without citation,that research suggests that a percent range is encompassed in practice.id.however,the textbook does not establish or even suggest that the rate is the correct interpretation to the contrary,it notes the controversy surrounding the definition of probable and offers no definitive conclusion.id.despite debates that probable should be redefined as more likely than not,or,the fasb has retained the exhibit terminology and research suggests that a percent range is encompassed in practice.the general accounting office,a proponent of change,alleges that the language permits restrictive interpretations in the percent range.the controversy is likely to continue.
given the ambiguity and generality of these sources,we do not think that failure to incorporate them in the context is evidence of recklessness.moreover,both sources allude to the controversy over the meaning of probable,and neither establishes that is the correct threshold for probable collectibility under sop.finally,as the district court also noted,the complaint does not allege that grant thornton knew about the relevant authorities yet ignored them.in re imergent sec,wl at.
plaintiffs plead no other facts establishing that grant thornton conduct was an extreme departure from ordinary care.instead,it appears that plaintiffs would have us conclude that failure to consult these two sources constitutes recklessness sufficient to incur liability for fraud under the exchange conclusion that,without more,we are unwilling to make.
on appeal,plaintiffs make two main arguments that the complaint alleges that grant thornton approved imergent practices without finding any support,which constitutes textbook recklessness,aplt.br,and that the district court erroneously held them to an intentional scienter standard,instead of the appropriate recklessness standard.aplt.br.they also argue that the magnitude of the restatement supports an inference of scienter,and that grant thornton had a motive to engage in fraud,namely the desire to please imergent and continue to receive large audit fees.aplt.br.these arguments are unavailing.
first,it is simply inaccurate to state that grant thornton did not have any support for its approval of the practices.sop itself does not define the phrase probable collectibility.instead,it references fasb statement,which defines probable as likely to occur a definition that does not,on its face,rule out a more likely than not standard.
thus,while it is true that,according to the complaint,grant thornton did not produce any secondary sources to support its interpretation,sop itself and fasb statement provide some support.although grant thornton interpretation of the rule may have been incorrect or even negligent,the complaint does not establish that grant thornton conduct was an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,fleming,at,or that no reasonable accountant would have made the same decision if confronted with the same facts.pr diamonds,at.
second,the district court did not improperly hold plaintiffs to an intentional standard.to the contrary,the district court devoted several pages of its opinion to developing the proper recklessness standard.see in re imergent sec,wl at.plaintiffs identify several statements that,they claim,are predicated on application of an intentional fraud standard.aplt.br.that is not the case.the district court conclusions merely recklessness under section b is a particularly high standard.see in re imergent sec,wl at.indeed,it is the plaintiffs who are in error,as they appear to predicate their arguments on a standard akin to negligence or gross is below the high threshold for liability under section b of the exchange act.see fleming,at simple negligence does not satisfy the scienter requirement.citations omitted accord south cherry,llc hennessee grp.llc,cir defining recklessness under the exchange act as a state of mind approximating actual intent,and not merely a heightened form of negligence internal quotation marks and citation omitted pr diamonds,at recklessness is a mental state apart from negligence and akin to conscious disregard.internal quotation marks and citations omitted in re comshare.sec,cir f ederal appellate courts have long held the view that,for the purpose of securities fraud,recklessness that is far from negligence and closer to a lesser form of intent constitutes scienter.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
plaintiffs argue that the magnitude of the restatement supports an inference of scienter.aplt.br.however,we agree with the district court that plaintiffs failed to adequately explain the connection between the restatement and scienter.see in re imergent sec,wl at.in this case,the allegedly reckless action is grant thornton failure to provide support for its approval of imergent policy.the magnitude of the restatement has nothing to do with grant thornton scienter in applying sop,the restatement would have been equally large had grant thornton acted in good faith,negligently,recklessly,or,for that matter,intentionally.further,even if the magnitude of the restatement is one factor supporting a finding of plaintiffs argue,see aplt.br.complaint as a whole still fails to raise a cogent and compelling inference that grant thornton acted with scienter.
plaintiffs also argue that grant thornton had a motive to engage in fraudulent or reckless conduct to please the client and continue to receive auditing fees.aplt.br.while this may be true,that motive is present in every relationship between an independent auditor and a company.plaintiffs do not allege facts tending to show that grant thornton motive in this case was atypical or linked to the revenue recognition policy.thus,grant thornton motive in this case does not support an inference of scienter.accord.sch.employees ret.ernst young,llp,cir allegations that the auditor earned and wished to continue earning fees from a client do not raise an inference that the auditor acted with the requisite scienter.internal quotation marks and citation omitted in re stone webster,sec,cir a bsent truly extraordinary circumstances,an auditor motivation to continue a profitable business relationship is not sufficient by itself to support a strong inference of scienter.
finally,the fact that imergent publically disclosed its expected collection rate on eptas seriously undercuts any inference that grant thornton acted with the requisite scienter.the from and clearly indicate imergent policy.see aplt.these disclosures are more consistent with the inference that grant thornton made an erroneous and perhaps negligent interpretation of an ambiguous gaap than with the inference that grant thornton conduct was an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care that present ed a danger of misleading buyers or sellers.fleming,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
it is true that the sac may adequately plead a gaap violation.however,it is that c laims of accounting irregularities or violations of gaap support a claim of scienter only when coupled with evidence that the violations or irregularities are the result of the defendant fraudulent intent to mislead investors.pirraglia novell,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also thompson relationserve media,cir tjoflat,concurring in part and dissenting in part accounting irregularities,even violations of gaap in certified accounting statements,can not support an inference of scienter unless the officer certifying the statement was severely reckless.internal quotation marks and citations omitted eca local ibew joint pension trust of chicago jp morgan chase,cir allegations of gaap violations or accounting irregularities,standing alone,are insufficient to state a securities fraud claims.only where such allegations are coupled with evidence of corresponding fraudulent intent might they be sufficient.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.plaintiffs failure to adequately allege scienter,then,is fatal to their claim notwithstanding the alleged gaap violation.
in sum,the complaint fails to raise a strong inference that grant thornton acted with scienter in expressing an unqualified opinion on imergent financial statements.specifically,the plausible nonculpable inference that grant thornton acted negligently is far more cogent and compelling than the inference that it acted sufficiently reckle
