robert lowinger appeals from judge sweet dismissal of his complaint pursuant to fed.civ.b.the complaint asserted claims under the securities exchange act of,b,against,inter alia,appellees goldman sachs,morgan stanley,llc,and morgan securities llc collectively lead underwriters.it sought to hold them liable under section b for disgorgement of profits received in connection with their sales and purchases of shares in the course of facebook,initial public offering ipo.
section b requires a beneficial owner of ten percent or more of an issuer stock to disgorge all profits realized from short sales or purchases of that security within a period.see b.the lead underwriters alone did not meet the threshold.however,beneficial owner,as defined in section d of the exchange act,includes groups.appellant contends that the lead underwriters and certain shareholders together formed a group under section d.
the group was allegedly formed by agreements between the lead underwriters and shareholders shareholders.the agreements prevented the shareholders from selling their stock for a specified period of time except as permitted by the lead underwriters.the district court dismissed the complaint on the grounds that the agreements alone did not render the lead underwriters beneficial owners of the aggregated shares held by the shareholders under section d.because we agree that this standard form agreement is insufficient,on its own,to establish a group under section d,we affirm.
background 
upon review of a dismissal of a complaint under fed.civ.b,the facts,and inferences to be drawn from those facts,are viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.chambers time warner,cir.
this appeal arises from the may,ipo by facebook,facebook.the offering was underwritten by a syndicate of financial firms collectively,underwriters,including the three lead underwriters.goldman was a lead underwriter,and some goldman subsidiaries owned facebook shares.as part of the ipo process,each of the shareholders who,in the aggregate,owned more than ten percent of facebook common stock entered into agreements with the lead underwriters in order to induce the underwriters that may participate in the public offering to continue their efforts in connection with the public offering.app x at.appellant makes no claim that these agreements departed from standard underwriting practices.
the agreements generally provided that the shareholders would not sell or otherwise dispose of facebook stock for periods ranging from days to days after the date of the prospectus without the consent of morgan stanley as agent for the lead underwriters.the agreements were disclosed in facebook prospectus and registration statement 
as is common in ipos,the registration statement and prospectus alerted investors that the underwriters might,sell more than the million shares earmarked for the ipo.permitting such sales allows underwriters to stabilize fluctuating share prices during an offering by increasing the supply of shares after the offering price has been determined.this ensures and assures investors that the entire underwritten amount is sold.underwriters generally hedge this extra allotment by establishing a short position on oversold shares while simultaneously holding the shares long.underwriters are thus protected against upward or downward movements in the stock price.the facebook ipo permitted the underwriters to cover this short position either by purchasing the requisite additional shares directly from facebook and the shareholders at a fixed price per the terms of a option,or green shoe,or by purchasing shares directly from the open market once secondary trading had commenced 
because of their role in the ipo,the lead underwriters were necessarily granted access to nonpublic financial information concerning facebook.in march and april,facebook shared its internal forecasts with the lead underwriters for both the second quarter of and for fiscal year.these forecasts estimated revenue between and billion and approximately billion,respectively.that information was incorporated into materials used by the underwriters to market the facebook ipo to investors in a road show commenced on may.app x at.
that same day,may,however,the complaint alleges,facebook revised its revenue estimates downward for the second quarter to the low end of the to billion range and projected the fiscal year estimate to be to lower than the previously forecasted billion.facebook shared those concerns with morgan stanley.on may,facebook amended its registration statement to advise potential investors of its revised estimates.
on may and,the underwriters sold shares of facebook common stock to the public at prices ranging from to per share.facebook received for each share sold and the underwriters received discounts and commissions amounting to per share.over million of these shares were sold by the lead underwriters,which generated in discounts and commissions for appellees.
stating that the amendment to the registration statement did not adequately disclose the revised estimates,the complaint alleges that only after trading closed on may,did the investors become aware that the underwriters had already cut their estimates for facebook ahead of the ipo on may,the first trading day thereafter,facebook stock price declined to on extremely high volume reflecting a decline of more than from the ipo price.app x at.on may,a report by reuters further divulged that the revised projections had been revealed by the underwriters to select clients in a manner that avoided a general and direct disclosure of the relevant material information.the decline continued and on may,facebook stock closed at per share below the ipo price on high trading volume.
during that period,the underwriters declined to exercise their green shoe option to cover their short positions,choosing instead to purchase the shares directly on the secondary market,at prices lower than the green shoe fixed price of per share.as a result,the underwriters made a profit of about million with the bulk of that profit having been made on may.app x at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
on september,appellant,a facebook shareholder,made a demand on facebook that it compel morgan,morgan stanley,and goldman to disgorge their profits as explained infra,calculated under section b by subtracting the sales prices of may from the purchase prices during the following four days.facebook declined to bring suit,and appellant filed his complaint on june,
on may,the district court granted appellees motion to dismiss the complaint.it held that because appellant section d group allegation was based entirely on the agreements,it was insufficient to state a claim under section b.the district court noted that b ecause agreements are standard industry practice,they are,without more,insufficient to establish a section b group.in re facebook,ipo sec.derivative,supp.the district court declined to reach the alternative argument that the underwriters transactions were exempt under sec rule as part of a good faith underwriting 
this appeal followed.we solicited,and received,the views of the sec,as amicus curiae,relevant to the disposition of this appeal.

section a of the exchange act provides that any director,officer,or beneficial owner of more than percent of a firm securities,commonly called statutory insiders,must report to the sec the amount owned and must disclose changes in ownership.a.section b,intended to prevent the defined insiders from profiting from variations in share price,imposes a rule for disgorgement of profits.it states 
for the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by such beneficial owner by reason of his relationship to the issuer,any profit realized by him from any purchase and sale of any equity security of such issuer within any period of less than six months shall inure to and be re
