this appeal presents the question,inter alia,of whether the charitable gift annuities sold in this case were investment contracts under federal securities law.we conclude they were,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
not only did robert dillie promise his investors a gift for your lifetime and beyond,he pledged preservation of the american way of life,preservation of your assets,and preservation of the american family.unless dillie meant to refer to the way of life perfected by the boston swindler charles ponzi and his family we can safely say that dillie claims were a bit overstated.
the vehicle by which dillie was to deliver these dreams was a charitable gift annuity,sold through the foundation foundation.from until,the foundation sold its charitable gift annuities through financial planners,insurance agents,and others,including the defendants in this lawsuit.
the foundation marketing literature assured investors that they would receive a lifetime stream of income,with the money remaining at their death directed to a charity designated by the investor.the promotion was initially an enormous success for dillie the return for the investors was not.in all,the foundation raised million dollars from the sale of more than charitable gift annuities.unfortunately,the business model was simply a ponzi scheme in which,rather than investing the investors funds,the foundation used the investors funds to make annuity payments to earlier annuitants,commission payments to facilitators,and payments to dillie and others for personal expenses including dillie gambling expenses.although it collected millions in investments,the foundation quickly became insolvent.with a few minor exceptions,no charitable contributions were ever made,and the scheme collapsed in.
shortly after the collapse,the securities and exchange commission filed a civil complaint against dillie.the district court appointed lawrence warfield receiver as receiver for receivership assets in order to prevent waste and dissipation of the assets of the defendants to the detriment of investors.dillie was subsequently indicted and ultimately pled guilty to several counts of wire fraud and money laundering.he was sentenced to months in prison.
the receiver filed the instant complaint seeking the return of commissions paid to agents by the foundation for the sale of the charitable gift annuities.the receiver alleged breach of fiduciary duty,constructive fraud in confidential relationship,negligence and gross negligence,common law fraud,federal and state security fraud,actual and constructive fraudulent transfer,conversion,and unjust enrichment.
the district court denied the receiver motion for summary judgment on the fraudulent transfer claim and denied defendants motion for summary judgment on all but the common law fraud claim.warfield alaniz,d.it also denied defendants request to dismiss the defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction,finding that it had personal jurisdiction over them under,which confers nationwide service of process in suits to enforce liabilities or duties created under the securities exchange act of.id.at.
after a jury trial,the jury found for the receiver on the federal and state securities law,constructive fraud,negligence per se,and unjust enrichment claims and for defendants on the general negligence,conversion,and fraudulent transfer claims.defendants were ordered to pay damages ranging from to per person.defendants timely appealed the judgment,and the receiver filed a protective from the district court denial of summary judgment on the fraudulent transfer claim 
we review de novo the district court denial of a motion for summary judgment,moreno baca,cir,as well as the district court determination that the charitable gift annuities were investment contracts see united states carman,cir although characterization of a transaction raises questions of both law and fact,the ultimate issue of whether or not a particular set of facts,as resolved by the factfinder,constitutes an investment contract is a question of law.
the district court correctly held that the foundation charitable gift annuities were investment contracts subject to regulation as securities under section a of the securities act of act,a,and section a of the securities exchange act of act collectively with the act,securities acts,a 
our analytical framework is governed by the supreme court guidance in sec howey.under the howey test,an investment contract for purposes of the securities act means a contract,transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.id.at.in howey,the supreme court found an investment contract present where promoters sold acreage with fruit trees on it as well as service contracts to cultivate and market the crops,with an allocation of the net profits going to the purchaser.the howey court noted that its definition of investment contract embodies a flexible rather than a static principle,one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.id.at.
we distilled howey definition into a test requiring an investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits produced by the efforts of others.sec rubera,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the third prong of this test,requiring an expectation of profits produced by the efforts of others,involves two distinct concepts whether a transaction involves any expectation of profit and whether expected profits are the product of the efforts of a person other than the investor 
in applying the howey test,we are mindful of the remedial purpose of the securities acts,as well as the supreme court repeated rejection of a narrow and literal reading of the definition of securities.see,reves ernst young,d noting that,i n defining the scope of the market that it wished to regulate via the federal securities laws,congress painted with a broad brush tcherepnin knight,d i n searching for the meaning and scope of the word security in the act,form should be disregarded for substance and the emphasis should be on economic reality.sec joiner leasing.novel,uncommon,or irregular devices,whatever they appear to be,are also reached if it be proved as matter of fact that they were widely offered or dealt in under terms or courses of dealing which established their character in commerce as investment contracts,or as any interest or instrument commonly known as a security.
applying these principles to the case at hand,we note that it is undisputed that,as the district court explained 
t he investors paid money to through an irrevocable gift of cash,securities,or other assets.in return,promised to pool the money in investments such as stocks,bonds,and money market funds,and to periodically pay each of the investors a fixed sum of money based on their individual ages and the date that payment commenced.in addition to a monthly income stream,the investors expected to receive substantial tax benefits resulting from their purchase of the cgas.
warfield,d at.it is also undisputed that the foundation literature promised that monies remaining after the named annuitants lifetime would be directed to a charity designated by those who purchased the charitable gift annuities.
defendants argue that the investors did not make any investment of money within the meaning of howey because they lacked the requisite intent to realize financial gain through the transactions,and intended instead to make charitable donations.in addition,and relatedly,defendants argue that the investors had no expectation of profits because the anticipated value of the gift annuities at the time of purchase was always less than the purchase amount.defendants do not dispute that there was a common enterprise or that any profits were the product of the efforts of a person other than the investor,and we accordingly need not address whether the foundation charitable gift annuities satisfy these elements of the howey test.
the investment of money prong of the howey test requires that the investor commit his assets to the enterprise in such a manner as to subject himself to financial loss.rubera,at quoting hector wiens,cir per curiam.in rubera,we found this prong satisfied where investors turned over substantial amounts of money with the hope that the investment managers efforts would yield financial gains.id.it is undisputed in this case that the purchasers of the foundation gift annuities turned over substantial amounts of money in exchange for the foundation promise to make annuity payments and turn funds remaining at the end of the annuitant life over to designated charities.furthermore,although the foundation falsely represented that investors accounts were secured by the dollar assets of the foundation,the investors risked financial loss due to the now realized possibility that the foundation would not be able to honor its promises.defendants argue,however,that the purchasers of the foundation gift annuities made no investment of money because they lacked the intent to realize a financial gain and were motivated solely to make a charitable donation.we reject this argument.
at the outset,we note that,while the subjective intent of the purchasers may have some bearing on the issue of whether they entered into investment contracts,we must focus our inquiry on what the purchasers were offered or promised.under howey,courts conduct an objective inquiry into the character of the instrument or transaction offered based on what the purchasers were led to expect.at.see also joiner,at.the test for determining whether an instrument is a security is what character the instrument is given in commerce by the terms of the offer,the plan of distribution,and the economic inducements held out to the prospect.emphasis added.accordingly,courts have frequently examined the promotional materials associated with an instrument or transaction in determining whether an investment contract is present.see,sec edwards,d observing that a payphone sale and buyback scheme involved investment contracts where promotional materials noted potential for ongoing revenue generation united housing foundation,forman,d noting,in the course of finding investment contract test not met,that the promotional materials n owhere seek to attract investors by the prospect of profits and rather repeatedly emphasize the nonprofit nature of the endeavor see also rice branigar,cir holding investment contract definition was not met where promotional materials for housing development did not emphasize investment value of lots sec goldfield deep mines of,cir relying in part on brochure representations of profit possibility in finding ore purchase reinvestment program satisfied howey test aldrich mcculloch,cir stating that in determining whether real estate transaction constitutes security,promotional emphasis of the developer is c entral united states carman,cir holding an investment contract was present where business consistently promoted the package it offered as an investment.
our review of the record in this case demonstrates that the foundation marketed its gift annuities as investments,and not merely as vehicles for philanthropy.one promotional brochure entitled maximizer gift annuity a gift that offers lifetime income and beyond states,under the heading attractive returns,that y our annuity payment is determined by your age and the amount you deposit.the older you are,the more you receive.the brochure goes on to list the current average rates.elsewhere,under a heading titled a gift that gives to the donor,the brochure states 
to get this same return through the stock market,the hypothetical investor would have had to find investments that pay dividends of even the most profitable companies rarely pay dividends of more than.the rate of return on a foundation gift annuity is hard to beat 
the brochure also includes a chart comparing the benefits of a commercial annuity with a charitable gift annuity,indicating the superiority of the charitable gift annuity in such categories as annuity rate,annual income,income tax savings,federal estate tax savings,and partial bypass capital gains.although the brochure also notes that the investor will make a difference through the purchase of the gift annuity,the brochure as a whole emphasizes the income generation and tax savings aspect of the charitable gift annuity.indeed,a bullet point summary of the advantages of the foundation charitable gift annuities states high rates tax free income capital gains tax savings current tax savings estate tax free safe secure simple flexible pays you now helps you make a difference later.
another brochure entitled the charitable gift annuity preserving your family legacy now and for generations to come places emphasis on the opportunity for the investor to designate family members as secondary annuitants under the scheme,noting that y ou can easily include your spouse,children,or grandchildren to receive these lifetime benefits.this brochure also emphasizes the stability and security of charitable gift annuities,noting that a gift annuity is one of the oldest and safest financial instruments available.on the whole,this brochure pitches charitable gift annuities to an investor whose main concern is to provide a steady stream of income to dependents after he or she is gone.the brochure emphasis is on the income production potential of the charitable gift annuity.the fact that some purchasers may have been attracted to the gift annuities in part by the foundation promise to donate funds remaining after the annuitants life to a designated charity does not alter the outcome.see forman,at.suggesting that existence of collateral motive does not shield transaction from securities laws.in sum,when the promotional materials are examined,the investment component of the annuity is evident.
in addition to considering the foundation marketing materials,we note that the gift annuities were marketed and sold to persons who were likely to be attracted by the foundation promises of periodic payment of income and tax benefits.see,howey,at.considering class of persons to whom investment opportunity was offered in reaching determination that investment contract was present.at oral argument,defendants suggested that the charitable gift annuities were marketed solely to the elderly,who had little interest in a return on their investment.this contention is belied by the record.not only were there relatively young investors,but some purchasers designated a much younger annuitant,often a son or daughter,who stood to receive the monthly annuity payments for the duration of his or her life after the death of the primary annuitant.in addition,to impose a requirement that the elderly must expect personally to see returns on an investment before his or her death effectively renders the investment contract definition inapplicable to a large portion of the population.as the supreme court has noted,the particular motives of the types of investment vehicles appealing to vary considerably depending on the investor stage of life.see edwards,at.that the charitable gift annuity purchaser preferred a perceived investment yielding a stable income for himself and a designated beneficiary rather than a higher risk investment should not bar the investor from the protection of the securities laws.
in sum,because under the terms of the foundation offer,the purchasers of the foundation gift annuities committed their assets in return for promised financial gain,the transactions involved satisfy the investment of money prong.
defendants also argue that gift annuity transactions fail to satisfy the expectation of profits element of the howey test.the supreme court addressed the definition of profits under howey in forman,at,holding that shares in a housing development did not constitute securities because purchasers of the shares had no reasonable expectation of profits.in reaching its decision,the court explained that,b y profits,th is court has meant either capital appreciation resulting from the development of the initial investment or a participation in earnings resulting from the use of investors funds.id.at.
more recently,the court explained that,in forman,it had provided an illustrative description of prior decisions on profits,not an exclusive definition of profits.edwards,at.in edwards,the court held that a payphone arrangement involved the offer of investment contracts.the court held that the howey test was satisfied despite the fact that the scheme promised a fixed rather than variable rate of return,noting that investments pitched as such as those offering a guaranteed fixed return are particularly attractive to individuals more vulnerable to investment fraud,including older and less sophisticated investors.id.at.edwards also noted that,in howey,the court used profits in the sense of income or return,to include,for example,dividends,other periodic payments,or the increased value of the investment.id.
after edwards,it is clear that fixed periodic payments of the sort promised in the present case may constitute profits for purposes of the howey test.however,the thrust of defendants argument is that the expectation of profits prong also requires an expectation of net financial gain lacking in this case.this position finds support in edwards,which noted that forman supports the commonsense understanding of profits in the howey test as simply financial returns on investments.at.quoting forman,at.defendants argue that because the estimated value of the gift annuities at the time of purchase was always less than the initial payment amount,the purchasers expected no net gain from the transaction.indeed,defendants argue that it was impossible for purchasers to see returns on their investment and that accordingly,any payments to defendants could not constitute profits.defendants argument fails.
under the terms of the foundation charitable gift annuity contracts,the fixed rate at which the annuity amount was to be paid was based on the life expectancy of the purchaser.of course,the present value of the annuity at the time of purchase,which was also based on the projected life expectancy of the purchaser,was always less than the purchase price.that fact,however,does not establish that it was impossible for the purchaser to profit from the charitable gift annuity investment.indeed,whether or not a particular purchaser stood to see a return on his or her initial investment depended entirely on whether the investor or the designated secondary beneficiary lived longer than the actuarial tables predicted.furthermore,as we discussed in the preceding section,consideration of the foundation promotional literature,as well as the annuity contracts themselves,demonstrates that the foundation presented its gift annuity as opportunity for financial gain.the record indicates that for many of the annuitants,the periodic payments and tax benefits could deliver a return on the initial payment,especially when the payments paid to designated annuitants are taken into account.further,the purchaser may well have anticipated an increase in investment value that would accrue to the benefit of the charity.at heart,defendants argument under the profits prong closely mirrors their argument that the purchasers of gift annuities made no investment of money and fails for the same reasons discussed in our consideration of that prong.
we conclude that the structure of the charitable gift annuity contracts included an expectation of profit within the meaning of howey.
in summary,the district court properly determined that the foundation charitable gift annuities were,in fact,investment contracts and therefore subject to federal securities law.
we next address defendants argument that they are exempt from the registration provisions of the act the act defines a broker as any person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others.act a a,a a.section of the act provides that securities brokers and dealers must be registered unless they deal only intrastate or are otherwise specifically exempted from registration.act a,a.specifically,defendants contend that they qualified for exemptions to the registration requirements under sections a a v and e of the act,both of which were added to the act by the philanthropy protection act of philanthropy act,stat.codified in scattered sections of.before addressing defendants arguments on this point,we briefly discuss the background of the philanthropy act.
the philanthropy act was passed to codify certain sec interpretations of existing exemptions from registration under the securities acts for charitable organizations.see,at,reprinted in.prior to the passage of the philanthropy act,the federal securities laws exempted charitable organizations and securities issued by these organizations from securities registration that no part of the net earnings of the organizations inured to the benefit of any person,private shareholder,or individual.see investment company act of investment company act c,c excluding charitable organizations from the definition of an investment company act a,a exempting from provisions of act,except for provisions,any security issued by a charitable organization act g d,g d same with regard to act.
the limiting language in all of these provisions left open the possibility that charitable organizations maintaining charitable income funds were ineligible for the exemption because the donor to such a fund or the purchaser of a gift annuity receives part of the net earnings of the organization in the form of periodic income.however,the sec specified in a series of releases and letters that it would take no enforcement action against organizations maintaining such funds and issuing such instruments.see christ church of washington,sec letter,wl may,stating that staff would not recommend action to commission if church issues gift annuities without registration pooled income funds,release,sec docket,wl,stating that staff would not recommend enforcement against public charities maintaining pooled income funds in accordance with specified standards.
despite these assuring sec interpretations,congress was spurred to enact the philanthropy act by litigation alleging that charitable organizations issuing charitable gift annuities were operating as unregistered investment companies under federal securities law.see,at,at.the philanthropy act amended the and acts,the investment company act,and the investment advisers act of by providing specific exemptions for charitable organizations maintaining income funds meeting certain specifications.the upshot of these amendments was to exempt certain funds maintained by charitable organizations,securities issued by these funds,and employees of these funds,from the securities and registration requirements of the securities acts.see generally timothy horner hugh makens,securities regulation of fundraising activities of religious and other organizations,stetson.
central to our analysis is the philanthropy act amendment of section c of the investment company act to exclude from the definition of an investment company a ny company organized and operated exclusively for religious,educational,benevolent,fraternal,charitable,or reformatory is or maintains a fund described in subparagraph b.philanthropy act a codified at c.subparagraph b states in relevant part 
a fund is described in this subparagraph if such fund is a pooled income fund,collective trust fund,collective investment fund,or similar fund maintained by a charitable organization exclusively for the collective investment and reinvestment of one or more of the following 
ii assets of a pooled income fund 
iii assets contributed to a charitable organization in exchange for the issuance of charitable gift annuities.
the two exemptions to which defendants contend they are entitled refer back to this language we turn to these exemption provisions next.
we first address defendants argument that they are entitled to the exemption defined at section b of the philanthropy act.relevant for our purposes is the following language 
notwithstanding any other provision of this title,but subject to paragraph of this subsection,a charitable organization,as defined in section c d of the investment company act of c d,or any t
