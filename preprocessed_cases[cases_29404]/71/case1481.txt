the plaintiffs,who are stockholders of morgan chase jpmc,brought this purported class action for money damages in the court of chancery,challenging a merger in which jpmc acquired bank one corporation bank one in july.the plaintiffs claimed that the jpmc directors had breached their fiduciary duties by approving a merger exchange ratio that paid an unnecessary and excessive premium to bank one stockholders,and inducing jpmc shareholders to approve the merger with a proxy statement that contained materially inaccurate or incomplete disclosures.the court of chancery dismissed the overpayment claim under rule,on the ground that the claim was derivative and the plaintiffs had not excused their failure make a demand.the court dismissed the proxy disclosure claim under rule b,on the ground that the complaint did not state a cognizable claim for money damages,which was the only remedy being sought.
the plaintiffs have appealed from the judgment of dismissal,but only as to their proxy disclosure claim,and only against director defendant william harrison,as the sole appellee.we conclude,for the reasons that follow,that in dismissing that claim the court of chancery correctly applied delaware law accordingly,we affirm.
in january,jpmc and bank one jointly announced a merger,which had been unanimously approved by their respective boards of directors.under the merger agreement,jpmc would issue common shares to bank one stockholders at a premium of over the closing price of bank one common stock on the date of the merger announcement.
the merger agreement also prescribed the succession plan for jpmc senior management.following the merger,the ceo of jpmc,william harrison,would continue as ceo for two years,after which james dimon,the ceo of bank one,would succeed harrison.during the interim period,dimon would serve as president and chief operating officer.after the period,harrison,who was chairman of jpmc before the merger,would continue as chairman.
the joint proxy statement filed with the securities and exchange commission in february listed various reasons for the merger,which was expected to create the second largest financial institution in the country,measured by total assets.in may,the jpmc stockholders overwhelmingly approved the merger,with over of the votes cast in favor.the merger closed on july.
what prompted this litigation was an article that described the preliminary negotiations between harrison and dimon.that article appeared in the new york times on june,only days before the merger closed.according to the article,dimon reportedly offered to sell bank one to jpmc at no premium if he were appointed ceo of the merged entity immediately after the merger closed.the critical sentence in the article stated dimon,always the tough deal maker,offered to do the deal for no premium if he could become the chief executive immediately,according to two people close to the deal.
based on that one sentence,the plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that jpmc could have purchased bank one for no premium if jpmc agreed to appoint dimon ceo.by allowing harrison to keep the title of ceo for two more years the plaintiffs alleged,the board of jpmc caused jpmc to overpay for bank one to the extent of the exchange ratio premium.the plaintiffs claimed that the shareholder class was entitled to recover money damages equal to the dollar value of that billion.the plaintiffs position was that by approving the premium and obtaining shareholder approval through a materially misleading proxy statement that is,by not disclosing the information about dimon alleged offer to harrison,the jpmc directors breached their fiduciary duties,including their duty of disclosure,owed to the shareholders of jpmc.
the court of chancery opinion 
as earlier noted,the court of chancery dismissed the complaint in its entirety.the vice chancellor dismissed the underlying the board had breached its fiduciary duty by approving the merger that claim was derivative,and the plaintiffs had not excused their failure to make a suit demand on the jpmc board under court of chancery rule applying the test announced in tooley donaldson,lufkin jenrette,the vice chancellor held that to plead a direct injury,a stockholder must demonstrate that the duty breached was owed to the stockholder and that he or she can prevail without showing an injury to the corporation.the plaintiffs argued that the shareholder class was harmed individually and directly,because their stock interest in the merged entity had been diluted to the extent of the merger premium.rejecting that argument,the court of chancery concluded that dilution always occurs in a merger,and that stripped of embellishments,the plaintiffs claim was simply that jpmc was caused to overpay for bank one.that,the vice chancellor held,would be a classic derivative claim if jpmc had paid cash,and the result should be no different where,as occurred here,the merger consideration was stock 
the court of chancery also concluded that the plaintiffs proxy disclosure claim for damages was not legally cognizable under rule b.the vice chancellor observed that although the disclosure allegations could have supported a claim for injunctive or other equitable relief,no injunctive relief was ever sought and equitable remedies were no longer practicable.nor did the complaint state a cognizable disclosure claim for money damages,the court found,because the complaint did not allege any compensable harm to the class.as the vice chancellor stated,because the damages allegedly flowing from the disclosure violation are exactly the same as those suffered by jpmc in the underlying claim,the injury alleged in the complaint is properly regarded as injury to the corporation,not to the class.therefore,the claim for actual damages,if there is one,belongs to the corporation and can only be pursued by the corporation,directly or derivatively.
the plaintiffs argued that a violation of the duty of disclosure,without more,automatically entitles the affected shareholders to a damages recovery.rejecting that contention,the court of chancery held 
t he plaintiffs try to rely on for the rule that there is a per se rule of damages for breach of the fiduciary duty of disclosure.this is no longer an accurate statement of delaware law.loudon limited to its facts,holding that stands only for the narrow proposition that where directors have breached their disclosure duties in a corporate transaction that has in turn caused impairment to the economic or voting rights of stockholders,there must at least be an award of nominal damages.footnote omitted for reasons already discussed,the complaint in this case does not properly allege any impairment to the economic or voting interests of the class of jpmc stockholders.the only economic injury the plaintiffs claim to have suffered is the loss of the opportunity for jpmc to have acquired bank one on more favorable terms.that injury,if there is one,is to the corporation.moreover,jpmc stockholders voting rights were unaffected by the merger.although there are now more jpmc shares outstanding and a greater number of stockholders,control of the corporation remains unchanged.thus,the sort of injury to voting interests described in is absent 
the contentions and issues on appeal 
as noted,the plaintiffs appeal only from the court of chancery dismissal of their proxy disclosure claim,and only with respect to harrison.they do not challenge the vice chancellor determinations that plaintiffs underlying breach of fiduciary duty claim was derivative,or that the majority of the jpmc board were independent and disinterested,or that the board approval of the merger agreement,including its premium and succession provisions,was protected by the business judgment rule.the only claim presented to us is that the court of chancery reversibly erred by dismissing the proxy disclosure claim,because assuming the truth of plaintiffs allegations,the plaintiffs were entitled to recover compensatory damages,or at the very least nominal damages,as a matter of law.in response,the appellee contends that even if the directors were found to have violated their duty of disclosure,that violation does not give rise to any legally cognizable claim for damages,whether compensatory or nominal,based on the facts alleged in the complaint.
thus,the issues we must decide are whether the court of chancery correctly determined that the alleged duty of disclosure violation fails to state a legally sufficient claim for either compensatory or nominal damages.because those two types of damage claims rest on different theories that require separate analyses,we address each claim separately.
the plaintiffs claimed entitlement to recover compensatory damages 
to understand the plaintiffs argument that their complaint states a cognizable claim of entitlement to compensatory damages,some background is helpful.in the court of chancery,the plaintiffs contended that the defendants violation of their fiduciary duty of disclosure entitled the shareholder class to recover compensatory damages equal to the billion premium that plaintiffs allege the defendants wrongfully caused jpmc to overpay for bank one.the vice chancellor held that the alleged compensatory damages,as thus measured,flowed only from the underlying claim of claim that was derivative,not direct.applying the tooley donaldson standard for determining whether a claim is direct or derivative,the court of chancery held that only the corporation jpmc would have suffered the alleged harm from the overpayment,and only the corporation would receive the benefit of any damages recovery because claims of waste are classically derivative,the vice chancellor conclusion is correct 
the plaintiffs do not challenge that determination on appeal.what they contend,however,is that the compensatory damages to which they are entitled as a consequence of the proxy disclosure violation are identical to the damages that would flow to jpmc as a consequence of jpmc underlying derivative waste claim.that is,the billion value of the premium paid by jpmc is the measure of the damages for the separate harms occasioned both to the corporation and to the shareholder class,respectively,by the defendants two distinct fiduciary violations.the vice chancellor was not persuaded by this argument,and neither are we.to the extent the plaintiffs claim is that the compensatory damages worth billion flow from the disclosure violation,that damages claim is derivative,not direct.even if it were assumed that improper proxy disclosures induced jpmc shareholders to approve the merger including the billion overpayment,the harm resulting from the overpayment was to jpmc.therefore,any damages recovery would flow only to jpmc,not to the shareholder class.
the plaintiffs contend that their disclosure claim is direct,that their claim supports a compensatory damages recovery by the class,and that the court of chancery erred in holding otherwise.the plaintiffs argue that delaware decisions do not mandate that direct claims must have damages independent of those which would be sought in a derivative suit instead,it is the injury suffered that must be distinct.the plaintiffs urge that the issuance of billion worth of jpmc shares to former bank one stockholders resulted in a dilution of the proportionate economic value and voting power of the shares owned by all jpmc shareholders.therefore,plaintiffs argue,their proxy disclosure claim is a direct claim that would entitle the jpmc shareholder class to recover compensatory damages in the amount of billion.
that argument conflates three different issues i whether the proxy disclosure claim is direct,ii whether that disclosure claim,if valid,would entitle the plaintiffs to recover compensatory damages,and iii if so,how those compensatory damages should be measured.the first two of those issues do not involve matters that are in dispute.this court has recognized,as did the court of chancery,that where it is claimed that a duty of disclosure violation impaired the stockholders right to cast an informed vote,that claim is direct but that proposition leaves unanswered the second question what relief flows from the disclosure violation as to that issue,it is also undisputed,and the court of chancery recognized,that a duty of disclosure violation may entitle the injured party to compensatory damages in appropriate circumstances.but,that does not answer the third question,which is whether those circumstances are alleged in this specific complaint.
the plaintiffs argue that their complaint alleges circumstances that trigger their entitlement to a compensatory damages recovery.to construct that argument,however,plaintiffs must resort to conflating i their direct claim for liability for a disclosure violation,with ii the corporation entitlement to recover compensatory damages as a consequence of the corporation quite separate underlying claim for waste.to say it differently,what the plaintiffs are but not that where a disclosure violation arises from a corporate transaction in which the shareholders suffer a dilution of the economic and voting power of their shares,the shareholders automatically become entitled to recover the identical damages on their disclosure claim,that the corporation would be entitled to recover on its underlying derivative claim.
that argument is flawed for two reasons.first,it ignores the fundamental principle governing entitlement to compensatory damages,which is that the damages must be logically and reasonably related to the harm or injury for which compensation is being awarded plaintiffs have pled no facts from which for that matter any quantifiable be inferred from the claimed infringement of their right to be told the material facts relating to the merger on which they were asked to vote.although the billion damage figure would be a logical and reasonable consequence and measure of the harm caused to jpmc for being caused to overpay for bank one,that billion figure has no logical or reasonable relationship to the harm caused to the shareholders individually for being deprived of their right to cast an informed vote.indeed,as the vice chancellor observed,if the plaintiffs damages theory is valid,the directors of an acquiring corporation would be liable to pay both the corporation and its shareholders the same compensatory damages for the same injury that simply can not be.
second,the plaintiffs cite no authority that validates conflating their individual direct claim of liability for a duty of disclosure violation with the compensatory damages flowing from the corporation separate and distinct underlying derivative claim for waste.the plaintiffs rely upon in re pictures,for the proposition that shareholders may recover compensatory damages where a corporate transaction that caused impairment to their economic or voting rights,is accomplished by means of the directors breach of their duties of disclosure.but does not help the plaintiffs here.this court has previously held,and the vice chancellor correctly observed,that stands only for the narrow proposition that where directors have breached their disclosure duties in a corporate transaction that has in turn caused impairment to the economic or voting rights of stockholders,there must at least be an award of nominal damages.the claim being addressed at this point,however,is for compensatory,not nominal,damages.does not speak to the plaintiffs claim for compensatory damages in this case.
we conclude,for these reasons,the court of chancery did not err in dismissing the plaintiffs proxy disclosure claim insofar as it is the predicate for their claim for compensatory damages.
the plaintiffs alternative claim of entitlement to nominal damages 
the plaintiffs also claim,in the alternative,that the court of chancery erred in dismissing their proxy disclosure claim,because if that claim were validated,it would entitle the shareholders to recover,at the very least,nominal damages.the plaintiffs rely on for the rule that there is a per se rule of damages for breach of the fiduciary duty of disclosure.the court of chancery held,correctly in our view,that that is no longer an accurate statement of delaware law.
in loudon company this court stated 
we hold that under delaware law there is no per se rule that would allow damages for all di
