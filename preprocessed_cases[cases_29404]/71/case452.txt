background 
in november,raised nearly million by issuing shares of series a convertible preferred stock the preferred.that stock,while having no voting rights and paying no dividends,was convertible into common stock at the lesser of per share or percent of the average closing price of the common stock for the five trading days prior to the date of the holder notice of conversion.because the preferred paid no dividends,had no voting rights,and was convertible to common stock at a bargain price,it would almost always be converted.in addition,purchasers of the preferred were likely to profit from conversion no matter what happened to the price of the common stock,provided that the company survived.that is,so long as the price of the common did not fall more than percent after conversion,shareholders of the preferred would profit by conversion and sale of the common into which the preferred was converted 
this litigation arose out of an alleged scheme by defendant winehouse in which winehouse allegedly organized a cartel to purchase a percentage of convertible stock in the names of nominees.he allegedly arranged for a number of securities firms to become market makers in common stock,and then proceeded to sell the common stock short allegedly to drive down the price of the common stock.gurary concedes that this alleged manipulation did not begin before november.
on october,gurary purchased shares of nu tech common stock at,and then on november,purchased another shares at per share.after becoming concerned about his investment when the stock price began to decline,gurary spoke with marvin feigenbaum feigenbaum,chairman of,sometime in december.feigenbaum assured gurary that he had alerted winehouse that would refuse to register the common stock into which the preferred was convertible unless winehouse and his group stopped shorting the common stock.feigenbaum predicted that this threat would convince winehouse to stop shorting the stock because a refusal to register the common issued upon conversion would force winehouse to cover his short position by purchasing common stock at a possibly higher price in the open market.based on feigenbaum assurances,gurary purchased another shares on december,at a price of per share.gurary claims to have subsequently learned that winehouse and his associates arranged to borrow an unlimited number of shares from market makers for the express purpose of continuing to short the stock using nominee names.
gurary spoke to feigenbaum again on february.feigenbaum told gurary that he had met that day with winehouse and others in another attempt to stop the short selling.feigenbaum explained to gurary that had offered to repurchase the group preferred shares at cost plus ten percent and to allow the group to keep its existing profits from the short sales if it would cease its activities.although winehouse refused the offer,feigenbaum told gurary that would not surrender to winehouse and would refuse to register the short sellers shares.apparently comforted by these assurances,gurary bought another shares of common at a price of that same day.
on march,feigenbaum and another board member met with winehouse and asked that winehouse and his group accept registration of the common stock into which their preferred was convertible over a period of twelve months rather than insisting that it be registered immediately.winehouse refused this offer also and said that he would continue to sell short.common stock dropped approximately per share over the next two days as the winehouse group continued its short sales.six days later,gurary,in a conference call arranged by an intermediary,spoke directly with winehouse,who allegedly admitted to him that he deliberately had shorted the stock to drive the price down,that he intended to continue,and advised gurary to sell his shares because the price would drop to a dollar.
on may,gurary brought suit against and winehouse in the united states district court for the southern district of new york as a result of the alleged manipulation of the stock.gurary complaint principally alleged that defendants winehouse and manipulated common stock in violation of section b of the exchange act,and rule thereunder,by making numerous misstatements and omissions of material fact in connection with the purchase and sale of the convertible preferred stock and the shorting of the common stock 
both defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.in an affidavit in opposition to defendants motion,gurary counsel,david jaroslawicz,requested that he be granted leave to amend the complaint if the district court discovered any pleading deficiency.the district court,observing that gurary claims were based on four purchases,two purchases on october,and november,and two later purchases on december,and february,granted the motion in favor of winehouse and,after converting their b motion into one for summary judgment however,the district court did not comment on gurary request for leave to amend and therefore implicitly denied it.
gurary appealed to this court,and defendants and winehouse on the grounds that the district court improperly denied their motions for sanctions made pursuant to the pslra.in an opinion dated august,we affirmed in part,and vacated and remanded in part.with respect to gurary first purchase on october,we concluded that this purchase failed to state a cognizable claim under rule because gurary failed to allege culpable deception in connection with the purchase or sale of a security in that the alleged manipulation did not commence until november,and gurary first purchase preceded that date.gurary,at internal quotation marks omitted.we also concluded that gurary second purchase failed to state a cognizable claim under rule because gurary,at the very most,paid less for the security on november,than he otherwise would have as a result of the defendants alleged fraud.we noted that a defrauded buyer may only recover the excess of what he paid over the value of what he got,not the opposite.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.with respect to gurary last two purchases,we concluded that because there was no suggestion in the complaint or in gurary affidavit that feigenbaum did not intend to do just what he promised at the times he made the statements to gurary,gurary claim under rule was fundamentally flawed as it failed to allege that feigenbaum secretly intended not to perform or knew that he could not perform.id.at.we also vacated and remanded in part for the district court to make findings regarding compliance with rule b as mandated by the pslra.id.at.
in an order dated january,the district court determined that sanctions were not warranted because gurary could colorably argue based on a conceivable extension of the law that he relied on the market price as indicating the fair market value of common stock for his first two purchases,only to see it depressed by illegal market manipulation in violation of the exchange act,and that in reliance on feigenbaum promise to prevent further manipulation and stabilize the price,gurary made two further purchases on which the promises proving worthless he suffered even more losses.gurary,wl,at.in addition,the district court noted that a lthough a more scholarly and meticulous practitioner,or one more expert in federal procedure and securities law,might have foreseen that the complaint would be dismissed,it can not be said that a competent attorney could not form the requisite responsible belief as to the validity of gurary claims.id.internal quotation marks omitted.nu tech now appeals the district court order we affirm in part,and vacate and remand in part for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
discussion 
i.the private securities litigation reform act of and rule 
in,congress passed the pslra to give teeth to rule,r ecognizing the need to reduce significantly the filing of meritless securities lawsuits without hindering the ability of victims of fraud to pursue legitimate claims,and because e xisting rule has not deterred abusive securities litigation.simon debartolo group,richard jacobs group,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the pslra,which added section c,codified at c,to the exchange act,requires that a district court make specific findings as to a party compliance with federal rule of civil procedure b at the conclusion of a case arising under the exchange act,see simon debartolo group,at citing c,and also mandates the imposition of sanctions if the court determines that rule has been violated.see c.
if a court finds a rule violation,a rebuttable presumption arises that the appropriate sanction for a complaint that substantially fails to comply with rule b is an award to the opposing party of the reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses incurred in the action.id.quoting c a ii.however,if a party against whom sanctions will be imposed successfully meets its burden by providing sufficient rebuttal evidence under c b that such fees and expenses are not appropriate,then courts should award the sanctions they deem appropriate pursuant to rule.c c.the pslra does not alter the substantive standards for finding a rule violation but circumscribes courts discretion in choosing whether to conduct the rule inquiry at all and whether and how to sanction a party once a violation is found.simon debartolo group,at.
rule b provides in relevant part that 
by presenting to the court whether by signing,filing,submitting,or later advocating a pleading,written motion,or other paper,an attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the person knowledge,information,and belief,formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,
the claims,defenses,and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,modification,or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law 
the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or,if specifically so identified,are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.
b.the advisory committee notes explain that rule b establishes an objective standard,intended to eliminate any justification for patently frivolous arguments.also,the extent to which a litigant has researched the issues and found some support for its theories even in minority opinions,in law review articles,or through consultation with other attorneys should certainly be taken into account in determining whether paragraph b has been violated.although arguments for a change of law are not required to be specifically so identified,a contention that is so identified should be viewed with greater tolerance under the rule.id.while monetary sanctions may be imposed in some circumstances under rule,see.c,they may not be awarded against a represented party for a violation of subdivision b.c a,because responsibility for such violations is more properly placed solely on the party attorneys.advisory committee notes to amendments see also simon debartolo group,at.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court determination with respect to sanctions under the pslra and rule for abuse of discretion.see simon debartolo group,at citing cooter gell hartmarx,d.rule is violated when it is clear under existing precedents that there is no chance of success and no reasonable argument to extend,modify or reverse the law as it stands.id.quoting mareno rowe,cir internal quotation marks omitted.that is,material errors of law constitute per se abuses of discretion.see also cooter gell,at.concluding that an erroneous view of the law would constitute abuse of a court discretion sussman bank of israel,cir same see also pierce tripler,cir finding an abuse of discretion where the district court awarded sanctions against a party who has a good faith basis to pursue legal argument supported by one state court decision in the absence of contrary controlling authority.
iii.imposition of sanctions 
citing eastway construction city of new york,appellant asserts generally that the district court abused its discretion in denying sanctions against gurary because his claims against involving all four purchases failed to satisfy fundamental and threshold requirements for a rule claim and that gurary has failed to suggest any reason that he could have achieved success under existing precedents,and has failed to advance any reasonable argument to extend,modify or reverse the law as it stands,cir.we agree with respect to gurary first two purchases,on october,and november,respectively,but disagree with respect to gurary december,and february,purchases 
a.the initial purchases october,and november,
the district court on remand concluded that sanctions were inappropriate because gurary could colorably argue that he relied on the market price as indicating the fair market value of common stock for his first two purchases,only to see it depressed by illegal market manipulation in violation of section b of the securities exchange act of.gurary,wl,at.that conclusion ignores both the plain language of the exchange act and case law prohibiting recovery on any claims arising out of gurary first two purchases,and we therefore conclude that the district court abused its discretion by not imposing sanctions in connection with these claims.
section b of the exchange act and rule thereunder provide that a plaintiff must allege material misstatements or omissions indicating an intent to deceive or defraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.emphasis added see also blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d.gurary complaint alleges a violation of with respect to his first purchase on october,although gurary concedes that the alleged manipulation of stock did not begin until at least november.based on the plain language of section b and case law,gurary october,purchase could not under any circumstances give rise to a rule cause of action because that purchase occurred before any alleged deception began,and therefore could not be in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.see,blue chip stamps,at.see also b.accordingly,gurary claim based on his october,security purchase was not warranted by existing law.
nor could gurary claim be supported by any colorable argument for a change in existing law.the in connection with the purchase or sale of a security requirement of section b and rule would prohibit a court from adopting a rule that would support gurary claim.this is not a case,in other words,in which a litigant seeks only to swim upstream against the current of stare decisis,in which case a particularly trenchant argument for rejecting existing precedent might be availing.rather,the statute and regulation applicable here are incapable of judicial revision and thus precluded the district court from adopting any theory that would impose liability for a purchase entirely unconnected with alleged fraud.
similarly,gurary claim based on his second purchase was not sustainable under any existing theory of law.under principles,a buyer defrauded in violatio
