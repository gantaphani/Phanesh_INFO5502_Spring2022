the heir of a deceased investor filed this civil action against the investor brokers,alleging mismanagement of the investor accounts.the investment agreements signed by the investor required that all controversies be decided by arbitration before one of the securities industry organizations sro.but all of the sro refuse to conduct arbitrations in california because they do not want to comply with the ethical standards for arbitrators recently promulgated by the california judicial council.the sro take the position that the standards are preempted by federal law.
yet,after this action was filed,the brokers moved to compel arbitration.they assert that an sro would arbitrate the dispute if the heir waives the judicial council ethical standards or agrees to hold the arbitration outside california.the heir has declined both options.on motion by the brokers,the trial court ordered the case to arbitration.the heir challenges that order.
we conclude that the trial court should first decide if california is a proper location for the arbitration,applying principles that determine whether a forum selection clause is valid.if california is the proper location,the dispute should be tried in a court in california because the sro will not arbitrate the matter here.but if an location is proper,the dispute should be resolved through arbitration there.
background 
this case is before us by way of a petition for writ of mandate seeking to overturn the trial court order directing plaintiff to arbitrate claims against the brokers for unlawful trading practices.
a.the petition 
the petition alleges as follows.in,beth lobel inherited a stock portfolio valued between and.by,she had become a successful trader in her own right.she opened several brokerage accounts and individual retirement accounts ira at interfirst capital corporation interfirst.her broker was james copping,who was supervised at interfirst by brett briggs and bradford phillips.
correspondent services corporation csc and ubs painewebber painewebber,the parent company of csc,processed the trades made by interfirst on lobel accounts.csc carried those accounts.painewebber was also the trustee for lobel ira.painewebber acted as a clearinghouse for the trades made from lobel interfirst accounts.interfirst and copping initiated several unauthorized trades that were processed through csc and painewebber.
with respect to each account,lobel signed a customer agreement requiring the arbitration of disputes between the parties.the arbitration provisions read as follows or in similar language i agree and by carrying an account for me,csc agree s that any and all controversies which may arise between me and csc or between me and the organization that has introduced my account s carried by csc corporation concerning any account,transaction,dispute or the construction,performance or breach of this or any other agreement whether entered into prior,on,or subsequent to the date hereof,shall be determined by arbitration.any arbitration under this agreement shall be held under and pursuant to and be governed by the federal arbitration act,and shall be conducted before an arbitration panel convened by the new york stock exchange,or the national association of securities dealers,nasd.i may also select any other national securities exchange arbitration forum upon which csc is legally required to arbitrate the controversy with me such arbitration shall be governed by the rules of the organization convening the panel.i may elect in the first instance the arbitration forum,but if i fail to make such election then you may make such election.the award of the arbitrators,or of the majority of them,shall be final and judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
lobel died intestate on september.lobel son and sole heir,plaintiff jordan alan,was named the administrator of her estate.at the time of lobel death,her accounts totaled million.thereafter,interfirst and copping made questionable trades that reduced the value of the accounts to.painewebber and csc processed the trades.
b.the complaint 
on september,plaintiff filed this action against interfirst,painewebber,csc,copping,phillips,and briggs.for convenience,we sometimes refer to all defendants as the brokers.the complaint asserts causes of action for negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,breach of contract,and a violation of the california unfair competition law bus,et.in essence,the complaint alleges that defendants churned lobel accounts and made unauthorized,risky investment decisions that increased their commissions and substantially reduced the value of the accounts 
california ethical standards for arbitrators 
while plaintiff was contemplating litigation against the brokers,the california legislature was considering new ethical standards for arbitrators who hear cases pursuant to the terms of an arbitration agreement.as provided by section,subdivision a,of the code of civil procedure beginning july,a person serving as a neutral arbitrator pursuant to an arbitration agreement shall comply with the ethics standards for arbitrators adopted by the judicial council pursuant to this section.the judicial council shall adopt ethical standards for all neutral arbitrators effective july,the standards shall address the disclosure of interests,relationships,or affiliations that may constitute conflicts of interest,including prior service as an arbitrator or other dispute resolution neutral entity,disqualifications,acceptance of gifts,and establishment of future professional relationships.
the judicial council fulfilled its statutory mandate,promulgating ethical standards for arbitrators effective july.the standards address,among other things,the disclosures to be made by arbitrators to avoid doubts of impartiality,the disqualification of arbitrators,conducting the arbitration hearing,ex parte communications,confidentiality,compensation,and marketing.see cal.rules of court,div.vi,ethics standards for neutral arbitrators in contractual arbitration,pt.west civ.proc.supp.
in response to the ethical standards,the nyse and the nasd announced that,as applied to them,the standards were preempted by federal law,namely,the securities exchange act of et and the federal arbitration act et.they are litigating that issue in federal court.see,nasd dispute resolution judicial council of ca d mayo dean witter reynolds,d.the nyse and the nasd have refused to hear cases in california unless the claimant waives the ethical standards.in the alternative,the nyse and the nasd will arbitrate disputes if the claimant agrees to hold the hearing outside california.in his amicus curiae brief filed in this appeal,the california attorney general states,the nasd and nyse contend that the ethical standards do not apply in sro arbitrations and have,since july of last year,unilaterally suspended hundreds of securities arbitrations in the state 
sro arbitrations 
both the nyse and the nasd are sro registered with the securities exchange commission pursuant to the securities exchange act of the exchange act.as part of the comprehensive system of federal regulation of the securities industry,the exchange act authorizes sros within the securities industry to their members subject to oversight by the united states securities and exchange commission sec.sros are subject to extensive oversight,supervision,and control by the sec on an ongoing basis 
the exchange act directs sros to adopt rules and that conform with the exchange act with some exceptions,the sec must approve all sro rules,policies,practices,and interpretations prior to their implementation each sro must comply with the provisions of the exchange act as well as its own rules 
one of the functions of the sros is to provide arbitral fora for the resolution of securities industry disputes securities routinely include arbitration clauses in their customer agreements as a result,both the nyse and the nasd provide arbitration services to their members.the sec has expansive power to regulate the sro arbitration programs.mayo dean witter reynolds,supra,d at,citations and fn.omitted.
here,plaintiff chose to file a civil action to resolve the parties dispute and did not elect an sro forum in the first instance.defendants painewebber and csc collectively painewebber moved to compel arbitration pursuant to the federal arbitration act,seeking to have the dispute heard under the auspices of the nasd.the motion did not specify a location for the arbitration.in addition,all defendants moved to stay the action pending arbitration.plaintiff filed opposition.at the hearing on the motions,the trial court provided a tentative ruling in favor of defendants.counsel for plaintiff sought to clarify the tentative ruling as follows 
borenstein are you compelling an arbitration before the new york stock exchange or the national association of securities dealers when neither is appointing arbitrators or are you compelling arbitration to another state where the ethics rules do apply 
the court no,the former.the former.i not satisfied that they not appointing arbitrators.i get the impression that,in fact,they are under certain circumstances.is that correct,gentlemen 
trainor counsel for painewebber that is correct,your honor.
borenstein well,your honor,the certain circumstances are if we waive the ethics rules or if we arbitrate outside california.
at the end of the hearing,the trial court granted the motions.plaintiff petitioned this court for a writ of mandate.we issued an order to show cause,established a briefing schedule,and set the matter for oral argument.having considered the parties arguments,we conclude that the trial court order should be vacated and the matter returned for that court to determine the proper location for the arbitration.
discussion 
whether an arbitration agreement applies to a controversy is a question of law to which the appellate court applies its independent judgment where no conflicting extrinsic evidence in aid of interpretation was introduced in the trial court.brookwood bank of america th,d.we therefore review the trial courts ruling de novo.see norcal mutual ins.newton th,d.
interpretation of the arbitration provisions 
in moving to compel arbitration,painewebber chose the forum provided by the nasd from among those permitted in the customer agreements.the arbitration rules of the nasd are found in its code of arbitration procedure consisting of pages.the code governs the composition of panels,use of public and nonpublic arbitrators,exercise of peremptory challenges,joinder of parties,production of documents,dismissal of proceedings,tolling of time limitations,default procedures,and the payment of filing fees and forum fees.
the arbitration provisions in lobel customer agreements are to be construed in accordance with their plain meaning.see taylor investors associates,cir,mowbray moseley,hallgarten,estabrook weeden cir.those provisions state in this or similar language a ny arbitration shall be conducted before an arbitration panel convened by the nyse or the nasd such arbitration shall be governed by the rules of the organization convening the panel.the investor may elect in the first instance the arbitration forum,but if the investor fail s to make such election,then the broker may make such election.italics added.
as we read the arbitration provisions,the parties are required,as an integral part of the agreements between them,to submit their disputes to an arbitral forum designated in the arbitration provisions.thus,if an,the nasd,the forum selected by the to hear the matter,the dispute is to be tried in court.in other words,the arbitration provisions mean that all arbitrations must be conducted in a forum convened by,and subject to the rules of,the chosen sro.this is so because,as we next discuss,the arbitration provisions encompass more than the simple task of appointing an arbitrator.they determine the selection of a forum a court or arbitral with its own set of rules and procedures 
our interpretation of the arbitration provisions is supported by in re salomon.shareholders derivative lit.cir salomon.there,shareholders brought a derivative action against officers who had signed agreements providing for arbitration before the nyse of any dispute arising out of their employment.the defendants moved to compel arbitration under the federal arbitration act.the district court granted the motion and referred the matter to the nyse.
before the nyse,the shareholders contended that the dispute was not arbitrable.the secretary of the nyse decided that the matter should not be arbitrated,relying on the nyse discretion,as set forth in its constitution,to decline in any case to permit the use of its arbitration facilities salomon,supra,at.the nyse board affirmed the secretarys decision on the ground,among others,that shareholders derivative litigation is foreign to the procedures and mechanisms employed in nyse arbitration.ibid.
the case returned to the district court,where the motion to compel arbitration was formally denied and the matter set for trial.the defendants appealed.the second circuit affirmed,stating 
u nder the arbitration agreements,all disputes were to be arbitrated by the nyse and only the nyse,in accordance with the nyse constitution and rules.the nyse constitution clearly permits the nyse to refuse the use of its facilities for the arbitration of any particular dispute when the nyse so refuses,there is no further promise to arbitrate in another forum.
by now,it is axiomatic that federal policy strongly favors arbitration as an alternative dispute resolution process w hile it is still the rule that parties may not be compelled to submit a commercial dispute to arbitration unless they have contracted to do so,federal arbitration policy requires that any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.
the question we decide is not whether shareholder derivative suits are arbitrable,but where this its be arbitrated under the agreements.although the federal policy favoring arbitration obliges us to resolve any doubts in favor of arbitration,we can not compel a party to arbitrate a dispute before someone other than the nyse when that party had agreed to arbitrate disputes only before the nyse and the nyse,in turn,exercising its discretion under its constitution,has refused the use of its facilities to arbitrate the dispute in question 
the defendants argue that the final clause of their respective arbitration requires them to arbitrate in accordance with the provisions of the nyse constitution and nyse simply a choice of law provision.arbitration need not take place before the nyse,they contend,so long as the nyses rules govern in a proceeding brought before whichever arbitral body hears the dispute.we can not agree 
because the parties had contractually agreed that only the nyse could arbitrate any disputes between them,the district court properly declined to appoint substitute arbitrators and compel arbitration in another forum 
t he arbitration agreements here required that any arbitration be before the nyse,and not before any other arbitral forum.accordingly,we will not disturb the trial court decision to proceed to trial.salomon,supra,at,italics in original,citations omitted accord,smith barney critical health systems of cir,smith barney.
in the present case,the parties agreements obligate them to arbitrate before the sro that painewebber elected,namely,the nasd,after plaintiff declined to choose an arbitral forum in the first instance.but the nasd refused the use of its facilities in california to arbitrate the dispute in question.salomon,supra,at.because the nasd so refuses,there is no further promise to arbitrate in another arbitral forum,for example,the american arbitration association aaa.id.at accord,luckie smith barney,harris upham,cir where customer agreement provided for arbitration before nyse,nasd,or american stock exchange amex,investor could not compel arbitration before aaa merrill lynch georgiadis cir same.
in that regard,one of the arbitration provisions in salomon,supra,stated that disputes would be settled in accordance with the arbitration procedure prescribed in the constitution and rules then obtaining of the nyse.id.at,bracketed material in original.the other arb
