brothers theodore lee and andre lee the lees were convicted on conspiracy and substantive charges of uttering counterfeit securities in violation of and a.the lees challenge their conviction,claiming that the government did not introduce sufficient evidence to prove that the counterfeit checks were of an organization that affected interstate commerce,and that the district court jury instruction concerning interstate commerce was insufficient.we affirm their convictions on all counts except counts six and seven.the convictions on those two counts are reversed.
background 
the lees were engaged in a counterfeit payroll check scheme in chicago.they made payroll checks that purported to be drawn on the accounts of legitimate businesses,but were in fact drawn on accounts that had closed or had never existed.in early,the lees and their brother terrence provided robert johnson,an account holder at paul federal savings,with counterfeit payroll checks.over the course of two weeks,johnson cashed at paul eleven checks drawn on a citibank account held by prestige electrical maintenance prestige.another paul account holder,titus ellis,cashed five counterfeit checks provided by the lees.those checks were drawn on an account held by urban insurance urban at standard federal bank standard.
after a paul bank investigator informed johnson that he faced prosecution for his role in the scheme,he agreed to participate in an undercover operation.on june,tracy anderson drove johnson and theodore lee to paul.lee gave johnson a counterfeit check drawn on a bank of waukegan account held by slager heating cooling slager.after johnson cashed it,the three men traveled to another paul branch,where secret service agents arrested lee and anderson.the agents searched anderson vehicle and found another check payable to johnson and drawn on an account at the bank of waukegan.in a search of the lee residence later that day,agents found several more counterfeit checks.
on september,a grand jury issued a indictment charging the lees,terrence lee,johnson,and anderson.count one charged all five defendants with conspiracy to make,utter,and possess counterfeit securities of an organization,in violation of and a.counts two through seven charged one or more of the five defendants with uttering and possessing counterfeit securities of an organization,in violation of.each of these counts identified paul as the victim organization.counts two and three charged defendants for the eleven checks drawn on the urban account at standard.counts four and five charged defendants for the five checks drawn on the prestige account at citibank.counts six and seven charged defendants for the two checks drawn on the slager account at the bank of waukegan.
anderson,johnson,and terrence lee pleaded guilty.as part of his plea agreement,johnson agreed to cooperate with the government.the lees went to trial,where the government sought to prove the existence of,and the lees role in,the scheme.the government introduced evidence that the account holders or banks named on the checks existed.johnson testified that andre lee,when recruiting him for the scheme,stated that the checks came from one of their friends that worked at a big company.johnson also stated that he looked up prestige on his own,by using both an internet yellow pages site and.

defendants tendered a jury instruction stating that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the organizations listed as issuing companies on the checks operated in or affected interstate commerce.the court denied this instruction.the court later overruled the defendants objection to the government elements instruction,which they argued did not adequately state the interstate commerce element of the offense.

the defendants argue that the district court erroneously denied their motion for judgment of acquittal.we review the denial of motion for a judgment of acquittal de novo.united states fassnacht,cir.
section a conviction 
the statute prohibits making,uttering,or possessing a counterfeit or forged security of a state or political subdivision thereof or of an organization,with intent to deceive another person,organization,or government.a.a check is a security for purposes of the statute.c a.the statute defines organization as a legal entity which operates in or the activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce.c.thus,it was incumbent on the government to prove that the disputed checks were of a legal entity that affected interstate commerce.
the government now argues that it could prove this element at trial by establishing that either the payor company or the drawee bank named on the check was an existing organization.the stipulation agreed to by the parties referenced the companies,but it stated that the checks either,one,were not authorized by the named payor corporation or,two,named a fictitious payor corporation and corporate account.because of this ambiguity,the stipulation did not establish that the companies were existing organizations because it allowed for the possibility that they were fictitious.as other courts of appeals have held,fictitious entities are not organizations under.united states wade,cir see also united states barone,cir holding that a nonexistent company does not constitute an organization under the statute when its only effect on interstate commerce results from the passage of its forged securities to a victim that operates in interstate commerce.
we agree with other courts of appeals that section does not expressly or impliedly state that a document may be the security of only one organization.wade,at see also united states chappell,cir.the jury,therefore,could rationally have concluded that checks were securities of both the issuing banks and account holders.united states kellum,cir see also united states jackson,cir.in its,the government needed to present affirmative evidence indicating that either the payor companies or the drawee banks existed.
counts four and five 
for the two counts involving the checks drawn on the prestige account at citibank,the government introduced some evidence indicating that both prestige and citibank existed.government witness robert johnson testified to prestige existence,stating that he searched an internet yellow pages site and found a company with the same name,but with an address different from the one on the counterfeit checks.although internet information often lacks authentication,united states jackson,cir,johnson also testified that he located prestige using.when discussing the scheme,andre lee also told johnson that the checks came from one of their friends that worked at a big company,which the jury could have inferred to mean prestige.
