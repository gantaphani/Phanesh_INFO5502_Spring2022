petitioners jerome vernazza,vernon hall,stanley hargrave,and associates ims seek review of an order of the securities and exchange commission commission imposing sanctions for violations of several antifraud provisions of the securities laws.the commission determined that the petitioners,who are investment advisers or persons associated with advisers,knowingly or recklessly made materially false statements and omissions to their clients and in their papers filed with the commission.the commission found that the petitioners falsely represented that they received no referral fees and had no financial interest in any of the recommendations they made to their clients.because the commission findings are supported by substantial evidence,we deny the petition for review.
factual background 
the facts are largely undisputed.vernazza,hall,and hargrave are partners in ims,a firm registered with the commission as an investment adviser.vernazza also was registered as an adviser,but withdrew his registration in.vernazza,hall,and hargrave also owned the accounting firm hall vernazza,cpas,which for all practical purposes was the same business as ims.
world money managers world also a registered investment operated as the adviser to the tax planning federal cash fund tax fund,to which operated as the subadviser.in june,world and closed the tax fund due to unprofitability.ordinarily,the closing costs for an investment fund are paid by the fund itself in this case,paid the closing costs and obtained a loan from world to do so the promissory note for the loan provided that would repay the loan at a rate of per month,with the full amount due by july.
the day after the loan was made,world and entered into a shareholder servicing agreement ssa,the terms of which are central to this case.the ssa provided that world would pay for services related to world permanent portfolio family ppf of funds,such as marketing the funds and providing tax advice to investors.a schedule to the ssa stated that compensation would be based on time,effort,and complexity of services at an annual rate not to exceed a series of percentages of additional assets.additional assets was defined as the value of the investments in ppf funds made by clients of or ims.the percentage caps ranged from to of the additional assets,depending on which of the three ppf funds the client invested in,whether the client had been previously invested in the tax fund,and when the investment was made.the highest percentages were applied to investments made by former tax fund clients before june,day before the loan was due to be repaid.the ssa did not indicate any other basis,such as an hourly rate of pay,for determining compensation.the ssa also contained a minimum investment requirement whereby would not be paid at all until its and ims clients had purchased at least in ppf funds.
actual compensation from world was always the maximum amount payable under the ssa caps.petitioners never sent world an accounting of hours worked,services performed,or hourly rates.the only accounting in the record is a list of the investments made by and ims clients,with the servicing fee determined by the percentages in the ssa.
according to vernazza,the reason that compensation was determined by the caps is that had performed services entitling it to more money than it could recover under the caps.as of the first bill sent to world,had performed services entitling it to about,but because this amount was greater than the caps,it was paid only according to the caps and the extra amount was rolled over to the next period.this happened throughout the life of the agreement vernazza testified that performed services worth a total of about,but that compensation was limited by the caps because the value of the services performed exceeded the amount payable under the caps.vernazza stated that he billed the work at either per hour or per hour he also stated that had discussed a range of per hour with world but had never agreed on a specific hourly figure.
the payments made by to world on the loan closely tracked the payments made by world on the ssa.missed the first payment on the loan,a payment due in january.the payment finally was made on april,the day after received its first ssa payment from world in the amount of.by september,world had paid under the ssa had in turn paid world under the promissory note for the loan.continued to be paid under the ssa until.
during this period,petitioners made representations,in engagement letters to their clients,that they had no financial interest in and did not receive commissions for recommending ppf funds.multiple engagement letters from ims to its clients,for example,stated that ims warrants that they have not and will not receive any commission or any payment from,nor do they have any financial interest in,any recommendation made.
vernazza and ims also made similar representations in filings with the commission as investment advisers,vernazza and ims were required to file a form adv with the commission and to update it annually.see a.the form includes questions about potential conflicts of interest if any apply to the adviser,they must be explained on schedule f of the form.part i,question asks whether the adviser recommend ed securities to clients during its last fiscal year in which the adviser had any ownership or sales interest.part ii,question c asks whether the adviser has arrangements that are material to its advisory business or its clients with a related person who is an other investment adviser.part ii,question d asks whether the adviser r ecommends to clients that they buy or sell securities in which the adviser or a related person has some financial interest.finally,part ii,question a asks whether the adviser,or a related person,receives some economic benefit from a in connection with giving advice to clients.
ims and vernazza originally answered all of the above questions in the negative.in,vernazza changed his answer to part ii,question c,stating that,under the ssa,was paid by world for advisory and administrative support services according to time,effort and complexity of services.ims did the same,and also mentioned that compensation was capped at of the investment in each fund,although it did not mention that these percentages applied only to investments made by ims clients.in,ims also amended the form to answer yes to part ii,question d,and gave a similar explanation of the ssa,including the same description of the caps.neither vernazza nor ims made any other material amendments to the forms 
as advisers,vernazza and ims also were required to furnish clients with disclosure statements comprising the same information as part ii of the form see.the disclosure statements for vernazza,hall,and hargrave during all stated that they received no fees or commissions from anyone selling the investments they recommended.they explained that,under the ssa,received compensation from world for advisory and administrative support services,but did not mention the caps.
procedural history 
on july,the commission division of enforcement initiated proceedings against the petitioners,alleging fraud in violation of both the securities act of,securities act,and the securities exchange act of,exchange act,and several violations of the investment advisers act of,to advisers act.after a hearing,an administrative law judge alj found that the petitioners had committed the violations and issued a order,suspended vernazza and ims registrations as advisers,prohibited vernazza,hall,and hargrave from associating with any adviser for six months,and ordered disgorgement of the payments received under the ssa 
the alj order was reviewed de novo by the commission,and it was,in large part,affirmed.the commission found fraud in violation of several statutes and regulations,and false statements to the commission in violation of advisers act.the essential basis of all of these violations was that the petitioners had made materially false statements when they represented that they had no financial interest in,nor received any economic benefit from,the investment recommendations they made,and that they made such statements knowingly or recklessly.the commission found that the ssa was merely a disguised referral fee agreement,in which world gave petitioners the money for the tax fund closing costs in exchange for petitioners sending business to world.the commission also upheld the alj sanctions 
pursuant to securities act a,a exchange act a,a and advisers act a,a,which give the courts of appeals jurisdiction to review final orders of the commission,petitioners filed petitions for review with the ninth circuit.they argued that the commission erred in finding that petitioners acted with scienter and in excluding the proffered testimony of an expert witness,that the commission abused its discretion in imposing sanctions,and that the commission lacks authority to bar association with unregistered advisers.
standard of review 
under all of the statutes in question,the commission findings of fact are reviewed for substantial evidence.see a,a,a.the commission imposition of sanctions is reviewed for abuse of discretion.our task is to assure that the sanction is supported by the law and facts,not to revisit the sanction anew or impose our independent judgment on the merits of the sanction.krull sec,cir citations omitted.
an agency interpretation or application of a statute is a question of law that we generally review de novo.brower evans,cir.but when it appears that congress delegated authority to an agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation was promulgated in the exercise of that authority,the agency interpretation may be rejected only if it is unreasonable or contrary to clear congressional intent.united states mead,d citing chevron,natural res.def.council,d.an agency interpretation of a different form is not afforded such deference,but is nonetheless given some weight.id.at.
discussion 
i.the commission findings of fraud.
the commission found fraud in violation of securities act a,a,and exchange act b,id.b,and rule,fraud in violation of the advisers act and,and false statements to the commission in violation of advisers act,id.advisers act criminalizes willfully making false statements of material fact,or material omissions,in applications or reports to the commission,such as a form id.advisers act prohibits advisers from,directly or indirectly,employing a scheme to defraud clients or engaging in practices which operate as a fraud upon clients.id.exchange act b criminalizes employing deceptive devices in connection with the sale of securities in violation of commission rules,id.b rule prohibits,as such a deceptive device,the use of fraudulent schemes or business practices and prohibits making false statements of material fact or misleading material omissions.securities act a criminalizes the use of fraudulent schemes or business practices and criminalizes obtaining money by making false statements of material fact or misleading material omissions.a.although scienter is required for some of these violations,the element of a materially false statement is satisfied by essentially the same conduct for all of the statutes in question.
petitioners made materially false statements.
we have no trouble concluding that the petitioners made materially false statements when they claimed not to recommend securities in which they had an ownership or sales interest,not to receive economic benefits in connection with giving advice to clients,and not to recommend securities in which they had a financial interest.it is indisputable that potential conflicts of interest are material facts with respect to clients and the commission.see,sec capital gains research bureau,d noting that an investment adviser must fully and fairly reveal his personal interests in his recommendations to his clients.
two aspects of the ssa created a financial interest for the petitioners to recommend ppf funds to their clients.first,the minimum investment provision created an incentive for the petitioners to convince their clients to invest a total of at least in ppf funds otherwise they would not have received any payment under the ssa.when a person payment is contingent on his or her clients investing a minimum amount of money,that person has a financial interest in recommending the investment until that amount of money has been reached.
the second aspect of the ssa,the system of caps,continued to create a financial interest in recommending ppf funds even after the minimum investment provision had been satisfied.we need not decide whether the ssa caps facially created a financial interest because it is obvious that they did so in practice.as noted above,vernazza indicated that had performed work in excess of the compensation it was entitled to under the caps,and thus the balance was carried forward.at this point,as long as a balance was carried forward,compensation was wholly dependent on the amount of money invested by its and ims clients.when compensation is predicated entirely on the amount of money invested in a fund by a person clients,that person has a financial interest in recommending that fund.the petitioners had a financial interest in recommending ppf funds,and their representations to the contrary were false statements of material fact.
petitioners argue that the commission erred by not crediting vernazza testimony that he put in substantial work under the ssa and kept records of this work,thus finding that the work performed under the ssa was minimal.as long as a balance was carried forward,however,the amount of work actually performed under the ssa is irrelevant.petitioners still had a financial interest in recommending world funds,even if they also needed to,and in fact did,perform other services under the ssa 
substantial evidence supports the commission finding of scienter.
it is undisputed that scienter is a required element for violations of securities act a,exchange act b and rule,and advisers act.scienter is not required for the other violations of the advisers act.the parties do,however,dispute the meaning of scienter the petitioners suggest that scienter requires specific intent to defraud.
in this circuit,a violation of exchange act b and rule may be supported by knowing or reckless conduct,without a showing of willful intent to defraud.nelson serwold,cir see also howard everex,cir.a similar showing is required for violations of securities act a.see,sec dain rauscher,cir.we apparently have never considered what constitutes scienter under advisers act,but because its language is nearly identical to that of securities act a we now hold that the same or reckless to advisers act.
citing the testimony of vernazza,hall,and hargrave,the commission found that each had knowledge of the caps under the ssa and that each had reason to know of the false statements made in the forms adv and disclosure statements the commission held that the petitioners had a duty to disclose potential conflicts of interest accurately,and that even if the petitioners failure to disclose was unknowing,it was reckless.the commission found it implausible that the petitioners were ignorant of this duty,or that the failure to do so was merely an oversight,and therefore determined that the petitioners had the requisite scienter.
petitioners argue that,because there is no direct evidence of their intent to defraud their clients,the commission finding of scienter lacks substantial evidence.we are not persuaded.the commission identified the applicable standard of care correctly and had the requisite evidentiary basis to conclude that the petitioners were in violation.
the commission correctly determined that the petitioners had a duty to disclose any potential conflicts of interest accurately and completely,and to recognize that the ssa created such a potential conflict.although the commission determination of the duty of care is not the kind of formal interpretation that is entitled to chevron deference,an agency interpretation may merit some deference whatever its form,given the specialized experience and broader investigations and information available to the agency.mead,at.quoting skidmore swift.in this case,we defer to the commission experience and expertise
