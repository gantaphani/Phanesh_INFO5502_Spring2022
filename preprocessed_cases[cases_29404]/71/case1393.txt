the issue raised in this writ proceeding is whether the target of a government investigation may share privileged documents with the government without waiving the privilege or the protection afforded attorney work product.we conclude petitioner waived the privilege and work product protection for documents shared with the government.
background 
on april,petitioner mckesson hboc,mckesson publicly disclosed that its auditors had discovered improperly recorded revenues at mckesson subsidiary,hbo company hboc.the disclosure led to shareholder lawsuits,some filed the same day as the disclosure,and investigations by the united states attorney office united states attorney and the securities and exchange commission sec.the sec opened a formal investigation by order dated july.the order stated the sec was investigating whether mckesson,its present and former officers,directors,employees,predecessors,subsidiaries,or other persons or entities had committed securities fraud filed untrue or misleading reports with the sec failed to keep accurate books,records and accounts falsified books,records and accounts misled mckesson auditor and failed to implement an adequate system of accounting controls.
mckesson retained the law firm of skadden,arps,slate,meagher flom llp skadden to represent it in the shareholder lawsuits and to perform an internal review of the matter.skadden attorneys proceeded to interview present and former mckesson or hboc employees.the attorneys prepared an interview memorandum for each of the interviews some employees were interviewed more than once.skadden then prepared a report the audit committee report,which it provided to mckesson on july.
during the course of the internal review,skadden informed representatives of the united states attorney and the sec that mckesson was willing to disclose the results of skadden internal review to the government,subject to agreements designed to preserve the confidentiality of any materials given to the government.the united states attorney and the sec agreed to enter into such agreements.
the confidentiality agreements prepared by skadden reflected mckesson belief that the documents it was providing were protected by the privilege and the work product doctrine.the agreements further stated that mckesson did not intend to waive those protections,and that mckesson believed it had a common interest with the government in obtaining information regarding the improperly recorded revenues.although the united states attorney and the sec agreed to protect the confidentiality of the documents,the agreements did provide for disclosure under certain circumstances,including the prosecution of mckesson specifically,the united states attorney was permitted to disclose the documents to a federal grand jury as the office deems appropriate,and in any criminal prosecution that might result from the office investigation.with respect to the sec,the documents were to be protected,except to the extent that the sec staff determines that disclosure is otherwise required by federal law or in furtherance of the commission discharge of its duties and responsibilities.
skadden provided copies of the audit committee report and the interview memoranda to the united states attorney and the sec in late july and early august.
to date,the government has not taken any action against mckesson in connection with the improperly recorded revenues.in june,sec staff did notify mckesson of its intent to recommend enforcement proceedings against mckesson,but the sec later notified mckesson,in january,that it had terminated its investigation of mckesson with no enforcement action recommended against mckesson.the united states attorney did file criminal charges against former hboc executives.
several civil actions against mckesson have been consolidated in respondent san francisco superior court.plaintiffs and real parties in interest merrill lynch fundamental growth fund,and merrill lynch global value fund,collectively,merrill lynch moved in the consolidated actions to compel mckesson to produce the audit committee report and the interview memoranda merrill lynch asserted mckesson had waived both the privilege and attorney work product protection when it gave the documents to the government.
the trial court granted the motion to compel.the trial court found the audit committee report and the interview memoranda were subject to the privilege,but that the privilege had been waived by sharing the documents with the government.the trial court stated the disclosure of the documents to the sec and the united states attorney was not reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose for which skadden was consulted.citing,subd.d.mckesson hboc retained skadden to investigate the alleged fraud and to determine who was responsible.however,this purpose did not require disclosure of the report to the sec or the united states attorney.
the trial court similarly found the documents were subject to the protection afforded attorney work product code civ,subd.c,but that mckesson had waived that protection by disclosing the documents to third parties who did not have an interest in preserving the confidentiality of the documents.
the trial court stayed its order so that mckesson could seek appellate review.mckesson has sought review by way of a petition for writ of mandate or prohibition.at the direction of our supreme court,we issued an order to show cause why the relief sought in the petition should not be granted.in addition to the return and other briefs filed by merrill lynch,we have received and considered briefs in support of the petition from the sec and the securities industry association 
discussion 
standard of review 
the parties dispute the applicable standard of review.mckesson argues the underlying facts are undisputed therefore this court should review the trial court order de novo.see emeryville redevelopment agency elementis pigments,th,d application of evid.code provisions to undisputed facts presents a question of law.merrill lynch asserts the trial court order is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.see kleitman superior court th,d a discovery order is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.
we find the waiver issue presents a mixed question of fact and law.mixed questions of law and fact concern the application of the rule to the facts and the consequent determination whether the rule is satisfied.crocker national bank city and county of san francisco cal d.as the historical facts are undisputed,the question is whether,given those historical facts,mckesson has waived the privilege and attorney work product protection.that inquiry requires a critical consideration,in a factual context,of legal principles and their underlying values.ibid.therefore,the question is predominately legal,and we independently review the trial court decision.see tennenbaum deloitte touche,whether holder has waived right to claim privilege is mixed question of law and fact reviewed de novo.
waiver of privilege 
in california,the privilege is a legislative creation.see.the courts of this state have no power to expand it or to recognize implied exceptions.wells fargo bank superior court cal th,d,see also no privilege except as provided by statute.the purpose of the privilege is to promote full and open discussion between clients and their attorneys.solin myers th,d.nevertheless,evidentiary privileges should be narrowly construed because they prevent the admission of relevant and otherwise admissible evidence.people sinohui cal th,d,greyhound superior court cal d.
the privilege may be waived.the evidence code provides the privilege is waived with respect to a communication protected by the privilege if any holder of the privilege,without coercion,has disclosed a significant part of the communication or has consented to disclosure made by anyone,subd.a.
there is no question that mckesson consented to disclosure of the audit committee report and interview memoranda to the government.mckesson,however,seeks refuge in subdivision d of,which allows disclosure without waiving the privilege when disclosure is reasonably necessary for the
