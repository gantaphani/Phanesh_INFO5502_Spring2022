defendant joseph falcone appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york platt,convicting him after a jury trial of thirteen counts of securities fraud,in violation of section b of the securities exchange act of,b section b,and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud,in violation of,based on the misappropriation theory of insider trading.the charges arose from a scheme involving the misappropriation of confidential copies of a magazine column that discussed securities for the purpose of trading in the securities of the featured companies.in challenging the district court finding that this case is governed by this court decision in united states libera,cir,which upheld a conviction based on a similar scheme,defendant argues on appeal that libera should not govern the result in this case because under the supreme court more recent decision in united states,d,the misappropriations at issue in both libera and the instant case would not satisfy section b requirement that the misappropriation be in connection with the purchase or sale of a security and this case is materially distinguishable from libera we disagree and affirm the judgment of conviction.
background 
defendant conviction arose from his participation in a scheme in which an employee of hudson news,a magazine wholesaler,faxed a stockbroker acquaintance of defendant,larry smath,confidential copies of a column in business week magazine inside wall street that discussed companies and their stocks.business week is a weekly financial publication owned by.smath himself used the information to trade securities and also passed the information along to defendant,who likewise traded in the securities discussed in the column.
evidence was introduced at trial indicating that the value of stocks discussed favorably in the column tended to increase after the magazine was released to the public and that,because of this impact,business week imposed a strict confidentiality policy prior to that release on all those involved in the magazine production and distribution.this policy applied to hudson news and was implemented through a broader company policy,applicable to all the magazines hudson news distributed,prohibiting employees from taking copies of the magazines or portions thereof out of the company delivery department.
after the jury returned a guilty verdict,the district court denied defendant motion to set the verdict aside.although expressing concern about the boundless expansion of the misappropriation theory,the district court reluctantly declared that it was bound by this court imposition of liability on virtually identical facts in united states libera,cir.libera dealt with the criminal liability of individuals who,like defendant here,received copies of the same inside wall street column in business week magazine in violation of business week confidentiality policy and traded on the information.see id.at.in libera,the information was passed to the defendants after it had been misappropriated by an employee of business week printer.id.
here,employees of entities further down the chain of distribution were the misappropriators.according to the evidence at trial,after being printed,business week magazine is sent to a national distributor of magazines,curtis circulation company curtis.see united states falcone,d.curtis sells the magazine to various wholesalers,including hudson news.gregory salvage,a employee of hudson news,arranged for a subordinate to fax copies of the inside wall street to the close of the stock market on thursdays and prior to the public release of the magazine later that smath,a stockbroker at renaissance securities and salvage neighbor.smath himself traded based on this information and also passed it on to defendant,who likewise traded in reliance thereon.
on appeal,defendant argues that under the misappropriation theory as defined in,it is not sufficient for the purposes of section b liability that a misappropriation ultimately results in securities trading.instead,he argues,the misappropriation in breach of a duty must itself have a certain nexus with securities trading that is lacking in the scenario at issue in libera and the instant case.defendant further argues that even assuming libera applies here,there was insufficient evidence to convict him of securities fraud or conspiracy to commit securities fraud.although the first contention merits some discussion,we ultimately reject both arguments.
discussion 
i.the law of insider tradinga.relevant statutory authority 
section b of the securities exchange act of is violated when any manipulative or deceptive device is used,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.b.pursuant to this section,the securities and exchange commission has adopted rule,which provides in relevant part that 
it shall be unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,
b to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,or 
c to engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
b.the traditional theory 
under traditional insider trading theory,section b is violated when a corporate insider,such as an officer of the corporation,trades in the securities of his corporation on the basis of material,information,at.such trading constitutes deception under section b because a relationship of trust and confidence exists between the shareholders of a corporation and those insiders who have obtained confidential information by reason of their position with that corporation,and this relationship gives rise to a duty to disclose or to abstain from trading because of the necessity of preventing a corporate insider from tak ing unfair advantage of uninformed stockholders.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted alterations in original.although the requirement that the deception be in connection with the purchase or sale of a security is not often discussed in traditional insider trading case law,the connection is almost the duty of disclosure being breached is to persons with whom the insider is engaging in securities transactions,and the insider breaches that duty when he or she engages in the securities transaction without disclosure.
in dirks sec,d,the supreme court held that under the traditional theory,it is equally a section b violation if,under certain circumstances,the corporate officer does not actually trade but instead tips a corporate outsider,a friend or a family member with the information for the purpose of having the outsider trade.see id.at.in deciding dirks,the first issue for the supreme court was what duty of disclosure,if any,a corporate outsider was subject to,such that his or her trading in violation of that duty would constitute deception under section b.the court emphasized that there was no general duty of disclosure between all those who invest in the stock market,id.at,and that,unlike corporate officers,corporate outsiders have no relationship with the corporation shareholders from which any duty to disclose could arise,id.at.while the court ultimately determined that tippees could nevertheless still be in violation of section b,it held that the circumstances under which that could occur were limited 
a tippee assumes a fiduciary duty to the shareholders of a corporation not to trade on material nonpublic information only when the insider has breached his fiduciary duty to the shareholders by disclosing the information to the tippee and the tippee knows or should know that there has been a breach.
the second issue for the court in dirks was to determine when an insider duty was breached where the insider had not himself or herself traded based on material information but had simply given outsiders such information.in dirks,the corporate insider had given the defendant,an officer of a securities,information that a massive fraud was occurring at the corporation,in an attempt to expose that fraud.id.at.the defendant informed others of what he had been told and certain investors sold their securities in the corporation.id.at.the question was whether the insider actions constituted a breach of the insider fiduciary duty to shareholders because,notwithstanding the insider benign motives,trading in the corporation securities without disclosure had still resulted from his provision of information to the defendant.the court held that no such breach had occurred.id.at.
to constitute a violation of section b,according to dirks,the test is whether the insider personally will benefit,directly or indirectly,from his disclosure.absent some personal gain,there has been no breach of duty to stockholders.and absent a breach by the insider,there is no derivative breach.id.at.thus,the tippee could not be held liable for a federal securities fraud violation simply because he or she in fact traded in securities or helped others to trade in securities based on the material nonpublic information.rather,the key factor was the tipper intent in providing the information.
c.the misappropriation theory 
the theory in the second circuit 
the second circuit was the first to recognize a different theory of insider trading the misappropriation theory.see generally united states chestman,cir en banc setting forth history of application of misappropriation theory in this circuit.under the misappropriation theory,
a person violates rule when he misappropriates material nonpublic information in breach of a fiduciary duty or similar relationship of trust and confidence and uses that information in a securities transaction.in contrast to the traditional theory,the misappropriation theory does not require that the buyer or seller of securities be defrauded.focusing on the language fraud or deceit upon any person emphasis added,we have held that the predicate act of fraud may be perpetrated on the source of the nonpublic information,even though the source may be unaffiliated with the buyer or seller of securities.
chestman,at.
under this theory,this court prior to chestman upheld the securities fraud convictions of a newspaper reporter,a former newspaper clerk,and a stockbroker who traded securities based on misappropriated information similar to the type of information at issue in this case the timing and content of the wall street journal confidential schedule of columns of acknowledged influence in the securities market.united states carpenter,cir.while under the misappropriation theory,the duty that had been breached no longer was a duty owed to a party to a securities transaction,we found in carpenter that such deception still satisfied the in connection with standard because 
the use of the misappropriated information for the financial benefit of the defendants and to the financial detriment of those investors with whom appellants traded supports the conclusion that appellants fraud was in connection with the purchase or sale of securities under section b and rule.we can deduce reasonably that those who purchased or sold securities without the misappropriated information would not have purchased or sold,at least at the transaction prices,had they had the benefit of that information.certainly the protection of investors is the major purpose of section b and rule.further,investors are endangered equally by fraud by misappropriators as by fraud by insiders.
id.at internal citations omitted.rejecting the argument made by the carpenter dissent that the in connection with requirement was not met because no information had been misappropriated,we added that the deception was in connection with securities transactions because the misappropriated information regarding the timing and content of certain journal columns had no value whatsoever to appellants except in connection with their subsequent purchase s and sales of securities.id.at quoting sec materia,cir.furthermore,we pointed out that t he sole purpose of the scheme was to purchase and sell securities,id.quoting united states newman,cir,and thereby virtually to reap instant profits in the stock market,id.quoting materia,at 
we found ourselves applying the theory in the context of information obtained from a publication again in in united states libera,cir.libera involved the same magazine at issue in this a similar scheme involving the misappropriation of the inside wall street column.id.at.however,unlike in carpenter,in libera,the misappropriators of the information did not have others trade on their on the misappropriated information.id.the initial misappropriator in libera,in fact,did not receive any financial payment at all for advance copies of the column eventually,when that individual was unable to continue,his replacement was paid and later per column.id.
the main issue in libera was whether,in order to find the tippees liable under section b pursuant to the misappropriation theory,the tipper must have known that his breach of a fiduciary obligation would lead to the tippee trading on the misappropriated information.id.at.under the traditional theory of insider trading,tippee liability was in fact premised on the intent of the tipper to provide the tippee with information that the tippee could use to make money in securities trading.see dirks,at.holding that tippees and tippers would be liable where there existed a relationship between the insider and the recipient that suggests a quid pro quo from the latter,or an intention to benefit the particular recipient.the elements of fiduciary duty and exploitation of nonpublic information also exist when an insider makes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend.libera held,however,that tippee liability under the misappropriation theory did not require this type of knowledge by the tipper,and that 
t he tipper knowledge that he or she was breaching a duty to the owner of confidential information suffices to establish the tipper expectation that the breach will lead to some kind of a misuse of the information.this is so because it may be presumed that the tippee interest in the information is,in contemporary jargon,not for nothing.to allow a tippee to escape liability solely because the government can not prove to a jury satisfaction that the tipper knew exactly what misuse would result from the tipper wrongdoing would not fulfill the purpose of the misappropriation theory,which is to protect property rights in information.
thus,libera held that the only required elements for tippee liability were i a breach by the tipper of a duty owed to the owner of the nonpublic information and ii the tippee knowledge that the tipper had breached the duty.id.at.other than in its recitation of the standard set forth in rule,libera made no mention of the in connection with requirement.
the supreme court decision in 
in,the supreme court resolved an conflict regarding the validity of the misappropriation theory and held that a lawyer who traded in the shares of the target company of a proposed acquisition based on information misappropriated from his law firm and its client,the company seeking to acquire the target,violated section b,at.the court agreed that section b deception requirement could be predicated on a fraud on the source of confidential information instead of a buyer or seller of securities,but it did not fully endorse the broad rationale this circuit provided in carpenter for why the deception of a source of confidential information was in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.
as defined by the supreme court in,the misappropriation theory holds that a section b violation occurs when an individual misappropriates confidential information for securities trading purposes,in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information.id.at.under,the deception requirement of section b is satisfied by the misappropriator feigning fidelity to the source of the confidential information.id.at.according to the court,a company confidential information qualifies as property to which the company has a right of exclusive use and t he undisclosed misappropriation of such information,in violation of a fiduciary duty constitutes fraud akin to fraudulent
