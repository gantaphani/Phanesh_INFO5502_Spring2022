in this nationwide class action,million present and former policyholders of state farm mutual automobile insurance company state farm contend that during the class period,to,state farm breached a duty to pay billions of dollars in dividends and,as a result,created an excessive surplus.
state farm moved for summary judgment based on the business judgment rule,asserting that the board of directors board had made its financial decisions on an informed basis,in good faith,and with the honest belief that it was acting in the company best interests.plaintiffs countered that the rule was not applicable because the board did not adequately consider whether to declare dividends but merely management recommendations the board was not sufficiently informed about dividends the board dividend practices were fraudulent or dishonest and the board dividend decisions were totally without merit.
the trial court granted summary judgment,concluding that the business judgment rule applied as a matter of law.we agree.first,the board could properly rely on information from state farm management and actuarial department in its deliberative process.second,the board was sufficiently written financial materials,oral presentations from company officers,and discussions during board make independent decisions about dividends.third,state farm did not engage in fraud by failing to indicate in its insurance policies and bylaws that it paid dividends from certain sources of income and did not sell invested assets for that purpose.it had no duty to disclose that type of information.nor was there anything fraudulent about the financial information annually sent to policyholders it was based on audited reports prepared by independent accountants in compliance with state regulatory principles of accounting.fourth,in applying the business judgment rule,a court does not consider the merits of a board decisions.rather,the court focuses on the decisionmaking process to ensure that it was not tainted by fraud,oppression,illegality,or the like.thus,plaintiffs attack on the merits of state farm decisions is of no import.we accordingly affirm.
background 
on june,plaintiffs filed this class action against state farm,alleging that,as policyholders,they were entitled to dividends under their insurance policies and that state farm had improperly withheld dividends in order to increase its surplus.the term surplus means an insurance company assets less liabilities.put another way,surplus is the capital available to back up an insurer obligations under its policies.
plaintiffs alleged that state farm breached its duty to policyholders by amassing surpluses far in excess of what state farm reasonably needed to meet its present and future insurance obligations,thereby reducing dividends.as relief,plaintiffs requested damages,attorney fees,and an injunction barring state farm from pursuing the practices that had reduced the dividend payments.
the complaint set forth six causes of action breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,fraud,negligent misrepresentation,violation of the consumers legal remedies act,and violation of the unfair competition law bus.
state farm demurred to the complaint on the ground that the payment of dividends was subject to the discretion and business judgment of the board.plaintiffs filed opposition.by order dated october,the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the cause of action under the consumers legal remedies act.on the remaining claims,the trial court sustained the demurrer with days leave to amend.the trial court also instructed plaintiffs to attach their insurance policies to the amended complaint.
on october,plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint,realleging the five causes of action that survived the demurrer.in essence,plaintiffs alleged that state farm had overstated its losses and understated its income so as to reduce the dividends to policyholders.plaintiffs attached their policies,as instructed.
between and,the policies in most states provided,t he first insured named in the declarations is entitled to share in the earnings and savings of the company in accordance with the dividends declared by the board of directors on this and like policies.after,the policies in most states read,t he first insured named in the declarations is entitled to receive dividends the board of directors in its discretion may declare in accordance with reasonable classifications and groupings of policyholders established by such board.italics added.
further,in a newsletter sent to california policyholders in,state farm described dividends as a return of part of your premium because claim costs were less than anticipated.the newsletter also stated that o ur goal as a mutual company is to put your interests first.
throughout the class period,the bylaws of state farm provided subject to the provisions of law regarding return of excess premiums,the board of directors may authorize from time to time such refunds or credits to policyholders from the savings and gains of the corporation and upon such terms and conditions and in such amounts or percentage as may,in their judgment,be proper,just and equitable.
demurrer to amended complaint 
on november,state farm filed a demurrer to the first amended complaint,arguing again that the board had properly exercised its discretion and business judgment with respect to declaring dividends.plaintiffs filed opposition.
in january,the trial court,commissioner bruce mitchell presiding,sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to all causes of action and entered a judgment of dismissal.plaintiffs filed a timely appeal.
on january,division one of this district filed a split decision,reversing the judgment of dismissal and reinstating the claims for breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and violation of the unfair competition law hill state farm mutual automobile insurance nonpub.opn.state farm i.the court concluded that plaintiffs had adequately pleaded their claims under california law and that an accounting would be an appropriate remedy if plaintiffs prevailed on the contract or covenant claim.
in rejecting state farm contention that the action was barred by the business judgment rule,the court distinguished this division decision in barnes state farm mut.auto.ins.th,d barnes.the court explained that,in barnes,a policyholder sued state farm auto,seeking to compel it to distribute its unjustifiably large surplus back to its policyholders.id.at,d.the plaintiff alleged that state farm had accumulated a surplus fund consisting of premiums and investment income in excess of billion and that such conduct by state farm amounted to an unjustified hoarding of surplus funds,for no legitimate business purpose and all to the detriment of policyholders who otherwise could have received either reduced premium rates or substantial dividends.ibid.
in barnes,the trial court sustained state farm auto demurrer without leave to amend.the court of appeal affirmed,stating 
whether a private corporation should declare and pay a dividend,or make a distribution of its assets is a matter committed to the sound business judgment of the corporation board of directors.it is thus the general rule that a court will not interfere with a corporate decision to withhold dividends in the absence of a showing of abuse of the wide discretion which the courts grant to corporate directors.
as one california court recently summarized the rule,the common law business judgment rule refers to a judicial policy of deference to the business judgment of corporate directors in the exercise of their broad discretion in making corporate decisions.the business judgment rule is premised on the notion that those to whom the management of the corporation has been entrusted,and not the courts,are best able to judge whether a particular act or transaction is one which is helpful to the conduct of corporate affairs or expedient for the attainment of corporate purposes,and establishes a presumption that directors decisions are based on sound business judgment 
in barnes,the plaintiff,although attempting to plead around this rule,has failed to allege facts showing that the directors decision regarding the accumulation of state farm surplus was not made in good faith or in what the directors believed to be the best interests of the corporation.he has alleged no facts demonstrating fraud,oppression,corruption or conflict of interest by the directors.h e appears to rest his claim upon the singular proposition that state farm surplus and dividend policy differs significantly from an industry average.this is clearly insufficient to permit a court to interfere in the management of an apparently successful corporate enterprise.barnes,supra,th at,d,citations and fns.omitted.more is needed to establish an exception to the business judgment rule than conclusory allegations of improper motives and conflict of interest.state farm i,supra,typed opn.at.
after quoting from barnes,division one continued in the present case,plaintiffs alleged that state farm decisions with respect to dividends were not made in good faith p laintiffs alleged that the board of directors had improperly withheld dividends by overstating underwriting losses,understating investment income,excluding from operating return the investment income derived from state farm surplus,and falsely claiming that the surplus had to cover the obligations of state farm affiliated insurance companies.
thus,far from relying on conclusory allegations,plaintiffs point to several objective criteria in challenging state farm alleged wrongful conduct.this is not a case where the policyholders merely rest their claim upon the singular proposition that state farm surplus and dividend policy differs significantly from an industry average.barnes,supra,th at,d.moreover,under state farm overly broad interpretation of the business judgment rule,virtually every decision of the board of directors,regardless of the circumstances,would enjoy absolute immunity.
we are unpersuaded by state farm dire prediction that plaintiffs claims,if allowed to stand,will put the courts in charge of the boardroom.courts are not empowered to substitute their judgment for that of the board.a determination of liability would have to take into account that directors should be given wide latitude in their handling of corporate affairs because the hindsight of the judicial process is an imperfect device for evaluating business decisions.similarly,any determination of liability would have to take into consideration that the business judgment rule afford s directors broad discretion in making corporate decisions and allow s these decisions to be made without judicial t he business judgment rule provides ample protection for the board lawful decisions.
we emphasize that this appeal raises a narrow question at the pleading stage did plaintiffs sufficiently allege that state farm directors engaged in bad faith conduct in deciding to declare dividends or in setting the amount thereof the answer is yes.the first amended complaint alleged that the board improperly manipulated objective criteria for example,general expenses,underwriting losses,investment costs in order to overstate losses and understate income,all for the purpose of reducing dividends to policyholders.we can not say that the business judgment rule bars plaintiffs claims at this point in the litigation.state farm i,supra,typed opn.at,citation omitted.
on june,plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint,realleging the same claims and material allegations.
after the pleading stage,the trial court certified a nationwide class of million present and former state farm policyholders,million of whom reside in california,for the period through.
petition for a writ of mandate 
on march,state farm filed a motion in the trial court to resolve a conflict of laws issue whether the substantive law of the company was the suit was plaintiffs claims.state farm argued that illinois law applied because corporate decisions about dividends involved the internal affairs of the company,and,consequently,the law of the state of incorporation should govern.plaintiffs asserted that california law controlled.by statement of decision filed on may,the trial court,judge charles mccoy presiding,ruled that california law applied because a breach of contract claim is not subject to the business judgment rule.
state farm promptly filed a petition for a writ of mandate with this district.the petition was assigned to division one,which issued an order to show cause.after briefing and oral argument,the court vacated the trial court decision and held,in a published opinion,that substantive illinois law applied,including the illinois business judgment rule state farm mutual automobile ins.superior court th,d state farm ii.the court said every state in this country has enacted laws regulating corporate governance.by prohibiting certain transactions,and regulating others,such laws necessarily affect certain aspects of interstate commerce this beneficial free market system depends at its core upon the fact that a in the rarest organized under,and governed by,the law of a single jurisdiction,traditionally the corporate law of the state of its incorporation.
the internal affairs doctrine is a conflict of laws principle which recognizes that only one state should have the authority to regulate a corporation internal peculiar to the relationships among or between the corporation and its current officers,directors,and otherwise a corporation could be faced with conflicting demands.states normally look to the state of a business incorporation for the law that provides the relevant corporate governance general standard of care.
internal affairs include steps taken in the course of the original incorporation,the adoption of,the issuance of corporate shares,the holding of directors and shareholders meetings,the declaration and payment of dividends and other distributions,charter amendments,mergers,consolidations,and reorganizations,the reclassification of shares and the purchase and redemption by the corporation of outstanding shares of its own stock.
it would be impractical to have matters which involve a corporation organic structure or internal administration governed by different laws.it would be impractical,for example,if an issuance of shares,a payment of dividends,a charter amendment,or a consolidation or reorganization were to be held valid in one state and invalid in another state farm ii,supra,th at,d.
in addressing the trial court reasoning,the court also stated in the present case,state farm policyholders challenge the board of directors decision whether to declare dividends.the policyholders rely on the language in their policies,a newsletter,and the bylaws,contending they have a contractual right to dividends that must be honored in accordance with their reasonable expectations 
t he policyholders argue that their right to dividends should be adjudicated under contract law,the business judgment rule notwithstanding.and the trial court commented,state farm is not going to be able to use corporation law as a trump over that contractual obligation.but the business judgment rule,which accords deference to the decisions of the board of directors,is reflected in the language of state farm policies,newsletter,and bylaws.the rule is,in essence,written into the contract.
simply put,the policyholders challenge a decision of the board of directors that falls within state farm internal affairs.the causes of action in the complaint,though labeled in common of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair matters peculiar to the relationships among or between the corporation and its current officers,directors,and shareholders as to those matters,the law of state farm place of incorporation,illinois,applies,not california law on contracts 
in other words,t he law applicable to a contract dispute does not control claims relating to the internal affairs of the corporation.t he plaintiff contention that this suit,being one on a contract,does not involve the internal affairs of a foreign corporation is without merit.state farm ii,supra,th at,d,citations omitted.
the court also discussed the business judgment rule under illinois law.the business judgment rule is a presumption that directors of a corporation make business decisions on an informed basis,in good faith,and with the honest belief that the course taken was in the best interests of the corporation like most rebuttable presumptions,it arises by operation of law however,the plaintiff may rebut the presumption by presenting evidence that the director s acted fraudulently,illegally,or without becoming sufficiently informed to make an independent business decision.the burden is on the party challenging the decision to present facts rebutting the presumption.state farm ii,supra,th at,d.another illinois court had put it this way the decision concerning the declaration of a dividend where a legal dividend fund is available rests within the sole discretion of the board of directors.courts are reluctant to interfere with the exercise of the directors business judgment unless the withholding is fraudulent,oppressive or totally without merit.ibid.and a third court had stated the business judgment rule protected the directors decision absent a showing of fraud,oppression,or dishonest conduct.id.at,d,italics omitted.
the court summarized these various formulations,concluding a bsent one of the exceptions to the business judgment,oppression,dishonesty,total lack of merit,illegality,or a failure of the board of directors to become sufficiently informed to make an independent corporation is not liable for a lack of dividends.state farm ii,supra,th at,d.
further,as to plaintiffs causes of action,the court pointed out the differences between the covenant of good faith and fair dealing under california and illinois law.in illinois,the covenant provides a cause of action,sounding in tort,only where an insurer breaches a duty to settle a third party claim against the insured.state farm ii,supra,th at,d.with that exception,the covenant does not support an independent cause of action or permit the recovery of tort damages.id.at,d.rather,it is a rule of construction used to determine the intent of the parties where a contract is susceptible to two conflicting constructions.w here an instrument is susceptible of two conflicting constructions,one which imputes bad faith to one of the parties and the other does not,the latter construction should be adopted.id.at,d accord,fox heimann d,energy consult.covenant home d,mary hosp.hpo d,perez citicorp,d.
and even where the covenant applies,p arties are entitled to enforce the terms of negotiated contracts to the letter without being mulcted for lack of good faith.express covenants abrogate the operation of implied covenants so courts will not permit implied agreements to overrule or modify the express contract of the parties.state farm ii,supra,th at,d.
finally,the court discussed the nature of a mutual,as opposed to a stock,insurance company.state farm is a mutual insurance corporation.as such,it issues no capital stock and is cooperatively owned by its policyholders,who are both the insurers and the insureds 
mutual insurance companies are organized,maintained,and operated solely for the benefit of their policyholders such companies do not generate traditional entrepreneurial profits,but rather seek to meet their obligations at the lowest possible cost to the policyholders who,by paying premiums,provide the companies exclusive source of capital.
policyholders in mutual companies are denominated members of the company their ownership rights in the company are their membership interests.members of mutual insurance companies have many of the same rights as stockholders in corporations,including the right to vote and the right to residual surplus upon liquidation.
state farm does not offer insurance policies as investment opportunities but instead provides policyholders with protection against loss.in contrast,a stock insurance company seeks to earn a profit for the benefit of its stockholders,who may or may not be policyholders 
m utual insurers have greater difficulty than stock insurers in raising capital to fund growth,and hence,must rely to a greater extent on accumulated surplus and income from new members to support growth m anagers of mutual insurers tend to exercise more discretion which tends to favor stability over greater risk.state farm ii,supra,th at,d,citations omitted.
after the court granted state farm petition,the case returned to the trial court for additional proceedings.
motion for summary judgment 
in october,state farm filed a motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,for summary adjudication as to each cause of action.state farm argued that the business judgment rule,as applied in illinois,barred the action in its entirety.in support of summary adjudication,state farm asserted the contract claim failed because the insurance policies and bylaws did not accord plaintiffs an enforceable right to dividends at any time or in any amount a separate cause of action for breach of the covenant did not exist under illinois law and the unfair competition law did not apply because it was a california statute.state farm submitted declarations and exhibits in support of the motion.plaintiffs filed evidence in opposition.
state farm evidence 
state farm based the price of its automobile part on actuarial data obtained from each state.its underwriting goal was to sell policies at an affordable price so that total premiums would equal total losses and expenses.thus,the company attempted to break even on the sale of insurance.at the same time,state farm maintained a surplus on which it earned investment income.the company would use that income in the event of an operating loss.during the class period,state farm generally paid dividends if its underwriting results were better than expected.the company did not sell assets from the surplus to pay dividends.rather,the assets provided a source of funds for catastrophes and allowed the company to charge low premiums and reduce rates.
in,when the class period began,the board consisted of members.by,the last year of the period,the board had grown to members.the board met march,july,september,and state farm headquarters in bloomington,illinois.those meetings consisted of a series of presentations over a period.state farm officers,some of whom were also directors,made oral reports on state farm finances,operations,investment activities,pension funds,and audit results.the presentations led to discussions among the directors on those topics.
during the year,the directors received numerous written financial reports,such as monthly financial statements around eight pages in length,showing a breakdown of assets,liabilities,and surplus quarterly operations reviews around eight pages,which set forth underwriting profits and losses,and investment activity by category quarterly statements around pages,providing detailed information about the company financial condition,including data about increases and decreases in surplus an annual report on audits of financial basis around pages,prepared by coopers lybrand audited reports,listing subcategories and the corresponding amount of income,losses,and surplus and the annual statement of varying lengths,up to pages,consisting of multiple schedules of specific information on the company overall financial condition,including surplus.
the monthly and quarterly financial statements,together with the quarterly operations reviews,enabled the directors to track profits,losses,and the size of the surplus on a continuing basis.state farm invested its surplus,primarily in stocks,bonds,and real estate.
the surplus consisted of five categories catastrophe,which provided a source of protection in the event of a catastrophe a minimum guaranty fund required by statute unassigned funds,which represented the unassigned retained earnings of the company unrealized capital gains and funds to protect the policyholders of state farm subsidiaries also called affiliates,namely,state farm life insurance company and state farm fire and casualty company.
vincent trosino held a managerial position with state farm beginning in,becoming a member of the board in.from to,he was,chief administrative officer from to,he was executive,chief operating officer and in,he assumed the position of president,chief operating officer.trosino testified that the board quarterly meetings involved interactive presentations by several officers,including himself.these discussions,he said,combined with the written materials provided to the board,allowed the directors to gain a good,working understanding of the essential aspects of state farm operations and finances,including its surplus position and how that position was evolving.
since,trosino has served as an in considering and determining the level of state farm surplus,and in considering,recommending,and voting upon whether to declare a dividend as well as the amount of the dividend.he periodically reviewed state farm financial performance and surplus level with the company actuarial department.those reviews involved constant monitoring of the surplus,profits and losses,and income from all sources,including investments,and examining whether conditions warranted a dividend and,if so,the amount.
according to trosino ultimately,the appropriate range of surplus is not a matter of a single rating or ratio,but rather is a matter of judgment that is exercised by senior officers and our board of directors,and i have participated directly in making these judgments during the period to the present the surplus supported state farm ability to meet the needs of its policyholders,remain competitive,charge lower premiums,and support the reasonable growth of its business during discussions among the board of directors,we concluded that retaining capital gains as additions to our surplus was the wisest course of action and in the best interests of our policyholders.this growth in surplus added to our ability to provide financial protection to our policyholders and,in addition,added to our ability to reduce rates or lessen the size of rate increases to our policyholders.had we determined to liquidate any significant portion of our surplus in order to pay a dividend,it would have reduced both our financial strength and our ability to reduce or lessen the size of increases of rates and premiums state farm typically did not liquidate investments except in catastrophe situations.the board was opposed to dividending out,or selling,an asset in the surplus to pay a dividend.on the other hand,state farm had no problem using money generated by investments in the surplus,for example,maturing treasuries.that money was used to offset the cost of operations,such as an underwriting loss.
trosino recommended that the board declare dividends primarily when state farm underwriting return exceeded its underwriting targets for the previous months or so.by the same token,a dividend was usually not recommended if the company had greater than anticipated losses on its policies.trosino recommendations were based on a analysis.under this method,policyholders received a dividend if they lived in a state that produced higher income than the target underwriting return for that state.if policyholders did not live in such a state,they did not receive a dividend.in making a dividend decision,the board used a worksheet that showed the pertinent underwriting statistics for each state.
trosino also considered the financial effect of natural disasters.for instance,he did not recommend dividends in,or light of hurricane hugo,other catastrophes,and the uncertain situation after the northridge earthquake during those times,the level and cost of auto insurance claims rose significantly,and underwriting losses were much greater than expected.
this approach allowed the surplus to grow during the class through investment million in to billion in,as indicated in the audited reports.according to state farm and plaintiffs expert witnesses,the board declared dividends in years of the class period,totaling billion,as shown below.
in making dividend recommendations to the board,trosino relied in part upon input from the actuarial department.gregory hayward,an assistant and actuary who has been with state farm since,described the work of the company actuaries.they conducted an ongoing actuarial analysis of the financial position and needs of state farm for use by senior management in assessing the company surplus,rates,and dividends.hayward,who heads the research unit of the actuarial department,routinely monitored and analyzed state farm surplus levels and reviewed his findings with at least one key officer and member of the board.
the actuarial department maintained a close watch on gains and losses,expenses,and state farm overall financial condition and had an ongoing dialogue with management as to whether a dividend or rate reduction should be recommended to the board.in the years when a dividend was not recommended,state farm had usually suffered greater than anticipated losses on its policies.for instance,a dividend was not recommended in or because state farm had suffered underwriting losses in the preceding years billion in and billion in.in the latter half of,underwriting results improved,yielding a profit of million for the year.as a result,a dividend was declared in.
state farm did not have a practice or rule against declaring dividends in the event of an underwriting loss.in hayward words,we took into consideration all of the financial aspects of the company.he pointed out that state farm also earned investment income on non surplus items such as reserves unearned premium reserves and loss expense reserves.if a dividend was declared notwithstanding an underwriting loss,state farm would still use underwriting results,as opposed to investment income,to choose the states in which to pay dividends.
as one director testified,the board considered at least three factors in deciding whether to declare a dividend underwriting results,net income before taxes including interest and dividends earned on the surplus,and the net worth of the company.there were several,and which state farm declared a dividend even though it had incurred an underwriting loss that year and the preceding year.
roger joslin was a principal financial officer of state farm since and a director since,continuing in both capacities until his retirement in.he also participated in considering,recommending,and voting for dividends.in july,joslin,then the company treasurer,drafted a memorandum to file,stating the board of directors has broad discretion concerning declaration of dividends to policyholders.nothing,including past practices,dictates how dividends shall be apportioned.as noted by joslin,when a dividend recommendation was made to the board,the directors gave it due consideration.
wendy gramm,a director from to,who had served as chair of the united states commodity futures trading commission,recalled that i or others on the board did ask a lot of questions of state farm management on their dividend proposals.robert jaedicke,a director from to,and a former dean of the stanford graduate school of business,referred to the discussion of dividends as an interactive session that was sometimes rather lengthy possibly half of the morning meeting with continual discussion and questions from board members and comments from officers.
james wilson,a professor at the university of california at los angeles and a member of the board beginning in,remembered a meeting in which management proposed a dividend.the board voted in favor of a dividend after what he called considerable discussion.asked at his deposition about that part of the meeting,wilson said,any time we discuss the financial conditions of the company,there is an extended discussion.
if trosino or another officer recommended a dividend,then the board declared one.if such a recommendation was not made,a dividend was not declared.but a dividend might still have been discussed.trosino explained that if he recommended a rate cut,for example,directors sometimes asked questions about declaring a dividend.the board would discuss the issue and eventually conclude that it wanted to keep rates as competitive and low as possible and would approve the recommended rate cut.director gramm testified that the board discussed rate cuts in terms of competition and providing a good value to policyholders.to gramm best recollection,the board consistently approved what the officers recommended,be it a dividend or a rate cut.some board members would ask questions about the particular recommendation,but they were ultimately satisfied with the answers they received.as gramm said,b y the time we got to actual votes,people on the board were comfortable with the proposals so that,in fact,we operated more like a collegial body.but she did not recall any occasion when management contemplated a rate cut in lieu of payment of dividends.
in,hayward completed an actuarial report for trosino and the board,analyzing the size of the surplus as of the end of the previous year.he concluded that the surplus is strong and provide s our policyholders with superior protection and value at very competitive prices.the risk of ruin,while not zero,is acceptably low.the surplus is within a range of reasonableness.the funds are neither inadequate nor excessive giving due consideration to the extraordinary and unique risks and best interests of our policyholders.the report was based on three different mathematical methods or models,all described in detail.although hayward finished the report after the class period,he testified while in prior years the actuarial department had not prepared formal reports in this format,the report illustrates the type of surplus analysis that we performed going back many years in the years prior to,state farm actuarial department analyzed the surplus using similar methods and techniques.each year,the actuarial department advised executive management about the level and adequacy of surplus t he size of the surplus was reasonable and not excessive based upon the ongoing analysis of surplus,the actuarial department has never concluded that the surplus was excessive or too high.
the actuarial department did not believe it would be prudent to sell any assets in the surplus for purposes of declaring a dividend.to do so,the actuaries thought,would have eliminated assets as a source of future growth and income,and reduced the ability to charge stable and low insurance rates and premiums.the strength of the surplus also permitted state farm to implement rate approximately in the second half of and continuing through.in,state farm reduced its target underwriting return from zero percent to minus five percent in all states,due in large part to the increase in the surplus.the company made an intentional decision to sell policies at a loss,relying on investment income to remain profitable.from through,state farm implemented rate reductions totaling nearly billion.
in his declaration,hayward described how the insurance industry uses ratios as shorthand expressions to reflect the amount of surplus that exists in relation to an insurer premium.a surplus to premium ratio of to means that for every dollar of surplus the numerator,there are two dollars of premium the denominator.this is a ratio of and is commonly referred to as a surplus level of cents.but the risk exposure from a specific policy vastly exceeds the premium and can vary greatly from one type of policy to the next.for instance,an auto policy with a premium of might have a potential exposure of viewed in isolation,that policy would require more than cents for each dollar of premium.thus,the insurance industry does not rely solely on ratios to indicate the appropriate level of surplus.this is perhaps most evident in state farm filings with state regulators in which it represented that a ratio is prudent.that representation merely indicated the minimum amount of surplus needed for ratemaking purposes.state regulators are concerned with preventing insolvency and focus on whether the surplus is adequate,not whether it is excessive they consider adequate and any ratio below to be a sign of potential insolvency.in addition,state farm disclosed its actual total surplus to regulators and was never informed that the ratio is a maximum or that a dividend was warranted.hayward declaration is consistent with the testimony that state farm chief actuary,thomas morrill,gave before congress in.
state farm did not adopt a fixed ratio for evaluating its surplus,but it did address the subject of ratios more than once in writing.on october,dale nelson,a state farm actuary,sent a draft memorandum to alan curry,a and actuary,stating that the increase in the surplus has caused some to question whether state farm has surplus surplus.after providing a analysis of that issue,nelson concluded state farm finds itself in a position where it must stand on its is no one else with the financial resources to back it up.for anyone to argue,then,that state farm has too much surplus is to ignore present day realities.in an office memo to curry,dated march,nelson devoted eight pages to the same topic,noting that a ratio in the range is not overly conservative for state farm.a june memo,consisting of seven pages,asked,among other things,what is the right surplus ratio for state farm the answer,as set forth in the memo,was state farm does not have a specific target,which we believe is the appropriate ratio.it is our objective to be financially able to fulfill our obligations to policyholders.we believe that a surplus to premium ratio stronger than is needed to accomplish that objective.underscoring in original.
an august,actuarial report,by nelson and chief actuary gary grant,was given to the board.the report consisted of pages,three exhibits,and four appendices.after discussing several theories and factors,it concluded considering the multiplicity and magnitudes of risks involved,the surplus could never be too large for absolute assurance of all obligations to customers.however,there are practical limits on how large the surplus can become.competition is the major constraint.regulatory views and public perceptions are also important.considering all factors,it seems prudent for state farm to maintain at least cents of unassigned surplus for every dollar of premium written and for the fire company to have an additional cents of surplus available for catastrophe losses which exceed those provided in the rates.when circumstances allow,earnings should be used to build and maintain a higher level.a level as high as cents or even appears to be sustainable,strictly from the standpoint of its effect on insurance rates and state farm competitive position.as grant testified at his deposition,he did not reach any conclusions about an appropriate level of surplus.rather,he and nelson wrote the report so that management could evaluate the size of the surplus.
once a year,the directors received a financial review of selected property and casualty insurance groups prepared by state farm research department.a portion of the report,entitled analysis of underwriting ratios,compared and discussed the ratios of several insurance companies.from to only years covered in the or more of state farm competitors had a higher ratio than state farm.for instance,in,three of state farm eleven,safeco,and united services automobile higher ratios.
according to state farm,its ratios for to ranged from to in,the ratio was in,and in.plaintiffs calculations for to indicated that state farm ratios ranged from to in,the ratio was in,and in.the industry average during the class period ranged from to.
director joslin,who served as treasurer for many years,confirmed that at many board meetings,there were discussions regarding the appropriate level of surplus.at each meeting,joslin or a member of his staff reviewed the company surplus position.at no time did the board conclude that the surplus exceeded reasonable limits.
as director jaedicke stated a t every meeting we had a financial report which included the increases in surplus,as well as the increases in the various categories of the surplus.and that was always part of the discussion,part of the consideration at every meeting that i could recall.jaedicke did not recall anybody on the board of directors suggesting that somehow we ought to weaken our financial condition by monetizing some asset or set of assets and paying a dividend.during his deposition,jaedicke was asked about the surplus and replied i find it difficult to respond when you say did we ever discuss whether we had surplus surplus,which would indicate we felt we had too much i mplicit in our discussion of surplus would be whether you had too much.that was not where the focus was.nobody felt that way.he also commented usually,once a year we compared ourselves with the industry.t hat was another occasion on which the size of the surplus would be discussed.
stressing the importance of surplus,director wilson said that the board wanted to feel comfortable that should there be a series of catastrophes in the near future,we would have enough money to pay all of the policyholders.he added i think we were assured by the performance of the market that our net worth was going up.but,as you know,we carry unrealized capital gains on the books as a separate item,k nowing,as we do,as everyone should know,that the market is volatile.what is a gain one year could be a loss in the subsequent years.wilson acknowledged that t here could be in principle too much net worth went on to say,i n my judgment,as a director for the seven or so years that i been on the board,we never been in a position where we had too much.in fact,right now,i think we have too little.i think the net worth has been inadequate to prudently run state farm 
during director gramm eight years on the board,the directors did look at especially the ratios of all the time.and at some times the surplus was lower than others.gramm always felt more comfortable if the surplus to premium ratio was closer to not above one half,which was kind of a regulatory minimum.she did not recall state farm focus ing on one number that was an important ratio.at every quarterly meeting,the directors reviewed these numbers,and given the catastrophes and the hail storms and the hurricanes,gramm had concern about the size of the surplus.t hose ratios helped quantify that.she recalled that state farm ratios were not as favorable as some of its competitors ratios.the company did not view the ratios as binding or determinative in making decisions but regarded them as a reliable indicator of its financial condition.t he ratio itself is just one measure,gramm said.
actuary hayward testified that the surplus was also crucial in protecting the financial condition of state farm subsidiaries.as he put it,the subsidiaries add great risk to state farm.after several natural disasters,state farm recapitalized its wholly owned companies.for instance,it recapitalized state farm fire and casualty company after hurricane andrew in,provided surplus notes to its florida company after other hurricanes,and,after disasters in california,provided capital and surplus notes to a state farm company that writes homeowners insurance here.
when asked at his deposition why state farm did not sell any of the assets in the surplus to pay dividends,trosino said that state farm business model is to provide for our policyholders at the lowest cost possible a policy that will live up to our obligations to pay them and that we will have the wherewithal to do that come what may.and in doing so,as a mutual company where we only raise our capital through retained earnings or build our capital through retained earnings,we believe our surplus position has to be very,very strong.and that has served us well for over years and being the number one insurer of automobiles and having the highest retention rate of any large company,the model has proven to be successful with our policyholders.
finally,each year,state farm prepared a insert,entitled annual report to policyholders,which was included with the policyholders premium notices.the insert contained a short message from the chairman.for example,the insert began the past year was a good one for state farm mutual and its policyholder group.because of improved claims experience,we were able to reduce auto insurance rates in more than half the states state farm mutual customers in states and the district of columbia received more than million in policyholder dividends.the dividend reflects claims experience in those states the funds available for the overall financial protection of state farm mutual million policies in force increased last year,due significantly to favorable investment results.following the chairman message was a breakdown of state farm assets and liabilities.the financial information and terminology on the insert were taken from the audited reports,prepared by coopers lybrand in compliance with the accounting principles of the illinois department of insurance.
plaintiffs evidence 
in opposition to summary judgment,plaintiffs relied in part on state farm evidence,drawing different inferences to support their own arguments.they submitted additional evidence in an effort to challenge the frequency and amount of state farm dividends and the size of the surplus.plaintiffs also offered evidence to show that the board did not adequately consider whether to declare dividends and was not sufficiently informed to make dividend decisions.last,plaintiffs asserted that state farm misled policyholders about the use and size of the surplus.
the opposition papers contained several expert declarations,including one from a professor of corporate governance and one from an actuary.state farm filed objections to both declarations.as relevant,the specific evidence offered by plaintiffs will be described and discussed below.
trial court decision 
on august,the trial court,judge carolyn kuhl presiding,filed an order granting summary judgment and issued a opinion.the opinion discussed the business judgment rule and the evidence submitted by the parties.it concluded that state farm had made a prima facie showing that it was entitled to summary judgment and that plaintiffs had failed to offer evidence sufficient to establish an exception to the business judgment rule.further,the trial court sustained state farm objections to the declaration of plaintiffs actuarial expert,finding it inadmissible because the declarant was not knowledgeable about mutual,as opposed to stock,companies.
judgment was entered on august.plaintiffs filed a motion for new trial,which was denied.they appealed.
discussion 
plaintiffs contend they had a right to dividends under their insurance policies and bylaws.state farm counters that,as a matter of law,there was no promise to declare dividends,making this an open and shut case.it is not so simple.we conclude that plaintiffs did not have a right to any amount of dividends,but state farm was obligated to consider from time to time whether dividends should be declared.
in considering whether to declare dividends,state farm was bound by a duty of care,requiring the board to make decisions in a prudent manner.according to plaintiffs,state farm breached the duty of care by failing to act prudently in making dividend decisions.in response,state farm invokes the business judgment rule.plaintiffs argue that several exceptions to the rule apply.we reject plaintiff argument.
first,plaintiffs correctly point out that the business judgment rule does not protect the board if it makes no decision.yet the board does not have to decide every underlying issue related to dividends.directors may resort to delegation and reliance on officers and employees for information and recommendations.here,based on the financial reports and additional input received from others,the board adequately considered whether to declare dividends.the board deliberations complied with the business judgment rule.
second,plaintiffs properly state that if directors do not become sufficiently informed to make an independent decision about dividends,the company is not protected by the business judgment rule.but this exception is inapplicable here because,through numerous financial reports,including actuarial data,and discussions among the officers and directors,the board was sufficiently informed and acted independently.
third,plaintiffs contend that the board engaged in fraudulent and dishonest behavior in two respects first,by not explaining its dividend practices in its insurance policies and bylaws second,by providing policyholders with misleading information about the financial condition of the company.we disagree with the first contention because an insurer need not explain the specifics of its dividend practices,particularly where the board expressly retains discretion in the matter.the second contention is flawed because the information provided to the policyholders was taken from a report prepared by independent accountants in compliance with state regulatory principles of accounting.and in making these contentions,plaintiffs produced no evidence that the board acted with improper motives.
finally,plaintiffs argue that the board decisions were without merit.this is not,however,an exception to the business judgment rule.rather,the rule focuses on whether the process used to reach the decision was tainted by fraud,oppression,illegality,or the like.the very purpose of the rule is to preclude liability for a company mistakes,errors,and mere negligence.an exception that permitted consideration of the merits of a board decisions would swallow the rule.

summary judgment is appropriate if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.
a defendant seeking summary judgment has met the burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action once the defendant burden is met,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of fact exists as to that cause of action in reviewing the propriety of a summary judgment,the appellate court independently reviews the record that was before the trial court we must determine whether the facts as shown by the parties give rise to a triable issue of material fact in making this determination,the moving party affidavits are strictly construed while those of the opposing party are liberally construed.we accept as undisputed facts only those portions of the moving party evidence that are not contradicted by the opposing party evidence in other words,the facts set forth in the evidence of the party opposing summary judgment and the reasonable inferences therefrom must be accepted as true.buxbaum aetna life casualty th,d,italics added.

plaintiffs claim to dividends 
plaintiffs contend they had a contractual right to dividends under their policies and the bylaws,state farm breached the policies and bylaws by declaring inadequate dividends,and the business judgment rule does not apply to breach of contract claims.state farm argues that plaintiffs contract claim is without merit as a matter of law,and we need not decide if the business judgment rule applies.we conclude that neither of those positions is correct.plaintiffs did not have a right to any amount of dividends,but state farm did have a duty to make dividend decisions in a prudent manner.the business judgment rule is a defense to such a breach of duty claim.to the extent possible,we rely on illinois law in reaching our conclusion.see state farm ii,supra,th at,d.if,however,illinois courts have not addressed a specific point or if the decisions of other courts are of assistance,we rely on principles from other jurisdictions.

in ohio state life insurance company clark cir ohio state life,the charter of the insurance company provided,t he surplus of the company shall belong to the holders of policies on the mutual plan,and shall be apportioned and distributed on such equitable plan as the directors may provide.id.at.each insurance policy contained a provision to the effect that such policy is entitled to share in the divisible surplus of the company as apportioned or determined by the company.id.at.in affirming a declaratory judgment for the policyholders,the sixth circuit said general principles of corporate law control the rights of stockholders.the rights of policyholders are controlled by their policies of insurance and any applicable statutory provisions.id.at,italics added.the court concluded we construe the charter as giving to the policyholders on the mutual plan a vested contract right to the beneficial interest in the surplus id.at,italics added.
this ruling does not mean that the mutual plan policyholders are entitled to receive from the surplus as dividends on their policies more than is provided by the terms of the policies.as policyholders their rights are controlled by the provisions of their policies.under their policies their rights in the surplus are limited but,in addition to their rights under the policies they have certain proprietary rights in the surplus acquired by reason of the provisions of the charter.the cases relied upon by the insurer which construe policyholders rights under policy provisions are not controlling in a case where,as here,we are construing policyholders rights acquired through a provision of the corporate charter.ohio state life,supra,at,citations omitted.
yet ohio state life does not support the claims of state farm policyholders.as the sixth circuit made clear nor does our ruling mean that the mutual plan policyholders are entitled to have the surplus divided between them at the present time,free from the control of the directors.we are here dealing with the beneficial interest in the surplus,a proprietary right,not the right of possession and distribution.their claim is that they are entitled to have their beneficial interest in the surplus preserved in its present status for their benefit as mutual plan policyholders.ohio state life,supra,at,italics added.
in interpreting insurance policies under illinois insurance law,u nambiguous clauses must be enforced according to their terms suggestions of creative possibilities regarding the interpretation of a contract do not render it ambiguous,but rather,the relevant inquiry to determine if ambiguity exists is whether the contract provisions are subject to more than one reasonable interpretation controversy between the parties regarding the meaning of a provision also does not render the provision ambiguous when interpreting contract provisions,words are given their plain and ordinary meaning and courts should refrain from adopting interpretations resulting in distortions and creating ambiguities where none exist.young allstate ins.d.
here,state farm policies prior to entitled plaintiffs to share in the earnings and savings of the company in accordance with the dividends declared by the board of directors.in,that provision was modified to refer to the dividends that the board in its discretion may declare.during the class period,the bylaws remained unchanged,stating that the board may authorize from time to time such refunds or credits to policyholders from the savings and gains of the corporation and upon such terms and conditions and in such amounts or percentage as may,in their judgment,be proper,just and equitable.and a newsletter to policyholders stated,in connection with a distribution of dividends,our goal as a mutual company is to put your interests first.
in light of the foregoing case law,we do not construe state farm policies,bylaws,or newsletter as conferring a right upon plaintiffs to any amount of dividends at any particular time.nor did the policyholders have a right to dividends from any specific source,say,the assets in the surplus as opposed to underwriting income.yet the board had to duty to consider whether to declare dividends.it can not be said that the matter of paying a dividend is solely within the unreviewable discretion of the directors.while the stability and solvency of the mutual company is the prime consideration,the principle of mutuality would be a mere sham,if the directors could,under all circumstances,reserve within the treasury all the accumulation of excess charges.such procedure,in some cases,would be both unjust to the members and an encouragement to improvidence and arbitrary conduct on the part of the directors in the way of unwise spending and unwise investments.lipsman reich misc.
state farm policies and bylaws obligated the board to consider whether to declare dividends from time to time,regardless of whether dividends were actually declared.in undertaking that obligation,the board owed the policyholders a duty of care.state farm is immune from liability only if the board fulfilled certain obligations the policyholders and the corporation.the duty of care requires directors to exercise the degree of skill,diligence and care that a reasonably prudent business person would exercise in similar circumstances.atwood grain supply growmark,accord,stamp batastini d,gearhart industries,smith,cir,massey disc,so d.the functions of a director such as the declaration of dividends constitute basic sources of a director obligations for purposes of the duty of care.ali,principles of corporate governance analysis and recommendations a,com.b.although directors are vested with broad discretion in determining whether,when,and what amount of dividends should be paid,that discretion is subject to legal restraints.the directors must exercise the requisite degree of care in discharging their duty to act prudently in light of the circumstances.fletcher cyclopedia of the law of private corporations vol.
the business judgment rule is a defense to an alleged breach of the duty of care.see ferris elevator neffco,d,radol thomas cir,gearhart industries,smith,supra,at fletcher cyclopedia of the law of private corporations,supra.
we find inapplicable cases holding that the business judgment rule does not apply to a breach of contract claim.see,willmschen trinity lakes improvement d,fe bland two trees management,anderson nottingham village homeowner,amended on reargument.in those cases,the board was not vested with any discretion in making the challenged decision.see atwood grain supply growmark,supra.at,fn.business judgment rule protects directors broad discretion.and to the extent the duty of care was implicated,it was breached.
in willmschen trinity lakes improvement,supra,d,the residents of a subdivision filed suit against the homeowners association and the board,alleging breach of a written covenant to maintain the common areas.the defendants had ignored the condition of lakes on the property,permitting the water to become noxious and hazardous.the illinois appellate court rejected the application of the business judgment rule,stating the rule does not afford a corporation carte blanche to behave unlawfully.hence,it may be good business judgment to walk away from a contract,but this is no defense to a breach of contract claim.id.at,at.at.
likewise,in fe bland two trees management,supra,the residents of cooperatives were forced to pay a flip tax upon selling their shares and leases,notwithstanding that the tax was contrary to the terms of the bylaws and the leases.in subsequent litigation,the directors,who had approved the tax,invoked the business judgment rule.the new york court of appeals held the defense did not apply,stating that the business judgment rule constitutes no grant of general or inherent power in the directors to enforce against a shareholder an edict of the directors beyond their authority to make under either the bylaws of the corporation or,in the case of a cooperative apartment corporation,the contract between the corporation and its embodied in the proprietary lease.id.at,at,at see also anderson nottingham village homeowner,supra,business judgment rule not applicable where homeowners association breached written maintenance policy by failing to repair leak in townhouse owner roof.
in a further effort to skirt the language of their policies and bylaws,plaintiffs rely on a tax case,modern life accident insurance cir,where the seventh circuit commented,without any authority or evidentiary support,that a mutual insurance company must accord its members the right to the return of premiums which are in excess of the amount needed to cover losses and expenses.id.at.the issue in modern life accident was whether the taxpayer was a life insurance or a mutual insurance company,as the two were taxed differently.we do not regard the court description of a mutual company characteristics for tax purposes as controlling in an action that,as here,seeks damages for an alleged underpayment of dividends.see also keystone mut.casualty co driscoll,for tax purposes,a mutual insurance company can not create a surplus for safety and growth,but must return unused premiums to members,affd.cir.
more in line with our view is another tax case,thompson white river burial ass cir,where the eighth circuit explained to say that an essential characteristic of mutual insurance is that the excess of premiums received over the actual cost of insurance shall be returned to the policyholders is but another way of saying that the essential of mutuality is insurance at cost.it is not necessary to mutuality that periodic returns from premiums collected be made to the members of an association.it is enough that the power exists when a surplus of premium receipts over cost of insurance in fact exists and the determination of the existence of the appropriate surplus is largely within the discretion of those charged with the management of the association g ood reasons may exist for failing to make distributions to the members of a mutual insurance company.t he use of high premium rates would enable a company to make rebates,while the use of low rates may make distributions impracticable,but in either case the insurance is furnished at cost.id.at,italics added.
last,plaintiffs rely on an illinois statute that provides the board of directors of any company may from time to time fix and determine the amount of dividends to be returned to each policyholder,and may for such purpose establish reasonable plans for the distribution of such refunds after retaining sufficient funds for the payment by the company of all outstanding policy and other obligations.ilcs,italics added.but,as used in this statute,the term may does not mean shall,and a board may declare dividends if and when it so decides,except as mandated by the company insurance policies,charter,or bylaws.see rothschild new york life ins,wl,pp.lexis,pp.illinois law does require,however,that dividends be paid out of earned surplus,not contributed surplus.ilcs a see lubin,supra.at,at discussing types of surplus.
in sum,under the law of illinois and other jurisdictions,plaintiffs rights and interests in state farm assets are governed by their insurance policies,bylaws,and newsletter.those documents did not give plaintiffs an interest or right to dividends in any amount,at a particular time,or from a specific portion of retained earnings.yet the board was obligated to decide whether to declare dividends and had to comply with the duty of care in doing so.plaintiffs contend that the board breached the duty of care in making dividend decisions by not acting prudently.the board responds that its decisions are protected by the business judgment rule.we now examine the relationship between the duty of care and the business judgment rule as applied to the undisputed material facts of this case.
c.the board deliberations 
where there is no conscious decision by directors to act or refrain from acting,the business judgment rule has no application.the absence of board action,therefore,makes it impossible to perform the essential inquiry whether the directors have acted in conformity with the business judgment rule in approving the challenged transaction.mccall scott cir,amended on denial of rehg.cir.the rule does not apply when the directors did not actually make a decision.summers cherokee children family serv.
nor is a company protected if the directors knew that material decisions were being made without adequate deliberation in a manner that suggests that they did not care whether shareholders would suffer a loss or injury.in re tyson foods consol.lit,see in re walt disney.derivative litigation,accord,in re avado brands,in re federal nat.mortg.ass securities d,affd.sub nom.pirelli armstrong tire.retir.med.raines.a board must do more than passively the decisions of the active managers.barr wackman.
plaintiffs contend that the board merely management the officers decisions,the board did not deliberate about whether the assets in the surplus should be sold dividended or monetized to pay dividends,and the board did not deliberate about rate reductions.
we have already described the evidence on these points and see no reason to repeat it in detail.see pt,ante.suffice it to say that the directors had extended discussions about whether to declare dividends or implement rate cuts.the officers made presentations at board meetings,supported by information from the company actuarial department.the officers also addressed what action,if any,the board should take.the meetings were interactive and sometimes rather lengthy.the directors asked questions and were satisfied with the officers answers.the board read numerous financial reports in deciding whether to declare dividends or reduce rates.
in addition,the directors knew that the assets in the surplus were not being sold to pay dividends.the officers presentations made clear that underwriting the the declaration of dividends.the periodic financial reports indicated the status of the assets.and,separate from the declaration of dividends,the board had discussed and decided to retain the assets in the surplus.see pts,post.state farm had protected the surplus in this manner for more than years.but plaintiffs contend the board was unaware of the practice and did not approve it.we find no basis for that contention.
nor was the board a mere rubber stamp for management.the directors thoroughly discussed the issues and questioned the officers.that the record does not reveal the substance of all of the questions asked by the directors is in fact of little importance what was uncovered and the relative weight accorded it by the directors in evaluating and balancing the several factors and considerations are beyond the scope of judicial concern.treadway companies,care cir,fn.it is therefore immaterial that the board minutes did not provide a verbatim transcript of the meetings.as an illinois court has explained,i n recording the minutes of a director meeting,the secretary,though under an obligation to keep the minutes faithfully is not obligated to include everything that is said in the minutes as long as he accurately transcribes what has taken place.field oberwortmann d,citation omitted.
and contrary to plaintiffs assertion,the minutes support the directors testimony about the board decisionmaking process.the minutes in,for example,indicate that at the march meeting,john killian,the controller,gave a slide presentation of an overview of company conditions,reviewed the annual statement,and respond ed to the questions from the directors.at the june meeting,killian presented slides on the company financial condition and results from operations and investments.on september,killian gave a slide presentation on the company financial condition,reported on underwriting results,and answered questions from the board.at the december meeting,killian gave a slide presentation reviewing financial and underwriting results he also reviewed operating return results by state,which prompted a discussion of the company surplus and dividend policy in other years,the minutes contained similar entries.
given the contents of the minutes and the testimony of the directors and the officers that the board reviewed,questioned,and discussed management recommendations before voting on them,we conclude that the board made its own decisions.it was not dominated or controlled by the officers.see minnesota invco midwest wireless,fn.cratty peoria law library ass,court had authority to enforce bylaw that expressly entitled stockholder to payment of dividend of eight percent per annum on first day of each year channon channon,wl,pp.lexis,pp.court properly decreed payment of dividend where board was dominated by director who said he would never declare another dividend,company admittedly could afford to pay dividend,and motion to declare dividend was voted down at board meeting without discussion.
plaintiffs attack on the board deliberations ignores important principles of corporate governance.the directors do not have to discuss every aspect of the company business.a board may rely on an officer recommendations,including his or her silence in some circumstances.the board may generally instruct senior executives to report major developments related to their areas of responsibility.in such a case,in the absence of suspicious circumstances or other unusual facts indicating that reliance is unwarranted,the board would be reasonable in assuming that silence indicated that no major developments had occurred.a director may assume that silence from a senior executive whom he or she reasonably believes merits his or her confidence reflects a judgment by that senior executive that no major developments related to the executive area of responsibility have taken place.ali,principles of corporate governance analysis and recommendations,supra,b,com.b,citations omitted.in short,directors may rely on the management decisions and recommendations of officers.potter pohlad,fn.accord,lanza drexel cir,in re healthsouth.shareholders lit,affd,wl.
it has long been recognized at common law that the function of the board of directors is to determine the general business policy of the corporation and that the directors are entitled to rely upon the officers and employees of the corporation,both in carrying out that policy and in receiving reports and information upon which to base that policy.it can not be expected of a director that he should be watching either the inferior officers of the company or verifying the calculations of the auditors himself.the business of life could not go on if people could not trust those who are put into a position of trust for the express purpose of attending to details of management.briano rubio th,d.
delegation and reliance by directors may take place in numerous and varying factual contexts.i n carrying out their oversight obligations directors will almost certainly have to rely on information,reports,and statements from other persons and from committees of the board in making business judgments,directors will often have to delegate responsibility with respect to the evaluation of various matters and will almost invariably have to rely on memoranda,documents,and oral statements prepared and presented by other persons.ali,principles of corporate governance analysis and recommendations,supra,b,com.b,italics added.other persons includes directors,officers,and employees,a.in the usual case,directors and officers will be reasonable in believing that they can rely on the information,opinions,reports,statements,decisions,judgments,and performance of others without the need for independent verification or further inquiry,com.i,accord,fletcher cyclopedia of the law of private corporations,supra.
thus,trosino or another officer could properly rely on advice from the actuarial department in deciding whether to recommend that the board consider declaring a dividend.and the board,in turn,could rely on an officer to recommend that it take such action.if trosino,for example,did not make a he remained silent on the board could assume a dividend was not warranted without engaging in a discussion of the matter.even so,trosino testified that directors sometimes questioned whether a dividend should be declared if he did not recommend one.
plaintiffs take the position that the board had to discuss a possible dividend every year,regardless of what management recommended.but state farm insurance policies,bylaws,and newsletter did not require such a discussion.in addition,the written financial reports kept the directors informed of the company overall financial picture throughout the year.for instance,management did not recommend a multistate dividend in.in that year,state farm suffered its second consecutive annual underwriting loss exceeding billion in both and its third consecutive decrease in annual net income declining from million in to million in and a drop in the surplus of million.it should come as no surprise that a multistate dividend was not an officer or the meetings that year.
a similar analysis applies in the other years when dividends were not declared.the board already knew from the financial reports or the occurrence of catastrophes that a dividend was not warranted,and the lack of a recommendation from management confirmed that dividends need not be discussed.yet plaintiffs criticize the board for failing to discuss a possible dividend in,notwithstanding an underwriting loss in that year of billion,following on the heels,in,of the northridge earthquake and a underwriting loss of billion.
plaintiffs also complain that,in some years,state farm reduced rates but did not declare a dividend.but those two options are indistinguishable for purposes of the business judgment rule.dividends may be made,and by many of the companies have been made largely,by way of abating or reducing the amount of the renewal premium.where the dividend is so made the actual premium receipt of the year is obviously only the reduced amount the financial result both to the company and to the policy holders is,however,exactly the same whether the renewal premium is reduced by a dividend or whether the renewal premium remains unchanged,but is paid in part either by a credit or by cash received as a dividend.penn mutual lederer,fn.omitted.a dividend may take the form of either a payment or a reduced premium.see id.at,fn.at,fn.wallace swift spinning mills,fn,fn.rieff evans iowa,cranley national life ins.of vermont d,affd.cir mutual assur.gluck,fn,affd.see also b,c defining policyholder dividend.and in some years for example,the board approved both.
relying on coons,supra,at page.at,plaintiffs assert that dividends must be distributed at fixed periods.but in coons,the insurance policy stated that d ividends are payable annually on the policy anniversary date.id.at,at.applicable here is coons admonition that u nder the terms of the contract a policyholder is not entitled to such dividends in any other manner or time than therein specified.id.at,at.state farm policies and bylaws specified no manner or time for the payment of dividends.accordingly,dividends were paid when the board determined that they were warranted in light of underwriting results,net income before taxes,and the net worth of the company.
finally,plaintiffs contend that state farm never used investment income from any source to pay dividends.state farm had two principal sources of income premiums and investment income on its surplus and reserves.the company paid dividends in several years when it had an underwriting loss.in those years,as the audited reports show,dividends were paid out of investment income.
plaintiffs rely on a portion of joslin july file memo,which stated w e are reluctant to take any action which appears to return investment income to policyholders.our philosophy has been to return unneeded premium rather than a portion of total profits.joslin was the treasurer at the time,but was not yet on the board.the reluctance to which he referred was apparently not shared by everyone.on august,the executive committee approved a declaration of dividends,despite an eventual underwriting loss of million that year and a combined underwriting loss the previous two years and exceeding billion.as stated in the minutes,at the september,meeting of the board,the proceedings of the executive committee were presented and,a fter a full discussion of the factors considered and the impact on the company condition,the board voted to approve the executive committee action.dividends in the amount of million were approved.thus,investment just unneeded used to pay dividends.
whether state farm retained its entire surplus,used some of the investment income from the surplus to pay dividends,or used only investment income from its reserves for that purpose does not alter our conclusion that the board adequately considered whether to declare dividends or reduce rates.plaintiffs challenge to the board handling of the surplus is a distinct issue we address next.

the directors have the duty to inform themselves of the material facts necessary to exercise their judgment.stamp batastini,supra,d at at.at.they may not close their eyes to what is going on about them in corporate business,and must in appropriate circumstances make such reasonable inquiry.ibid.t he standard for judging the informational component of the directors decisionmaking does not mean that the board must be informed of every fact.the board is responsible for considering only material facts that are reasonably available,not those that are immaterial or out of the board reasonable reach.roselink investors,henchman d.
the informed decision prerequisite focuses on the preparedness of a director or officer in making a business decision as opposed to the quality of the decision itself.fundamental to an understanding of the standard is the recognition that the extent of the information required is that which the director or officer reasonably believes to be appropriate under the circumstance.in evaluating what is a reasonable belief in a particular situation,the informed requirement should be interpreted realistically and with an appreciation of the factual context in which the business judgment was made.ali,principles of corporate governance analysis and recommendations,supra,c,com.e.of course,the business or professional experience of directors or officers may help to inform them about a decision.they may also be informed by the general views or specialized experience of colleagues.reliance on reports,representations,statements,and opinions prepared by officers and employees of the corporation and by outside professionals and experts will often be necessary and will,in many situations,satisfy the informational requirement id.at.
the requirement of director independence inheres in the conception and rationale of the business judgment rule.the presumption of propriety that flows from an exercise of business judgment is based in part on this unyielding precept.independence means that a director decision is based on the corporate merits of the subject before the board rather than extraneous considerations or influences.while directors may confer,debate,and resolve their differences through compromise,or by reasonable reliance upon the expertise of their colleagues and other qualified persons,the end result,nonetheless,must be that each director has brought his or her own informed business judgment to bear with specificity upon the corporate merits of the issues without regard for or succumbing to influences which convert an otherwise valid business decision into a faithless act.aronson lewis,overruled on another point in brehm eisner,accord,orman cullman.
plaintiffs argue that the board failed the informed decision prerequisite in evaluating the size of the surplus.not so.the directors were aware of the appropriate material facts through the written and oral reports of the actuarial department and management.the board often discussed the size of the surplus.
s urplus provides a safety cushion to absorb adverse results and protects the policyholder and the company by helping maintain the company solvency during periods of unfavorable operating results.as the amount of surplus increases,the risk of insolvency decreases the payment of dividends reduces the surplus 
state farm invests its surplus,and the return on that investment is an essential part of the company overall financial position.an insurer must have an adequate surplus at all times,especially in light of potential catastrophes that may result in substantial damage to numerous policyholders state farm refers to its surplus as policyholder protection funds.
the financial soundness of an insurance company depends on numerous factors that are difficult to quantify,and the insurance market is characterized by substantial diversity across insurers in types of business written,characteristics of customers,and methods of operation.it is impossible to specify the right amount of surplus for most insurers through a formula.each insurance company has its own method for determining the amount of surplus it considers to be adequate.state farm ii,supra,th at,d,citations omitted.
internal memoranda between state farm actuaries in the indicated that state farm does not have a specific target ratio,which we believe is the appropriate ratio.the actuaries concluded then that the ratio should be greater than and perhaps as high as.in the written report to the board,the actuaries advised when circumstances allow,earnings should be used to build and maintain a higher ratio.a level as high as cents or even appears to be sustainable.
during the class period,state farm actuarial department was constantly involved in analyzing the size of the surplus.as hayward testified,the actuaries used several methods to assess the appropriate level of surplus.he regularly provided oral research reports to at least one key officer and member of the board.among the methods used was one that showed the surplus ratio needed to withstand various asset declines and liability increases and maintain sufficient minimum surplus to continue operations.that appeared in both the and written reports for the based on the following equation 
for purposes of this calculation l liabilities s surplus p premiums x percent decline in assets y percent increase in liabilities and k minimum surplus to continue operations.in the report,hayward indicated that,under this method,state farm should have a ratio above.using this and other methods employed by the actuarial department for many years before,hayward or another actuary had advised executive management each year that the size of the surplus was reasonable and not excessive.the department never concluded that the surplus was excessive or too high.
director gramm testified that the directors looked at the ratios all the time.the ratios helped her quantify the use of the surplus for catastrophes.she was more comfortable with a ratio of or higher instead of the regulatory view consistent with the opinions expressed in the actuaries memos.director joslin stated that the appropriate level of surplus was discussed at many meetings,and the board never concluded that the surplus exceeded reasonable limits.director jaedicke echoed that observation,adding that nobody felt there was too much surplus.nor,he said,did anyone ever suggest that state farm should weaken its financial position by selling an asset to pay dividends.director wilson emphasized that the surplus,regardless of its size,was subject to the volatility of the markets.he,too,testified the surplus was inadequate.trosino,the chief operating officer,indicated that,during board discussions,we concluded that retaining the surplus was the wisest course of action the surplus provided funds in the event of a catastrophe,allowed the company to remain competitive,and furthered efforts to keep premiums low and to reduce or lessen the size of rate increases.and the actuarial department wholly supported that approach.
once a year,the directors received a written report that discussed and compared the surpluses and ratios of state farm and its competitors.state farm never had the highest ratio.during the class period,its ratios ranged from to according to the company the range was to according to plaintiffs.the receipt of that report,jaedicke said,was yet another occasion on which the size of the surplus would be discussed.italics added.
in light of the foregoing evidence,we conclude that,as a matter of law,the board was sufficiently informed to make independent decisions about dividends and the surplus.the directors relied on what they reasonably believed to be adequate information,and the board decisions were anything but faithless acts.
for their part,plaintiffs rely on the declarations of a professor of corporate governance and an actuary for the proposition that the board could not make informed dividend decisions absent actuarial the surplus.without resolving the trial court ruling that the actuary declaration was inadmissible,we agree.the size of a mutual company surplus can not be properly evaluated based on gut reactions,hunches,or intuition.but here,the officers and directors were provided with several categories of information,including actuarial data,upon which they could reasonably rely.as noted,state farm actuarial department reported its analyses to management,which,in turn,made oral presentations to the board.hayward,the head of the department research unit,regularly informed a key officer and board member of his findings.also,plaintiffs experts did not identify any additional sources or types of actuarial data that state farm should have considered.
with respect to plaintiffs use of experts,we express concern that policyholders might be encouraged to challenge a dividend decision in the hopes that the business judgment rule will be defeated,and the case will make it to the jury,based solely on the opinion of an outside expert.as one court cogently observed in that regard t he validity,accuracy and usefulness of any actuarial study rests largely on the appropriateness of the assumptions on which it is based.basically,plaintiffs would ask the court to decide which of the various assumptions offered by both sides are the more reasonable.this would be a distinctly inappropriate task for this court to undertake.t he court should not address itself to the various accounting theories and contentions which would support the payment of a dividend.instead,the court must limit its inquiry to the reasonableness of the actions and motivations of those charged with running this insurance company.pincus mut.assurance,affd.mem.
plaintiffs discussion of a written by state farm chief actuary,gary grant,misses the mark.for one thing,the involved issues that arose one year after the class period.second,it indicated that state farm ratio in was six cents above the ratio and at least cents below the ratio recommended by an actuarial calculation made in.last,the suggested that the august,actuarial report be rewritten.hayward accomplished that task less than a year after the was sent.
in addition,we reject plaintiffs contention that the directors were misguided about the constituency they were supposed to serve.mutual insurance companies are organized,maintained,and operated solely for the benefit of their policyholders.state farm ii,supra,th at,d.when jaedicke became a director,he read section of the illinois business corporation act,which states in discharging its duties,the board of directors may consider the effects of any action upon employees,suppliers and customers of the corporation or its subsidiaries,communities in which offices or other establishments of the corporation or its subsidiaries are located,and all other pertinent factors.ilcs section.but the business corporation act excludes insurance companies see ilcs because they conduct a business charged with the public interest and are authorized and governed by a special act,more stringent in its regulations by reason of the nature of their business doggett north american life ins.
although jaedicke read section of the act,there is no evidence that he gave it any thought in making decisions related to dividends or the surplus.in fact,he testified during his deposition that he owed a duty of loyalty to state farm policyholders and no one else.further,section permits,but does not require,a director to consider the interests of the listed constituencies employees,suppliers,customers policyholders,surrounding communities,and other pertinent factors.plaintiffs made no showing that,under the statute,the nonpolicyholders had interests that differed from,or conflicted with,the policyholders interest in dividends.even if jaedicke had given any weight to section,it would be pure speculation to assume that his decisions disadvantaged the policyholders.and,during his time on the board,jaedicke was one of directors.no evidence suggests that any other director or officer considered section in making dividend or surplus decisions.thus,the statute did not influence the board decisions on those matters.
plaintiffs also take issue with jaedicke testimony about the possible tax results to state farm if it sold assets from the surplus to pay dividends.plaintiffs submitted evidence indicating that the taxes would be entirely offset by a deduction allowed for the full amount of the dividend.jaedicke,who admitted he was not the expert on taxes,testified he did not believe any portion of the dividend would be deductible.similarly,hayward said in his declaration that state farm would have to pay income taxes if it sold any part of the surplus.plaintiffs seize on these isolated comments in arguing that the board confusion over tax issues led to the mistaken conclusion that state farm should not sell any assets from the surplus.to the contrary,the complete testimony of jaedicke and hayward indicates that their real concern was not tax liability,if any,but the loss of the asset itself.and,again,jaedicke was just one of several directors.his individual opinions about taxes were inconsequential given that no other director mentioned the subject.as for hayward,he too conceded a lack of tax knowledge i not a tax expert and his tax opinions had no effect on the type of data he generated as an actuary.finally,we have just explained that the board as a whole,including jaedicke,gave many than retaining the surplus.see also,post.the tax issue is a red herring.
decisions that are fraudulent or dishonest 
a bsent one of the exceptions to the business judgment rule such as fraud or dishonesty a corporation is not liable for a lack of dividends.state farm ii,supra,th at,d.
given that the business judgment rule protects a board mistakes,errors,and mere negligence see pt,post,a plaintiff can not circumvent that protection by simply characterizing a board decisions as fraudulent or dishonest.a mere mistake of judgment is not fraud.public service commission city of indianapolis.rather,fraud requires evidence of improper motives on the part of the board members.lewis playboy enterprises,d.
in kelly bell,affirmed sub nom.ella kelly wyndham,bell,a corporation agreed to continue paying local tax assessments on its existing machinery in exchange for the county support of state legislation that would gradually eliminate the taxes on all of its machinery.the legislation passed.on its annual reports to shareholders,the corporation continued to show its machinery payments as taxes,although,by operation of the new law,the local authorities no longer had the authority to impose taxes.see id.at.
shareholders brought suit against the directors,alleging that the annual reports fraudulently listed the payments as taxes.the directors moved for summary judgment,relying on the business judgment rule.see kelly bell,supra,at.in opposition to the motion,the shareholders submitted an affidavit from a certified public accountant,who stated that listing the payments as taxes did not conform with generally accepted accounting principles.the court of chancery responded that may be.but for present purposes the test is not whether the reporting was in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles but rather whether,under all the evidence,the reporting was fraudulent.id.at.the court concluded t here is not a shred of evidence to show that this procedure was adopted for sinister reasons.under the circumstances,reporting the payments to stockholders in the form in which they were actually made is not fraudulent.certainly plaintiffs have made no showing that there was any purposeful effort on the part of any defendant to conceal the true nature of what was done from the stockholders.ibid.on appeal,the delaware supreme court affirmed,agreeing that the fraud exception did not apply because t here is no evidence that any director or officer was motivated by expectation of personal gain,by bad faith or by any consideration other than that of doing what was best for the company.ella kelly wyndham,bell,supra,at.
in this case,plaintiffs advance two arguments in support of the fraud or dishonesty exception to the business judgment rule first,state farm should have disclosed to policyholders that it did not sell assets from the surplus to pay dividends and second,the annual report to policyholders the insert included with premium fraudulent information.both arguments fail.
source of dividends 
in their opening brief,plaintiffs assert that policyholders are entitled to know,through their insurance policies and bylaws,the actual dividend policies and practices that are followed by management and the board.in support,plaintiffs cite two authorities,winger manufacturing company d winger and volume,fletcher cyclopedia of the law of private corporations vol.section,pages.neither is applicable.
winger involved the predecessor version of section of the illinois business corporation act ilcs,which entitles a shareholder to examine the books and records of a corporation.see winger,supra,d at,at.as plaintiffs have pointed out,the business corporation act does not apply to insurance companies.see ilcs.but assuming that mutual insurance companies must or do allow policyholders to examine their books and records,state farms dividend practices would not be found there.the board considered several unwritten factors during lengthy discussions.each meeting differed from the others due to changes in the company financial condition and other circumstances.there was no written policy or practice in existence for anyone to examine.
plaintiffs rely on the fletcher treatise for the principle that d irectors and officers of a corporation stand in a sufficiently confidential relation to the shareholders to impose a duty upon them to reveal all facts material to the corporate transactions,especially with regard to membership corporations or cooperatives a board duty of complete candor to its shareholders to disclose all germane or material information applies to matters of corporate governance as well as to corporate transactions.fletcher cyclopedia of the law of private corporations,supra,fn.omitted.this principle contemplates disclosure with respect to corporate transactions such as mergers,dissolutions,the removal of directors,the purchase of minority shareholders stock by majority shareholders,the conversion of corporate funds,the acquisition of another corporation assets,and recapitalization plans.
but it does not apply to dividend decisions.see fletcher cyclopedia of the law of private corporations,supra,fns.and cases cited.as the illinois supreme court has recognized in insurance cases,the parties are competent to contract and have the right to insert such lawful provisions in the agreement as they see fit.coons,supra,at at,italics added.thus,insurers are not required to explain their dividend practices where the insurance policy or bylaws provide vesting the board with broad discretion in the matter.requiring that dividend practices be printed in the policy or bylaws would unnecessarily restrict the board latitude in making dividend decisions.the information disclosed by state farm was therefore sufficient.
more specifically,plaintiffs complain that state farm insurance policies and bylaws indicated that the board would consider paying dividends from earnings,savings,and gains when the company did not consider the assets in the surplus as a source of dividends.plaintiffs describe this nondisclosure about the surplus as fraudulent.if state farm had disclosed that the surplus was,plaintiffs argue,policyholders would have had a realistic picture of their dividend prospects.we disagree for a number of reasons.
first,the representations in the policies and bylaws were literally true dividends were paid from earnings,savings,and gains.in some years,state farm paid dividends out of underwriting income unneeded premium in other years,when the company suffered an underwriting loss but nevertheless paid a dividend,investment income was used to make the payments.consequently,we find no evidence of improper motives on the part of the board.
second,even if state farm had made the disclosure sought,policyholders would not have had any better idea of the dividends they might receive.the insurance policies and bylaws did not indicate that dividends would be declared in any particular amount,manner,or time.any disclosure about the surplus would have been of no assistance.
third,as the adage goes,a job half done is a job not done.several factors were considered in deciding whether to declare a dividend and its amount.a disclosure about the surplus alone would have been open to attack as misleading.it would have simply given policyholders reason to complain that the company had not disclosed other aspects of its decisionmaking process,such as relying on underwriting results,focusing on income by state,taking net income into account,and reviewing the company net worth.in other words,state farm could not have described its dividend practices in a way that would have satisfied all of its policyholders.it faced a damned if you do,damned if you do situation.litigation would be possible either way.
last,state farm complied with whatever duty of disclosure it may have had by issuing the annual report to policyholders,which summarized state farm financial condition.the reports typically distinguished between underwriting results and the surplus.for instance,the report said state farm mutual results showed improvement again in.policyholders in states,where claims experience was better than expected,shared in million in dividends.net income from all sources was about per policy and went into the policyholder protection funds.
annual reports to policyholders 
even if the law imposes no duty upon directors to furnish annual reports to shareholders,corporate directors must honestly disclose all material facts when they undertake to give out written statements concerning the condition or business of their corporation.hall john isaacs sons farms,revd.on another point,citation omitted.d irectors owe a duty to honestly disclose all material facts when they undertake to give out statements about the business to stockholders.kelly bell,supra,at accord,fletcher cyclopedia of the law of private corporations,supra,fraud may result from the concealment of material facts in the annual or other reports.generally,knowledge of corporate records and documents is imputed to all directors.in re illinois valley acceptance.
in their opposition papers,plaintiffs rely on the opinions of three experts in arguing that the annual reports to policyholders were misleading.the annual reports listed the amount of assets,liabilities,policyholder protection funds,and a summary of operating data.each of those categories was further broken down into subcategories,and the amount of each subcategory was shown.a final entry stated net income.all of this information,plus a list of the directors by name and title,occupied a small column measuring approximately inches by inches.
we see no need to discuss each of the alleged misleading aspects of the reports.the figures and terminology in the policyholder reports were taken from the audited reports,which coopers lybrand prepared in compliance with the accounting principles prescribed or permitted by the illinois department of insurance.admittedly,the audited reports were not prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles gaap.the state did not accept gaap.state farm use of illinois accounting principles in preparing the policyholder reports does not support an inference of fraud or dishonesty.it is not fraud to do what one has a legal right or obligation to do.state wilbe lumber,so d,italics omitted.that which the law authorizes can not constitute a legal wrong.yoder givens.
the audited reports began with four statements,each consisting of a single page of numerical data covering,respectively income changes in surplus cash flows and admitted assets,liabilities,and surplus.following the statements were several pages of notes,explaining the statements in more detail.to take an example,the audited report had four pages of statements and pages of notes.
plaintiffs accuse state farm of fraud and dishonesty on the ground that the small column of financial data in the annual policyholder reports did not contain all of the explanatory information set forth in the notes.that accusation ignores the limited purpose of the policyholder reports to provide a brief overall picture of state farm financial condition at the time of the premium notices.consistent with that purpose,the poli
