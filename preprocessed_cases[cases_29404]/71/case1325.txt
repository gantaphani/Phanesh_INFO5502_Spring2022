defendant was convicted by jury of counts of theft,burglary,selling securities by false statement,and forgery,with an aggravated white collar crime enhancement,and enhancements for taking property in excess of in value,after she stole from six victims,some elderly,while purporting to run an investment company.sentenced to years months in prison,she appeals.she contends there is insufficient evidence to support three counts the trial court erred in permitting a forensic accountant to testify that defendant ran a ponzi scheme two of the forgery counts should be vacated and the sentence on the remaining forgery counts should be stayed.
we find merit only in the last two contentions relating to the forgery counts.multiple forged signatures on a single document constitute but one count of forgery.two counts of forgery must be vacated.the sentence on the remaining forgery counts is stayed pursuant to penal code section because the forgeries were part of a single course of action with a single intent.in all other respects,we affirm the judgment.
