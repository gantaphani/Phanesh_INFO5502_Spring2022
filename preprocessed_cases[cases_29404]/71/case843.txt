kenneth payne founded heartland financial services,in january and served as its president.from to as late as august,heartland,together with jms investment group,llc,which was founded in,and other affiliated companies,engaged in a massive fraud,holding themselves out as brokerage,insurance and estate planning firms and raising millions of dollars through fraudulent sales of securities.working with payne in this business were daniel danker,heartland vice president and office manager,johann smith,founder,manager and attorney for jms,and constance,an administrative assistant who worked for both jms and heartland.their operation was a classic ponzi scheme.investors were promised extraordinarily high rates of return,which in the beginning were realized,for the purpose of encouraging greater reinvestment.by,heartland had over clients,who had invested million with the company.between december and december,jms raised million from over investors.altogether,the two companies and their affiliates collected over million.in reality,heartland and its affiliates did not invest most of the funds at all,but payne and his colleagues withdrew and spent the money for their own personal benefit.
payne and danker were,at various relevant times,licensed as registered securities representatives of five broker dealers,the defendants in this roberts financial group,alliance capital management,andover securities,fsc securities corporation and ffp securities.according to the complaint,these broker dealers,which were registered under section of the securities and exchange act and with the national association of securities dealers,had the ability and the duty to supervise and control,directly and indirectly,the activities of payne and danker,but failed to exercise proper supervision or to maintain proper control.the complaint also alleges that payne and danker were employees and agents of these companies,and that they were able to perpetrate the ponzi scheme in part because they were able to hold themselves out as licensed registered securities representatives of the broker dealers.
on august,the sec moved for,and the district court granted,a temporary restraining order against payne and danker.as part of the proceedings,the district court removed payne,danker,smith and from control of heartland and jms and appointed james knauer as receiver for the two companies according to the court order,knauer mandate is to marshal,conserve,protect,hold funds,operate,and with the approval of the court,dispose of any wasting assets,wherever those assets may be found,of heartland for the benefit of the investors.agreed order at para,sec payne,no.c.a year later,knauer brought this action against the five broker dealers,charging that they are liable to heartland and jms for a variety of torts based upon the broker dealers relationship with payne and danker counts i and ii alleged that the broker dealers are controlling persons liable for the wrongful conduct of payne and danker and for the sale of unregistered,nonexempt securities by payne and danker pursuant to the securities and exchange act of and the indiana securities act,et.count iii alleged that the broker dealers are directly liable for breach of fiduciary duty and fraud and vicariously liable for the fraudulent and wrongful conduct of payne and danker under the doctrine of respondeat superior.count iv alleged damages under indiana crime victims statute,based on both direct and vicarious liability count v alleged negligent supervision of the activities of payne and danker by the broker dealers.
the broker dealers moved to dismiss the complaint under.b and b.they argued that the receiver had no standing because he was improperly asserting claims of the investors,and not claims of the entities on whose behalf he was appointed.in the alternative,the defendants argued that the receiver claims were barred by the equitable doctrine of in pari delicto,which prohibits a plaintiff from maintaining a claim if the plaintiff himself bears equal fault for the alleged injury,and that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
the district court dismissed counts i and ii,agreeing with the defendants that those claims belonged to the investors in heartland and jms,rather than to the ponzi entities themselves.the receiver does not appeal the dismissal of those two counts.the district court concluded that the receiver did have standing to assert counts iii,iv and v,but nonetheless dismissed these counts under the doctrine of in pari delicto.the district court held that these claims were barred because the receiver had pleaded in his complaint,s imply put,that payne,danker,smith,and were heartland and jms,leading to the inescapable conclusion that heartland and jms participated in the ponzi scheme and knew of the conversion of heartland and jms funds by payne,danker and others.district.order at,emphasis added.the receiver appeals the dismissal of counts iii,iv and 
we review a.b dismissal de novo.dawson,at.
before considering the district court ground for dismissal,we need to clarify exactly what claims are before us.perhaps in part because of the unusual nature of this case,the receiver filed not only one lengthy complaint but incorporated by reference large portions of two additional complaints filed in other proceedings.taken as a whole,this pleading provides a plethora of detail about the alleged misdeeds of payne,danker,heartland,jms and other individuals and entities involved in the ponzi scheme.it is quite significant,however,that the receiver is not pursuing all claims that might have arisen from such a complex and prolonged species of fraudulent activities.
what claims is the receiver pursuing for our purposes,it is useful to think of ponzi schemes as being comprised of two phases.first,the schemer solicits and receives money for investment,guaranteeing high returns while doing little with the money to produce actual profits.while in this first stage,the schemer may generate some income for himself by charging a fee or paying himself a salary with the funds,this sales step is not the source of most of his ponzi gains.after all,the ponzi schemer is not content to enrich himself modestly by extracting fees or salaries from the funds he has solicited.rather,the schemer realizes most of his gains by appropriating large sums of money from the solicited funds,the pace of the withdrawals accelerating as he is ready to disband the ponzi entity and make off with its assets.this embezzlement step of the ponzi scheme depletes the ponzi entity of resources,which are diverted to the entity principal,the schemer 
the five counts of the instant complaint can be mapped along the lines of the two ponzi phases.counts i and ii of the complaint involve the torts associated with illegal sales of securities,and were dismissed by the district court.while those dismissals were not appealed and are therefore not before us,we believe that the district court was probably correct in concluding that knauer,as receiver for heartland and jms,had no standing to pursue the ponzi sales claims.as we see it,ponzi entities themselves are not injured by the sales of securities.even if heartland and jms were arguably being misused by payne and danker,this misuse,at the sales stage,res
