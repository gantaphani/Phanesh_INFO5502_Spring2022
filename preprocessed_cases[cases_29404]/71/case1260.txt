the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo appeals a district court order holding it in contempt for failing to comply with a discovery deadline to which it agreed.though we appreciate ofheo efforts to comply,we conclude that it ultimately failed to do so and find no abuse of discretion in the district court contempt finding or choice of sanction.
appellant office of federal housing enterprise oversight regulates the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation for some reason freddie mac both enterprises participating in the secondary mortgage market.this case concerns ofheo responsibilities toward fannie mae.
in ofheo opened a special review of fannie mae accounting and financial practices,ultimately concluding that the enterprise had departed from generally accepted accounting principles in order to manipulate its reported earnings and inflate executive compensation.although ofheo has since closed its investigation and concluded its enforcement actions,its preliminary investigation report prompted several private civil actions against fannie mae,its senior executives,and others.these actions have been consolidated into multidistrict litigation in the united states district court for the district of columbia.
although ofheo is not itself a party to the multidistrict litigation,the parties have subpoenaed records it collected in performing its oversight functions and preparing its investigation report.this appeal concerns a dispute over subpoenas issued by appellees,three individual defendants in the multidistrict litigation who were senior executives at fannie mae former chairman and ceo franklin raines,former cfo timothy howard,and former senior vice president and controller leanne spencer.
in the summer of,howard and raines subpoenaed over thirty categories of documents from ofheo.see.c b ii governing subpoenas to nonparties.they claimed that the documents would aid their defense by showing that they had been completely transparent with ofheo,appellees br.that ofheo had approved fannie mae accounting and compensation practices,and that ofheo investigation was politically motivated and biased,id.at.arguing that howard and raines should have instead sought these documents pursuant to its disclosure regulations,ofheo moved to quash the subpoenas,and the individual defendants moved to compel compliance.on november,the district court ruled for the individual defendants and directed ofheo to comply during the next four months.
although ofheo began producing documents,it asked howard and raines now joined by spencer,the third appellee to limit their requests for electronically stored information in order to minimize the burden on ofheo.responding by letter dated february,the individual defendants revised their initial requests for such information,limiting them for the time being to certain email communications stored on ofheo network and backup tapes.shortly thereafter,ofheo filed a motion with the district court seeking an approximately extension of the time to comply.representing that the parties had agreed that the court november,order did not apply to the esi,electronically stored information,ofheo motion proposed extending the deadline only for paper documents.ofheo mot.for extension.ofheo explained that it was providing electronically stored information voluntarily and not pursuant to the court order.
the court granted ofheo motion,but the individual defendants objected,claiming that they had never agreed that the order left out electronically stored information.at an april status conference,the district court confirmed that its november,order covered such information and that,in approving ofheo proposed extension order,it had intended to limit the new deadline to paper documents.it granted ofheo request for a further extension to produce the outstanding information.
during the summer of,ofheo reported to the court that it had produced all documents requested by the february letter.but skeptical of the limited production,the individual defendants sought and obtained a rule b deposition,which confirmed that ofheo had failed to search all of its backup tapes.see.b providing for depositions of organizations through designated representatives.according to ofheo,it never understood the february letter request for communications on backup tapes to apply to its backup tapes,but nonetheless voluntarily undertook to search them for certain of the requested documents.
in august of,the individual defendants moved to hold ofheo in contempt.in response,the district court,stating that it had no doubt that the ofheo backup tapes were going to be looked at,scheduled a contempt hearing in order to assess the burden that examination of such tapes would impose on ofheo.hr g tr.at.following the first day of the hearing,ofheo and the individual defendants entered into a stipulated order that held the contempt motions in abeyance and required ofheo to conduct searches of its backup tapes and provide all responsive documents and privilege logs by january.in language central to the issue before us,the stipulated order fifth paragraph states 
ofheo will work with the individual defendants to provide the necessary information without individual document review to develop appropriate search terms.by october,the individual defendants will specify the search terms to be used.
stipulated order.
pursuant to the stipulated order,the individual defendants submitted over search terms,which covered approximately documents.ofheo objected on the grounds that the stipulated order limited the individual defendants to appropriate search terms,but the district court disagreed,ruling on november,that the stipulated order gave the individual defendants sole discretion to specify search terms and imposed no limits on permissible terms.although the district court made this ruling in an chambers conference,the parties agree on its meaning.
ofheo undertook extensive efforts to comply with the stipulated order,hiring contract attorneys solely for that purpose.the total amount ofheo spent on the individual defendants discovery requests eventually reached over million,more than percent of the agency entire annual budget.
on november,the day before an interim deadline for production of several categories of material,ofheo informed the district court that it would be unable to meet that deadline and moved for an extension until december,assuring the court that it could meet that extended deadline.the court granted the motion,but two days before the extended deadline,ofheo informed the court not only that its previous assurances had been based on insufficient data,but also that it had only recently hired the necessary number of contract attorneys.ofheo told the court that it would be unable to comply with the extended interim deadline,and that although it could produce all documents by the ultimate january,deadline,it would be unable to produce all the required privilege logs until february.
the individual defendants renewed their motions to hold ofheo in contempt.on january,the district court granted the motions.the court recognized ofheo efforts at compliance,but deemed them not only legally insufficient,but too little too late,stating 
t he court is cognizant of the large number of attorneys,contract attorneys,and ofheo personnel working to comply with the subpoenas and the resulting costs of this compliance.nevertheless,ofheo has treated its deadlines as movable goal posts and has repeatedly miscalculated the efforts required for compliance and sought thereafter to move them.
hr g tr.at.as a sanction,the court ordered production of all documents withheld on the sole basis of the qualified deliberative process privilege and not logged by the january,deadline.contrary to the individual defendants requests,however,the court made clear that production was to be made only to counsel and would not waive the privilege.although ofheo says that it provided the documents by january and the privilege logs by the end of february,the individual defendants claim that approximately documents remain unaccounted for.
ofheo appeals the contempt finding,arguing that the stipulated order limited the individual defendants to specifying appropriate search terms and did not unambiguously compel it to process inappropriate terms.in the alternative,ofheo argues that it substantially complied with the stipulated order,rendering a finding of contempt inappropriate,and that in any event the district court abused its discretion by compelling compliance with the subpoenas in the first place.ofheo also appeals the district court choice of sanction,which this court stayed pending appeal.exercising our appellate jurisdiction due to the finding of contempt,see catholic conference abortion rights mobilization,d,we review both the contempt finding and the sanction for abuse of discretion,food lion,united food commercial workers int l union.
we begin with ofheo principal argument that paragraph five of the stipulated order limits the individual defendants to specifying only appropriate search terms,and that by transgressing this limitation,the individual defendants relieved ofheo of its obligation to process the search terms and to produce the corresponding documents and privilege logs by the stipulated order deadline.we disagree.
although ofheo characterizes paragraph five use of the phrase appropriate search terms as a protection it bargained for,it presented no extrinsic evidence for this claim.as a consequence,we interpret the meaning of the stipulated order based on the document itself.see segar mukasey,c onstruction of a consent decree is essentially a matter of contract law.internal quotation marks omitted.on its face,paragraph five first sentence uses the phrase appropriate search terms to describe an obligation on ofheo,not the individual defendants,and its second reserves full discretion to the individual defendants to specify search terms 
ofheo will work with the individual defendants to provide the necessary information without individual document review to develop appropriate search terms.by october,the individual defendants will specify the search terms to be used.
stipulated order.ofheo describes paragraph five as c onfining defendants to appropriate search terms,appellant opening br,but it quotes neither sentence in full and its opening brief never so much as mentions the second sentence.this omission is striking given that on its face the second sentence imposes no limitation on the terms the individual defendants may specify.to defeat such a clear statement,the remainder of the stipulated order would need to provide a correspondingly persuasive indication that the individual defendants are somehow limited in their choice of search terms.it does not.
paragraph five reference to appropriate search terms,on which ofheo exclusively relies,imposes no limitation on the individual defendants.the paragraph directs ofheo and the individual defendants to work together,but only to facilitate ofheo provision of information to assist in developing search terms.the phrase to develop appropriate search terms indisputably modifies the necessary information it is not an independent obligation on the parties.see stipulated order ofheo will work with the individual defendants to provide the necessary information to develop appropriate search terms.that is,the phrase serves only to define the type of information ofheo must information necessary for the development of appropriate search terms.nothing in paragraph five text gives ofheo any role in actually developing those search terms.
although paragraph five defines the information ofheo must provide,it nowhere limits the search terms the individual defendants ultimately specify to those based on this information.if the individual defendants wished to specify search terms based on information obtained from other sources at their disposal,nothing in the paragraph precludes that.nor is there any logical reason why it all,the individual defendants undoubtedly acquired voluminous information from the parties to the multidistrict litigation during discovery,and it quite unlikely that they and ofheo would have ruled out search terms based on this wholly independent source of information.thus the phrase appropriate search terms,which relates only to the information ofheo must provide,imposes no restrictions on the search terms the individual defendants end up specifying,which may be based on wholly independent information.
ofheo argues that reading the stipulated order to allow the individual defendants full discretion to specify search terms would render the phrase to develop appropriate search terms surplusage.again,we disagree.clearly the whole phrase is surplusage without it,the agreement would only impose the maddeningly nebulous requirement that ofheo provide the necessary information,giving no hint as to what type of information that might be.
even if some variant of the phrase is essential,might the word appropriate still be surplusage under our plain reading we think not.the word plays a valuable role it sharpens ofheo obligations to the individual defendants.without that word,the necessary information to develop search terms might consist of nothing more than minimally useful information,such as the technical specifications of ofheo data retrieval software.but paragraph five requires ofheo to provide more it must furnish that information necessary to formulate search terms that are not just minimally sufficient,but actually appropriate to the task of retrieving relevant documents.see webster third new international dictionary defining appropriate as specially suitable.the inclusion of such detail is understandable given the difficulties ofheo and the individual defendants experienced resolving their discovery disputes up to that point.
the word appropriate would be surplusage only if the information necessary to develop appropriate search terms was of no value whatsoever to the individual defendants.in that case it would have made no sense for paragraph five to obligate ofheo to do something that the individual defendants could possibly want.but of course such information is quite valuable to the individual defendants.they want to retrieve the relevant documents as efficiently as possible,and appropriate search terms,by definition,do so better than minimally adequate search terms.since the first sentence requirement that ofheo do something valuable for the individual defendants is hardly remarkable,we create no surplusage when we take at face value its plain text,which sets forth only ofheo obligation to provide information at the outset,not any limitation on the individual defendants discretion to choose search terms.
the language surrounding paragraph five strongly supports this straightforward reading.unlike paragraph five,the remainder of the stipulated order includes several provisions that unmistakably protect ofheo.for example,paragraph six protects ofheo from having to produce certain categories of documents by stating simply,ofheo will not produce the following documents,and enumerating in detail three protected categories.stipulated order.other provisions in the stipulated order expressly limit the individual defendants to identifying fifteen backup tape sets to restore out of over backup tapes in ofheo possession,id.cap the number of ofheo record custodians subject to the requests,id.specify the relevant time period for the individual defendants requests,id.and provide deadlines that effectively extend ofheo time to comply by several months,id.tellingly,even the very sentence in paragraph five that contains the word appropriate unambiguously includes a specific protection for ofheo its obligation to provide information does not extend to individual document review.see id.ofheo will work with the individual defendants to provide the necessary information without individual document review to develop appropriate search terms.each of these protections is specifically set forth in the stipulated order,and each clearly protects ofheo.the contrast to the word appropriate appearing without elaboration in a sentence defining ofheo revealing.
