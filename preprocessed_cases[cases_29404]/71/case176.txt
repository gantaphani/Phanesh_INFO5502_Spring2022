andrew roth appeals from judge oetken dismissal under.b of his derivative action on behalf of leap wireless international,leap.he seeks to hold the goldman sachs group and its wholly owned subsidiary goldman,sachs collectively,goldman liable under section b of the securities exchange act exchange act and rule d for their failure to disgorge profits derived from writing call options on leap stock.
although section b is long in the tooth older even than the author of this opinion and the subject of countless judicial interpretations,it seems to be an fount of close questions as to its meaning.the issue here arises from the fact that goldman owned over ten percent of leap equity shares a statutory insider under section b when it wrote certain call options,but owned under ten percent when the unexercised options expired less than six months later.the principal issues are whether i a call option expiration within six months of its writing constitutes a purchase for section b purposes that can be matched to the sale that is deemed under rule a to occur at the option writing and ii if so,whether the loss of statutory insider status before the expiration eliminates the need for disgorgement under section b.concluding the expiration was a purchase but that the goldman defendants were not statutory insiders at the time of the purchase,the district court held that goldman was not required to disgorge any profits.we affirm.
background 
appellant complaint alleges the following.goldman owned common stock in leap.on september,goldman ownership stake in the company surpassed ten percent,rendering it a statutory insider subject to the reporting and disgorgement requirements of section on the same date,goldman wrote call options that covered million shares of leap and were exercisable at.the options were sold at share for a total of and bore an expiration date of january.on october,goldman disposal of leap shares dropped its ownership stake below ten percent.
in an october,message to leap,goldman disclosed that it had generated profits from purchases and sales of leap securities unrelated to the options described above during the period when goldman was a statutory insider.pursuant to section b,goldman voluntarily disgorged to leap the profits totaling about derived from these transactions.
on january,the call options at issue here expired unexercised.
on june,appellant,a leap shareholder,made a demand on leap to sue goldman under section b and rule d for goldman alleged failure to disgorge profits earned by writing the short call options that expired unexercised within six months.in response,leap referenced the profits already voluntarily disgorged by goldman and communicated that it consider ed the matter closed.
appellant filed the present action on july.goldman and leap the latter as a nominal defendant moved to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim.the district court granted the motions,holding i both a purchase and a sale must exist to trigger liability under the statute.under section b,the expiration of a short call option constitutes a purchase to be matched with the sale that is deemed to occur when the option is written.ii goldman was a statutory insider only when the options were written,not when they expired.iii goldman was,therefore,not required to disgorge profits earned from writing the options because the statute requires statutory insider status at the time of both purchase and sale.reliance emerson,d.appellant timely appealed.
after the close of briefing but before oral argument,we invited the sec to submit an amicus curiae brief regarding the merits of the appeal.that brief,when filed,agreed with the district court.
discussion 
we review a district court dismissal of a complaint pursuant to rule b de novo.operating local annuity trust fund smith barney fund mgmt.llc,cir.
the question before us is whether,to fall under the disgorgement requirements of section b and rule d,an expiration of a call option is a purchase and the writer of a call option must be a ten percent owner both at the time it writes the option and at the time the option expires.we begin with the pertinent statutory and regulatory framework.
a section b 
stated simply,liability under section b,quoted in note,supra,attaches when there was a purchase and a sale of securities by a shareholder who owns more than percent of any one class of the issuer securities within a period.gwozdzinsky fund,cir.it is intended to prevent the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by company insiders by requiring that any profit realized by the insider from any purchase and sale,or any sale and purchase,of any equity security of such issuer other than an exempted security within any period of less than six months shall inure to and be recoverable by the issuer,irrespective of any intention on the part of such insider.b.section b applies to e very person who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than percent of any class of any equity security of the issuer,id.a,and states that it shall not be construed to cover any transaction where a statutory insider was not such both at the time of the purchase and sale,or the sale and purchase,of the security involved,id.b.
section b is generally subject to mechanical application.it imposes a form of strict liability and requires insiders to disgorge profits even if they did not trade on inside information or intend to profit on the basis of such information.credit suisse sec.usa llc simmonds,d,quoting gollust mendell,d accord magma power dow chem,cir no showing of actual misuse of inside information or of unlawful intent is necessary to compel disgorgement.as the supreme court has noted,the only method congress deemed effective to curb the evils of insider trading was a flat rule taking the profits out of a class of transactions in which the possibility of abuse was believed to be intolerably great.reliance,at.
in the past,the customary mechanical application of section b was largely saved from arbitrariness because the underlying rules were discernible and provided predictability.however,the growing complexities of financial transactions have generated numerous issues of statutory interpretation that admit of no clear resolution.the courts and the sec have responded to these developments in two ways.
first,the supreme court has permitted a departure from flat rule s in a very limited number of situations.for example,it has noted that t he statutory definitions of purchase and sale are broad and have the potential to reach many transactions not ordinarily deemed a sale or purchase.kern cnty.land occidental petroleum,d.given that breadth,courts have properly asked whether the particular type of transaction involved is one that gives rise to speculative abuse,where the instrument or transaction is unorthodox or borderline.id.at,quoting reliance,at.
second,the sec has promulgated a substantial number of rules addressing the increasing use of instruments and transactions that do not fit comfortably into section b simplistic scenario of purchases and sales of common shares.as explained below,the sec has promulgated rules governing options of the kind that give rise to the present appeal.
b sec section rules 
a call option is a type of instrument commonly described as a derivative because derivative securities are not explicitly covered by section b,the sec adopted rule in to effect the purposes of section and to address the proliferation of derivative securities and the popularity of options.ownership reports and trading by officers,directors and principal security holders,exchange act release,investment company act release.the adoption was based on the sec conclusion that,because the value of a derivative security is tied to the value of the underlying equity security,holding derivative securities is functionally equivalent to holding the underlying equity securities for purposes of section.trading in derivatives might,therefore,give rise to speculative abuse id.
appellant seeks to hold goldman liable under rule d,quoted in note,supra.to reiterate,it provides in relevant part that if an insider writes an option that expires unexercised within six months and profits from doing so on account of having been paid by the purchaser for a right to buy shares that the purchaser did not exercise,the writer will be held liable.allaire okumus,cir.the rule is designed to prevent a scheme whereby an insider with inside information favorable to the issuer writes a n option,and receives a premium for doing so,knowing,by virtue of his inside information,that the option will not be exercised within six months.gwozdzinsky,at.
as noted,two transactions a sale and a purchase of securities are required to trigger liability under section b,and the status as a statutory insider must exist at the time of each transaction.reliance,at.rule defines,for the most part,derivative transactions as either sales or purchases for the purposes of the statute.these categorizations are premised on the fact that j ust as an insider opportunity to profit commences when he purchases or sells the issuer common stock,so too the opportunity to profit commences when the insider engages in transactions in options or other derivative securities that provide an opportunity to obtain or dispose of the stock at a fixed price.at.
for example,rule a provides that the establishment of or increase in a put equivalent position shall be deemed a sale of the underlying securities for purposes of section b of the act.b a.the definitional section of the regulations explains that writing a call option is functionally the same as taking a put equivalent position.such a derivative security position increases in value as the value of the underlying equity decreases,because,when the market price of the security is above but dropping close to the strike price,the cost to the writer of selling at the strike price decreases.a h.if the market price falls below the strike price,the option holder will not exercise it,and the writer will profit on the premium.following the same logic,the regulations provide that t he closing of a derivative security position as a result of its exercise or conversion shall be exempt from the operation of section b of the act.b b.
but while rule a equates the establishment of a put equivalent position to a sale,rule d does not identify the events it lists the writing and the expiration of the option as either purchases or sales.however,in a release regarding the then proposed amendments to the section rules,the sec stated a grant of an option may be viewed as a sale of the derivative security by the writer of the option,if consideration is received for the option.ownership reports and trading by officers,directors and principal stockholders,exchange act release.in the same release,the sec noted in the case of an expiration of a short option position,the expiration would be treated as the purchase of the option because there is profit potential in such a case.id.at.the sec advances the same view here in its amicus brief.important to our disposition of this appeal,therefore,is the deference we must give to an agency interpretation of its own regulations as expressed here in the sec release quoted above and in its amicus brief unless the proffered interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulations.see auer robbins,d internal quotation marks omitted accord press quick reilly,cir.
c application 
although neither party contests that the writing of a call option constitutes a sale under section b,see,gwozdzinsky,at,both challenge the district court holding that a short call option expiration amounts to a section b purchase by the option writer.the parties claim instead that the passive expiration of a short call option is a statutory nonevent in all cases under the statute this conclusion,they argue,is compelled by our holdings in magma power and allaire.
while the parties agree on this premise,each nevertheless argues for a different outcome.acknowledging that two separate transactions are necessary elements of section b disgorgement requirement,goldman invites us to invalidate the portion of rule d that pertains to short call option expirations appellant,on the other hand,argues that the writing of a short call option constitutes a simultaneous sale and purchase under the statute,based on a theory that the writer commits itself to a subsequent purchase of the underlying stock at the instant it takes a short position on a call option.according to appellant,then,because goldman was a statutory insider when the options were written at the time of the asserted simultaneous sales and purchases for section b purposes,it is of no consequence that goldman was not a statutory insider at the time of the option expiration.
however,both parties misconstrue our precedents,and we adopt the district court holding and the sec interpretation for purposes of section b,the expiration of a call option within six months of its writing is to be deemed a purchase by the option writer to be matched against the sale deemed to occur when that option was written.rule d was adopted to eliminate the potential that an could generate profits by knowing,by virtue of his inside information,that the option will not be exercised within six months.gwozdzinsky,at.when an insider sells a call option,and that same option expires unexercised less than six months later,the writer opportunity to profit on the underlying stock is realized.it is for this reason that the sec determined,in the case of an expiration of a short option position,the expiration would be treated as the purchase of the option.at.we follow that resolution of the issue.
neither magma power nor allaire mandates a different result.in magma power,we concluded that an option holder decision not to exercise an option to buy stock does not constitute a transaction by the option holder for the purposes of the statute at.goldman is not the option holder,however,but the option writer.while the option holder decision not to purchase shares may not constitute a transaction on the part of the option holder,we have never held as much with respect to the option writer.
nor does allaire,an opinion regarding the application of rule a,control our decision.in allaire,the defendants wrote call options on allaire stock prior to becoming statutory insiders.thereafter,the defendants acquired enough shares to push their ownership stake above ten percent.the original options then expired unexercised just one month after they were written.about a month later,while the defendants were still insiders,they wrote a new set of call options on allaire stock.at.
allaire argued that,under rule a,the expiration of the initial set of options constituted a purchase of the stock because it represents a liquidation of or decrease in a put equivalent position the second set of options then,when written,amounted to the establishment of a new put equivalent position a sale that,according to allaire,could be matched to the purported purchase.id.at.we held that the expiration of the first set of options did not constitute a purchase under section a matchable to the later sale of a different set of call options.id.at.
when read out of that context,there is language in allaire that would seem in tension with our conclusion that the expiration of a call option under rule d constitutes a purchase by the option writer.but we reiterate,to the extent that allaire did not make it clear,that this language applies only to short call option expirations under rule a.indeed,t he principal issue in allaire was whether,under rule a,the expiration of a short call option is a purchase,thereby exposing its to section b liability if within six months after that expiration he or she also wrote sold another such call option.id.at emphasis added.
given the facts of allaire,there are sound reasons to view our holding there as limited to expirations under rule a.the danger of misuse of information exists at the time the option is written,and the expiration of that option is the moment of profit.matching writings with expirations of different options does not clearly advance the purposes of the statute.options written at different times are less likely to give rise to speculative abuse,and matching th
