scottsdale capital advisors corporation and three of its current and former officers collectively,scottsdale are respondents in an ongoing disciplinary proceeding before the financial industry regulatory authority,finra for allegedly selling unregistered securities in violation of section of the securities act of,securities act and finra rule.before finra completed its proceedings,scottsdale sought an injunction in federal district court,claiming the finra proceeding is unauthorized because finra may only discipline members for violations of the securities exchange act of,et exchange act.the district court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and scottsdale appeals.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
congress,through the exchange act,delegated the power to register national securities associations rsas or associations to the securities and exchange commission sec.pursuant to this authority,the sec registered finra as an rsa finra,comprised of financial brokers and dealers,promulgates rules to enforce compliance with the exchange act,the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the association.b.
despite finra seemingly broad power,congress mandated that the sec exercise close supervision over the association.before any finra rule goes into effect,the sec must approve the rule and specifically determine that it is consistent with the purposes of the exchange act.id.b,b c.the sec may also amend any existing rule to ensure it comports with the purposes and requirements of the exchange act.id.b,c.
the exchange act sets out the process by which finra may initiate disciplinary proceedings,which is codified in finra code of procedure.h finra rule,et when finra believes a member has violated any rule,regulation,or statutory provision,including the federal securities laws and the regulations thereunder,finra rule,it begins a disciplinary proceeding by filing a complaint against the member.id.if the respondent requests,finra will hold a hearing,after which a hearing panel will issue a written decision.id.the respondent or finra may appeal the hearing panel decision to the national adjudicatory council nac,a finra committee.id.an appeal to the nac acts as a stay of the hearing panel decision.id.b.the nac may affirm,modify,reverse,dismiss,or remand the hearing panel decision.id.a.the nac decision or the hearing panel decision if there was no appeal is finra final action unless finra board of governors calls for review.id.
review of final finra action invokes the sec role under the exchange act in overseeing finra authority to discipline members.finra must promptly file notice with the sec when it imposes any final disciplinary sanction on any member and finra members may appeal adverse final finra actions to the sec for review.d.an appeal to the sec shall stay the effectiveness of any sanction,other than a bar or an expulsion.finra rule a.the sec,upon its own motion or by appeal from the member,shall then review finra decision to ensure any rule allegedly violated was applied in a manner consistent with the purposes of the exchange act.e a.the sec can affirm,modify,or set aside finra decision or remand for further proceedings.id.e.if,after sec review,a party remains aggrieved,it may obtain review of the sec final order in the appropriate court of appeals.id.a see also bennett sec,slip op.at argued.with this scheme in mind,we turn to the finra proceeding at issue here.
on may,finra initiated a disciplinary proceeding against scottsdale,alleging it had liquidated over million shares of unregistered stocks in violation of section of the securities act,a.according to finra complaint,scottsdale violation of the securities act also violated finra rule,which requires members to observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade.finra rule.scottsdale filed a motion for summary disposition with the finra hearing panel,alleging,inter alia,that finra did not have jurisdiction to bring the proceeding because it can only charge violations of the exchange act,not the securities act.the hearing panel denied the motion and scheduled a hearing for june.
scottsdale then filed for declaratory and injunctive relief in the united states district court for the district of maryland,alleging,as it had before finra,that the disciplinary proceeding was ultra vires.finra filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.
on april,the district court held a hearing on the motion to dismiss.assuming without deciding that scottsdale had a cause of action under the exchange act,the district court nonetheless found it clear that congress intended to channel judicial review through th e comprehensive scheme found in and.the question of whether the finra rules that are involved here are within their authority and appropriate,the district court reasoned,is clearly within the review scheme outlined in the exchange act.the district court relied on thunder basin coal company reich,to dismiss the complaint,finding it beyond the subject matter jurisdiction of the court to consider a challenge to the ongoing disciplinary proceeding.scottsdale appeals.
scottsdale argues finra exceeded its authority by charging it with violations of the securities act and,therefore,the proceeding is ultra vires.finra counters that,as a threshold matter,scottsdale must first press its claim through the administrative process and then seek review in the appropriate court of appeals.we review a district court dismissal of a complaint for lack of jurisdiction de novo.taxpayers union soc.sec,cir.
article iii courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,possessing only that power authorized by constitution and statute.kokkonen guardian life ins.of.congress may,in its discretion,grant,withhold,or otherwise limit the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts.wade blue,cir.we are bound by those limitations unless they offend the constitution.see bowles russell.
notwithstanding the exclusive grant of jurisdiction to the courts of appeals in the exchange act,scottsdale argues the district court had jurisdiction to consider its claim because finra lacked authority to initiate the disciplinary proceeding.scottsdale believes it need not,as it describes it,exhaust administrative remedies before seeking review in this court for two reasons first,scottsdale claims the limited exception to recognized in leedom kyne,applies because finra is allegedly acting outside of its statutory authority.alternatively,scottsdale asserts its claim is not of the type congress intended to remove from district court jurisdiction under the framework articulated in thunder basin.we discuss each claim in turn.
scottsdale first argues the district court had jurisdiction under leedom.leedom involved a challenge to the national labor relations board nlrb decision in direct violation of the national labor relations act nlra to include both professional and nonprofessional employees in a collective bargaining unit.at.before the court,the nlrb conceded that it had acted in excess of its powers and had thereby worked injury to the statutory rights of the petitioners.id.at.even though the nlra precluded district court jurisdiction of such an action,the supreme court held that the district court had jurisdiction because the nlrb had acted in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition in the act.id.at emphasis added.in such a case,the court reasoned,the suit is not to review as the term is used in the governing statute because the agency has acted without authority.id.
scottsdale contends that,similar to the action in leedom,finra has exceeded its delegated authority,thereby removing the statutory bar to jurisdiction.however,such a reading extends leedom beyond its painstakingly delineated procedural boundaries.boire greyhound.leedom relied on the presumption that when congress has given a right it must be held that it intended that right to be enforced and that intention supersedes congressional provisions.at.if the district court in leedom did not exercise jurisdiction,petitioners would have no other means,within their control,to protect and enforce a congre
