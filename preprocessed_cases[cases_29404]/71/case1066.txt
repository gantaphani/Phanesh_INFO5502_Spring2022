introduction 
the united states appeals from a final order of the district court dismissing criminal indictments against three individual defendants charging counts of criminal securities violations.the dismissal was premised on the district court conclusion that the government had engaged in deceitful conduct,in violation of defendants due process rights,by simultaneously pursuing civil and criminal investigations of defendants alleged falsification of the financial records of their camera sales company.foreseeing the possibility of an appeal,the district court held that the indictments must be dismissed,but ruled in the alternative that,should there be a criminal trial,all evidence provided by the individual defendants in response to securities and exchange commission sec subpoenas should be suppressed.see united states stringer,d.
the court also suppressed evidence relating to the swedish drop shipment,an allegedly fraudulent accounting entry.the district court reasoned that the government had improperly interfered with,or intruded into,the relationship of one of the defendants by accepting incriminating evidence about the entry from a defense attorney.the attorney had an apparent conflict of interest because she represented the corporation as well as an individual defendant.
accepting the district court factual findings under the clear error standard,we hold that the government conduct does not amount to a constitutional violation under either the fourth or fifth amendments.we vacate the dismissal of the indictments because in a standard form it sent to the defendants,the government fully disclosed the possibility that information received in the course of the civil investigation could be used for criminal proceedings.there was no deceit rather,at most,there was a government decision not to conduct the criminal investigation openly,a decision we hold the government was free to make.there is nothing improper about the government undertaking simultaneous criminal and civil investigations,and nothing in the government actual conduct of those investigations amounted to deceit or an affirmative misrepresentation justifying the rare sanction of dismissal of criminal charges or suppression of evidence received in the course of the investigations.
we also reverse the order excluding evidence received from the conflicted attorney.we do so because the government advised the attorney of the existence of a potential conflict and did not interfere with the relationship.
ii.background 
a.the concurrent sec civil and attorney criminal investigations 
prior to the criminal action that forms the basis of this appeal,the sec began investigating the defendants,kenneth stringer,iii,mark samper,and william martin,and their company for possible civil securities fraud violations.the company was flir systems,flir,an oregon corporation headquartered in portland that sells infrared and cameras for military and industrial use.the sec began the investigation on june.about two weeks later,the sec held the first of a series of meetings with the oregon united states attorney office usao to coordinate the ongoing sec investigation with a possible criminal investigation.an sec assistant director and an sec staff attorney met with the supervisor of the white collar crime section of the usao to discuss the possibility of opening a criminal investigation.the meeting apparently convinced the usao supervisor to investigate.within days,the usao and the federal bureau of investigation fbi opened a criminal investigation.
federal securities laws authorize the sec to transmit evidence it has gathered to the usao to facilitate a criminal investigation by the usao.see b,d.to gather evidence for its criminal investigation,the oregon usao in june of sent a letter to the sec the access letter requesting access to the sec investigative files,and the sec promptly granted access.
the civil and criminal investigations proceeded in tandem and the sec continued to meet and communicate with the usao and fbi.the sec turned over documents the sec collected through its civil investigation.
at the beginning of the criminal investigation,the usao identified two of the three defendants,flir former ceo,stringer,and former cfo,samper,as possible targets,and named them in the usao access letter to the sec.a few months later,in october,the assistant united states attorney ausa assigned to the case made a list of the subjects of the investigation and placed asterisks and the comment knew what was going on next to the entries for samper and stringer.a month later,the ausa stated in his handwritten notes that stringer had lied about his role in the company.in april,an from the sec staff attorney to the sec assistant director stated the ausa define d the targets as ken stringer and mark samper.
the district court concluded that the third defendant,martin,former vp of sales,was also an early potential target of the criminal investigation.martin appears on the ausa early list of the subjects of the investigation above the comment knew pushing up sales.during a january meeting,the sec advised the usao and fbi that flir was blaming stringer and martin for the fraudulent conduct at the heart of the investigation.
early in the criminal investigation,the usao decided the investigation should remain confidential.at an october meeting between the sec,usao,and fbi,the ausa advised that the evidence collected by the sec might support criminal wire fraud charges.nonetheless,an internal fbi memo issued in late october stated that the ausa had concluded,based on the defendants cooperation with the sec at that point,that the sec should investigate without the assistance or inclusion of the fbi.at the january meeting between the sec,fbi,and usao,the sec revealed that flir was cooperative and was providing evidence that was damaging to stringer and martin.
by june,the usao was not yet ready to convene a grand jury and issue indictments.the sec and usao believed that flir and defendant samper would settle with the sec so long as the attorney was not directly involved.during a december phone conversation between the ausa assigned to the case and the sec assistant director,the ausa continued to believe it was premature sic to surface and that the presence of an ausa would impede a meeting between the sec and defendants.during a december phone call,the sec and usao decided that the usao would not surface,convene a grand jury and issue indictments,until the end of feb.
the sec facilitated the criminal investigation in a number of ways.the sec offered to conduct the interviews of defendants so as to create the best record possible in support of false statement cases against them,and the ausa instructed the sec staff attorney on how best to do that.the ausa asked the relevant sec office,located in los angeles,to take the depositions in oregon so that the portland office of the usao would have venue over any false statements case that might arise from the depositions,and the sec did so.both the sec and usao wanted the existence of the criminal investigation kept confidential.the sec staff attorney,at one of the portland depositions,made a note that she wanted to make sure the court reporters wo tell flir attorney that there was an ausa assigned to the case.
the sec,however,did not hide from the defendants the such an investigation.the sec sent each of the defendants subpoenas in the summer of,and attached to each was form,a form sent to all witnesses subpoenaed to testify before the sec.under the header routine uses of information,the form states that t he commission often makes its files available to other governmental agencies,particularly the united states attorneys and state prosecutors.there is a likelihood that information supplied by you will be made available to such agencies where appropriate.
form also advises witnesses of their fifth amendment rights.after the heading fifth amendment and voluntary testimony,the form states that 
information you give may be used against you in any federal civil or criminal proceeding brought by the commission of any other agency.you may refuse,in accordance with the rights guaranteed to you by the fifth amendment of the constitution of the united states,to give any information that may tend to incriminate you or subject you to fine,penalty,or forfeiture.
none of the defendants invoked his right against during his deposition,and all proceeded to testify in compliance with the subpoena.each of the defendants was represented by counsel when he testified.
during the course of stringer deposition,taken in portland in october,stringer attorney actually questioned the sec staff attorney about the involvement of the usao.in response to those questions,the sec staff attorney answered as follows 
martson my first question is whether stringer is a target of any aspect of the investigation being conducted by the sec.
staff attorney the sec does not have targets in this investigation.
martson the other questions i have relate to whether or not,in connection with your investigation,the sec is working in conjunction with any other department of the united states,such as the attorney office in any jurisdiction,or the department of justice.
staff attorney as laid out in the form,in the routine use of section there are routine uses of our investigation,and it is the agency policy not to respond to questions like that,but instead,to direct you to the other agencies you mentioned.
martson and which attorney office might i inquire into 
staff attorney that would be a matter up to your discretion.
the record does not show the sec did anything to impede an inquiry,nor does it disclose that any inquiry was made.the record reflects that the government never furnished defendants with any false information concerning the existence of a criminal investigation.
in september,a year before the criminal indictments,defendants samper and martin entered into consent decrees in the civil action,agreeing to pay penalties,disgorgement,and interest.
b.the swedish drop shipment evidence from the attorney jointly representing defendants 
throughout the course of the sec investigation,flir was represented by attorney lois rosenbaum.defendant samper,flir former cfo,had retained separate counsel.in march,rosenbaum sent samper a letter offering to jointly represent flir,stringer,and samper.in the letter,rosenbaum claimed that based on her present knowledge of the facts,she did not anticipate that any conflicts would arise between the.the letter,however,advised the clients to consult separate counsel before consenting to the joint representation and promised immediately to inform the clients if a conflict did arise.
samper separate counsel sent a letter to rosenbaum stating that samper consented to the joint representation in spite of the potential conflict of interest that may arise between the clients.samper separate counsel continued to represent him as monitoring counsel.
on june,the sec sent samper a subpoena with form enclosed.it warned of possible dangers of joint representation.the form advised that y ou may be represented by counsel who also represents other persons involved in the commission investigation.this multiple representation,however,presents a potential conflict of interest if one client interests are or may be adverse to another.
in july,when the sec learned that rosenbaum was representing flir and its employees,it immediately sent her a letter warning of the specific dangers of this.we are concerned that the broad range of interests possessed by your many clients can not be adequately represented by a single attorney.the letter specifically pointed out the potential conflict of interest in representing a company under investigation by the sec and upper level management who may have civil liability.the letter stated that,although it is far too early in the investigation for the sec staff to identify people who may possess liability,we are troubled by the scope and breadth of your representation.rosenbaum continued to represent both flir and samper,among others.
one of the eventual charges in the indictment was that two of the involved defendants created the swedish drop shipment,an entry in flir books that allegedly recognizes million in revenue without substantiation.flir controller,david meussle,first discovered the unsubstantiated entry.meussle believed that stringer and samper made the entry.rosenbaum represented meussle,as well as samper and flir.
the sec civil complaint,filed on september,two years after the joint representation began,did not allege a charge relating to the swedish drop shipment.after rosenbaum received a copy of the complaint,she called the sec staff attorney,disclosed the existence of the swedish drop shipment,and facilitated sec interviews with meussle in order to enhance the level of flir cooperation with the government.rosenbaum also sent a memo to the sec that contained possibly privileged communications she had with samper about the transaction.the criminal indictment later charged that stringer and samper created the false entry.thus rosenbaum,while representing meussle and flir,apparently in order to further the interests of flir,assisted the sec investigation.
proceedings below 
on september,a grand jury returned an indictment charging stringer,samper,and martin with securities,mail,and wire fraud.defendants filed motions to dismiss the indictments and to suppress statements they made to the sec.the district court dismissed the indictments and suppressed the sec statements because it concluded that the government,in violation of the due process clause,abused its authority to conduct parallel proceedings.united states stringer,d.the district court held that the government violated defendants fifth amendment due process rights by using trickery and deceit to conceal the criminal investigation from defendants,id.at,and conducting a criminal investigation under the auspices of a civil investigation,id.at.the district court suppressed evidence of the swedish drop shipment on the basis of its conclusion that the government interfered with samper relationship in violation of his due process rights.id.at.
this appeal by the government followed.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to 
iii.discussion 
a.the parallel investigations 
the supreme court has held that the government may conduct parallel civil and criminal investigations without violating the due process clause,so long as it does not act in bad faith.see united states kordel,d.in kordel,the supreme court held that the government did not violate the due process rights of corporate executives when it used evidence it obtained from an fda civil investigation to convict them of criminal misbranding.at,d.the court explained that the fda did not act in bad faith when it made a request for information,which ultimately was used in the criminal investigation,for the agency made similar requests as a matter of course in of its civil investigations.id.at.the court suggested that the government may act in bad faith if it brings a civil action solely for the purpose of obtaining evidence in a criminal prosecution and does not advise the defendant of the planned use of evidence in a criminal proceeding.id.at.the court thus distinguished the kordel investigation from bad faith cases where 
the g overnment has brought a civil action solely to obtain evidence for its criminal prosecution or has failed to advise the defendant in its civil proceeding that it contemplates his criminal prosecution or any other special circumstances might suggest the unconstitutionality or even the impropriety of this criminal prosecution.
the supreme court has not had occasion to address such issues since kordel,but lower courts have.in sec dresser industries,the circuit applied the principles laid down in kordel to a case involving parallel sec civil and department of justice criminal investigations.see,en banc.the court emphatically upheld the propriety of such parallel investigations.effective enforcement of the securities laws requires that the sec and justice be able to investigate possible violations simultaneously.id.at.the court said it would refuse to bar such investigations absent unusual circumstances.id.it said courts should refuse to block parallel investigations by these agencies in the absence of special circumstances in which the nature of the proceedings demonstrably prejudices substantial rights of the investigated party or of the government.id.
district courts have occasionally suppressed evidence or dismissed indictments on due process grounds where the government made affirmative misrepresentations or conducted a civil investigation solely for purposes of advancing a criminal case.see,united states carriles,d,appeal pending,wl,cir united states rand.
in this case,the district court concluded that the government should have told defendants of the criminal investigation and that it violated the standards laid down in kordel when it failed to advise defendants that it anticipated their criminal prosecution.stringer,d at.it held that the government engaged in trickery and deceit when the sec staff attorney instructed court reporters to refrain from mentioning the ausa involvement.when the sec staff attorney responded to stringer attorney question,during stringer deposition,by directing him to the attorney,the district court concluded that the sec attorney evaded the question.id.at.
in its appeal,the government argues that it had no legal duty to make any further disclosure of the existence of the pending criminal investigation.it points to the warnings in form in which the government disclosed the possibility of criminal prosecution,and it stresses that it did not make any affirmative misrepresentations.it maintains the sec attorney answer was appropriate and truthful.
the defendants argue that the district court properly held that the use of the evidence obtained by the sec in a criminal prosecution would violate defendants fifth amendment privilege against.the defendants were advised that the evidence could be used in a criminal investigation,but defendants did not invoke their fifth amendment privilege during the sec investigation.the government on appeal correctly contends that defendants waived or forfeited their fifth amendment right against.
the privilege against protects an individual from being forced to provide information that might establish a direct link in a chain of evidence leading to his conviction.hoffman united states.it may be waived if it is not affirmatively invoked.in minnesota murphy,the supreme court stressed that the privilege is lost if not affirmatively invoked,even if the defendant did not make a knowing and intelligent waiver,d.we have similarly stated that a defendant failure to invoke the privilege against waives a later claim of privilege.unruh,at holding that a defendant waived the privilege when,after being advised of his right not to answer questions,he proceeded to testify in a civil deposition.
the district court therefore erred in holding that defendants waivers of the privilege were ineffective because they were not told of the attorney active involvement.see stringer,d at.the sec form used in this case alerts sec investigative witnesses that the information can be used in a criminal proceeding.defendants were on sufficient notice,and so were their attorneys.as one federal court has explained,all that was required was sufficient notice that any information could be used against them in a subsequent criminal proceeding.united states teyibo.that court emphasized that sec form stated in no uncertain terms that the g overnment request for information could be refused pursuant to the fifth amendment protection against compelled.id.we agree.
the sec here went even further,warning each defendant at the beginning of each deposition that the facts developed in this investigation might constitute violations of criminal laws.nonetheless,defendants proceeded to testify and failed to invoke their privilege against.defendants have forfeited any claims that the use of their testimony against them in the criminal proceedings violates the privilege against.
the defendants next contend that the district court properly concluded that the government used the civil investigation solely to obtain evidence for a subsequent criminal prosecution,in violation of due process.the supreme court in kordel made it clear that dual investigations must meet the requirements of the fifth amendment due process clause.see at.while holding that i t would stultify the enforcement of federal law to curtail the government discretion to conduct dual investigations strategically,the court suggested that a defendant may be entitled to a remedy where the g overnment has brought a civil action solely to obtain evidence for its criminal prosecution.at.in this case,the government argues that it did not violate defendants due process rights because the civil investigation was not commenced solely to obtain evidence for a criminal prosecution.
it is significant to our analysis that the sec began its civil investigation first and brought in the attorney later.this tends to negate any likelihood that the government began the civil investigation in bad faith,as,for example,in order to obtain evidence for a criminal prosecution.in united states unruh,cir,we held that a defendant was not entitled to dismissal of his indictment when the department of the treasury instituted its investigation before any indictment and in order to file its own civil complaint.see also united states churchill,cir united states teyibo.
united states carriles,d,on the other hand,is a clear example of government bad faith.the district court dismissed an indictment because the citizenship and immigration services uscis interviewed the defendant solely to collect evidence in support of a criminal case against him.d at.the defendant,a cuban national,filed an application for naturalization.id.at.although uscis had already determined that the defendant was not eligible for citizenship,the agency nonetheless invited him to a interview in order to collect evidence for a criminal false
