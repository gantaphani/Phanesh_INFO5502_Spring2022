we are called upon to decide whether a rule of a commodity exchange can form the basis of federal agency action to punish its violation.if so,was the agency finding proper,under the circumstances 
petitioner andy saberi saberi intentionally violated chicago mercantile exchange cme rule.e,a speculative position limit rule.the commodity futures trading commission cftc determined saberi violation of cme rule.e was a violation of e e and imposed a cease and desist order,a fine,and banned saberi from trading on all exchanges under cftc control for days.contrary to saberi contention in his petition for review,cme rule does not limit the cftc ability to impose sanctions for a violation of e.further,contrary to saberi contention,the cftc imposition of sanctions does not violate due process.we deny the petition.
the cme is the sole american market for frozen pork belly futures.cme rule.e restricts the number of open executory futures contracts or positions a speculative trader may possess for a given commodity at a given time.the purpose of this limit is to prevent market manipulation,price instability,and market disorder as futures contracts reach their expiration date.see a.for frozen pork belly futures contracts,the cme position limit is a function of both the total deliverable supply of frozen pork bellies and the time left until the expiration of the futures contracts.see cme rule.e.as the expiration of the futures contracts approaches and the deliverable supply decreases,the cme position limits decrease.
for purposes of cme rule.e position limits,the positions of all accounts directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a person or persons and the positions of all accounts in which a person or persons have a proprietary or beneficial interest,shall be cumulated.cme rule.f emphasis added.
the cme market surveillance group is responsible for monitoring the cme speculative position limits.when a trader or firm holds a position at or near an approaching position limit,cme market surveillance staff typically call the exchange member firm carrying the trader position to notify the trader that his position is at or near the limit and to encourage the exchange member firm to take appropriate action for an orderly liquidation of any excess futures contracts.
saberi is an experienced trader.between and august,he regularly traded futures contracts in silver,gold,copper,cotton,cocoa,cattle,lean hogs,and frozen pork bellies.saberi is not,however,a member of the cme.at the relevant times,saberi maintained two commodity trading accounts,one at dean witter reynolds,dean witter account and one at ed f man international,ed f man account.
on friday,august,the cme rule.e position limit for august frozen pork belly futures contracts was contracts net long or short the cme rule.e position limit,however,decreased to contracts net long or short at the close of business on monday,august.
at the close of trading on friday,saberi was in compliance,holding a total of august frozen pork belly contracts short contracts in his dean witter account and short contracts in his ed f man account.saberi held no long contracts.on monday morning,saberi increased his position to short contracts by selling additional short contracts through his ed f man account.that morning cme manager of agricultural surveillance,reviewed cme position report,noting that as of the close of business on august,saberi held frozen pork belly positions,which would exceed the position limit if not reduced by the close of trading on august.accordingly,the cme manager of agricultural surveillance contacted both dean witter and ed f man,confirmed saberi cumulative position,and informed both firms that the cme rule.e position limit for frozen pork belly futures contracts would decrease at the close of trading to contracts and that saberi positions at all firms would be combined when determining compliance with the reduced position limit.
ed f man did not contact saberi on august,to inform him of his impending position limit violation.dean witter,however,contacted saberi and informed him that the cme rule.e position limit would decrease to contracts at the close of trading and that saberi positions at all firms would be cumulated when determining compliance.as to dean witter phone call,saberi testified before the alj,
yes.he called me.he said i have to get out some of my stuff.i ask him why i mean.i do understand.why should i do that i mean,when i losing half a million dollars nobody told me to get out,and now i trying to make a couple of bucks and they tell me to get out.
despite this notice,saberi violated cme rule.e by making no attempt to liquidate his excess short contracts through purchases of long contracts by the close of trading,electing instead to profit by riding the longs in,allowing the price of long contracts to drop for lack of bids 
cme division of market regulation sent saberi a warning letter stating he had violated cme rule.e by exceeding the position limit in effect at the close of trading on august.the letter also informed saberi that the matter had been referred to the cftc.
the cftc subsequently filed a administrative complaint against saberi,charging saberi with having violated e by violating cme rule.e.a cftc administrative law judge alj found saberi had violated cme rule.e,issued saberi a cease and desist order to refrain from violating cme rule.e,ordered saberi to pay a civil penalty,and barred saberi from trading on the cme for days.
saberi appealed to the cftc.the cftc upheld the alj factual conclusions,the cease and desist order,and the imposition of a civil penalty.the cftc,however,modified the alj trading ban,prohibiting saberi from trading on any market regulated by the cftc,not just the cme,for days.this petition for review ensued.
we review an agency interpretation of a statute de novo,vernazza sec,cir,amended by cir,rejecting those constructions that are contrary to clearly expressed congressional intent or that frustrate the policy that congress sought to implement.see chevron natural res.def.council,d.where,however,a statute is ambiguous or silent on a particular point,review of an agency interpretation is limited to whether the agency conclusion is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.
under,the cftc conducts administrative proceedings and imposes sanctions for violations of the commodity exchange act.see.here,interpreting e,the cftc determined saberi undisputed cme rule.e position limit violation was a violation of e and imposed civil sanctions under.
in relevant part,e states 
it shall be a violation of this chapter for any person to violate any rule of any contract market fixing limits on the amount of trading which may be done or positions which may be held by any person under contracts of sale of any commodity for future delivery if such bylaw,rule,regulation,or resolution has been approved by the commission.
e.accordingly,the plain language of e unambiguously imposes liability for violations of contract market position limit rules such as cme rule.hunt,at.
saberi,however,contends that pursuant to cme rule a first occurrence violation of cme rule.e is not a rule violation and,therefore,his first occurrence violation of cme rule.e was not a violation of e.
in relevant part,cme rule states 
for purposes of this rule,positions in excess of any allowed by a valid hedge approval shall be deemed speculative position limit violations.all speculative position limit violations shall be handled pursuant to paragraphs,and 
first occurrence 
the first occurrence of a speculative position limit violation will result in a warning letter to be issued by the division of market regulation.in the case of a customer trading at more than one clearing member,the customer,in addition to the commodity representatives and clearing members,will be issued a warning letter.a rule violation will not be recorded for the first occurrence of a speculative position limit violation however,a record of the incident will be maintained.
first violation following a warning letter 
the first speculative position limit violation within months of the receipt of a warning letter shall co
