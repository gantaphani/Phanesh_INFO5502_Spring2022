discussion 
harris contends gte delivery of his shares to the controller was unauthorized because gte did not give harris the notice he claims was required by the upl and that,as a result,gte is not entitled to the immunity afforded by the upl.we disagree.
first,the immunity conferred by the upl is absolute.upon delivery to the controller of duplicate stock certificates,the holder shall be relieved from all liability of every kind to any person for any losses or damages resulting to that person by the issuance and delivery to the controller of the duplicate certificate,subd.b fong westly,supra,th at,d evidence of a violation of the upl notice provisions is irrelevant to the issue of the controller immunity harris westly,supra,th at,d the immunity conferred upon the controller by section is absolute and unaffected by the controller failure to give notice of sale ley state of california th,d.the fact that gte allegedly failed to comply with the upl notice requirements thus can not diminish the absolute immunity conferred by section,subdivision b 
second,as gte observes,harris the immunity is conditional and vanishes if the escheatment was render the immunity meaningless because immunity comes into play when,and only when,the defendant is charged with wrongdoing.stecks young th,d olney sacramento county bar d.the only time a defendant faces potential liability and the only time a statutory immunity is called into play is when a plaintiff asserts the defendant erred,and w e can not adopt an interpretation of the statute which allows the statute to have effect only in those situations where it serves no function storch silverman d.
third,the legislature adoption of a rule of absolute immunity is consistent with the purpose of the upl,which is to give the state rather than the holders of unclaimed property the benefit of its use.douglas aircraft cranston cal d.without this protection,holders of unclaimed property concerned about lawsuits such as this class action would likely err on the side of retaining rather than delivering unclaimed property to the controller,thereby depriving the state of the benefit of its use.the legislature,faced with a choice between absolute immunity which promotes delivery of unclaimed property to the controller but provides only limited redress to the owners of the property and conditional immunity which would have discouraged delivery but allowed redress,plainly and unambiguously opted for absolute immunity,subd.b kaucky southwest airlines cir,statutory scheme compelling transfer of funds to government and confining suits to claims for refund protects corporations from being whipsawed.
for these reasons,the demurrer was properly sustained without leave to amend.

this case involves the duties of a corporation,defendant gte corporation,to plaintiffs,minority shareholders of before the minority shareholders gte stock was delivered to the state of california under california unclaimed property law upl code civ,et the trial court sustained gte demurrer on the ground that gte was afforded immunity under the upl.but,given the claims asserted in the second amended complaint complaint,the upl immunity provisions can not reasonably be interpreted to apply to the circumstances here,where plaintiffs allege that gte breached a fiduciary duty to give them a fair opportunity to prevent the operation of the upl in the first instance.imposing a duty on gte to honor plaintiffs rights as stockholders is consistent with one of the purposes of the upl to reunite owners with unclaimed funds or property.bank of america cory d.accordingly,i conclude that plaintiffs claims are not in derogation of any rights of the state or gte under the upl and that the demurrer was erroneously sustained because facts are alleged that plaintiffs damages arose from conduct which is outside the scope of the immunity provisions of the upl.and gte argument that the demurrer can be sustained on the alternative ground of the bar of the statute of limitations is also without merit.
california unclaimed property law 
escheat,at common law in england,formerly terminated a tenancy so that on the death of a tenant without heirs,or as a result of a tenant felony that worked a corruption of the blood,the land escheated to the lord of the fee.title by escheat was one of the fruits of and consequences of feudal tenure.but,as the feudal tenures do not exist in this country,there are no private persons who succeed to the inheritance by escheat and the state steps in the place of the feudal lord,by virtue of its sovereignty,as the original and ultimate proprietor of all the lands within its jurisdiction.escheat of tangible or intangible personal property arises from the same conceptual scheme.taylor westly cir,fns.omitted taylor.the california statutes distinguish between escheat and permanent escheat.where the property has not permanently escheated to the state,the state unclaimed property law sets up a custodial escheat system.the statute explicitly states that property received by the state under this chapter shall not permanently escheat to the state.it provides that the controller must safeguard and conserve unclaimed property in a trust fund for the interests of all parties having an interest in the property.id.at fns.omitted.
the court in fong westly th,d fong provided the following summary of the upl the law has two objectives protect unknown property owners by locating them and restoring their property to them,and give the state,rather than the owners of the unclaimed property,the benefits of holding the property,since experience shows most abandoned property will never be claimed.citation.the statute does not operate a true escheat.the law expressly provides title to property received by the state under its provisions does not pass to the state.the state holds the property as a custodian until the property rightful owner can claim the property.in general,the law declares certain personal property either located in the state or owned by a california resident escheats to the state when its owner fails to take enumerated steps during a period of time indicating continued active ownership,such as increasing or decreasing the amount on deposit,corresponding with the holder of the property,or otherwise indicating a continuing interest in the property.see.holders of such property must give property owners mailed notice of the pending escheat if the holder has the owner address in its records.if the owner fails to claim the property,the statute requires holders to make a verified report to the state controller,identifying the property owner name and last known address and describing the property.the holder files the report and,at the same time,transfers the property to the controller.fong,supra,th at,d.
with respect to stock,section provides in pertinent part that,as long as other conditions are met,any intangible interest in a business association,as evidenced by the stock records or membership records of the association,escheats to this state if the interest in the association is owned by a person who for more than three years has neither claimed a dividend or other sum nor corresponded in writing with the association or otherwise indicated an interest as evidenced by a memorandum or other record on file with the association,and the association does not know the location of the owner at the end of the period,subd.b.
within one year after receiving the holder report and the property described therein,the controller must cause a notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation to inform the property owners of the escheat.the controller in general sells all escheated property to the highest bidder,except that with regards to securities traded on an established exchange,the controller sells the securities within two years of its receipt on that exchange at the prevailing prices.the controller is required to publish prior notice of any sale,except that no notice is required for a sale of securities on a national exchange.ibid.any person who claims an interest in property escheated to the state may file a claim to the property or to the net proceeds from its sale,subd.a.if the controller grants the claim,the controller returns the property or the proceeds from its sale to the claimant,along with a payment of interest at a specified rate.former,subd.c stats,ch.fong,supra,th at,d.

the allegations of plaintiffs complaint are viewed in the context of the foregoing statutory scheme.
allegations of the plaintiffs 
gene harris is one of five named plaintiffs who bring this action on behalf of themselves and as members of an alleged class of approximately minority shareholders of gte and verizon communications,the successor to gte after a merger in june.each of the plaintiffs was an employee of gte whose employment relationship entitled them to gte and verizon fringe benefits on a basis plaintiffs,who worked for gte during the and,were entitled to gte stock as an incentive to actively participate in the creation and growth of the company.
liberally construed in favor of the plaintiffs,the complaint alleged that gte knew plaintiffs identities,location,and vital information,and that gte own records provided information from which their whereabouts could be easily ascertained,but gte failed to inform plaintiffs of their stock ownership,retained possession of their stock certificates,failed to calculate their dividends and interest,failed to provide them with notices and information required by law,failed to notify them of annual and special shareholders meetings,prevented plaintiffs from voting,and deprived plaintiffs of knowledge and the ability to take action with respect to their ownership interests in the corporations,including the ability to liquidate their interests,should they have determined that it was in their favor to do so.
during the months before they filed their action,plaintiffs learned that they owned stock in gte that was improperly transferred without their authorization and sold without their knowledge.the proceeds from the sale of plaintiffs stock were deposited in government accounts in the state of california where the stock is listed under their names,as shareholders of gte and verizon,and stating the stock is lost and unclaimed property.
plaintiffs asserted claims for breach of fiduciary duty,negligence,conversion,constructive fraud,accounting,and unfair competition under business and professions code section et.
gte filed a demurrer to the complaint on two grounds the complaint was barred by the the statutes of limitations governing the various claims because the causes of action allegedly accrued sometime during the and and the statutes expired long before plaintiffs belatedly filed suit in.gte was immune from suit pursuant to the provisions of section,subdivision b,of the upl in opposition to the demurrer,plaintiffs argued,among other things,that affording immunity to gte in the instant circumstances would violate principles of due process and would also render meaningless all law requiring corporate fiduciaries to diligently attempt to inform shareholders of corporate actions regarding their stock,and to obtain authorization before selling or transferring their stock,as well as render meaningless many other statutory provisions governing corporate
