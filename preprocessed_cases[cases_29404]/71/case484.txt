plaintiffs appeal the december,order of the district court for the district of new jersey,dismissing their action with prejudice pursuant to the securities litigation uniform standards act of slusa,f.this appeal presents the question whether slusa requires the dismissal of the entire action when the action includes some state law class action claims that clearly may not be maintained under slusa as well as other claims that are not so prohibited.we hold that slusa does not require such a dismissal.accordingly we will vacate the dismissal and remand this case for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs are a proposed class of shareholders of mutual funds managed by lord,abbett.llc lord abbett.on february,they filed this lawsuit against lord abbett and lord abbett distributor llc,the investment adviser and distributor of the lord abbett mutual funds following the consolidation of multiple related cases,plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint on august.
in their consolidated amended class action complaint,plaintiffs alleged among other misdeeds that lord abbett charged its existing investors excessive fees that were improperly used to pay brokers to market lord abbett funds to other investors.plaintiffs claimed that lord abbett was motivated to charge excessive fees because its management fees were based on the amount of assets being the number of investors grew so did the so did the fees.plaintiffs alleged violations of both federal and state law,including violations of sections b and a of the investment company act of,brought on behalf of the proposed class,and four state law counts,also brought on behalf of the class.
defendants filed a motion to dismiss,based in part on the ground that plaintiffs action was by slusa,f.as we recently explained in lasala bordier et cie,cir,slusa was enacted as a supplement to the private securities litigation reform act of,pslra or reform act.congress enacted the pslra to prevent the filing of strike suits abusive class actions which are brought with the hope that the expense of litigation may force defendants to settle despite the actions lack of merit.in congress view,such actions unnecessarily increase the cost of raising capital and chill corporate disclosure,reprinted in.the pslra imposed a number of requirements on federal securities litigation plaintiffs,designed to deter such frivolous suits 
in reaction to the rigors of the pslra,plaintiffs began filing cases in state courts under less strict state securities laws.congress then enacted slusa,stating that 
i n order to prevent certain state private securities class action lawsuits alleging fraud from being used to frustrate the objectives of the private securities litigation reform act of,it is appropriate to enact national standards for securities class action lawsuits involving nationally traded securities,while preserving the appropriate enforcement powers of state securities regulators and not changing the current treatment of individual lawsuits.
slusa,cong,stat.the slusa conference report explains that 
s ince passage of the reform act,plaintiffs lawyers have sought to circumvent the act provisions by exploiting differences between federal and state laws by filing frivolous and speculative lawsuits in state court,where essentially none of the reform act procedural or substantive protections against abusive suits are available a single state can impose the risks and costs of its peculiar litigation system on all national issues.the solution to this problem is to make federal court the exclusive venue for most securities fraud class action litigation involving nationally traded securities.
at.internal quotation omitted.
accordingly,slusa barred certain class actions and mass actions from state courts,providing in relevant part 
no covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any state or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any state or federal court by any private party alleging 
a a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security or 
b that the defendant used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.
f.under slusa,a covered class action brought in state court may be removed to federal court and is subject to the above limitations.f.
slusa defines the term covered class action as 
i any single lawsuit in which 
i damages are sought on behalf of more than persons or prospective class members,and questions of law or fact common to those persons or members of the prospective class,without reference to issues of individualized reliance on an alleged misstatement or omission,predominate over any questions affecting only individual persons or members or 
ii one or more named parties seek to recover damages on a representative basis on behalf of themselves and other unnamed parties similarly situated,and questions of law or fact common to those persons or members of the prospective class predominate over any questions affecting only individual persons or members or 
ii any group of lawsuits filed in or pending in the same court and involving common questions of law or fact,in which 
i damages are sought on behalf of more than persons and 
ii the lawsuits are joined,consolidated,or otherwise proceed as a single action for any purpose.
slusa is frequently described as claims.however,as the supreme court has explained,slusa does not actually such claims it merely denies plaintiffs the right to use the device to vindicate certain claims.merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,dabit,d dabit ii.plaintiffs retain the right to bring such a claim as an individual claim or federal securities fraud class action claim.lasala,at.
on august,the district court dismissed the four state claims pled in plaintiffs consolidated amended class action complaint as by slusa the district court also dismissed the remaining federal claims for failure to state a claim.with respect to plaintiffs claims for violations of sections b and a of the investment company act of,the district court determined that there is no direct cause of action under section b,which was a predicate for the section a claim,and dismissed those claims without prejudice.
plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on september,asserting only two derivative claims alleging violations of sections b and a of the investment company act.in general,plaintiffs alleged that lord abbett had received excessive management fees from its investors,primarily because it had failed to pass along the benefits of the economies of scale achieved as the funds grew.
meanwhile,on september,defendants moved for reconsideration of the district court decision to dismiss the claims without prejudice,in part on the grounds that slusa requires dismissal of the entire action not merely dismissal of the improper state law securities claims.without reaching the issue,the district court denied the motion as lacking sufficient grounds for reconsideration but subsequently granted the defendants leave to brief the issue for de novo consideration.accordingly,on may,defendants filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint pursuant to slusa 
the district court granted the motion and dismissed the second amended complaint with prejudice on december.the district court referred to our opinion in rowinski salomon smith barney,cir,where,in response to the plaintiffs argument that the court should examine each count separately to determine whether it should be,we noted in dictum 
w e question whether preemption of certain counts and remand of others is consistent with the plain meaning of slusa.the statute does not preempt particular claims or counts but rather preempts actions,f,suggesting that if any claims alleged in a covered class action are preempted,the entire action must be dismissed.
id.at.as the district court acknowledged,we did not reach this issue in rowinski because in that case the plaintiff had incorporated allegations into every count of his complaint.id however,the district court found rowinski helpful in that it provide d strong support,albeit in dicta,for the proposition that slusa preempts entire class actions rather than individual claims.
the district court then turned to the statutory language.the district court noted that,by its own terms,slusa preemption applies to any covered class action,which is in turn defined as any single lawsuit or group of lawsuits,and concluded that this language reflects congress intent to regulate entire lawsuits.the district court reasoned further that congress has used the word claim or claims elsewhere in the securities laws,including in the pslra,and that congress presumably would have used a narrower term than action if it intended otherwise.
the district court acknowledged that the court of appeals for the second circuit had addressed the present issue in dabit merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir dabit i,holding that slusa does not require the dismissal of an entire case where only some of the claims are improper state law claims under slusa in dabit i,the court acknowledged that slusa provisions might be read as prohibiting maintenance of an entire action that includes allegations.at.the court,however,declined to hold that slusa operated in this manner,reasoning that,
on this reading,slusa would effectively preempt any state law claim conjoined in a given case with a securities fraud claim,whatever its nature.we assume,however,that the historic police powers of the states are not preempted unless it was congress clear and manifest purpose to do so.
id.quoting city of milwaukee illinois,d.
the supreme court reversed the court of appeal holding on other grounds,ruling that slusa state law claims alleging fraud brought by investors who held securities,as well as by those who purchased or sold securities.dabit ii,at.the supreme court explained,
in concluding that slusa holder claims of the kind alleged in dabit complaint,we do not lose sight of the general presum ption that congress does not cavalierly causes of action.medtronic,lohr,d.but that presumption carries less force here than in other contexts because slusa does not actually any state cause of action.it simply denies plaintiffs the right to use the device to vindicate certain claims.the act does not deny any individual plaintiff,or indeed any group of fewer than plaintiffs,the right to enforce any cause of action that may exist.
moreover,the tailored exceptions to slusa preemptive command demonstrate that congress did not by any means act cavalierly here.the statute carefully exempts from its operation certain class actions based on the law of the state in which the issuer of the covered security is incorporated,actions brought by a state agency or state pension plan,actions under contracts between issuers and indenture trustees,and derivative actions brought by shareholders on behalf of a corporation.f a c,f c.
dabit ii,at.
in dismissing plaintiffs entire action in the present case,the district court acknowledged that,in dabit ii,the supreme court had not specifically addressed whether preemption of one claim under slusa requires dismissal of the entire action.however,because the presumption against had underpinned the second circuit analysis,the district court found that the supreme court decision in dabit ii had weakened,if not undercut entirely,the second circuit reasoning that slusa does not require dismissal of the entire action.
the district court also concluded that reading slusa as entire actions would not produce absurd results,rejecting plaintiffs claim that applying slusa to require the dismissal of an entire action would encourage the filing of multiple lawsuits based on the same set of facts in order to segregate state and federal claims.the district court found that congress had addressed this potential problem by treating any group of lawsuits as a covered class action for purposes of slusa.
plaintiffs appealed.they contend that the district court erred in concluding that slusa requires dismissal of an entire action.defendants urge us to affirm the district court holding or,in the alternative,to affirm the motion to dismiss on the grounds that there is no private right of action under section a of the investment company act and that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under section b.because we agree that slusa does not require dismissal of an entire action that includes some claims that are not by slusa in addition to some that are,we will vacate the district court dismissal and remand this action to the district court for further proceedings.
ii.discussion 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to the investment company act of,the investment advisers act of,and b.we have jurisdiction over this appeal from a final judgment of the district court pursuant to.slusa preemption is jurisdictional,and we review dismissals for lack of jurisdiction de novo.lasala,at cir.
as described above,slusa was enacted to prevent the flight of securities cases from federal to state courts,thereby preventing abusive lawsuits and mak ing federal court the exclusive venue for most securities fraud class action litigation involving nationally traded securities,at.see also securities litigation uniform standards act of,cong,stat.neither the supreme court nor this court has squarely addressed the issue raised in this appeal whether the inclusion of a slusa claim in a complaint,also alleging claims,requires dismissal of the entire action.in considering this issue as a matter of first impression,and mindful of slusa purpose,we conclude that neither the statutory language,the legislative history,nor the relevant case law supports the complete dismissal of such an action.
the role of the courts in interpreting a statute is to give effect to congress intent.rosenberg xm ventures,cir.the first step in statutory construction is to consider the plain language of the statute.united states gregg,cir.if the language of the statute expresses congress intent with sufficient precision,the inquiry ends there and the statute is enforced according to its terms.id.where the statutory language does not express congress intent unequivocally,a court traditionally refers to the legislative history and the atmosphere in which the statute was enacted in an attempt to determine the congressional purpose.id.
the plain language of slusa does not clearly indicate whether congress intended slusa to entire actions that include an offending claim.slusa provides,no covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any state or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any state or federal court f emphasis added.the term covered class action,in turn,is defined to include a single lawsuit or group of lawsuits.id.at f b emphasis added.as we suggested in rowinski,the terms no action,lawsuit,and group of lawsuits indeed suggest that slusa intends that entire actions,as opposed to particular claims,should fail.at.however,the word action is modified by the phrase based upon the statutory or common law of any state.f.the plain language of slusa does not refer to actions,such as this one,based in part on state law.
nor does the legislative history compel us to conclude that slusa requires dismissal of the entire action in such a case.the legislative history is silent as to whether congress intended an action to be dismissed in its entirety when it includes claims or whether only the claims must be dismissed.we struggle to see how permitting federal claims that do not specifically trigger the slusa preemption to proceed would lead to either abusive litigation or to the application of different legal standards to national securities.failing to dismiss the entire complaint would simply allow class action federal claims,and state law claims that do not trigger the slusa preemption,to proceed.nothing in slusa language or history indicates any intent to eviscerate such claims.
of course,requiring the dismissal of an entire action pursuant to slusa might deter class action plaintiffs and their attorneys from attempting to test the boundaries of which individual state law claims are by slusa.however,nothing in either the plain language of the statute or the legislative history s
