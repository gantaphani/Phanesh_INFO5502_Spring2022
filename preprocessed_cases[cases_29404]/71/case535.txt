opinion of the court 
this shareholders class action case comes on before this court on appeal from a february,order of the district court granting summary judgment to the ernst young llp ernst.see in re ikon office solutions sec,d.appellants are representatives of a certified class consisting of all persons who purchased common stock,convertible preferred stock,call options of ikon office solutions,ikon from october,through august.in their complaint they alleged that ernst,ikon accounting firm,violated section b of the securities exchange act,b,and rule,promulgated thereunder,by issuing an unqualified audit report approving ikon financial statements for fiscal year knowing that they overstated ikon income or,even if ernst did not have actual knowledge of the overstatement,by recklessly performing its audit.
the district court granted ernst motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the appellants failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to two elements of a prima facie section b claim scienter that ernst harbored an intent to deceive or acted with reckless disregard for the truth and accuracy of ikon financial disclosures and causation that the inflated value of ikon stock price dropped when the market reevaluated the security after a corrective disclosure.in addition,and in the alternative,the court granted ernst motion for partial summary judgment,ruling that it could not be liable to certain members of the class under section b by reason of an october,press release ikon issued because ernst itself did not communicate misrepresentations to investors in the press only activity proscribed by the statute.
because the record fails to establish a triable issue with respect to scienter,we will affirm the judgment of the district court without addressing loss causation or whether ernst can be held liable under section b for ikon october,press release.
background 
factual history 
ikon,which is headquartered in malvern,pennsylvania,supplies copiers,printing systems,and related services throughout the united states,canada,and europe.its shares are traded publicly on the new york stock exchange.between and,ikon embarked on a transformation business plan in which it acquired and consolidated close to independent copier,and outsourcing and imaging companies.see jarrell report.ikon intended to become an international provider of office technology solutions,serving as a single source for networking services,office technology,and software needs,rather than simply distributing and servicing office products in domestic markets.see jarrell report.
ernst,a big five accounting firm served as the independent,outside auditor of ikon september fiscal financial statements for a number of years,including the time encompassing the audit of ikon consolidated financial statements.see am.cplt.at.ernst designed its audits to evaluate whether ikon financial statements accurately and fairly reflected its financial position in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in addition,ernst performed certain internal audit functions for ikon,such as monitoring and evaluating its compliance with its own internal accounting policies and procedures.see am.cplt.at.
this dispute focuses on the soundness of ernst audit for fiscal year.on october,after ernst had completed the bulk of its audit work ikon issued a press release discussing and results.see.the release reported income from continuing operations totaling million for fiscal,a percent increase from fiscal.see.ernst reviewed the press release before it was issued without proposing any modifications.see dillon dep.
on december,ernst publicly issued its unqualified,or clean,audit opinion stating that it had conducted its audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing principles gaas and concluding that ikon financial statements fairly reflected its financial position.see graham report.relevant portions of that unqualified audit opinion,which appeared in ikon annual report to the securities and exchange commission on form,follow 
we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ikon office solutions,inc and the related consolidated statements of income,changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended september,we conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.an audit includes examining,on a test basis,evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.in our opinion,the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,in all material respects,the financial position of ikon office solutions,and subsidiaries at september,and,and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended september,in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
see am.cplt.at.
following the release of the audit opinion and ikon contemporaneous december,filing with the sec,share values of ikon common stock experienced a net gain.see chart common.within a matter of months,however,ikon prospects soured.on april,before the stock market opened,ikon announced that its second quarter earnings for fiscal year would be per share,instead of as expected by analysts.ikon also warned that third and fourth quarter earnings would fall below expectations.see pr newswire.ikon cited several reasons for the earnings shortfall,including issues related to its transformation process,competitive pressures,and costs associated with product rationalization.ikon,however,did not mention accounting charges to rectify discrepancies in its financial statements.
later that morning the investment banking firm of goldman,sachs downgraded ikon to market perform from recommend list,while prudential securities downgraded ikon from buy to hold.see jarrell report.as a result,the price of ikon common stock dropped precipitously from a share on april,to close at a share on april,decline of percent.see chart common.
ikon stock continued to decline over the remainder of the spring and summer of.on june,after the market closed,ikon announced that it would miss its earnings estimate for the third quarter of.see jarrell report.the following trading day,june,shares of its common stock declined to close at.see chart common.on july,ikon ceo john stuart resigned and was replaced by ikon james forese.see jarrell report.
with its market performance and economic prospects deteriorating,ikon engaged ernst to review the books of each of its north american and united kingdom business services,a project known as the special procedures.see letter to dinkelacker.specifically,ikon instituted the special procedures when internal audit work in ikon florida district revealed signs of operational deficiencies and accounting errors,including problems with reconciling intercompany transactions.see june,ikon report on florida district.
to assist in this process,the ikon board of directors hired the accounting firm of arthur andersen andersen to review ernst work.see mcaleer dep.andersen was permitted to review all work papers prepared in connection with ernst audit,ikon first and second limited quarterly reviews,and the special procedures.
on august,ikon issued a press release indicating that it was conducting a full review of operations previously announced.see ikon press release.on august,after the conclusion of an exhaustive review process,ikon announced the results of the special procedures it would take a million charge against earnings million in charges applied to its third quarter earnings,and would restate its previously reported,unaudited second quarter earnings to reflect million in charges.see ikon press release.the million in charges included million to cover defaults on leases,million for unpaid accounts receivable,million for adjustments due to the breakdown in internal controls at four operating units,million due to asset impairment,and million in miscellaneous adjustments.the press release did not disclose whether the million charge also corrected errors made in connection with ikon consolidated financial statements.the price of ikon common stock rose by cents,from to a share on august following the announcement of the results of the special procedures.
procedural history 
shortly after ikon announced these disclosures,appellants commenced actions against ikon and certain individual defendants related to it,alleging violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of,b and a,and of rule.in june,prior to the close of discovery,appellants filed an amended complaint,adding ernst as a defendant on the claim under section b and rule alleging,in essence,that ernst knew or should have been aware that ikon financial statements substantially overstated pretax income.
thereafter,the district court consolidated the actions and appointed the lead plaintiffs,the city of philadelphia through its board of pensions and retirement,oliver scofield,and lawrence porter,to represent the interests of a class certified to incorporate all those who acquired ikon securities between october,the day of ikon press release regarding its results,and august,the day before ikon announced the million in charges against earnings.
in november,the ikon defendants agreed to a settlement with the class for.the district court approved the settlement on may,leaving ernst as the sole remaining defendant.see in re ikon office solutions.sec.
on february,one month prior to trial,the district court on ernst motion entered summary judgment in its favor completely extinguishing the case on two independent failure to adduce sufficient evidence of both scienter and loss causation.in addition,the court,as we have indicated,granted ernst a partial summary judgment.appellants filed a timely notice of appeal on march.
jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction over this appeal of a final judgment of the district court pursuant to.the district court exercised federal question jurisdiction under and,because the case arose under the securities exchange act of,and rule promulgated thereunder.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review an order granting summary judgment de novo,applying the same test the district court employed.see lucent info,lucent tech,cir.c provides,in pertinent part,that a court may grant summary judgment only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
in determining whether summary judgment is warranted,we view the record and draw inferences in a light most favorable to the party.see arnold diamond,gulf coast trailing,cir.if a party fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case on which it bears the burden of proof at trial,there is no issue as to a genuine issue of a material fact and thus the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see anderson liberty lobby,d.
moreover,a party will not be able to withstand a motion for summary judgment merely by making allegations rather,the party opposing the motion must go beyond its pleading and designate specific facts by use of affidavits,depositions,admissions,or answers to interrogatories showing there is a genuine issue for trial.see celotex catrett,d see also gfl advantage fund,colkitt,cir.only evidence sufficient to convince a reasonable factfinder to find all of the elements of the prima facie case merits consideration beyond the rule stage.keller orix credit alliance,cir en banc.
section b prohibits the use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,of any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe b.rule,promulgated under section b,makes it unlawful for any person t o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.b.
to state a valid claim under section b and rule,a plaintiff must show that the defendant made a misstatement or an omission of a material fact with scienter in connection with the purchase or the sale of a security upon which the plaintiff reasonably relied and that the plaintiff reliance was the proximate cause of his or her injury.see gfl advantage fund,at weiner quaker oats,cir.
liability under section b may extend to secondary actors in the securities markets,as for example where an outside accounting firm prepares a fraudulent audit report that it knows will reach and likely influence the investing public.see central bank of denver,first interstate bank of denver,d a ny person or entity,including a lawyer,accountant,or bank may be liable as a primary violator under semerenko cendant,cir the in connection with prong is satisfied where the misrepresentations are material and disseminated to the public in a medium upon which a reasonable investor would rely.of course,imposition of liability on this basis is consistent with the primary purpose of the securities exchange act of which is to protect against manipulated stock prices by imposing strict and extensive disclosure requirements,irrespective of the type of actor that disseminates information to the investing public.see,reprinted wl.
however,by its terms,section b does not prohibit aiding and abetting.see central bank,at.at to establish securities fraud,plaintiffs must establish a more exacting threshold of scienter a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate or defraud,ernst ernst hochfelder,d,or,at a minimum,highly unreasonable conduct,involving not merely simple,or even inexcusable negligence,but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it.sec infinity group,cir,cert.denied,d citing mclean alexander,cir see healey catalyst recovery of,cir section recklessness closer to intentional conduct than indifference see also in re advanta sec,cir.simple computation errors or slight accounting mistakes will not suffice to establish scienter 
appellants advance the following claims to demonstrate that ernst knew of or was reckless in failing to discover deficiencies in ikon financial statements in connection with ikon october,press release and ernst december,audit opinion that ernst failed to investigate sufficiently evidence of fraud by ikon or take into account other conspicuous risk factors or red flags that would have alerted ernst to the fallacious computations and that ernst impermissibly relied on ikon internal controls in preparing its audit calculations.as a result of these alleged deficiencies and other violations of gaas,appellants attribute million in known errors and million in reckless errors to ernst audit opinion.
we have concluded,however,after an intensive study of the formidable record in this case,that even when viewed with hindsight it does not supply a basis from which to draw a reasonable inference that ernst recklessly or knowingly issued a materially false and misleading audit opinion after reviewing ikon financial statements while a determination of whether a party acted with scienter,intertwined as it may be with an assessment of witness credibility,often can not be undertaken appropriately on summary judgment proceedings in this case,even accepting arguendo that,as appellants assert,million of the million charge taken at the conclusion of the special procedures should have been recorded as of september,we are satisfied that the record establishes that ernst failure to do so was not without a good faith belief or reasonable basis.
at the outset,the magnitude of ernst audit for fiscal year bears mentioning six full scope audits,including one performed at ikon leasing arm,ikon capital,eight localized audits at ikon business units that generated percent of its revenues a host of procedures performed at ikon corporate headquarters full reviews of previous years audits extensive external testing of ikon account balances as the primary support for the audit opinion totaling percent more than the hours budgeted to the northern california district as opposed to,where the implementation of a new computer system impeded review all told,over hours of labor expended on an account to which hours originally were budgeted a percent overall increase.see mulherin decl,workpaper,workpapers workpaper.
it is equally notable that arthur andersen,after conducting its independent review during the special procedures,found nothing that would be a significant issue regarding the quality of ernst opinion,and that in coming to this conclusion andersen was assessing the work of a major rival in the national accounting market.see mcaleer dep.though not performing an outright audit of the opinion or financial statements for compliance with gaas or gaap,andersen allocated hundreds of hours of labor to its examination of the work papers produced by ernst in.see mcaleer dep.after this examination andersen concluded that the balance sheet was solid as of september,and that the computation of reserves was neither aggressive,nor conservative but rather essentially in the middle,solid,and,in fact,concurred in ikon decision not to restate the financial statements.see,mcaleer dep.one andersen partner involved in reviewing the working papers,thomas costello,stated that andersen became aware of nothing that was viewed to be a significant deficiency with respect to gaas.see costello dep.likewise,the chairman of the audit committee for the ikon board,james birle,indicated that andersen did not find anything fundamentally wrong with what ernst ha d done,so they gave them a passing grade.see birle dep.while appellants are correct that andersen conclusions do not provide cover categorically to insulate ernst from liability the fact that andersen endorsed ikon decision not to restate the financial statements nevertheless is highly probative of the competence of ernst audit opinion and undermines any suggestion that ernst could not reasonably have opined that ikon financial statements fairly presented its financial condition in accordance with gaap.see in re worlds of wonder sec,cir in establishing scienter,t he plaintiff must prove that the accounting judgments which were made were such that no reasonable accountant would have made the same decisions if confronted with the same facts.
we conclude that none of the specific errors appellants assert raises a material dispute of fact on which to predicate a finding of scienter.the record makes clear with respect to appellants claim that ernst ignored allegations that ikon cfo kurt dinkelacker dinkelacker had been cooking the books and supplying fraudulent numbers during the audit that ernst took appropriate steps to determine whether the allegations had any merit.to begin with,the alleged accuser,ikon official peter shoemaker,denied under oath that he ever made the remark.see shoemaker dep.furthermore,george berry berry,the ernst partner responsible for the ikon audit,testified that he understood the remark to mean that dinkelacker had been accused of characterizing operational expenses as transformation expenses.see berry dep.however,the allegation was deemed groundless as ernst just recently had reviewed ikon transformation expenses and found no improprieties with regard to the classification of expenses.see nepa dep.finally,ikon top management engaged outside counsel,two senior partners in the law firm of ballard spahr andrews ingersoll,llp,to investigate the allegation they subsequently found nothing to the cooking the books allegation.see pl.response to ernst first set of requests for admissions.
appellants next argue that a trier of fact may make a finding of scienter from evidence that ernst deliberately disregarded a warning from an ikon officer that various districts were being forced to perform unnatural acts and boost income by manipulating ikon reserves.specifically,in july,berry received written notice of these allegations from ikon official michael dudek dudek,who relayed information that several ikon employees indicated that they were uncomfortable with certain accounting directions which they had been receiving from ikon corporate.see dudek memoranda.
a jury could not plausibly infer an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care on the basis of this evidence.first and most significantly,nothing in the record links the concerns raised late in regarding the manipulation of reserves to ernst preparation of its audit opinion in,the only where ernst state of mind is relevant to the section b claim involved here.furthermore,the record establishes that ernst responded appropriately to the allegations of misconduct raised in the dudek memoranda berry ensured that top ikon management was aware of the allegations,encouraged ikon to hire an independent counsel to investigate which it philadelphia law firm of dechert price rhoads,delivered the dudek memoranda to the independent counsel,and incorporated additional steps into the special procedures to review the newly raised concerns.see nepa dep.the mere fact that ernst did not conduct its own fraud investigation or alert its field auditors to the allegations of fraud is not probative,as the relevant inquiry is bad faith,not judgment see in re worlds of wonder,at assertion that defendant did not conduct an audit precisely as plaintiffs might have insufficient to establish fraud see also hochfelder,at.at congress did not intend for anyone to be made liable except for practices acted other than in good faith.
in an effort to obtain a reversal of the summary judgment and secure a jury trial,appellants lay out the following scenario ernst prepared a checklist entitled internal control and fraud considerations during the planning stage of the audit the,checklist details dozens of possible risk factors ernst checked yes for the presence of a handful of risk factors,including,inter alia,unduly aggressive earnings targets,excessive interest in maintaining or increasing ikon stock price or earnings trend,and a commitment to achieving what appear to be unduly aggressive or unrealistic forecasts these responses,appellants maintain,demonstrate conclusively that a significant risk of financial error existed and raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether ernst knew that ikon personnel were under pressure to fake revenues and artificially inflate operating results see br.of appellants at.
appellants fail,however,to explicate that the checklist contained no answers to potential risks or that it was prepared in the planning stages,before ernst actually undertook its review of ikon financial statements to appraise the validity of these concerns.indeed,the questionnaire itself makes clear that the relative importance of risk factors varies among engagements such that the form can provide only a portion of the understanding about an entity internal control that is required to plan an audit.see.the simple fact that ernst identified ikon management strong preference for favorable earnings,standing alone,does not raise an inference of scienter sufficient to survive a summary judgment motion predicated on the absence of scienter.see acito imcera group,cir allegation that defendants were motivated to defraud the public because an inflated stock price would increase their compensation insufficient because i f scienter could be pleaded on that basis alone,virtually every company in the united states that experiences a downturn in stock price could be forced to defend securities fraud actions.in fact,rather than probative of recklessness,the document tends to corroborate ernst diligence in conducting the audit,identifying potential risks at an early stage in accordance with professional standards.see au an auditor has a duty to assess the risk of material misstatement of financial statements due to fraud quoted in schoenfeld asset mgmt.llc cendant,d.
we also reject appellants argument that scienter credibly may be inferred from ernst reliance on ikon defective internal controls while ikon internal accounting controls well may have been unreliable during fiscal year,the record,except with respect to the fourth quarter does not connect these internal deficiencies to ernst independent,external audit.to the contrary,ernst adopted an rely approach during the audit wherein,after scrutinizing ikon internal controls to confirm their effectiveness and making recommendations to ikon officers for improvement where deemed necessary,ernst nevertheless opted not to defer to ikon internal audit findings and processes.see generalized audit program steps,year ending,substantive testing without placing reliance on the related systems is the most efficient way to audit see also mulherin decl.w e determined that ikon overall internal control environment was effective however,we would not rely on the testing of controls as the primary support for our audit opinion.rather,we would perform substantive as analytical procedures and tests of serve as our principal source of audit evidence.absent further evidence affirmatively linking ikon internal controls to ernst audit opinion,the record does not raise a genuine issue of material fact from which a jury could conclude that ernst knowingly or blindly adhered to faulty internal controls or accounting practices.see monroe hughes,cir deficiencies in internal controls of a company are immaterial to the audit report itself because in essence they are matters of which only management should be aware danis usn communications,d,without more,auditor knowledge about problems in a client operational systems could support an inference only of negligence,not recklessness.
having failed to present concrete evidence from which a jury plausibly could conclude that ernst acted in a reckless manner,appellants purport to raise a material dispute with respect to scienter by parsing the audit for specific defects as evidence that ernst acted recklessly with respect to the audit as a whole.
however,the discovery of discrete errors after subjecting an audit to piercing scrutiny does not,standing alone,support a finding of intentional deceit or of recklessness.see in re software toolworks,cir the mere publication of inaccurate accounting figures,or a failure to follow gaap,without more,does not establish scienter citations and internal quotation marks omitted sec price waterhouse,misapplication of accounting principles by an independent auditor does not establish scienter.an audit does not guarantee that a client accounts and financial statements are correct any more than a sanguine medical diagnosis guarantees indeed,even an audit conducted in strict accordance with professional standards countenances some degree of calibration for tolerable error which,on occasion,may result in a failure to detect a material omission or misstatement.see aicpa general standard audit requires only due professional care cited in vladimir deloitte touche llp,wl,at.
rather,the objective of the ordinary examination of financial statements by the independent auditor is the expression of an opinion on the fairness with which they present financial position,results of operations,and changes in financial position in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.au quoted in united states weiner,cir.in other words,in issuing an opinion,the auditor certifies only that it exercised appropriate,not flawless,levels of professional care and judgment.see la rossa scientific design,cir those who hire experts are not justified in expecting infallibility,but can expect only reasonable care and competence.they purchase service,not insurance.citing gagne bertran,cal d.
thus,to give rise to section b liability for fraud,the mere of calculations will not suffice appellants must show that ernst the moment sufficiently egregious such that a reasonable accountant reviewing the facts and figures should have concluded that ikon financial statements were misstated and that as a result the public was likely to be misled.denny barber,cir rejecting fraud by hindsight because the law does not expect clairvoyance.
nothing in the record meets this demanding threshold.for example,appellants assert that ernst had actual knowledge of million in errors when it rendered its audit opinion.but they derive this figure from their singular and fastidious vision as to how the audit sensibly should have been conducted.the allegation does not,however,raise an inference that ernst harbored an intent to deceive or exhibited a reckless disregard for the likelihood of fraud by exercising divergent,but nevertheless principled,methodologies in auditing ikon financial statements.
the tabulation breaks down as follows.first,appellants contend that the lease default reserve the amount maintained to offset unpaid leases that are charged back to individual marketplaces in ikon southern california was understated by million.appellants derive this figure by subtracting the recorded reserve rate of percent from the historical lease default rate of percent and applying the difference percent to the southern california portfolio of million roughly million.see br.of appellants at.they point to an internal report,in which ernst auditors noted the percent discrepancy between default rate and reserve rate,to demonstrate actual knowledge on the part of ernst of the shortfall.see report.
ernst challenges this calculation for its failure to adjust for recoveries,the value of equipment retrieved from any defaulting lessees or the recovery obtained from defaulting lessees through settlement,litigation,or otherwise.notwithstanding this observation,even were we to accept the accuracy of appellants million figure the error falls short of raising a material dispute with respect to scienter.to begin with,the record reveals that the internal audit report from which appellants purport to discern ernst culpable state of mind was a draft marked for discussion purposes only and may not have been completed by the time ernst concluded its audit more importantly,there is no evidence to rebut a conclusion that ernst took reasonable steps to ensure the adequacy of ikon default reserves overall appellants can not establish scienter merely by pointing to the million reserve adjustment registered during the special procedures in,without affirmatively linking that amount to problems known as of september.see reply br.of appellants at.
appellants emphasize a million overstatement in los angeles inventory.however,as ernst correctly notes,that figure is predicated on a draft summary of findings for the southern california district which detailed a potential risk of misstatement in the event that inventory discrepancies remained unresolved.it does not,however,suggest that ernst failed to address these concerns before publication of the audit opinion quite simply,appellants fail to explain how ernst awareness of discrete inventory problems in one ikon district is tantamount to scienter,to a mental state suggesting an intent to conceal ikon true financial position from investors or a realistic expectation of likely public confusion regarding ikon overall financial health.
appellants point next to a known million shortfall in questionable receivables that were transferred from ikon management services unit ims to ikon document services ids.appellants allege that ernst knew of the bad debt reserve when its field auditors alerted ernst personnel in philadelphia to the fact that ids did not maintain a separate reserve for dubious accounts receivable.see summary review memo.
however,quite apart from this warning,nothing in the record supports the claim that ids was in fact for or that ernst philadelphia did not take appropriate steps to evaluate accounts receivable.furthermore,as ernst points out,auditing estimated reserves for doubtful accounts is a highly imperfect undertaking that requires an assessment of the risk that accounts may be defaulted on.as there is no evidence to suggest that ernst method of predicting collectibilty was unreasonable or grossly inconsistent with acceptable accounting practices,there is no basis to conclude that ernst fraudulently certified that the reserve for doubtful accounts in ikon consolidated financial statements comported with gaap 
appellants assert that ernst missed approximately million in known ids intercompany balances during the audit,but the evidence on this point suggests nothing more than simple error,at best approaching negligence,not scienter.approximately million in intercompany errors came to light during the special procedures,a figure that includes the million related to ids and ims.see special procedures summary of adjustments.appellants maintain that ernst knew of the imbalance both from a broad familiarity with ikon historic problems with expunging redundant balances and from explicit written warnings sent to ernst philadelphia from ernst houston emphasizing the need to eliminate accounts at.
yet those written warnings contain only a very general admonition to ensure intercompany accounts eliminate on a consolidated basis,and appellants offer no additional evidence to show that the million figure discovered in corresponds with the imbalance identified by ernst houston in.moreover,to the extent that ernst may have erred in failing to eliminate intercompany assets from earnings,an inference of recklessness or intent to deceive that otherwise might be drawn can not survive the fact that ernst thoroughly reviewed and tested ikon intercompany balances.see nepa dep.workpaper october,letter.
finally,appellants claim that there was a known misrepresentation of million involving the summary of audit differences sad,the list documenting discrepancies between ikon numbers and ernst conclusions.however,as appellants have acknowledged,ernst failure to require ikon to adjust its financial statements by million is only material when considered in the context of the million in claimed errors with respect to lease default reserve,inventory,accounts receivable,and intercompany balances that we already have addressed.see br.of appellants at.considering that these errors have been discounted,without some additional evidence insinuating scienter,the million pertaining to the sad does not supply a basis to establish scienter.
the million in allegedly reckless misstatements appellants charge also can not be the basis to establish scienter.first,the allegation that ernst failure to reconcile accounts resulted in a million overstatement does not support a finding of the requisite scienter the claim that appellants experts,in retrospect,would have compared assets against balance sheets on a monthly basis or that ikon internal policy called for monthly reconciliation of accounts payable,accounts receivable,cash,and inventory,does not illustrate that ernst incongruous auditing tactics were unjustified,let alone reflected an intent to defraud or rash disregard for the likelihood of deception.
the balance of allegedly reckless errors relate to million of shortfalls in accounts receivable reserves appellants experts opined that ikon transformation initiative seriously impaired account collectibility and,therefore,ernst should have enforced ikon more conservative policy to estimate appropriate reserve minimums.
however,as discussed previously highlighting different accounting methodologies that ernst might have in the nebulous context of establishing reserves for vulnerable not suggest that the approach actually chosen was an extreme departure from ordinary care.
for example,appellants point to the fact that ikon northern california deficient computer system could not properly assess the accounts receivable reserves.yet the record confirms that ernst took reasonable,additional steps to audit those reserves.in its september,summary review memorandum,ernst details the host of problems identified and procedures instituted during the audit of ikon northern california.see.after ikon conducted an internal audit of approximately accounts receivable and recommended a reserve of at least million,ernst auditors reviewed the work and actually proposed increased reserves for doubtful accounts receivable.see showing million adjustment on the summary of audit differences.indeed,rather than stripping reserves as appellants have maintained,ikon substantially increased its overall allowance for doubtful accounts by some million on ernst recommendation in.see,workpapers.plainly,without some additional support,the gaap methodologies advanced by appellants experts fall short of transforming ernst estimates of accounts receivable reserves into actionable fraud.
in short,appellants citations to the record,like misshapen jigsaw pieces that collectively fail to reveal the picture embedded within the puzzle,simply raise no inference that ernst opined on ikon consolidated financial statements with knowing or reckless disregard for the truth there is no reasonable basis in the record to doubt that ernst harbored an honest and belief in the accuracy of its audit,and,without further substantiating evidence,a jury may not premise a finding of willful or knowing conduct to defraud or recklessness merely by judging between competing but nevertheless sound accounting methodologies.
loss causation 
as there is no triable issue with respect to scienter,appellants prima facie section b claim fails,and we need not reach the issue of causation.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we will affirm the judgment of the district court entered february.
the big five accounting firms are arthur andersen llp,deloitte touche llp,ernst young llp,kpmg llp and pricewaterhousecoopers llp.for many years,the accounting industry was dominated by eight national firms.in,the big eight was reduced to six members with the mergers of ernst whinney and arthur young into ernst young and touche ross and deloitte haskins sells into deloitte touche.in,the big six became the big five as price waterhouse merged with coopers lybrand to become pricewaterhousecoopers.
gaap is a technical accounting term that encompasses the conventions,rules,and procedures necessary to define accepted accounting practices at a particular time.see american institute of certified public accounts aicpa,statement of auditing standards,quoted in sanders jackson,cir.gaap principles and standards provide a common framework by which financial statements from divers companies may be compared and adjudged.
the final audit opinion was dated october,with the exception of note,dated october.see graham report.
an unqualified or clean audit opinion is the highest level of assurance that an auditor can give on an organization financial statements.accountants will qualify their opinion where discrepancies are identified in a client financial statements.
gaas are the standards prescribed by the auditing standards board of the american institute of certified public accountants for the conduct of auditors in the performance of an examination.see sec arthur young,cir.
in central bank,the supreme court considered whether section b liability could extend to actors who do not commit a manipulative or deceptive act within the meaning of section b but who instead aid and abet a violation.in that case,the plaintiffs sought to hold a bank that served as indenture trustee for two separate bond issues liable under section b and rule for agreeing to delay an independent review of appraisal of land which secured bonds until approximately six months after the bonds were to be sold.the bonds were defaulted on before completion of the independent appraisal.see at.at.the supreme court,finding no basis within the language or legislative history of the statute and reluctant to allow plaintiffs to circumvent the reliance requirement of section b simply by demonstrating that a defendant gave some modicum of aid to those engaged in proscribed activities,refused to find an implied private right of action to impose aiding and abetting liability under section b.see id.at.at.
to prevail on a section b claim,however,appellants need not demonstrate that the audit for f
