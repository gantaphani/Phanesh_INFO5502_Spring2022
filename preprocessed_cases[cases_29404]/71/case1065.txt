this case requires us to consider whether the securities exchange act of preempts claims against registered clearing agencies in connection with their clearance and settlement services,where those services were performed pursuant to a program approved of by the securities and exchange commission.although we conclude that the state law claims asserted here were not precluded by field preemption,we hold the claims were barred by conflict preemption.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.

the three defendants in this action are the depository trust clearing corporation dtcc,the depository trust company dtc and the national securities clearing corporation nscc.dtc and nscc are subsidiaries of dtcc and are registered clearing agencies pursuant to section.dtc is the nation principal securities depository.it operates an automated,centralized system for transfers of securities positions among its participants,the beneficial owners of the securities,in accordance with their instructions.nscc provides centralized clearance,settlement,and information services for virtually all equity,corporate bond,municipal bond and other securities transactions in the united states.the changes in beneficial ownership of securities resulting from transactions that are cleared and settled at nscc are implemented by transfers among brokers accounts at dtc.
at times,a seller does not deliver to nscc system the securities it has sold by the settlement date.such an occurrence is called a.in,nscc created the stock borrow program to deal electronically with temporary,short term.nscc has promulgated rules to govern the operation of the stock borrow program,and the commission has approved those rules.see national securities clearing.proposed rule changes by organization,notice of filing of nscc proposed rule change adopting as a one year pilot program procedures for borrowing securities to meet system needs national securities clearing.proposed rule change,notice of filing of nscc proposed rule change making pilot program permanent depository trust,exchange act release,granting nscc application for full registration.

there are two types of implied preemption field preemption and conflict preemption.under field preemption,preemption is implied when congress so thoroughly occupies a legislative field,that it effectively leaves no room for states to regulate conduct in that field.cipollone liggett group,d.under conflict preemption,congress intent to preempt state law is implied to the extent that federal law actually conflicts with any state law.hillsborough county automated med,d.conflict preemption analysis examines the federal statute as a whole to determine whether a party compliance with both federal and state requirements is impossible or whether,in light of the federal statute purpose and intended effects,state law poses an obstacle to the accomplishment of congress objectives.crosby foreign trade council,d.
defendants do not argue that congress intended to occupy the entire field of securities regulation.rather,defendants argue that section of the exchange act reflects congress intent to occupy the field of clearing and settling securities transactions.however,an examination of the statutory framework of the exchange act does not reveal the comprehensiveness necessary to infer that congress intended to wholly occupy even the narrower field of clearing and settling securities transactions to the exclusion of state law 
when congress enacted the exchange act,it included a provision which recognizes that the act does not impact any state securities laws 
t he rights and remedies provided by the exchange act shall be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may exist at law or in equity n othing in this act shall affect the jurisdiction of the securities commission of any state over any security or any person insofar as it does not conflict with the provisions of this act or the rules and regulations thereunder.
