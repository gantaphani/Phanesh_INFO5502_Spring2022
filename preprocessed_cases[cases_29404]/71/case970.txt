this case involves allegations of securities fraud.defendant nvidia corporation is a publicly traded semiconductor company.in the spring of,it disclosed to investors information about defects in two of its products.a little over one month later,it further disclosed that it would be taking a million charge to cover costs arising from those product defects.as a result,nvidia share price dropped and its market capitalization contracted by billion.according to plaintiffs,who had purchased nvidia stock in the preceding eight months,the company knew it would be liable for the defective products long before its disclosures.they claim that nvidia should have informed investors about the defects as early as november.they further contend that,absent a disclosure about the product defects,nvidia intervening statements regarding its financial condition were misleading to investors,and consequently in violation of section b of the securities exchange act of and corresponding securities exchange commission sec rule.
the district court below dismissed plaintiffs amended complaint without further leave to amend,holding that it failed to adequately allege scienter,a necessary element for a claim under either section b or rule.we have jurisdiction under.
on appeal,plaintiffs essentially raise three distinct arguments,all directed to the element of scienter.first,they argue that the disclosure duty under item of regulation s k,is actionable under section b and rule.a proper analysis,they contend,should ascertain whether defendants acted with scienter in violating item disclosure duty.second,plaintiffs assert that the district court failed to consider their allegations holistically.they contend that,when considered holistically,their allegations give rise to a strong inference of scienter.third,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in finding that neither the corporate scienter doctrine nor the core operations doctrine supports a strong inference of scienter.
for the reasons discussed below,we affirm.
nvidia corporation is a publicly traded semiconductor company founded in by jen hsun huang,its current ceo.its core business involves the design and sale of two similar semiconductor chips.one is a graphics processing unit gpu the other is a media and communications processor mcp.in essence,gpus are designed to process the vast amount of data necessary to render images to a computer visual display.mcps are similar to gpus in that they function as a gpu in addition to various other devices,such as a system memory interface,ethernet communications controller,and audio signal processor.original equipment manufacturers oems,such as hewlett packard hp and dell computer dell,purchase these chips and incorporate them into the motherboards of computers they assemble and sell to consumers.
in addition to their similar functions,gpus and mcps also share a similar configuration,which comprises two main parts a die,or the silicon chip itself and a substrate,or wafer,which is a green circuit board that ultimately connects the die to the motherboard electrical components.to manufacture the gpus and mcps,the die is mounted onto the substrate.importantly,the die electronically connects to the substrate through bumps of solder that relay electrical signals between the die and the rest of the computer.the bumps are attached to the substrate using a solder paste.between the die and substrate is an underfill,which is a material that acts as an additional bonding agent to fortify the connection between the die and substrate.together,the solder and underfill are referred to as the material set.
given the highly complex and technical nature of nvidia gpu and mcp products,there is an inherent risk that some will fail.as a result,nvidia routinely includes in its sec forms a statement explaining that its products may contain defects or flaws,and warning investors that it may be required to reimburse customers for costs to repair or replace the affected products.to cover costs relating to inevitable defects,nvidia automatically records a reduction to revenue as a cash reserve.as product return and replacement costs accrue,nvidia withdraws cash from that reserve.
according to the complaint,in september,nvidia began experiencing problems with certain of its gpu and mcp products,particularly with those products material set.plaintiffs allege that some of nvidia chips experienced cracks in the solder bumps when subjected to excessive pressure during product testing.at that time,nvidia had been using a eutectic which has a relatively low lead content together with eutectic solder paste.in an attempt to remedy the cracking problem,nvidia switched some of the solders used in the chips from a eutectic solder to a solder,which is more malleable and therefore less susceptible to cracking from the pressure in product testing.it continued to use the eutectic solder paste,however.according to plaintiffs,varying thermal properties of the new,solder and the eutectic solder paste contributed to new problems with nvidia chips.specifically,because the two materials undergo thermal expansion at varying rates,the solder is susceptible to fatigue and cracking over time.
at some point,these new problems began manifesting in laptop computers incorporating nvidia gpu and mcp products that were made using solder.after hp and later dell began investigating these problems,it observed new cracking of the solder bumps connecting the die to the substrate the material set problem.at first,nvidia attributed the problem to damage or oem design issues.hp hypothesized that heat cycling was the root cause of the problem specifically,hp believed that the solder bumps would weaken over time due to repeated thermal expansion caused by heat cycling.
to reduce the stress on the chips solder bumps,and thus ameliorate the cracking problem,hp and dell,with the help of nvidia,issued software updates bios updates to their laptop computers.these bios updates altered a computer fan algorithm,causing the internal cooling fans to run continuously,thereby eliminating heat cycling.evidently,hp believed that by maintaining a fairly constant temperature,the solder bumps would not undergo thermal expansion as often and thus not be as susceptible to fatigue and failure.
ultimately,after significant testing,hp concluded that the root cause of gpu and mcp failures in its computers was not caused by cracking due to heat cycling,but by cracking due to operation of the chips within a narrow temperature range.apparently,the stress on the solder bumps caused by varying thermal properties of the solder and eutectic solder paste was especially acute in this temperature range.hp shared with nvidia its data demonstrating this problematic thermal profile,and,at some point,nvidia reproduced the data in its own laboratories.
in may and june,nvidia issued to its oem customers product change notifications pcns,indicating that it would be transitioning back to eutectic solder.
between november,and may,nvidia filed several forms with the sec,as required by law.according to plaintiffs,those forms contained materially false and misleading statements,principally because they omitted information regarding the material set problem.
for example,in the november,form k,plaintiffs point to nvidia claim that its core businesses are continuing to grow as the gpu becomes increasingly central to today computing experience.in nvidia february,form k,it highlights the assertion that fiscal was another outstanding and record year for us.strong demand for gpus in all market segments drove our growth.plaintiffs argue that these statements and others made in nvidia march,form k and may,form k are materially false and misleading because nvidia failed to disclose reported defects in its products as well.
on may,nvidia disclosed in its quarterly report that it had received claims for reimbursement from one of its oems for incremental costs due to an alleged material set defect.the report also indicated that the product was included in a significant number of the customer computer products and had been shipped to other customers in significant quantities.nvidia explained that it was evaluating the potential scope of the problem and cause of the alleged defect and the merits of the customer claim.it further indicated that it was unable to estimate the amount of costs that may be incurred at that time.
just over one month later,on july,nvidia filed an sec form k indicating it would be taking a to million charge to cover warranty,repair,return,replacement,and other costs arising from a weak material set in certain versions of its previous mcp and gpu products used in notebook systems.after nvidia july,disclosure,the market reacted accordingly,causing a decline in nvidia share price and a decrease of over billion in its market capitalization.
plaintiffs invested in nvidia stock between november,and july,the class period.they allege that,beginning november,nvidia knew of the defect in the gpu and mcp material set,this knowledge was material to investors,and failure to disclose it made other statements in nvidia sec filings misleading.
believing that defendants violated federal securities laws,plaintiffs filed three separate lawsuits,which the district court consolidated into a single action.in the consolidated complaint,plaintiffs allege three distinct but related counts.in the first and second counts,they allege that nvidia and huang,respectively,are liable for violations of both section b of the securities exchange act of and corresponding sec rule.in the third count,they aver that huang is further liable for violations of section a of the securities exchange act of.
upon defendants motion,the district court dismissed plaintiffs first consolidated class action complaint with leave to amend.plaintiffs then filed a second consolidated class action complaint.upon a second motion by defendants,the district court dismissed that complaint without leave to amend.in its order of dismissal,the district court specifically held that plaintiffs failed to sufficiently plead scienter,an element required for each count.

section b of the securities exchange act of declares it unlawful to use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the sec may prescribe as necessary.b.as the supreme court has indicated,there is an implied private cause of action in section b.matrixx initiatives,siracusano.additionally,sec rule implements section b by making it unlawful to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made not misleading.id.quoting.thus,to prevail on a claim for violations of either section b or rule,a plaintiff must prove six elements a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant scienter a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission economic loss and loss causation.stoneridge inv.partners,llc scientific atlanta.
section a of the securities exchange act of provides for liability of a controlling person.a.to establish a cause of action under this provision,a plaintiff must first prove a primary violation of underlying federal securities laws,such as section b or rule,and then show that the defendant exercised actual power over the primary violator.howard everex,cir.accordingly,our analysis focuses on plaintiffs allegations under section b and rule.
when alleging violations of federal securities laws,a plaintiff must satisfy the pleading requirements pronounced in the private securities litigation reform act of pslra.zucco partners,llc digimarc,cir.in passing this act,congress significantly altered pleading requirements in securities fraud cases by requir ing that a complaint plead with particularity both falsity and scienter.id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.more precisely,now a complaint must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b a.
to assist courts in determining whether a plaintiff has satisfied this heightened pleading standard,the supreme court has provided three points of instruction courts must,as with any b motion to dismiss,accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true courts must consider the complaint in its entirety,as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on rule b motions to dismiss and in determining whether the pleaded facts give rise to a strong inference of scienter,the court must take into account plausible opposing inferences.tellabs,at.in discussing the third point,the court explained that,although t he inference of scienter need not be irrefutable,or even the most plausible of competing inferences,it must be more than merely reasonable or permissible it must be cogent and compelling,thus strong in light of other countervailing explanations.id.at citations omitted.ultimately,the court held that a complaint will survive only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.id.
having outlined the lens through which we must consider plaintiffs allegations of scienter,we now turn to the definition of scienter itself.in ernst ernst hochfelder,the supreme court explained in a footnote that the term scienter refers to a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.the court recognized that some courts of appeals include within their definition of scienter a form of recklessness,but it did not address whether those courts are correct in doing so.id.as recently as in its decision in matrixx initiatives,the court stated that it ha s not yet decided whether recklessness suffices to fulfill the scienter requirement.at.
in this circuit,we have held that recklessness may satisfy the element of scienter.hollinger titan capital,cir en banc.we defined recklessness as a highly unreasonable omission,involving an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,and which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it.id.at quoting sundstrand sun chem,cir we added that the danger of misleading buyers must be actually known or so obvious that any reasonable man would be legally bound as knowing.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in in re silicon graphics.securities litigation,we opined that the wording of our previous decisions discussing recklessness including our decision in hollinger indicates that the standard for recklessness is actually much closer to one of intent these cases indicate that recklessness only satisfies scienter under b to the extent that it reflects some degree of intentional or conscious misconduct,cir.accordingly,we explained that scienter requires a strong inference of,at a minimum,deliberate recklessness.id.emphasis added since then,we have consistently applied the deliberate recklessness terminology and standard articulated in silicon graphics.see,in re verifone holdings.sec,cir zucco partners,at in re daou,at 
we now address plaintiffs arguments on appeal.
plaintiffs first argue that the district court erred by failing to consider their allegations of scienter in the context of item of regulation s k,they correctly assert that item requires disclosure of certain information.but then they contend that,if the information is material,failure to disclose it constitutes a material omission for purposes of section b and rule.ultimately,plaintiffs argue that the district court analysis should have focused on whether nvidia acted with scienter in failing to make the item disclosure.
we have never directly decided whether item disclosure duty is actionable under section b and rule.we now hold that it is not.
to prevail on a claim under section b or rule,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant made a misleading statement or omission of material fact.matrixx initiatives.at.thus,a statement might be misleading because it affirmatively misstates information.or a statement might be misleading because it is made outside the context of other material information.yet neither section b nor rule create s an affirmative duty to disclose any and all material information.disclosure is required under these provisions only when necessary to make statements made,in the sic light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.id.at alteration in original quoting b.in basic levinson,the supreme court noted that s ilence,absent a duty to disclose,is not misleading under rule.the court did not explain what would give rise to a duty to disclose,but it is this language in basic that plaintiffs cite in support of their argument.they assert that item creates a duty to disclose,and failure to disclose it is therefore misleading for purposes of section b and rule.
we have confronted a similar argument before.see in re verifone sec,cir in re lyondell petrochemical.sec,cir in re convergent techs.sec,cir.in each instance,we strongly suggested that a violation of item can not be used to show a violation of section b and rule.we noted that,w hile a ii provides that known trends or uncertainties be disclosed in certain sec filings,instruction to item a states that information need not be disclosed.in re verifone,at.without further discussion,we rejected the plaintiffs argument 
in oran stafford,the third circuit decided this issue more directly,cir.we are persuaded by its reasoning.there,the court explained that item disclosure requirement varies considerably from the general test for securities fraud materiality set out by the supreme court in basic levinson.id.at.in relevant part,item requires corporate management to d escribe in k and q forms any known trends or uncertainties that have had or that the registrant reasonably expects will have a material favorable or unfavorable impact on net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations.a ii.the sec shed further light on this requirement in an interpretive release 
where a trend,demand,commitment,event or uncertainty is known,management must make two assessments 
is the known trend,demand,commitment,event or uncertainty likely to come to fruition if management determines that it is not reasonably likely to occur,no disclosure is required.
if management can not make that determination,it must evaluate objectively the consequences of the known trend,demand,commitment,event or uncertainty,on the assumption that it will come to fruition.disclosure is then required unless management determines that a material effect on the registrant financial condition or results of operations is not reasonably likely to occur.
management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations,exchange act release,may.on the other hand,in basic,the supreme court stated that materiality of information depends upon a balancing of both the indicated probability that the event will occur and the anticipated magnitude of the event in light of the totality of the company activity.at internal quotation marks omitted.
as the court in oran also determined,these two standards differ considerably.at.management duty to disclose under item is much broader than what is required under the standard pronounced in basic.the sec intimated this point as well item mandates disclosure of specified information,and specifies its own standard for disclosure,reasonably likely to have a material effect the test for materiality approved by the supreme court in basic,levinson,is inapposite to item disclosure.exchange act release.at.the sec effort to distinguish basic materiality test from item disclosure requirement provides further support for the position that item requires more than basic what must be disclosed under item is not necessarily required under the standard in basic.therefore,b ecause the materiality standards for rule and item differ significantly,the demonstration of a violation of the disclosure requirements of item does not lead inevitably to the conclusion that such disclosure would be required under rule.such a duty to disclose must be separately shown.oran,at.
plaintiffs reliance on litwin blackstone group,cir,and panther partners ikanos communications,cir,is unavailing.those cases involved alleged violations of sections and a of the securities act of,not section b or rule.and,as we acknowledged in steckman hart brewing,section b of the exchange act differs significantly from sections and a of the securities act,cir.liability under sections and a of the securities act may arise from omitt ing to state a material fact required to be stated.see a,b.to put it differently,liability arises from an omission in contravention of an affirmative legal disclosure obligation.panther partners,at.there is no such requirement under section b or rule.as discussed above,for purposes of section b and rule,material information need not be disclosed unless omission of that information would cause other information that is disclosed to be misleading.matrixx initiatives.at.furthermore,as noted in panther partners,scienter is not an element of either a section or section a claim.at.such claims are not subject to the pslra heightened pleading standards unless based on allegations of fraud.id.accordingly,neither panther partners nor litwin affects our analysis here.
also unavailing is plaintiffs reliance on simon american power conversion.in that case,judge laguex opined that item imposes an affirmative duty to disclose,and found that the defendant failure to disclose in that case was actionable.simon.at.subsequently,however,judge laguex clarified his opinion as this court noted in simon,the disclosure rules are probative of what defendants are otherwise obliged to disclose but do not,themselves,provide an independent duty of disclosure.kafenbaum gtech holdings,d.he went on to say that plaintiffs may not rely solely upon item to prove that defendants failed to disclose material information as a matter of law in violation of rule.id.at.
in sum,we hold that item does not create a duty to disclose for purposes of section b and rule.such a duty to disclose must be separately shown according to the principles set forth by the supreme court in basic and matrixx initiatives.
next,plaintiffs contend that the district court erred by not considering their allegations of scienter holistically.
in tellabs,the supreme court explained that,when assessing allegations of scienter,a court job is not to scrutinize each allegation in isolation but to assess all the allegations holistically t he reviewing court must ask when the allegations are accepted as true and taken collectively,would a reasonable person deem the inference of scienter at least as strong as any opposing inference at citations omitted.we apply this same standard but in a dual inquiry.first,we determine whether any of the plaintiff allegations,standing alone,is sufficient to create a strong inference of scienter.zucco partners,at.if none is sufficient alone,we then consider the allegations holistically to determine whether they create a strong inference of scienter taken together.id.
we have reviewed plaintiffs allegations in their entirety.we find that none creates a strong inference of scienter individually.and,together,they do not give rise to a strong inference of scienter holistically.the most compelling inference that we can reasonably draw is that nvidia was first investigating the root cause,and then the scope,of the material set problem once it determined that its liability would exceed its normal reserves,nvidia disclosed the problem to investors.any inference of scienter requires more than this.thus,while the complaint may plausibly allege knowledge of the material set problem,it does not plausibly allege that nvidia and huang intentionally misled investors,or acted with deliberate recklessness,by not disclosing the problem sooner.we discuss our reasoning below.
plaintiffs contend that nvidia acted with scienter in withholding from investors certain information regarding the material set problem.they allege that,between november and july,nvidia made various statements in its sec forms regarding its financial performance and the quality of its products.plaintiffs argue that those statements were materially false and misleading because nvidia did not also disclose that certain of its products were failing at an abnormal rate and that nvidia ultimately would be financially responsible for replacement costs.according to plaintiffs,nvidia first determined that it would be financially liable for the chip failures by the middle of nevertheless,it did not disclose this to investors until july.from these facts,plaintiffs infer that nvidia intentionally misled investors by waiting to disclose its liability for almost an entire year,until it had prepared replacement products.
in evaluating plaintiffs inference of scienter,we bear in mind that nvidia includes in its sec forms a statement explaining that its products may contain defects or flaws and warning investors that it may be required to reimburse customers for costs to repair or replace the affected products.moreover,we are mindful that,because product defects are so common,nvidia automatically records a reduction to revenue as a cash reserve to cover costs relating to the inevitable product failures.bearing these facts in mind,we must determine whether plaintiffs allegations create a strong inference of scienter that huang and nvidia intentionally misled investors,or were at least deliberately reckless,by not disclosing nvidia liability for chip failures prior to july.
plaintiffs allege that nvidia first became aware of the material set problem sometime in,and then determined the root cause of the problem and therefore that it would be financially responsible for it by the middle of.then they contend that the delay between nvidia root cause determination in mid and its disclosure of the problem in was motivated by an intent to mislead investors until it had prepared replacement products.nevertheless,plaintiffs allegations that nvidia first determined the root cause of its chip failures by the middle of are implausible.in so alleging,plaintiffs rely most directly on the accounts of confidential witness,confidential witness,and articles written by charlie demerjian.
according to,communications between hp and nvidia began in,with hp asking questions,and asking nvidia to conduct a failure analysis.when nvidia initially resisted,hp began to engage it at a higher,executive,level.by early,hp had determined that nvidia chips sustained physical damage through normal use,and therefore making nvidia responsible.hp developed overwhelming data demonstrating root cause and identified the thermal profile that would cause nvidia chips to experience cracking at the solder bumps.asserts that hp shared the data and thermal profile with nvidia sometime in early and nvidia reproduced it by the middle of.
the timing of account conflicts with the account of richard hunt hodge,hp director of engineering and quality for the notebook division according to hodge,hp itself did not determine the thermal profile that would significantly increase the probability of chip failures until the middle of ultimately,by mid,hp determined that operation of the nvidia part through a narrow temperature range was the cause of chip failures due to solder bump cracking.if hp did not determine the problematic thermal profile until the middle of,any inference of scienter is significantly reduced,as nvidia disclosed the information in july.
the notion that hp had determined the problematic thermal profile in early is implausible when considered together with plaintiffs other allegations.plaintiffs allege that hp and dell,with the help of nvidia,issued bios updates in november and february,respectively.those bios updates altered a computer fan algorithm so that its internal cooling fans would run continuously,thereby eliminating heat cycling and maintaining a fairly constant temperature inside the computer.hodge explains in his declaration that the hp bios update keeps a gpu or mcp outside of the problematic temperature range usually around at idle.because it runs constantly,it obviates the thermal through the problematic narrow temperature range.if hp had determined the problematic thermal profile in early,as plaintiffs and allege,it is implausible that hp would have waited until november to issue a bios update that greatly reduces the probability of a chip failure due to solder bump cracking the implausibility of the timing in account of events further detracts from any inference of scienter.
plaintiffs reliance on charlie demerjian and to corroborate cw timing of events does not restore plausibility to their allegations.demerjian is a reporter with years experience working with computers.he covered nvidia chip defects and spoke to dozens of people about the problems.clearly,demerjian information is secondhand.in any event,demerjian merely indicates that hp started a root cause analysis and by summer,hp employees knew that nvidia gpus were having problems associated with heat cycling.this account does not indicate that hp had determined the root cause or problematic thermal profile by summer.according to,dell saw problems with nvidia gpus in early.indicated that nvidia eventually admitted that it was their chip causing the problem,and that it was not a dell issue.nevertheless,does not allege when nvidia admitted responsibility for the problems.thus,even if dell had notified nvidia of problems in early,provides no basis to infer that nvidia also knew it would be liable at that time.
even accepting as true timing of events,the fact that nvidia had reproduced the problematic thermal profile by the middle of and thus had determined the root cause of the chip failures does not create an inference of scienter.plaintiffs assert that hp provided nvidia with what hp believed demonstrated root cause of,and nvidia liability for,the chip failures.their allegations do not provide any basis to infer what nvidia concluded from the profile or other data,nor do they plausibly suggest that nvidia must have determined it was at fault at that time.furthermore,plaintiffs never allege that huang or anyone else at nvidia knew at that time or any time prior to july that nvidia liability would exceed its normal reserve set aside for costs associated with product failures.accordingly,these allegations do not give rise to a strong inference that huang and nvidia acted with intent to mislead investors,or recklessly disregarded an obvious danger of misleading investors,by not disclosing information regarding the material set problem prior to july.
after alleging that hp provided nvidia with all of its data demonstrating root cause and the problematic thermal profile,plaintiffs assert that determining the cause of the problem should have been easy for nvidia.they rely on several sources to support this allegation.
demerjian,and john rigg,plaintiffs consultant in this case,assert that failures of the gpu are easily identifiable.confidential witness explains that it takes about a month to determine whether a gpu or mcp is generating more heat than specified.hodge indicates that it took hp less than two months to hypothesize that temperature cycling caused the problematic cracks in the solder bumps.
but even if gpu failures are easily identifiable,it does not necessarily follow that nvidia would be responsible for those failures or should have known that it would be responsible.as nvidia initially contended,the failures could have been caused by oem design issues.and plaintiffs reliance on hodge declaration for the contention that nvidia should have easily determined that it was liable for the chip failures is misplaced.plaintiffs ignore the timing of hodge account hp did not hypothesize temperature as the root cause until november.then,hp did not begin to test its hypothesis until january.after weeks of testing,hp determined that temperature was not the root cause,as its testing did not induce a single chip failure.it was not until sometime around the middle of that hp ultimately discovered the specific cause of chip failures operation within the problematic thermal profile.
plaintiffs also rely on two articles for the proposition that nvidia must have known that it was going to be liable sooner than it admitted.both articles were published after nvidia july disclosure.one article provides amd one of nvidia competitors opinion on nvidia chip failures.according to the article,amd thinks bumps are more prone to fatigue and need comprehensive reliability engineering to be used successfully.amd also notes that a solder and eutectic solder paste have varying thermal expansion coefficients,which places significant stress on the solder bumps.the other article discusses a research report written by tu,a professor affiliated with the department of materials science and engineering at the university of california,los angeles.in essence,the report discusses the same issues discussed by amd.
these articles do not contribute to an inference of scienter.they were written in hindsight and do not reflect huang or nvidia knowledge prior to july.simply because scientists were able to explain in retrospect the science behind nvidia chip failures,it does not mean that nvidia knew or should have known it would be liable for those failures during the class period or that its liability would exceed its normal reserve.
plaintiffs also point to an email authored by hp richard hodge in may,wherein hodge indicated that nvidia had moved away from eutectic solder in its chips.from this email,plaintiffs conclude that there are known industry concerns with the use of solder.they also conclude,defendants knew deliberately disregarded that their gpu and mcp problems likely stemmed from this hasty,manufacturing change initiated in.nevertheless,there is no basis for this conclusion.certainly,hodge email suggests that he had some concern about using noneutectic solder.but there is nothing more to indicate an concern with noneutectic solder,nor is there anything to suggest that nvidia should have known that its use of noneutectic solder was the root cause of its chip failures.accordingly,this allegation does not appreciably add to any inference of scienter.
next,plaintiffs contend that nvidia delayed disclosure of its chip failures until it had prepared replacement chips.they support this contention with very few factual allegations,however.
plaintiffs rely on statements made by.after hp provided nvidia with data that hp believed demonstrated the root cause of the chip failures and the problematic thermal profile that would cause those failures,nvidia confirmed to hp that it was able to reproduce the problem.yet,according to,nvidia never admitted to getting to root cause,and they peddled the same story for as long as possible,that they were still investigating.also alleges that nvidia would do the phd runaway to appear cooperative while trying to slow hp down.in essence,asserts that nvidia employees would ask hp to conduct additional tests merely to buy more time.
as we discussed above,the timing of account is implausible,especially in light of hodge declaration.provides no specific examples of when nvidia attempted to slow down hp by having it conduct meaningless tests or experiments,nor does explain why those tests and experiments were meaningless.from assertions alone,a reasonable factfinder could not infer that nvidia was conducting needless testing or attempting to delay disclosure of its product defects.as a matter of law,account to this end does not add to an inference of scienter.
plaintiffs also rely on a statement made by nvidia vice president of investor relations,michael hara.in september,after nvidia disclosure,hara explained to investors that the failing chips were past or near the end of their useful life and that nvidia was not even shipping these parts anymore.from this statement,plaintiffs infer that defendants stalled the disclosure of the material,adverse facts for several months,if not a full year,until the failing products were at the end of their and the company had new products to market.
we agree that the coincidence of nvidia disclosure with the apparent of its failing chips could,under some circumstances,arouse suspicion.but this statement alone does not create an inference that nvidia strategically delayed disclosure of its chip failures until those chips were past their useful life.
finally,plaintiffs rely on the fact that nvidia participated in preparation of bios updates and issued pcns.as we discussed above,the uncontested evidence shows that in november,nvidia helped hp and later dell issue bios software updates that altered a computer fan algorithm.in may and june,nvidia issued pcns that indicated it would be changing back to a eutectic solder in its gpus and mcps.plaintiffs allege that significant engineering is required to transition from one material set to another.from these facts,plaintiffs conclude that nvidia must have known it was liable for the product defects long before its disclosure.but these facts do not mandate such a conclusion.the bios updates were intended to ease stress caused by heat cycling,which,as nvidia first contended,could have been caused by oem design issues.even if nvidia decided to transition back to eutectic solder long before it issued pcns in may and june,it does not necessarily mean that nvidia knew it was responsible for the failures.a more plausible inference is that nvidia believed that solder was a contributing factor and switched back to eutectic solder to eliminate it.
after alleging that nvidia delayed disclosure until it had prepared replacement chips,plaintiffs attempt to buttress that allegation by contending that nvidia has a history of delaying disclosure of known problems.nevertheless,they rest their contention on the accounts of several confidential witnesses whose experiences do not contribute to an inference of scienter.their accounts are unspecific and speculative.more problematic,some witnesses never worked for nvidia.and those who did either stopped working there long before the material set problem arose or worked in an area unrelated to it,such as environmental engineering or staffing systems and compliance.
for example,confidential witness worked for nvidia as a senior engineering manager between december and march,months before the product failures arose.declaration maintains that nvidia is arrogant,and think s it never do es wrong,and operated with a failure to recognize real problems.confidential witness was a sales director for one of nvidia vendors.stated that nvidia was notorious for blaming other entities for product related problems some of the time they were right in blaming others and some of the time they were wrong,but their default was always to say,this is not our problem.this is your problem.
confidential witness worked at nvidia as an environmental compliance engineer.stated that nvidia has a history of failing to take responsibility for company problems.believes that nvidia had the following mentality do say anything to muck the waters.confidential witness,a former nvidia staffing systems and compliance analyst,stated that was told i do care what you do,just make us look good.provides no context,however,as to who made the statement or why the statement was made.confidential witness worked for a website that sold nvidia products.stated,i seen a lot of hostile actions from nvidia nvidia tends to be a little when it comes to scrapping their failure percentage rates they had a lot of fiascos in the past with like the geforce ultra,a lot of overheating issues.
these statements do not give rise to an inference of scienter individually.the testimony of confidential witness cw provides the most probative evidence indicating that nvidia had a culture of failing to take responsibility for known problems.was a director of ic quality and reliability for nvidia.according to,there was an instance where employees at nvidia knew of a design flaw in one of its products,but did not reveal it until after nvidia customer had discovered and contained the problem.testimony is less significant,however,when considering that period of employment was at most one year,from to,long before the product defects giving rise to this lawsuit.
accordingly,these allegations that nvidia has a history of delaying known problems do not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.
as further evidence of scienter,plaintiffs rely on the existence of other lawsuits filed against nvidia by its insurers.apparently,after it disclosed to investors information regarding its defective products,nvidia submitted claims to its insurance companies to cover the losses sustained as a result.foreseeably,the insurance companies did not want to pay nvidia claims.thus,they alleged that nvidia knew of the defective products before january and had failed to provide information that the insurers had requested.these allegations do not significantly add to an inference of scienter,as the insurers litigating claims would attempt to avoid liability.
evidently,one of nvidia insurers also alleged the existence of a class action lawsuit filed against hp in november.the insurer argued that nvidia knew the lawsuit related to problems with nvidia defective chips and that hp would seek indemnification from nvidia.nevertheless,plaintiffs never explain with any particularity when or how nvidia became aware that hp would seek indemnification from nvidia.accordingly,the existence of this additional lawsuit does not add to an inference of scienter.
plaintiffs also contend that,when considered with all other allegations,the departure of some of nvidia executives adds to the inference of scienter.we do not agree.
plaintiffs allege that three individuals left nvidia after it disclosed the defective products.on may,nvidia cfo,marvin burkett,announced his retirement.significantly,burkett continued as interim cfo until a replacement was hired,and in february,he became a senior advisor to nvidia.in june,nvidia senior director and head of internal audit left the company.plaintiffs do not explain,however,how this executive played any role in allegedly delaying the disclosure of the defective products.in january,nvidia replaced david kirk,its chief scientist.plaintiffs fail to provide any detail as to why kirk was replaced notably,kirk continued to work with nvidia as a research fellow.
in short,plaintiffs fail to provide any facts to connect these departures with the problems at issue in this lawsuit.more detrimental to their allegations,however,is that two of the three individuals remained at nvidia in some type of advisory role.therefore,the most reasonable inference is that these departures were benign.
plaintiffs argue that their allegations give rise to an inference of scienter under the corporate scienter doctrine.in most cases,the most straightforward way to raise an inference of scienter for a corporate defendant will be to plead it for an individual defendant.glazer capital,lp magistri,cir quoting teamsters local freight div.pension fund dynex capital,cir.yet,the collective scienter or corporate scienter doctrine recognizes that it is possible to raise the inference of scienter without doing so for a specific individual.id.in the ninth circuit,we ha ve not previously adopted a theory of collective scienter.id.at.nevertheless,in glazer capital,we opined that the doctrine might be appropriate in some cases.id.for instance,as outlined in the hypothetical posed by the seventh circuit,there could be circumstances in which a company public statements were so important and so dramatically false that they would create a strong inference that at least some corporate officials knew of the falsity upon publication.id.citing makor issues rights,tellabs,cir.
we do not believe the facts alleged in this case would give rise to an inference of scienter under the collective scienter doctrine.here,plaintiffs contend that statements made by nvidia in its sec filings were misleading because nvidia did not also disclose information regarding the material set problem.those statements were not so dramatically false as in the example posed by the seventh circuit in to create an inference of scienter that at least some corporate officials knew of the falsity upon publication.
plaintiffs also contend that their complaint raises a strong inference of scienter under the core operations doctrine.under this doctrine,the pslra pleading requirements may be satisfied,in certain circumstances,by a scienter theory that infers that facts critical to a business core operations or an important transaction are known to a company key officers.ferry lp,killinger,cir.in south ferry,we explained that,in light of the supreme court decision in tellabs,the core operations inference may be considered when weighing a complaint allegations of scienter holistically.id.at.nevertheless,we cautioned that,absent some additional allegation of specific information conveyed to management and related to the fraud or other allegations supporting scienter,the core operations inference will generally fall short of a strong inference of scienter.id.we did,however,leave open the possibility that in some unusual circumstances,the core operations inference,without more,may raise the strong inference required by the pslra.id.at.one example of such unusual circumstances is where the nature of the relevant fact is of such prominence that it would be absurd to suggest that management was without knowledge of the matter.id.at.
here,plaintiffs never plausibly allege that specific information was conveyed to or others in nvidia management team.they apparently attempt to do so by relying on the account of,but lacks personal knowledge of these facts.report s that the communications regarding the chip problems were conducted at a sic these were executive level guys.boss was a senior technical employee,a director of quality.this guy is not going to be communicating with guys that are at manager level or engineering level.from this statement,it is evident that does not actually know whom from nvidia boss communicated with regarding the chip failures.surmises that,based on boss status in hp corporate hierarchy,he was communicating with executive level personnel from nvidia.accordingly,does not appear to have the requisite personal knowledge to assert that nvidia management team received specific information regarding the defective products.
even assuming did have personal knowledge that boss communicated with nvidia personnel,the specific information allegedly conveyed related to chip failures,not the root cause of them or nvidia liability.as we discussed above,assertion that hp had determined the root cause in early is not plausible.
again,even assuming hp had determined the root cause in early,plaintiffs do not allege any facts to support the notion that anyone at nvidia arrived at the same conclusion as hp regarding the root cause,or that nvidia would be liable.nor do plaintiffs provide a basis to infer that anyone at nvidia was aware that its financial liability would exceed its normal reserves.plaintiffs argue that k nowledge of the financial impact of the chip defect should be presumed when the nature of the problem concerned nvidia flagship product and was cause for concern to nvidia two largest customers.we do not agree.without factual allegations showing that at least someone at nvidia had knowledge of the extent of nvidia liability,there is no basis to presume that nvidia management would have had such knowledge.
accordingly,neither the collective scienter doctrine nor the core operations doctrine alone gives rise to a strong inference of scienter.
having evaluated plaintiffs allegations individually,we find that none creates a strong inference of scienter alone.evaluating the allegations together,we find that they do not create a strong inference of sci
