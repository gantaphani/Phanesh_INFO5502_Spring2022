we uphold the sec legal conclusions unless they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,a.canady sec,quoting wonsover sec.its factual findings are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.
we first note that seghers has waived the argument that he has a general constitutional and a statutory right to a hearing before being permanently barred from associating with any investment advisor.section f of the investment advisers act provides 
the commission,by order,shall censure or place limitations on the activities of any person associated with an investment advisor,or suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months or bar any such person from being associated with an investment advisor,if the commission finds,on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing,that such censure,placing of limitations,suspension,or bar is in the public interest and that such person is enjoined from any action,conduct,or practice specified in paragraph of subsection e of this section.
f emphasis added.the action,conduct,or practice specified in section e includes engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.e.
rule a of the commission rules of practice provides 
after a respondent answer has been filed the respondent,or the interested division may make a motion for summary disposition of any or all allegations of the order instituting proceedings with respect to that respondent the facts of the pleadings of the party against whom the motion is made shall be taken as true,except as modified by stipulations or admissions made by that party,by uncontested affidavits,or by facts officially noted pursuant to.
a.the hearing officer is authorized to grant the motion for summary disposition if there is no genuine issue with regard to any material fact and the party making the motion is entitled to a summary disposition as a matter of law.b.
seghers argued in his brief that the constitution and section f,f,require the sec to conduct a hearing before permanently barring an individual from associating with any investment advisor.at oral argument,however,seghers counsel conceded that he has no constitutional or statutory right to a hearing if there is no genuine issue of material fact.in light of his concession,we need not address the argument.
we reject seghers argument that alj mahony was without authority to vacate the scheduled hearing and reconsider the division motion for summary disposition.the sec rules of practice authorize the alj to r egulat e the course of a proceeding and the conduct of the parties and their counsel.the alj was part of regulating the course of the consider the division motion for summary disposition notwithstanding his predecessor denial thereof.
we also reject seghers argument that the sec applied the incorrect legal standard in considering the summary disposition motion.the sec stated that summary disposition may be granted if there is no genuine issue with regard to any material fact and the party making the motion is entitled to a summary disposition as a matter of law.sec opinion at quoting b.according to the commission,seghers must set forth specific facts establishing a genuine issue of material fact and may not rely upon mere allegations in his pleadings to the law judge to create a genuine issue.id.at citing frank quattrone,release,wl,at respondent did not rely on mere conclusory allegations or speculation but instead offered specific facts in opposition to sec summary disposition motion.
seghers claims that the sec statement that he may not rely upon mere allegations in his pleadings is at odds with a,which states,the facts of the pleadings of the party against whom the motion is made shall be taken as true,except as modified by stipulations or admissions made by that party,by uncontested affidavits,or by facts officially noted
