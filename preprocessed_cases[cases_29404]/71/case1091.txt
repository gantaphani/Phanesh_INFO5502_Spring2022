facts procedural history 
the facts are not in dispute.vorris blankenship,an attorney employed by kpmg llp kpmg,developed cancer.he suffered severe complications as a result of his medical treatment.blankenship treating physician informed him that,although he could undergo surgery to attempt to improve his situation,it was not advisable because the surgery could cause further complications and exacerbate his condition.
liberty life,administrator and fiduciary of the kpmg employee disability plan disability plan,of which blankenship was a member,initially determined in june that blankenship qualified for disability benefits under the disability plan.however,on april,liberty life sent blankenship a letter informing him that his benefits would be terminated because it had determined that there were alternative treatments that could improve his condition.blankenship appealed the decision to liberty life.five months later,in september,liberty life rejected blankenship appeal,reaffirming its prior decision to terminate benefits,and adding additional reasons for the determination.liberty life also informed blankenship that he had exhausted his administrative remedies and that its decision was final.
on september,kpmg terminated blankenship,who was at the time,for failure to return to work.upon termination,blankenship became eligible to receive retirement benefits from several of his retirement plans with kpmg.in a written letter,kpmg informed blankenship of his options for distribution of these benefits.the kpmg pension plan offered the benefits as either a joint and survivor annuity for the lives of blankenship and his spouse or as a payment.the payment could be distributed directly to blankenship,or he could elect to roll it over into an ira or other tax qualified vehicle.the kpmg personal account for retirement par plan,a plan in which the employer contributed an amount equal to percent of blankenship salary each year,also allowed for an annuity,a payment,or a direct rollover to an ira,with the additional options of payment in monthly installments or deferred distribution of the funds until blankenship reached the age of.
blankenship chose to roll over both accounts directly into an ira managed by the vanguard fiduciary trust company vanguard.on december,kpmg transferred,representing the amount in blankenship pension plan account,to his vanguard ira.on january,kpmg transferred,the amount in blankenship par plan account,to the vanguard ira.the disability plan requires that other income benefits be deducted from the total monthly disability benefit paid to the insured.these other income benefits are defined to include t he amount of benefits the insured receives under the employer retirement plan as follows a any disability benefits b any retirement benefits.emphasis added.retirement benefits are defined as money from a retirement plan which

discussion 
we first address liberty life challenge to the district court ruling that it is not entitled to deduct the disability payments due blankenship by the retirement benefits transferred to blankenship ira at vanguard.the disability plan requires that other income benefits be deducted from the total monthly disability benefit payments paid to the insured.these other income benefits are defined to include t he amount of benefits the insured receives under the employer retirement plan as follows a any disability benefits b any retirement benefits.emphasis added.the issue here is whether blankenship received his retirement funds when they were transferred to his vanguard ira under the terms of the disability plan.
we review de novo a district court determinations regarding the text of an erisa plan,including whether plan terms are ambiguous.cisneros unum life ins.of,cir see also metropolitan life ins.parker,cir citing cisneros,at.
we begin by recognizing that the term receives is not defined in the disability plan.on appeal,both parties accept the term receive to mean to take into possession or control,with blankenship focusing on the possession aspect,arguing that it means to accept custody of collect.however,a definition of receipt based on possession and one based on control may lead to two separate outcomes.thus,when considered in the context of the disability plan,the term receives is ambiguous.we therefore apply the rule of contra proferentem,and we conclude that it supports the district court determination.
contra proferentem,which is recognized by federal common law and the law of every state and the district of columbia,see kunin benefit trust life ins,cir,holds that if,after applying the normal principles of contractual construction,the insurance contract is fairly susceptible of two different interpretations,another rule of construction will be applied the interpretation that is most favorable to the insured will be adopted.id.at.the rule applies in interpreting ambiguous terms in an plan except where the plan grants the administrator discretion to construe its terms,is
