the instant petition for a writ of mandate presents the question of whether the california department of corporations the doc may be held liable for investment losses suffered by investors who purchased fraudulent securities from brokers subject to desist and refrain orders after those orders were rescinded by the doc.the real parties in interest contend that under government code section,which creates a private right of action against public entities that fail to discharge a mandatory duty,the doc may be held liable for such losses because the doc violated corporations code section command not to rescind any order without first finding that the action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors and consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this law the corporate securities law of.we disagree.
as explained below,when viewed in context,section is discretionary and does not create any mandatory duty under government code section.in addition,it is clear that the legislature intended that violations of section would not give rise to any private right of action,and permitting the instant lawsuit to go forward would frustrate legislative intent.thus,while the investors losses are indeed tragic,we conclude the instant claim against the doc for redress of those losses fails as a matter of law.consequently,we grant the petition.
on february,the real parties in interest,investors the investors,sued the doc for million in investment losses sustained when they purchased valueless securities in a ponzi scheme perpetrated by daniel william heath,heath and associates,larry schlarmann,and schlarmann and associates.the investors bought the securities based on the promise that the investments were safer than stocks and bonds and would guarantee to percent annual returns.
on march,the doc issued a desist and refrain order against schlarmann and his related business entities the schlarmann entities,and a separate but substantially similar order against heath and his related business entities the heath entities.the orders stated 
pursuant to section of the california corporate securities law of,you are hereby ordered to desist and refrain from the further offer or sale in the state of california of securities for the reason that,in the opinion of the commissioner of corporations of the state of california,the sale of such securities is subject to qualification under said law,such securities are being or have been offered for sale without first being so qualified,and the commissioner of corporations of the state of california finds that qualification of such securities is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors,and is consistent with the purposes of the policy and provisions of the corporate securities law of.
the doc also issued a desist and refrain order against the heath entities regarding their brokerage activities,which stated 
pursuant to section of the california corporate securities law of,you are hereby ordered to desist and refrain from acting as a in the state of california unless and until you have been licensed as such under said law or unless exempt,for the reason that,in the opinion of the commissioner of corporations of the state of california,you are acting or have acted as a in violation of section,and the commissioner finds that this order is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors,and is consistent with the purposes of the policy and provisions of the corporate securities law of.
the doc subsequently these orders by entering into stipulated settlements,first with the heath entities on may,and then with the schlarmann entities on june.the settlements provided that the schlarmann and heath entities would waive their rights to an administrative hearing and appeal contesting the desist and refrain orders in return,the parties agreed that the orders were not statements of admission,liability,fault or breach of any statute,regulation or order,and were not intended to be a statement as to the integrity of the heath entities or the schlarmann entities or of the investment potential of any security that those entities might offer,including the investments subject to the march,desist and refrain orders.the stipulated settlements state that the parties intended by the settlements to save time and expenses from further litigation of this matter.
the investors original complaint asserted four causes of action against the doc,alleging that it failed to fulfill its duties under the corporations code of protecting investors,such as the plaintiffs,from the fraudulent sales of securities.the complaint cited various provisions of the corporations code that it alleged had been violated by the doc.
the doc demurred to the complaint and the trial court sustained the demurrer as to each of the causes of action,ruling that the various corporations code sections cited by the investors in their complaint reflected discretionary,not mandatory duties and thus could not support liability.the court,however,noted that a provision cited by the investors in their opposition to the demurrer but not in their appears to impose a mandatory duty to make certain findings prior to rescinding an order.the court further noted that the doc had entered into stipulated settlements without making the findings specified in section,instead merely reciting that the settlements would save time and expenses.
the trial court granted the investors leave to amend their complaint to state a claim based on a breach of the duty contained in section.the court noted that the investors might not be able to amend their complaint in this fashion because if the commissioner has a discretionary duty to do something and then has a duty to make findings,the fact that the findings are made,which is the mandatory duty,does or does not necessarily give you the relief you requesting.the court also stated that if the investors were unable to amend their complaint successfully,i do think you going to get another chance to amend.
the investors then filed a first amended complaint,repeating their allegations and contending that the doc was liable for their financial losses based on its failure to perform its mandatory duty under section.after the doc again demurred,arguing,among other things,that section did not create a mandatory duty,the trial court overruled the demurrer,stating 
t his court has already determined that section imposes a mandatory duty to make certain findings prior to rescinding an order.the c ourt granted leave to amend in order for plaintiffs to allege a specific violation of section plaintiffs have amended to allege such a violation.
the court also determined that section was intended to protect against the kind of injury alleged by the investors,and that whether the doc violation of that section was the proximate cause of the investors injury was a question of fact.finally,the court ruled that there was no specific grant of statutory immunity that protected the doc from the investors claim.see creason department of health services cal th,d,creason if liability is precluded by a specific immunity statute,it can not be found under,which simply imposes a general legal duty or liability.
after answering the first amended complaint,the doc petitioned this court for a peremptory writ of mandate,contending that if the trial court ruling were allowed to stand,it would subject the doc to unprecedented liability,making it essentially a guarantor of investments whenever disgruntled investors perceive that the department desist and refrain orders somehow fall short of the terms of the corporate securities law of.the doc complained that by virtue of the instant case alone,the department is exposed to staggering losses that would amount to a significant percentage of its annual budget.
in response to the doc writ petition,we issued an order to show cause and stayed the trial court proceedings pending our resolution of the question of whether section imposes a mandatory duty on the doc under government code section.see state of california superior court d,fn.granting writ relief where trial court overruled demurrer filed by real estate commissioner because relief by extraordinary writ is an appropriate remedy where,as here,it is desirable that an important jurisdictional question presented by the defense of governmental immunity be speedily determined county of sacramento superior court cal d,writ relief is an appropriate remedy where it is desirable that an important jurisdictional question presented by the defense of sovereign immunity from suit should be speedily determined.it is to this question we now turn.
discussion 
the legal issue presented in this case concerns the intersection of two separate bodies of law,public entity liability under government code section,and the doc duties under the corporate securities law of.we,therefore,begin our analysis by summarizing the applicable legal principles with respect to each of these distinct bodies of law.
public entity liability under government code section 
the california tort claims act provides that a public entity is not liable for injury arising from an act or omission except as provided by statute,subd.a except as otherwise provided by statute a a public entity is not liable for an injury,whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person shamsian department of conservation th,d.
one form of statutory public entity liability,enacted in,is contained in government code section,which establishes a private right of action whenever i a public entity is under a mandatory duty imposed by an enactment ii the enactment was designed to protect against the injury claimed and iii the injury was proximately caused by the public entity failure to discharge its mandatory duty see haggis city of los angeles cal th,d,haggis state of california superior court,supra,d at.recognizing test for determining whether liability may be imposed on a public entity under.
in applying government code section,the first and foremost precondition to liability is that the enactment at issue be obligatory,rather than merely discretionary or permissive,in its directions to the public entity it must require,rather than merely authorize or permit,that a particular action be taken or not taken.haggis,supra,cal th at,d.it is not enough,moreover,that the public entity or officer have been under an obligation to perform a function if the function itself involves the exercise of discretion.walt rankin associates,city of murrieta th,d not every statute that uses the word shall is obligatory rather than permissive,and there may be factors other than statutory language that may indicate that apparently obligatory language was not intended to foreclose a government entity exercise of discretion county of los angeles superior court,supra,th at,d the use of the word shall in an enactment does not necessarily create a mandatory duty.thus,even where a statute includes mandatory language,there may be other factors that indicate that apparent obligatory language was not intended to foreclose a governmental entity or officer exercise of discretion.creason,supra,cal th at,d.
whether an enactment creates a mandatory duty is a question of law haggis,supra,cal th at,d,nunn state of california cal d,nunn.in deciding whether a statute imposes a mandatory duty,the courts look to legislative intent,which is determined primarily,although not exclusively,from the statutory text.nunn,at.in construing the statute,we must give the statute a reasonable construction that conforms to the apparent purpose and intention of the lawmakers,and the various parts of the statutory enactment must be harmonized by considering the particular clause in the context of the whole statute.id.at,haggis,at,d,reviewing court must examine the language,function and apparent purpose of the pertinent statutory provision to determine if it creates a mandatory duty.
b.the corporate securities law of 
section was enacted as part of a comprehensive reform of california securities laws passed by the legislature as the corporate securities law of the act.et see generally marsh volk,practice under the cal.securities laws et marsh and volk.the primary objective of the act was the creation of a balanced regulatory scheme to cope with the problems of modern securities markets in california.marsh volk,supra.
under the act,all offers and sales of securities in california must be qualified with the commissioner of the doc the commissioner unless specifically exempted.similarly,persons may not act as or investment advisors in the state of california without first obtaining a certificate from the commissioner authorizing such activity.the act also prohibits a number of deceptive practices,such as utilizing false or misleading statements in the purchase or sale of securities and engaging in insider trading.
the act provides two primary enforcement mechanisms.first,it authorizes the commissioner to prevent violations of the act by issuing injunctive orders against violators of the act.second,it provides for private rights of action by injured parties directly against violators of the act for financial losses incurred 
enforcement by the commissioner 
section of the act provides discretionary authority to the commissioner to enforce the act licensing and qualification requirements.section,subdivision a states that i f,in the opinion of the commissioner,a security is being sold without proper qualification,the commissioner may order the issuer or offeror of the security to desist and refrain from the further offer or sale of the security until qualification has been made.similarly,under section,subdivision b,i f,in the opinion of the commissioner,a person is acting as a or investment adviser without first being licensed to do so,the commissioner may order that person to desist and refrain from the activity until the person has been appropriately licensed or the required filing has been made under this law.
once the commissioner has issued such an order,the act provides certain procedural rights to persons affected by the order,including the right to a hearing challenging the order under the administrative procedures act,subd.d,et if a hearing is not requested,however,the commissioner order becomes final and can not be reviewed by any court or agency,subd.d.
section of the act,which is contained in a chapter of the act entitled administration,provides no rule,form or order may be made,amended,or rescinded unless the commissioner finds that the action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors and consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this law.
enforcement by private parties 
the act also creates a new form of statutory liability in the form of private rights of action designed to afford victims of securities fraud a remedy without the task of proving common law fraud.boam trident financial th,d america online,superior court th,d this california law was designed to protect the public from fraud and deception in securities matters,by providing statutory remedies for violations of the california corporations code.thus,in a chapter entitled civil liability,the act specifically authorizes four separate causes of action to enable private plaintiffs to seek redress directly from persons who have violated certain of its provisions.see.
specifically,the act creates a private right of action for i buyers or sellers of securities who are injured by persons who violate section,which prohibits actions that creat e a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for any security ii buyers and sellers of securities who are injured by persons who violate section,which prohibits the use of untrue statement s of a material fact or omissions of material facts to buy or sell securities iii buyers and sellers of securities who are injured by persons who violate section,which prohibits certain forms of insider trading and iv buyers of securities sold in violation of sections,or,which require securities sold in california to either be qualified for sale or exempt from the qualification requirements.in each instance,the private right of action is created against the person or persons alleged to have violated the specified provisions of the act.significantly,there is no suggestion that the doc can be held liable for either i another person violation of the provisions of the act for which a private right of action is provided or ii itself violating provisions of the act for which no private right of action is provided,such as section 
while intending to minimize securities fraud,the drafters of the act were also cognizant of the dangers of casting the net of civil liability too broadly.in the words of its principal drafters the act attempts to provide a scheme of liability that will adequately protect the investing public without undue hardship upon persons who might be potential defendants in such actions.marsh volk,supra,boam,supra,th at,d noting the act imposed certain restrictions on recovery,such as shortening the statute of limitations for bringing a statutory action and limiting the damages available california amplifier,supra,th at,d the purpose of the act in this regard is to create statutory liability that eliminates some of the elements of common law fraud,but balances this expansion of liability by placing other restrictions on recovery.in section,the act explicitly directs courts not to rely on the act provisions to authorize private rights of action beyond those explicitly enumerated.mandating that except as explicitly provided,no civil liability in favor of any private party against any person including government shall arise by implication from or as a result of the violation of any provision of this law or any rule or order hereunder.the drafters emphasized that i t is difficult to see how language restricting the creation of causes of action for violations of the act could be any more explicit than that contained in section.marsh volk,supra.
section does not create a mandatory duty under government code section 
investors contend that their complaint allegations state a claim against the doc under government code section for breach of a mandatory duty embodied in section.they argue that their claim satisfies all three prongs of government code section because i section imposes a mandatory duty upon the doc to make a specific finding that an act is necessary or appropriate in the public interest before it may make,amend,or rescind an order ii the requirement that the doc make these findings was intended to protect against the kind of injury suffered by the investors and iii the breach of the doc mandatory duty to make the requisite finding was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs investment losses.
we disagree that section creates any mandatory duty under government code section,and thus analyze,and resolve,the investors contention solely by reference to the first prong of government code section liability.see haggis,supra,cal th at,d,declining to decide whether claims satisfied second third prongs for,liability where claims failed other prongs.
section does not create any mandatory duty 
it is true,as the investors emphasize,that section utilizes mandatory language,specifically in its direction that n o order may be amended,or rescinded unless the commissioner finds the action necessary or appropriate.despite this mandatory language,however,the provision fits squarely within an overall statutory framework granting the commissioner pervasively discretionary authority to address violations of the act.haggis,supra,cal th at,d,marsh volk,supra,explaining that the act continued the tradition of placing broad discretionary authority in the hands of the commissioner see,the commissioner may from time to time make,amend and rescind such rules,forms,and orders as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this law and may in his discretion waive any requirement of any rule or form in situations where in his opinion such requirement is not necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors italics added.
under the act,even if in the opinion of the commissioner,subd.a a security is being offered without qualification or a is operating without an appropriate license,the commissioner is not required to take any action.rather,the act is explicitly permissive,stating only that if the commissioner perceives such a violation,he may issue a desist and refrain order,as the commissioner did in this case.ibid.
the investors acknowledge that the decision to issue a desist and refrain order is discretionary,but contend that once such an order has been issued,it can not be rescinded without the commissioner first making a mandatory finding that the commissioner own action is necessary or appropriate.the investors argue that this statutory command creates a basis for liability against the doc under government code section we disagree.
first,the only thing that section mandates is that the commissioner finds that his actions are necessary or appropriate,italics added.the section does not provide any further guidance with respect to exactly what the commissioner must do,for example,by mandating written or even express findings.see ensworth mullvain d.statute that authorized an injunction if the judge finds by clear and convincing evidence that unlawful harassment exists,did not require the court to make a specific finding on the record prior to issuing injunction,but was satisfied by finding necessarily implie d by the issuance of injunction itself.in fact,the section does not appear to require any action at all,but rather a state of mind that the commissioner,before acting,deems the action to be taken necessary or appropriate.this statutory language,which fails to mandate any specific conduct on the part of the commissioner,strongly supports a conclusion that section does not create any mandatory duty.superior court th,d a statute is deemed to impose a mandatory duty on a public official only if the statute affirmatively imposes the duty and provides implementing guidelines clausing san francisco unified school dist.d.if rules and guidelines for the implementation of an alleged mandatory duty are not set forth in an otherwise prohibitory statute,it can not create a mandatory duty nunn,supra,cal d at,statute commanding that standards for armed security guards shall be prescribed by the department of consumer affairs and prohibiting guards licensed after,from carrying firearms without meeting those standards,while arguably implying that standards should be promulgated before,did not create mandatory duty to do so.
second,even assuming that section mandates express or implied findings as a prerequisite to rescinding an order,the required findings themselves rely on a discretionary application of the commissioner judgment and expertise.haggis,supra,cal th at,d,it is not enough for,liability that the public entity or officer have been under an obligation to perform a function if the function itself involves the exercise of discretion.the commissioner is required to find that his action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors and consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act.this legislative command does not dictate any particular result,or even provide a standard by which action taken by the commissioner can be objectively measured,but rather explicitly call s upon the judgment,expertise and discretion of the commissioner to define what action,if any,is necessary or appropriate again,strongly supporting the conclusion that there is no mandatory duty.see haggis,at,d,statutory language that calls upon the judgment,expertise and discretion of the public officer does not create a mandatory duty within the meaning of government code section fox county of fresno d.if the statute were to be construed as mandatory,it would be very difficult,if not impossible,to reconcile that part of the statute which says that the enforcement agency shall with that portion which gives the agency the authority to take any appropriate action.
in sum,while section includes language that appears mandatory,this language is situated squarely within a statutory framework
