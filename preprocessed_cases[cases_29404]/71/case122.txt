plaintiffs appellants teachers retirement system of louisiana and christine fleckles,acting on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated investors collectively,plaintiffs,brought suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against pfizer,and several of its directors and officers alleging violations of b,a,and of the securities exchange act of,b,a,as well as securities and exchange commission rule rule promulgated thereunder,b.according to plaintiffs,between october,and october,pfizer made fraudulent misrepresentations and fraudulently omitted to disclose information regarding the safety of two of its drugs,celebrex celecoxib and bextra valdecoxib.when the market eventually learned of the cardiovascular risks associated with these drugs,the value of pfizer shares fell,harming plaintiffs and other shareholders in the process.a lawsuit followed.
the district court swain,denied pfizer motion to dismiss the complaint,certified the class,and allowed the parties to proceed through discovery.after extensive discovery and nearly a decade of litigation,the district court granted a motion in limine to exclude plaintiffs expert on loss causation and damages,daniel fischel fischel,from testifying at trial.the court provided two reasons for excluding the testimony.first,in an earlier summary judgment ruling,the court had determined that pfizer is not liable for certain alleged misrepresentations searle searle and pharmacia corporation pharmacia the companies that manufactured celebrex and bextra before pfizer made when they owned the drugs.because fischel did not isolate the effects of pfizer alleged misrepresentations and omissions from the effects of certain of searle and pharmacia allegedly fraudulent statements,the court concluded that his analysis would be unhelpful to the jury in determining the losses that pfizer caused.
second,using an event study,fischel had calculated inflation caused by pfizer alleged fraud by identifying seven days on which pfizer stock price fell when the market discovered allegedly concealed information about celebrex and bextra and five days on which pfizer stock price rose in reaction to new information about the drugs.when the district court determined in its summary judgment ruling that the declines on two days in the event study could not reasonably be attributed to pfizer alleged fraud,fischel removed those days from his analysis and also adjusted the amount of the increases that he included in his calculations.the court concluded that fischel methodology for adjusting the amount of price increases attributable to pfizer fraud was not the product of reliable principles and methods reliably applied.in re pfizer.secs,civ.lts hbp,wl,at may,in re pfizer ii.for these two reasons,the court prevented fischel from testifying about loss causation or damages.left with no testimony on these issues,plaintiffs could not sustain key elements of their claims,and the district court granted pfizer motion for summary judgment.
on appeal,plaintiffs argue that the district court abused its discretion in excluding fischel testimony,even if the district court correctly found that pfizer could not be held liable for certain searle and pharmacia statements,because fischel had no obligation to disaggregate those statements from pfizer statements.plaintiffs also argue that the district court was incorrect to conclude that pfizer was not liable,as a matter of law,for the searle and pharmacia statements.we conclude,first,that the district court abused its discretion by excluding fischel testimony in its entirety.the court erred in concluding that fischel needed to disaggregate the effects of pfizer allegedly fraudulent conduct from searle or pharmacia,regardless of whether pfizer is ultimately found liable for the latters statements.under plaintiffs theory of the case,fischel testimony could have been helpful to the jury even without such disaggregation.as for fischel adjustment to the price increases,the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that this change was not sufficiently reliable to be presented to a jury.however,fischel error did not render the remainder of his testimony unreliable.the court should have prevented him from testifying about the adjustment,but otherwise allowed him to present his findings on loss causation and damages.
we further find that the district court erred in concluding,as a matter of law,that pfizer had insufficient authority over certain searle and pharmacia statements as to have made them for the purposes of rule.we note,however,that our finding that the district court abused its discretion in excluding fischel testimony does not turn on the question of pfizer ultimate liability for these statements.accordingly,we hereby vacate and remand the judgment of the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual background 
celebrex and bextra are part of a broad class of medicines known as drugs,which are used to treat chronic pain and inflammation.before,this class of drugs had a common problem patients who used the drugs over a long period of time often developed stomach ulcers and other gastrointestinal problems.in this deficiency,pharmaceutical manufacturers saw opportunity.specifically,two companies merck,and searle began researching a type of drug,known as a cyclooxygenase cox inhibitor,which could reduce pain and inflammation without causing gastrointestinal distress.both companies ultimately succeeded,with merck creating a drug called vioxx,and searle creating celebrex.
pfizer,a,global pharmaceutical company that develops,manufactures and markets prescription medicines,in re pfizer.secs,civ.lts hbp,d,in re pfizer i,first became involved with cox inhibitors through searle.in february,pfizer signed a series of agreements with searle in which it agreed to,among other things,help market celebrex collectively,the co promotion agreement.searle later transferred control over celebrex to pharmacia through a merger in early,and pharmacia succeeded to searle rights under the co promotion agreement pfizer continued to fulfill its obligations under the co promotion agreement until april,when it obtained the exclusive rights to manufacture,promote,and sell celebrex and bextra by purchasing pharmacia.
plaintiffs contend that,while celebrex and bextra eliminated the gastrointestinal issues associated with drugs,the drugs presented a different,dangerous side effect.as early as,they claim,pfizer and searle knew about studies linking the cox inhibitors to cardiovascular problems in patients.but because celebrex was an enormous commercial success,searle issued press releases and other public statements denying that the drugs presented such risks.when ownership of celebrex passed to pharmacia,and later to pfizer,both companies continued to tout its safety,as well as the safety of bextra,notwithstanding the discovery of additional medical evidence tying the drugs use to heightened cardiovascular risks.according to plaintiffs,the press releases and public statements that pharmacia and pfizer issued during the class period had the effect of maintaining the public misperception about the safety of celebrex and bextra.from a market perspective,this meant that during the class period,investors continued to value pharmacia,and later pfizer,as if the companies products provided alternatives to other drugs without other side effects namely,cardiovascular risks that could deter consumers.
according to plaintiffs,pfizer effort to conceal these risks reached the breaking point in the fall of.on september,merck announced that it was withdrawing vioxx from the market due to cardiovascular safety concerns.seeking to capitalize on the downfall of its largest competitor in the cox inhibitor market,pfizer issued a series of press releases,advertisements,and public statements assuring investors that no studies had shown any increased cardiovascular risk associated with celebrex and that bextra cardiovascular safety profile is also well established in studies,internal quotation marks omitted.but new scrutiny followed merck announcement.on october,an editorial in the new england journal of medicine questioned the safety of pfizer celebrex and bextra.internal quotation marks omitted.soon after,information about studies linking the drugs to cardiovascular risks reached the public eye.these revelations,plaintiffs claim,caused pfizer share prices to fall as investors reassessed the value of celebrex and bextra in light of the newly discovered risks.
procedural history 
on december,a putative class action was filed against pfizer in the united states district court for the southern district of new york swain.plaintiffs represent all investors who purchased pfizer stock between october,and october,the class period.they allege that pfizer concealed the safety risks of celebrex and bextra both through statements delivered by searle,pharmacia,pfizer,and their employees when pfizer was a party to the co promotion agreement,and also through pfizer own statements when pfizer later owned the drugs in violation of b,a,and of the securities exchange act of.with respect to the claims under these three sections,the district court denied pfizer motion to dismiss the complaint and,on april,certified the class.
with the class certified,plaintiffs turned to developing their theory of pfizer liability.notably,searle and pharmacia owned celebrex and bextra before pfizer,and both searle and pharmacia allegedly made fraudulent misrepresentations and omitted to disclose material information about the cardiovascular risks associated with the drugs.plaintiffs alleged that pfizer is responsible for some of these misrepresentations in particular,statements by searle,pharmacia,and their employees because pfizer had authority over those statements.but pfizer,plaintiffs contended,also engaged in its own fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions about the drugs both before,and during,the class period.like the searle and pharmacia statements,these misrepresentations and omissions supposedly concealed the cardiovascular risks associated with celebrex and bextra.
this array of fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions created an issue for plaintiffs how to determine whether pfizer alleged fraud,as differentiated from alleged fraud by pharmacia or searle,caused pfizer stock price to fall.to address that issue,plaintiffs relied on an theory of liability.all three companies,plaintiffs claim,engaged in fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions that concealed the same information namely,that celebrex and bextra increase the risk of cardiovascular problems investors,however,typically change their assessment of a company value based on new information,not statements that reiterate old news.thus,by fraudulently concealing the same risks that pharmacia and searle hid,pfizer perpetuated the market misperceptions about celebrex and bextra,which caused the market to maintain the company stock price at an artificially high level.because the market would have adjusted the value of pfizer stock to reflect the true risks associated with celebrex and bextra if pfizer had not continued to conceal those risks,pfizer should be liable for the full amount by which its stock price fell when the market eventually discovered the truth.
if correct,this theory of liability could provide a means for establishing that pfizer is liable for the full value of the information that its predecessors concealed a theory of liability,however,does not constitute proof of liability.it does not show that the alleged misinformation about the drugs,once revealed,actually caused shareholders to lose money,nor does it identify the extent of those losses.for those issues,plaintiffs turned to daniel fischel,professor emeritus of law and business at the university of chicago law school and a former dean of that institution,who issued his initial expert report on january,the initial report.
in this initial report,fischel performed an event study analysis to determine whether,and the extent to which,pfizer stock price changed when the market learned about the cardiovascular risks associated with celebrex and bextra.fischel contended that,assuming that pfizer engaged in misrepresentations and omissions that kept information about the cardiovascular risks of celebrex and bextra from the market,his methodology isolated the extent to which the alleged fraud had artificially inflated pfizer stock price throughout the class period.
an event study is a statistical regression analysis that examines the effect of an event on a dependent variable,such as a company stock price.jay eisenhofer et,securities fraud,stock price valuation,and loss causation toward a corporate finance based theory of loss causation,bus.law.fischel briefly described this form of analysis in his initial report.in many event studies,the expert begins by analyzing how the defendant company stock price typically changes from as compared to securities issued by similar companies and the market as a whole.this comparison makes it possible to predict what the return of a defendant company security should be on a certain date given the return for the market as a whole known as the predicted return.daniel fischel,use of modern finance theory in securities fraud cases involving actively traded securities,bus.law.the expert then identifies days on which information correcting the alleged fraud reached the market and notes the amount that the defendant company stock price changed on that day the actual return.fischel,supra at.b y comparing the predicted return with the actual return on the date of release of the supposedly correct information or immediately thereafter,the event study attempts to isolate the change in the return earned by investors that is attributable solely to the allegedly withheld or false information.fischel,supra at.the difference between the actual return and the predicted return is known as the residual return.
performing an event study can thus help an expert to determine at least two things.first,assuming that the defendant company fraudulently concealed information,the event study shows how much money the fraud caused shareholders to lose.identifying residual returns on days when allegedly concealed information reached the market indicates that the supposedly withheld information caused the company stock price to change.see frederick dunbar arun sen,counterfactual keys to causation and damages in shareholder class action lawsuits.if the release of allegedly withheld information causes a stock price decrease,shareholders who purchased the defendant company stock after the alleged fraud but before the revelation may have paid a higher price than they would have but for the defendant fraudulent conduct known as an artificial ly inflat ed price.
second,the event study helps the expert calculat e what the price of the defendant company security would have been had the alleged wrongful conduct not occurred,by estimating the amount of artificial inflation in the company stock price over time.fischel,supra at.just as the existence of a residual return on a day when the market discovers allegedly concealed information shows that the company stock price was artificially inflated,the size of the residual return on such a day provides evidence of the amount by which concealing that particular information inflated the defendant company stock.as a result,if concealed information reached the market through multiple corrective disclosures,the sum of the residual returns associated with those disclosures provides evidence about the amount of artificial inflation in the company stock after the fraud but before those corrections.see bradford cornell gregory morgan,using finance theory to measure damages in fraud on the market cases.thus,an expert using an event study can estimate the amount of artificial inflation in the defendant company stock price when shareholders purchased their shares,which is equivalent to estimating the difference between what those investors should have paid for the shares the alleged fraud,and what they actually paid.see dunbar sen,supra at.
after explaining these background principles,fischel turned to the particulars of plaintiffs claims.at the outset,he emphasized that plaintiffs had not asked him to determine whether pfizer did,in fact,fraudulently conceal information about celebrex and bextra,or whether it concealed the same information as pharmacia and searle.rather,he assume d plaintiffs will be able to establish at trial that pfizer withheld material information about the cardiovascular risks associated with the drugs from at least the beginning of the class period,and instead used his analysis to determine whether,and the extent to which,pfizer share price fell when investors discovered those risks.as fischel explained,if plaintiffs are correct that pfizer concealed the cardiovascular risks associated with celebrex and bextra,measuring the amount by which the revelation of the risks caused pfizer share price to change identifies the artificial inflation in the company stock due to the alleged fraud.
operating under this theory,fischel first identified seven days on which the market learned information about the cardiovascular risks associated with celebrex and bextra,and pfizer stock price fell by a greater amount than expected.in other words,on the days these disclosures the corrective disclosures occurred,pfizer stock price showed negative residual returns.but fischel also observed that,around the same time as the corrective disclosures,pfizer stock price rose more than expected on five days when the market learned new information about the cox inhibitors.that is,on the five days that these disclosures the positive disclosures occurred,pfizer stock price showed positive residual returns.to account for these positive residual returns,fischel offset the stock price movements on the corrective disclosure days by the movements on the positive disclosure days.the result revealed that,throughout the class period,pfizer alleged misrepresentations and concealments about the cardiovascular risks associated with celebrex and bextra artificially inflated the value of its stock.specifically,fischel determined that pfizer stock was inflated by per share at the beginning of the class period and that inflation rose as high as per share before eventually falling to by october.
according to fischel,offsetting the positive disclosures against the corrective disclosures gave a more accurate measurement of the effects of the alleged fraud because i gnoring these price increases would overstate the alleged artificial inflation.on two of the positive disclosure dates,he noted,pfizer stock price rose as the market learned about the risks associated with vioxx and implicitly predicted greater sales for celebrex and bextra after learning that vioxx was being withdrawn and celebrex and bextra would be kept on the market.the subsequent corrective disclosures therefore revealed both allegedly concealed information about celebrex and bextra and showed the market that its prediction of greater sales was mistaken.to identify just the artificial inflation associated with allegedly concealed information,then,fischel determined that he needed to offset the price increases on these two positive disclosure dates against those on the corrective disclosure dates.
on the other three positive disclosure dates,fischel observed that investors increased their valuation of pfizer after learning that,despite the link between the cox inhibitors and cardiovascular problems,the risks were not as severe as anticipated and pfizer would be able to continue selling the drugs.investors,in other words,tempered their initially dire predictions about the effect of the cardiovascular risks on pfizer ability to sell celebrex and bextra.since he determined that the price movements on corrective disclosure days reflected overly pessimistic projections,fischel offset the value of the subsequent positive disclosures to get a more accurate assessment of the true value of the concealed information about the cardiovascular risks.
recognizing the possibility that the factfinder might conclude that not all the corrective disclosures identified by fischel were related to the fraud,pfizer counsel pressed fischel during a deposition on how he would adjust his analysis to account for such a decision.to that end,fischel addressed the following hypothetical 
q if the jury were to agree with all of plaintiffs allegations except to conclude that the corrective disclosure on november was not a corrective disclosure,how would that affect inflation in your analysis 
a if the statistically significant price decline on november for whatever reason is determined not to be an appropriate part of the calculations,then the sum of the residuals on all days before november would obviously be different and the artificial inflation numbers would change accordingly under those assumptions.
q so translated into this specific example,that means that the artificial inflation on dates preceding november would be lower the amount of inflation that allegedly came out of the stock price on november is that correct 
pfizer expert,paul gompers,responded directly to fischel report,rather than conducting his own analysis.gompers did not contest the use of the event study methodology and noted that he had no major criticism of how fischel obtained the residual return s in his analysis.instead,gompers focused his criticism on fischel assumptions that certain corrective disclosures actually revealed information about celebrex and bextra that had fraudulently been concealed.
after this initial round of expert discovery,pfizer filed a motion for summary judgment,which the district court granted in part and denied in part on march.the court rejected pfizer argument that plaintiffs could not show reliance because none of pfizer alleged misrepresentations caused the company stock price to rise.a misstatement,the court countered,may cause inflation simply by maintaining existing market expectations.in re pfizer i,d at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.the court concluded that fischel analysis showing that pfizer share price fell in response to disclosures of adverse information about celebrex and bextra could provide a basis for a reasonable jury to conclude that the price was artificially inflated at the beginning of the class period,and that plaintiffs relied on that inflated price.id.at.the district court then rebuffed pfizer argument that its alleged misrepresentations did not cause the company share prices to fall,concluding that,for five of the seven corrective disclosure days,plaintiffs had raised a genuine dispute of material fact about whether pfizer share prices fell because the market discovered previously concealed information.id.at.
the district court,however,also ruled against plaintiffs in two respects first,it found that losses on two corrective disclosure dates could not reasonably be attributed to disclosures exposing pfizer alleged misrepresentations.on one day,the disclosed information did not provide evidence of a causal link between the cox inhibitors and cardiovascular risks.id.at.on the other,pfizer did not reveal any new information as to celebrex and bextra cardiovascular risks and instead only disseminated business information regarding earnings.id.at.second,the district court addressed plaintiffs argument that pfizer is liable for statements by searle,pharmacia and their employees when the co promotion agreement was in place.plaintiffs identified ten such misrepresentations,but the district court decided that pfizer could not be held liable for nine of them.pfizer,it concluded,is liable only for searle and pharmacia statements over which it had ultimate authority.id.at.while the co promotion agreement provided such authority for press releases,only one of the ten alleged misrepresentations was a press release.the district court concluded,as a matter of law,that pfizer did not have sufficient authority over the other nine statements,eight of which were made directly by searle or pharmacia employees and one of which was contained in a pharmacia form k filing.id the court therefore granted pfizer motion for summary judgment to the extent that plaintiffs claims were tied to the two corrective disclosures that the court determined had not revealed previously undisclosed risk,and to the extent that they were premised on misstatements the court deemed not attributable to pfizer.
plaintiffs responded to this summary judgment decision by having fischel file an updated expert report the supplemental report.the supplemental report contained no adjustments in response to the district court conclusion that,as a matter of law,pfizer could not be held liable for certain statements.but the supplemental report did contain adjustments to account for the corrective disclosures that the district court had decided could not be linked to pfizer misrepresentations.fischel first removed these corrective disclosures from his event study analysis,which resulted in the overall stock price declines caused by the corrective disclosures falling by percent.fischel then stated that,b ecause eliminating the stock price declines related to celebrex and bextra on these dates reduce d the total residual stock price decline he estimated by percent,he proportionally reduce d the residual stock price increases he measured by percent.id.emphasis added.
during a second deposition,fischel explained that excluding two corrective disclosures created the possibility that some price changes on the positive disclosure days involved reactions to information about celebrex and bextra.despite being unable to identify any clear relationship between any particular p ositive d isclosure and any particular corrective d isclosure,he decided that the exclusion of the corrective disclosures must have ha d an effect on the p ositive d isclosures because inflation can not come out of a stock unless it goes into the stock.thus,he settled on a percent proportional reduction to the amount of the positive disclosures attributed to pfizer fraud the proportional reduction.
once again,gompers issued a report challenging fischel analysis the supplemental response.his supplemental response raised two objections to fischel supplemental report,both of which eventually became the basis for pfizer motion in limine to exclude fischel from testifying.first,gompers argued that fischel proportional reduction relied on an unreliable methodology.he observed that the initial report concluded both that there was positive inflation in pfizer stock at the beginning of the class period,and that pfizer stock price increased during the class period on the positive disclosure days.emphasis added.gompers argued that,while the decision to remove two of the corrective disclosures did mean less inflation entered the stock price,that did not justify reducing price increases associated with the positive disclosures,as opposed to the amount of artificial inflation that was in pfizer stock when the class period began.if fischel had simply removed the rejected corrective disclosures from his calculations without carrying out the proportional reduction,gompers explained,the amount of artificial inflation at the beginning of the class period would have fallen by an amount equivalent to the losses previously attributed to those corrective disclosures,thus achieving equilibrium between inflation entering and exiting pfizer stock.fischel failed to justify his decision to instead proportionally reduce the amount of inflation attributable to the positive disclosures,gompers argued,which by comparison led to a higher estimate of artificial inflation in pfizer stock price at the beginning of the class period.
second,gompers argued that fischel erred in his supplemental report by ignoring the district court decision that pfizer is not responsible for many of searle and pharmacia alleged misstatements about celebrex.fischel analysis,he argued,is predicated on an assumption that pfizer is liable for all alleged misstatements and omissions made by searle and pharmacia,and fails to disaggregate the price inflation numbers that are attributable to searle and pharmacia alleged misstatements and omissions.emphasis added.as a result,his testimony would not be helpful to jurors who need to decide the amount of damages attributable to pfizer alone.
relying on gompers report,pfizer moved,pursuant to federal rule of evidence,to exclude fischel from testifying about loss causation and damages.in an order issued on may,the district court granted the motion.the court found that fischel opinion was unreliable because he proffered no explanation of the analytical basis for his proportional reduction and provided neither an explanation of the relationships among the events triggering the respective price decreases and increases nor research reference or peer review information in support of his proportional adjustment method.in re pfizer ii,wl,at.furthermore,the court decided that fischel failure to account in any way for the impact of the excluded searle and pharmacia statements renders his opinions unhelpful to the jury in making calculations of damages proximately caused by pfizer alleged misrepresentations and omissions.id.it therefore excluded fischel testimony in its entirety.
plaintiffs requested,and received,an opportunity to propose an amended supplemental report to clarify fischel position.fischel used this opportunity to explain that it was unnecessary to disaggregate searle and pharmacia misrepresentations from pfizer because plaintiffs theory of liability was that pfizer misrepresentations and omissions during the class period maintained the market false expectations about the safety of celebrex and bextra false expectations already in place prior to the class period,but kept in place after the class period in part by pfizer misrepresentations.because fischel assumed that plaintiffs would be able to prove at trial that pfizer alleged misrepresentations during the class period concealed the same safety information that was concealed just prior to the class period,fischel averred,each of pfizer misrepresentations was responsible for maintaining the same amount of artificial inflation.fischel also described the proportional reduction in greater detail,and noted that,if the court disagreed with his methodology,it should exclude only that reduction,rather than all of his testimony.
the district court considered plaintiffs submissions and,on july,denied their motion to amend the supplemental report.the court was not persuaded that the proposed amendments were sufficient to meet the standards of federal rule of evidence.and even if they were,plaintiffs had no justification for the untimely disclosure of the additional explanations and contextual information.the court also found fischel proposal to exclude only his proportional reduction to the positive disclosures no more persuasive,explaining that his offer to permit the court to select which of two putatively valid inflation determination methodologies to present to the jury plainly demonstrates that the proffered testimony is not deserving of an expert opinion label.without a loss causation and damages expert,plaintiffs could not hope to establish liability at trial,so the district court granted summary judgment to pfizer.this appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the district court erred by excluding fischel from testifying.first,they argue that fischel failure to disaggregate the impact of pfizer and other companies misrepresentations is not a basis for excluding his testimony because,contrary to the district court summary judgment decision,pfizer had ultimate authority over those statements.even if it lacked such authority,they continue,fischel did not need to account for searle and pharmacia statements in order to be helpful to the jury because,under plaintiffs theory,pfizer concealed the same information as searle and pharmacia and is therefore liable for the full extent of plaintiffs alleged losses.second,plaintiffs contend that fischel proportional reduction to the positive disclosures was reliable and nothing more than an update to the data in his event study and that the district court should not have excluded fischel testimony on this basis.
we conclude that,based on the record before the district court after pfizer motion in limine was fully submitted,the court abused its discretion by excluding fischel testimony in its entirety.in the context of plaintiffs theory,even assuming,arguendo,that pfizer lacked sufficient authority over several searle and pharmacia statements,that would not require fischel to disaggregate the effects of pfizer alleged misstatements from those of searle and pharmacia in order to help the jury calculate the amount of losses that pfizer allegedly caused.similarly,although the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that fischel proportional reduction was unreliable,that conclusion did not justify excluding the remainder of his testimony.instead,the district court should have prevented fischel from testifying about the proportional reduction and otherwise allowed him to present his findings on loss causation and damages we also find that the district court was incorrect to conclude that,as a matter of law,pfizer lacked sufficient authority over eight statements by searle and pharmacia employees to the press,as to have made those statements for the purposes of rule liability.but we note that the district court abused its discretion in excluding fischel testimony,regardless of whether pfizer ultimately is liable for those statements.
we emphasize that our decision is a narrow one.the district court granted summary judgment after excluding fischel from testifying pursuant to rule.we therefore consider only whether that decision was an abuse of discretion in light of the evidence presented to the district court and the plaintiffs theory of the case.we need not,and do not,decide whether plaintiffs theory is either legally sustainable under rule or sufficiently supported by the evidence in the record.
searle and pharmacia statements 
our analysis begins with the district court determination that pfizer can be liable only for one pharmacia press release about celebrex,and not for nine other allegedly fraudulent public statements made by searle and pharmacia employees about the drug.because the district court resolved this issue on a motion for summary judgment,we review its conclusion de novo,resolving all ambiguities and drawing all permissible factual inferences in favor of plaintiffs.burg gosselin,cir internal quotation marks omitted.viewing the facts in this favorable light,we conclude that plaintiffs have raised a genuine dispute as to whether pfizer had sufficient authority over certain statements that individual searle and pharmacia employees made to various media outlets regarding the risks associated with celebrex 
under rule,it is unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,t o make any untrue statement of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.b.to be liable,therefore,a defendant must have made the material misstatement at issue.janus capital grp.first derivative traders,d see also fezzani bear,stearns,cir.as the supreme court explained in janus,the maker of a statement is the person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement,including its content and whether and how to communicate it.janus.at.a defendant does not make a statement simply by prepar ing or publish ing it on behalf of another.id.thus,in that case,a mutual fund investment advisor who was significantly involved in preparing a client prospectuses did not make the statements contained therein.id.at.only the client had the statutory obligation to file the prospectuses and nothing in the document indicate d that any statements came from the defendant rather than its client.id.a broader reading of make,the court cautioned,would substantially undermine the rule from central bank of denver,first interstate bank of denver,d,which prohibits private suits against aiders and abettors of rule violations.id.at see also fezzani,at.
here,the district court found and pfizer does not contest that pfizer participation in the co promotion agreement with searle later pharmacia created a genuine dispute of material fact about whether the company had ultimate authority over one of pharmacia press releases about celebrex.in re pfizer i,d at.plaintiffs claim that pfizer involvement ran deeper pfizer,they argue,also had ultimate authority over statements in a form k that pharmacia filed with the securities and exchange commission sec,as well as eight statements about the drugs that searle and pharmacia employees made to members of the media.although pfizer does not contest the district court finding that a reasonable jury could conclude that pfizer had the right to approve press releases,pfizer argues that there is no evidence that pfizer had similar authority over the form k,and that its right to approve did not extend to media statements made by searle and pharmacia employees.the record offers no support for plaintiffs argument with respect to the form k statements,but does provide sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute as to the eight other statements.
as to the statements in pharmacia form k,plaintiffs have failed to identify any evidence that raises a genuine dispute as to pfizer authority over these statements.the co promotion agreement,unsurprisingly,dealt with the signatories efforts to market celebrex.but plaintiffs have not pointed to anything in the record that might allow a reasonable jury to conclude that pfizer influenced,much less had any authority over,pharmacia form k,a regulatory disclosure required by the sec to inform the public of specific events that may be material to investors.see.on the contrary,the co promotion agreement stipulated that searle later pharmacia would have sole responsibility for communicating with regulatory authorities about celebrex,which naturally runs counter to any claim that pfizer was responsible for regulatory filings like the form agreement at,ex.to pls.opp.to defs.motion for summ,cv,ecf.summary judgment as to the form k statements was therefore wholly appropriate.
plaintiffs evidence of pfizer authority over the eight statements by searle and pharmacia employees to various newspaper and journal articles fares slightly better,however.in broad terms,the eight statements all conveyed that there were no increased cardiovascular risks associated with celebrex.to be clear,there is no dispute that searle and pharmacia employees,not pfizer employees,actually delivered the statements to the press.nor is there any evidence that these employees held themselves out as representing pfizer.and in the ordinary case,the fact that the statements were attributed to searle or pharmacia employees is strong evidence that the statement s w ere made by and only by the party to whom they were attributed.janus.at.nevertheless,we find that there is a material question of fact whether the present case deviates from the ordinary case.notwithstanding that the eight statements to the press were attributed to searle and pharmacia employees,plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to conclude that pfizer had ultimate authority over the statements content and whether and how to communicate them.id.
to start,plaintiffs cite to a fax sent by a public relations firm,jointly employed by pfizer and searle,to various pfizer and searle employees.see ecf,ex.included in the fax is a q a document containing questions the press might pose regarding cardiovascular risks associated with celebrex,along with scripted answers,id.at,some of which convey effectively the same content as the statements at issue,compare id.at,with.the q a document,the fax explains,would be reviewed and finalized during a conference call between pfizer and searle,before being distributed to the appropriate parties at searle and pfizer for final.see ecf,ex,at emphasis added.this evidence is consistent with deposition testimony by andrew mccormick,a pfizer senior management team member,also cited by plaintiffs,in which mccormick avers that senior management at pfizer would need to approve of media responses related to cox inhibitors,both to reporters and to publications in the forms of letters to the editors in order to get them out the door.ecf,ex.at.although the evidence is not abundant,we are unable to conclude that no reasonable jury could find from this evidence that pfizer had ultimate authority over the eight statements to the press.
plaintiffs also rely on pfizer co promotion agreement with searle later pharmacia,pursuant to which pfizer and searle agreed to coordinate a wide range of promotional activity concerning celebrex.see ecf,ex.the meaning of the co promotion agreement,ambiguous or unambiguous,is not dispositive of the question before us at summary judgment whether a genuine issue of material fact exists as to pfizer authority over the eight searle and pharmacia statements to the press.assuming,arguendo,that the co promotion agreement unambiguously fails to provide pfizer the power to approve or disapprove of searle and,later,pharmacia statements to the press,other evidence still creates a question of fact as to whether,notwithstanding any procedures articulated in the contract,pfizer in fact had ultimate authority over these statements.the meaning of the co promotion agreement is thus but one factor in the factual determination whether pfizer indeed had ultimate authority over the eight statements to the media.because we conclude that material questions of fact preclude summary judgment regardless of the correct interpretation of the co promotion agreement,we need not interpret it in this appeal.
we therefore conclude that the district court erred in determining that,as a matter of law,pfizer lacked sufficient authority over the eight allegedly fraudulent statements that searle and pharmacia employees made to the media,such that pfizer could not have made the statements for the purposes of rule.we therefore vacate the district court grant of summary judgment to pfizer with respect to those statements.as stated above,we leave undisturbed the district court ruling regarding pharmacia form k statement.
fischel testimony 
plaintiffs principal arguments focus on whether the district court decision to prevent fischel from testifying at trial was a proper application of federal rule of evidence,which governs the admissibility of expert testimony.under rule,an expert with specialized knowledge that will help the trier of fact may testify so long as that testimony is based on sufficient facts or data and is the product of reliable principles and methods that the witness has reliably applied to the facts of the case.the proponent of the expert testimony has the burden to establish these admissibility requirements,with the district court acting as a gatekeeper to ensure that the expert testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.united states williams,cir quoting daubert merrell dow,d.
the district court has broad discretion to carry out this gatekeeping function.its inquiry is necessarily a flexible one,daubert,at,and the types of factors that are appropriate to consider will depend upon the particular circumstances of the particular case at issue,kumho tire carmichael,d.we therefore review both the district court ultimate reliability determination and its decision about how to determine reliability for abuse of discretion.id.at emphasis in original see also amorgianos passenger,cir.but while the district court discretion is considerable,it is not unfettered.williams,at.the gatekeeping function under daubert is fundamentally about ensur ing the reliability and relevancy of expert testimony,and district courts may not stray from those goals.kumho tire,at.
in this case,the district court provided two reasons for excluding fischel testimony under rule,both of which stemmed from its summary judgment decision.for one,the district court noted that fischel supplemental report did not account for the district court determination that pfizer was not liable for many of searle and pharmacia alleged misrepresentations about celebrex.this oversight,it concluded,renders his opinions unhelpful to the jury in making calculations of damages proximately caused by pfizer alleged misrepresentations and omissions.in re pfizer ii,wl,at.in addition,the court found no analytical basis for fischel proportional reduction of the positive disclosures,and concluded that it had not been shown to be the product of reliable principles and methods reliably applied.id.we address each of these reasons in turn and conclude that neither provides a sufficient basis to exclude fischel testimony in its entirety.our conclusion does not depend on pfizer potential liability for the eight statements to the press by searle or pharmacia.
disaggregation of statements 
the district court first rationale for excluding fischel testimony that he failed to account for the district court prior determination that pfizer could not be liable for certain statements by searle or pharmacia rests on a misapprehension of fischel role in plaintiffs claim.as plaintiffs explained in their opposition to pfizer motions for summary judgment and again in opposition to pfizer motion in limine,their theory of liability is that pfizer misrepresentations and omissions regarding the cardiovascular risks associated with celebrex and bextra maintained pfizer inflated share price by keeping those risks hidden from the market.under that theory,they argue that there is no need to separately account for searle and pharmacia misrepresentations so long as pfizer own fraudulent conduct kept the same information concealed from the public,it is liable for the full value of that information to investors.fischel testimony,then,is important because it validates that the market reacted to information about the risks associated with celebrex and bextra and calculates the amount of artificial inflation in pfizer stock assuming that the company had been concealing those risks from the beginning of the class period.fischel did not purport to analyze how inflation entered pfizer stock prior to the class period because,under plaintiffs theory,pfizer may be liable for the full value of that inflation regardless of how it got there.
a closer look at plaintiffs theory makes fischel role clear.since basic levinson,d,securities class actions under rule have relied on the idea that,in an open and developed securities market,the price of a company stock is determined by the available material information regarding the company and its business.id.at.according to plaintiffs,a corollary to this idea is that fraudulent statements containing the same falsehoods as earlier misrepresentations will not cause a change in the stock price because the market has already digested that information and incorporated it into the price.findwhat investor grp,cir.t he inflation level need not change,however,for new investors to be injured by a false statement.id.at.if misrepresentations or omissions prevent a stock price from falling,they can cause harm by prolonging the period during which the stock is traded at inflated prices.id.first emphasis omitted see also in re vivendi universal,secs,d.thus,plaintiffs argue,pfizer misrepresentations about celebrex and bextra need not be distinguished from any statements by searle or pharmacia,because pfizer prolonged the period during which the same information about cardiovascular safety was concealed from the market.
fischel initial and supplemental reports must be evaluated within the context of this theory.see daubert,at discussing the requirement that the expert testimony fit s the plaintiff theory of the case.as fischel stated in his initial report,his task was to analyze the amount of alleged artificial inflation in pfizer stock price during the class period under the assumption that plaintiffs will be able to establish at trial that defendants withheld material information about the cardiovascular safety of celebrex and bextra.see also.to that end,he opined that,u ntil late,investors believed that any cardiovascular safety concerns regarding celebrex and bextra were limited,identified disclosures related to those risks that caused pfizer stock price to change,and then calculated the artificial inflation in pfizer stock price assuming that pfizer had,in fact,concealed those risks.this approach does not directly measure inflation caused by false statements instead,it measure s the value of the truth that the market eventually discovered.glickenhaus household int l,cir.and under plaintiffs theory,the inflation caused by pfizer misrepresentations and omissions is equal to the value of the truth because had its statement s been truthful,the stock price would have done what it did do once the truth was revealed.id.at lentell merrill lynch,cir t o establish loss causation,a plaintiff must allege that the subject of the fraudulent statement or omission was the cause of the actual loss suffered emphasis,ellipses,and internal quotation marks omitted in re omnicom.sec,cir a misrepresentation is the proximate cause of an investment loss if the risk that caused the loss was within the zone of risk concealed by the misrepresentations.emphasis and internal quotation mark omitted.fischel was not asked to provide,and did not offer,a way to identify how inflation entered the stock or to disaggregate the effect of specific statements made before and during the class period.
in denying pfizer summary judgment motion,the district court stated that a misstatement may cause inflation simply by maintaining existing market expectations.in re pfizer i,d at citing findwhat,at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.as a result,fischel did not need to address the district court decision that pfizer is not responsible for nine of searle and pharmacia misstatements in his supplemental report.he explained as much during his second deposition,stating that this portion of the district court decision did affect his analysis of inflation,and that his analysis assum es that p laintiffs will be able to prove their liability allegations but that he does not offer any opinion as to who was responsible for the inflation in pfizer stock price at the start of the class period.plaintiffs then reiterated this point in opposition to pfizer motion in limine fischel model fits plaintiffs allegations that pfizer made dozens of misrepresentations which effectively repeated the same false message to the market and served to maintain pfizer stock price at a constant,inflated level.as a result,he did not assign damages on a basis.
given the scope of fischel opinion,it was an abuse of discretion to prevent him from testifying on the grounds that he did not disaggregate the stock price inflation caused or maintained by pfizer own statements from that caused or maintained by searle and pharmacia statements.at bottom,the district court decision rests on the idea that,if plaintiffs succeed,the jury will have to attribute specific amounts of inflation to pfizer in order to calculate damages proximately caused by pfizer alleged misrepresentations and omissions.in re pfizer ii,wl,at.but as discussed above,plaintiffs theory is directly contrary to this idea they argue that pfizer is liable for all of the artificial inflation related to celebrex and bextra because,through its own fraudulent conduct,pfizer concealed the same information as its predecessors.in the context of that theory,fischel testimony can be helpful to the jury without disaggregating the effects of pfizer specific misrepresentations because it shows that the discovery of information pfizer allegedly concealed caused shareholders to lose money and calculates the amount of money they lost.
to be clear,we do not decide in this appeal that plaintiffs theory is either legally or factually sustainable.it might be that plaintiffs theory is deficient under rule or that,even under such a theory,plaintiffs can not establish,as they contend,that pfizer concealed the same information as searle and pharmacia hid.but these are reasons why plaintiffs claim may be legally or factually deficient,not justifications for concluding that,in the context of plaintiffs theory,fischel testimony is unreliable or unhelpful to the jury see ambrosini labarraque,the dispositive question under rule is whether the testimony will assist the trier of fact not whether the testimony satisfies the plaintiff burden on the ultimate issue at trial.internal quotation marks omitted.daubert and rule merely authorize the court to ensure that the expert testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.williams,at quoting daubert,at.put differently,fischel failure to disaggregate the effects of pfizer,searle,and pharmacia statements renders his testimony unhelpful only if plaintiffs need to disaggregate those statements to succeed at trial.accordingly,we conclude that fischel failure to distinguish inflation associated with pfizer misrepresentations from inflation associated with searle and pharmacia statements was,in context,an inadequate basis on which to exclude his testimony.
the proportional reduction 
the district court second basis for excluding fischel testimony relates to his proportional reduction of the positive disclosures.as already explained,in his supplemental report,fischel removed the declines associated with two corrective disclosures after the district court decided that pfizer alleged fraud could not reasonably be found to cause the losses on those days.because removing those disclosures caused the overall value of the corrective disclosures to fall by percent,fischel also reduced the amount of the stock price changes associated with positive disclosures that he attributed to the fraud by percent.he described his rationale for this proportional reduction in a single sentence contained in the supplemental report.the district court decided that this proportional reduction rendered fischel opinion unreliable because he proffered no explanation of its analytical basis and failed to show that it was the product of reliable principles and methods reliably applied.in re pfizer ii,wl,at.
the district court conclusion that fischel did not adequately explain his proportional adjustment to the positive disclosures was not an abuse of discretion.but fischel failure adequately to explain the proportional reduction was not a basis for excluding his testimony in its entirety.instead,the court should have prevented fischel from testifying about the proportional reduction and otherwise permitted him to offer his opinion about loss causation and damages.
at the outset,the district court decision to scrutinize fischel supplemental report when assessing whether his testimony satisfies rule s requirements was consistent with its gatekeeping function under daubert.as we explained in amorgianos,rule directs the district court to focus on the principles and methodology employed by the expert,without regard to the conclusions the expert has reached or the district court belief as to the correctness of those conclusions.at.part of that inquiry,however,requires assessing whether the expert appl ied his stated methodology reliably to the facts of the case.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.if the opinion is based on data,a methodology,or studies that are simply inadequate to support the conclusions reached,daubert and rule mandate the exclusion of that unreliable opinion testimony.id.at see also general joiner,d.
fischel supplemental report involves precisely the application of methodology to facts that district courts must scrutinize under rule.in the initial report,fischel presented his event study methodology,identified both corrective and the positive disclosures,and used the price movement on the days of those disclosures to calculate the artificial inflation in pfizer stock.when the district court concluded that pfizer was not responsible for the changes associated with two of those corrective disclosures,fischel had to adjust his calculations.according to plaintiffs,fischel supplemental report made this adjustment simply by updating the data he used in his event study analysis a type of analysis that pfizer expert conceded was a valid way to calculate artificial inflation.we agree that,because the district court had determined that the movements on the two excluded corrective disclosure dates did not occur because of pfizer fraud,fischel clearly needed to remove the price changes associated with those disclosures from his calculation of artificial inflation.but this narrative tells only half the story.
the issue of the positive disclosures was a more complicated matter.fischel init
