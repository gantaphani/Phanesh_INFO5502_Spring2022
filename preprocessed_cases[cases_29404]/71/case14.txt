to recover damages in a private action under b of the securities exchange act of and securities and exchange commission rule,a plaintiff must prove,among other things,reliance on a material misrepresentation or omission made by the defendant.matrixx initiatives,siracusano.requiring proof of direct reliance would place an unnecessarily unrealistic evidentiary burden on a plaintiff who has traded on an impersonal market.basic levinson.thus,this court has endorsed a theory,which permits plaintiffs to invoke a rebuttable presumption of reliance on public,material misrepresentations regarding securities traded in an efficient market,at.the theory facilitates the certification of class actions by permitting reliance to be proved on a classwide basis.
invoking the theory,respondent connecticut retirement plans and trust funds connecticut retirement sought certification of a class action under federal rule of civil procedure b against biotechnology company amgen and several of its officers collectively,amgen.the district court certified the class,and the ninth circuit affirmed.the ninth circuit rejected amgen argument that connecticut retirement was required to prove the materiality of amgen alleged misrepresentations and omissions before class certification in order to satisfy rule b requirement that questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.the ninth circuit also held that the district court did not err in refusing to consider rebuttal evidence that amgen had presented on the issue of materiality at the stage.
held proof of materiality is not a prerequisite to certification of a class action seeking money damages for alleged violations of b and rule.
a the pivotal inquiry in this case is whether proof of materiality is needed to ensure that the questions of law or fact common to the class will predominate over any questions affecting only individual members as the litigation progresses.for two reasons,the answer to this question is no.first,because materiality is judged according to an objective standard,it can be proved through evidence common to the class.tsc industries,northway.thus,it is a common question for rule b purposes.second,a failure of proof on the common question of materiality would not result in individual questions predominating.instead,it would end the case,for materiality is an essential element of a claim.
b amgen arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.
amgen points to the court statement in erica john fund,halliburton,that securities fraud plaintiffs must prove certain things in order to invoke basic rebuttable presumption of reliance,including that the alleged misrepresentations were publicly known,that the stock traded in an efficient market,and that the relevant transaction took place between the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed.if these predicates must be proved before class certification,amgen contends,materiality another predicate should be treated no differently.the court disagrees.the requirement that a putative class representative establish that it executed trades between the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed relates primarily to the rule a and a inquiries into typicality and adequacy of representation,not to the rule b predominance inquiry.and unlike materiality,market efficiency and the public nature of the alleged misrepresentations are not indispensable elements of a rule claim.while the failure of common,classwide proof of market efficiency or publicity leaves open the prospect of individualized proof of reliance,the failure of common proof on the issue of materiality ends the case for all class members.
amgen also contends that policy considerations militate in favor of requiring precertification proof of materiality.because class certification can exert substantial pressure on the defendant to settle rather than risk ruinous liability,amgen asserts,materiality may never be addressed by a court if it is not required to be evaluated at the stage.in this regard,however,materiality does not differ from other essential elements of a rule claim,notably,the requirements that the statements or omissions on which the plaintiff claims are based were false or misleading and that the alleged statements or omissions caused the plaintiff to suffer economic loss.significantly,while addressing the settlement pressures associated with class actions,congress has rejected calls to undo the theory.and contrary to amgen argument that requiring proof of materiality before class certification would conserve judicial resources,amgen position would necessitate time and resource intensive on materiality at the stage.
c also unavailing is amgen claim that the district court erred by refusing to consider the rebuttal evidence amgen proffered in opposing connecticut retirement motion.the ninth circuit concluded,and amgen does not contest,that amgen rebuttal evidence aimed to prove that the misrepresentations and omissions alleged in connecticut retirement complaint were immaterial.the potential immateriality of amgen alleged misrepresentations and omissions,however,is no barrier to finding that common questions predominate.just as a plaintiff class inability to prove materiality creates no risk that individual questions will predominate,a definitive rebuttal on the issue of materiality would not undermine the predominance of questions common to the class.

amgen,et,petitioners connecticut retirement plans and trust funds 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
this case involves a complaint filed by connecticut retirement plans and trust funds connecticut retirement against biotechnology company amgen and several of its officers collectively,amgen.seeking certification under federal rule of civil procedure,connecticut retirement invoked the presumption endorsed by this court in basic levinson,and recognized most recently in erica john fund,halliburton.the premise is that the price of a security traded in an efficient market will reflect all publicly available information about a company accordingly,a buyer of the security may be presumed to have relied on that information in purchasing the security.
amgen has conceded the efficiency of the market for the securities at issue and has not contested the public character of the allegedly fraudulent statements on which connecticut retirement complaint is based.nor does amgen here dispute that connecticut retirement meets all of the prerequisites stated in rule a the alleged class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable there are questions of law or fact common to the class connecticut retirement claims are typical of the claims of the class and connecticut retirement will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.
the issue presented concerns the requirement stated in rule b that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.amgen contends that to meet the predominance requirement,connecticut retirement must do more than plausibly plead that amgen alleged misrepresentations and misleading omissions materially affected amgen stock price.according to amgen,certification must be denied unless connecticut retirement proves materiality,for immaterial misrepresentations or omissions,by definition,would have no impact on amgen stock price in an efficient market.
while connecticut retirement certainly must prove materiality to prevail on the merits,we hold that such proof is not a prerequisite to class certification.rule b requires a showing that questions common to the class predominate,not that those questions will be answered,on the merits,in favor of the class.because materiality is judged according to an objective standard,the materiality of amgen alleged misrepresentations and omissions is a question common to all members of the class connecticut retirement would represent.the alleged misrepresentations and omissions,whether material or immaterial,would be so equally for all investors composing the class.as vital,the plaintiff class inability to prove materiality would not result in individual questions predominating.instead,a failure of proof on the issue of materiality would end the case,given that materiality is an essential element of the class members claims.as to materiality,therefore,the class is entirely cohesive it will prevail or fail in unison.in no event will the individual circumstances of particular class members bear on the inquiry.
essentially,amgen,also the dissenters from today decision,would have us put the cart before the horse.to gain certification under rule b,amgen and the dissenters urge,connecticut retirement must first establish that it will win the fray.but the office of a rule b certification ruling is not to adjudicate the case rather,it is to select the metho d best suited to adjudication of the controversy fairly and efficiently.
this case involves the interaction between federal laws and rule requirements for class certification.to obtain certification of a class action for money damages under rule b,a plaintiff must satisfy rule a prerequisites of numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation,see supra,at,and must also establish that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.to recover damages in a private action under b of the securities exchange act of,stat,as amended,b,supp.v,and securities and exchange commission rule,cfr,a plaintiff must prove a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant scienter a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission economic loss and loss causation.matrixx initiatives,siracusano,slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.
reliance,we have explained,is an essential element of the b private cause of action because proof of reliance ensures that there is a proper connection between a defendant misrepresentation and a plaintiff injury.halliburton,at slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.the traditional and most direct way for a plaintiff to demonstrate reliance is by showing that he was aware of a company statement and engaged in a relevant transaction based on that specific misrepresentation.ibid.we have recognized,however,that requiring proof of direct reliance would place an unnecessarily unrealistic evidentiary burden on a plaintiff who has traded on an impersonal market.basic,at.accordingly,in basic the court endorsed the theory,which permits certain rule plaintiffs to invoke a rebuttable presumption of reliance on material misrepresentations aired to the general public,at 
the theory rests on the premise that certain well developed markets are efficient processors of public information.in such markets,the market price of shares will reflec t all publicly available information.at.few investors in such markets,if any,can consistently achieve returns by trading based on publicly available information alone,for if such returns were readily attainable,it would mean that market prices were not efficiently incorporating the full supply of public information.see brealey,myers,allen,principles of corporate finance ed.i n an efficient market,there is no way for most investors to achieve consistently superior rates of return.
in basic,we held that if a market is shown to be efficient,courts may presume that investors who traded securities in that market relied on public,material misrepresentations regarding those securities.see,at.this presumption springs from the very concept of market efficiency.if a market is generally efficient in incorporating publicly available information into a security market price,it is reasonable to presume that a particular public,material misrepresentation will be reflected in the security price.furthermore,it is reasonable to presume that most investors knowing that they have little hope of outperforming the market in the long run based solely on their analysis of publicly available information will rely on the security market price as an unbiased assessment of the security value in light of all public information.thus,courts may presume that investors trading in efficient markets indirectly rely on public,material misrepresentations through their reliance on the integrity of the price set by the market.at.t he presumption,however,is just that,and can be rebutted by appropriate evidence.halliburton,at slip,at.see also basic,at providing examples of showings that would rebut the presumption.
although fraud on the market is a substantive doctrine of federal law that can be invoked by any rule plaintiff,see,black finantra capital,blackie barrack,the doctrine has particular significance in class actions.absent the theory,the requirement that rule plaintiffs establish reliance would ordinarily preclude certification of a class action seeking money damages because individual reliance issues would overwhelm questions common to the class.see basic,at.the theory,however,facilitates class certification by recognizing a rebuttable presumption of classwide reliance on public,material misrepresentations when shares are traded in an efficient market.ibid 
in its complaint,connecticut retirement alleges that amgen violated b and rule through certain misrepresentations and misleading omissions regarding the safety,efficacy,and marketing of two of its flagship drugs according to connecticut retirement,these misrepresentations and omissions artificially inflated the price of amgen stock at the time connecticut retirement and numerous other securities buyers purchased the stock.when the truth came to light,connecticut retirement asserts,amgen stock price declined,resulting in financial losses to those who purchased the stock at the inflated price.in its answer to connecticut retirement complaint,amgen conceded that a t all relevant times,the market for its securities,which are traded on the nasdaq stock exchange,was an efficient market thus,the market for amgen securities promptly digested current information regarding amgen from all publicly available sources and reflected such information in amgen stock price.consolidated amended class action complaint in no.cd cal.answer.
the district court granted connecticut retirement motion to certify a class action under rule b on behalf of all investors who purchased amgen stock between the date of the first alleged misrepresentation and the date of the last alleged corrective disclosure.after granting amgen request to take an interlocutory appeal from the district court order,see fed.rule civ.proc.f,the court of appeals affirmed.see.
amgen raised two arguments on appeal.first,amgen contended that the district court erred by certifying the proposed class without first requiring connecticut retirement to prove that amgen alleged misrepresentations and omissions were material.second,amgen argued that the district court erred by refusing to consider certain rebuttal evidence that amgen had proffered in opposition to connecticut retirement motion.this evidence,in amgen view,demonstrated that the market was well aware of the truth regarding its alleged misrepresentations and omissions at the time the class members purchased their shares.
the court of appeals rejected both contentions.amgen first argument,the court of appeals noted,made the uncontroversial point that immaterial misrepresentations and omissions by definition do not affect stock price s in an efficient market.at.thus,where misrepresentations and omissions are not material,there is no basis for presuming classwide reliance on those misrepresentations and omissions through the mechanism of the market price.the problem with that argument,the court of appeals,is evident b ecause materiality is an element of the merits of their securities fraud claim,the plaintiffs can not both fail to prove materiality yet still have a viable claim for which they would need to prove reliance individually.ibid.the court of appeals thus concluded that proof of materiality is not necessary to ensure compliance with rule b requirement that common questions predominate,at.
with respect to amgen second argument,the court of appeals determined that amgen proffered rebuttal evidence was merely a method of refuting the materi ality of the misrepresentations and omissions alleged in connecticut retirement complaint.ibid.having already concluded that a plaintiff does not need to prove materiality before class certification,the court similarly held that the district court correctly refused to consider amgen rebuttal evidence at the class certification stage.ibid.
we granted amgen petition for certiorari,to resolve a conflict among the courts of appeals over whether district courts must require plaintiffs to prove,and must allow defendants to present evidence rebutting,the element of materiality before certifying a class action under b and rule.compare case below and schleicher wendt,materiality need not be proved at the stage,with in re salomon analyst metromedia litigation,plaintiff must prove,and defendant may present evidence rebutting,materiality before class certification.see also in re dvi.securities litigation,plaintiff need not prove materiality before class certification,but defendant may present rebuttal evidence on the issue.
the only issue before us in this case is whether connecticut retirement has satisfied rule b requirement that questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.although we have cautioned that a court analysis must be rigorous and may entail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff underlying claim,stores,dukes,slip,at internal quotation marks omitted,rule grants courts no license to engage in merits inquiries at the certification stage.merits questions may be considered to the extent but only to the extent that they are relevant to determining whether the rule prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.see,at,slip,at,a district court has no authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit at class certification unless it is necessary to determine the propriety of certification quoting eisen carlisle jacquelin,advisory committee note on subd.c of fed.rule civ.proc,a n evaluation of the probable outcome on the merits is not properly part of the certification decision.
bearing firmly in mind that the focus of rule b is on the predominance of common questions,we turn to amgen contention that the courts below erred by failing to require connecticut retirement to prove the materiality of amgen alleged misrepresentations and omissions before certifying connecticut retirement proposed class.as amgen notes,materiality is not only an element of the rule cause of action it is also an essential predicate of the theory.see basic,at w here materially misleading statements have been disseminated into an impersonal,market for securities,the reliance of individual plaintiffs on the integrity of the market price may be presumed.emphasis added.that theory,amgen correctly observes,is premised on the understanding that in an efficient market,all publicly available information is rapidly incorporated into,and thus transmitted to investors through,the market price.see,at.because immaterial information,by definition,does not affect market price,it can not be relied upon indirectly by investors who,as the theory presumes,rely on the market price integrity.therefore,the theory can not apply absent a material misrepresentation or omission.and without the theory,the element of reliance can not be proved on a classwide basis through evidence common to the class.see,at.it thus follows,amgen contends,that materiality must be proved before a class action can be certified.
contrary to amgen argument,the key question in this case is not whether materiality is an essential predicate of the theory indisputably it is instead,the pivotal inquiry is whether proof of materiality is needed to ensure that the questions of law or fact common to the class will predominate over any questions affecting only individual members as the litigation progresses.fed.rule civ.proc.b.for two reasons,the answer to this question is clearly no.
first,because t he question of materiality is an objective one,involving the significance of an omitted or misrepresented fact to a reasonable investor,materiality can be proved through evidence common to the class.tsc industries,northway.consequently,materiality is a common questio n for purposes of rule b.basic,at listing materiality as one of the questions common to the basic class members.
second,there is no risk whatever that a failure of proof on the common question of materiality will result in individual questions predominating.because materiality is an essential element of a rule claim,see matrixx initiatives,at slip,at,connecticut retirement failure to present sufficient evidence of materiality to defeat a motion or to prevail at trial would not cause individual reliance questions to overwhelm the questions common to the class.instead,the failure of proof on the element of materiality would end the case for one and for all no claim would remain in which individual reliance issues could potentially predominate.
totally misapprehending our essential point,justice thomas dissent asserts that our entire argument is based on the assumption that the presumption need not be shown at certification because it will be proved later on the merits.post,at.our position is not so based.we rest,instead,entirely on the text of rule b,which provides for class certification if the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.a failure of proof on the common question of materiality ends the litigation and thus will never cause individual questions of reliance or anything else to overwhelm questions common to the class.therefore,under the plain language of rule b,plaintiffs are not required to prove materiality at the stage.in other words,they need not,at that threshold,prove that the predominating question will be answered in their favor.
justice thomas urges that a plaintiff seeking class certification must show that the elements of her claim are susceptible to classwide proof.post,at.see also post,at criticizing the court for failing to focus its analysis on whether the element of reliance is susceptible to classwide proof from this premise,justice thomas concludes that rule plaintiffs must prove materiality before class certification because materiality is a necessary component of fraud on the market,and without fraud on the market,the rule element of reliance is not susceptible of a classwide answer.post,at.see also post,at i f a plaintiff wishes to use basic presumption to prove that reliance is a common question,he must establish the entire presumption,including materiality,at the class certification stage.
rule b,however,does not require a plaintiff seeking class certification to prove that each elemen t of her claim is susceptible to classwide proof.post,at.what the rule does require is that common questions predominate over any questions affecting only individual class members.fed.rule civ.proc.b emphasis added.nowhere does justice thomas explain how,in an action invoking the basic presumption,a plaintiff class failure to prove an essential element of its claim for relief will result in individual questions predominating over common ones.absent proof of materiality,the claim of the rule class will fail in its entirety there will be no remaining individual questions to adjudicate.
consequently,proof of materiality is not required to establish that a proposed class is sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation the focus of the predominance inquiry under rule b.amchem products,windsor.no doubt a clever mind could conjure up fantastic scenarios in which an individual investor might rely on immaterial information think of the superstitious investor who sells her securities based on a ceo statement that a black cat crossed the ceo path that morning.but such objectively unreasonable reliance does not give rise to a rule claim.see tsc industries,at materiality is judged by an objective standard.thus,the individualized questions of reliance,post,at,that hypothetically might arise when a failure of proof on the issue of materiality dooms the class are far more imaginative than real.such individualized questions do not undermine class cohesion and thus can not be said to predominate for purposes of rule b 
because the question of materiality is common to the class,and because a failure of proof on that issue would not result in questions affecting only individual members predominating,fed.rule civ.proc.b,connecticut retirement was not required to prove the materiality of amgen alleged misrepresentations and omissions at the stage.this is not a case in which the asserted problem,that the plaintiff class can not prove materiality exhibits some fatal dissimilarity among class members that would make use of the device inefficient or unfair.nagareda,class certification in the age of aggregate proof.instead,what amgen alleges is a fatal similarity an alleged failure of proof as to an element of the plaintiffs cause of action.ibid.such a contention is properly addressed at trial or in a ruling on a motion.the allegation should not be resolved in deciding whether to certify a proposed class.ibid.see also schleicher,at w hether a statement is materially false is a question common to all class members and therefore may be resolved on a basis after certification.
insisting that materiality must be proved at the stage,amgen relies chiefly on two arguments,neither of which we find persuasive 
amgen points first to our statement in halliburton that securities fraud plaintiffs must prove certain things in order to invoke basic rebuttable presumption of reliance,including that the alleged misrepresentations were publicly known,that the stock traded in an efficient market,and that the relevant transaction took place between the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed.at slip,at quoting basic,at.see also dukes,at,slip,at,p laintiffs seeking b certification of a class action must prove that their shares were traded on an efficient market.if these predicates must be proved before class certification,amgen contends,materiality another predicate should be treated no differently.
we disagree.as an initial matter,the requirement that a putative class representative establish that it executed trades between the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed relates primarily to the rule a and a inquiries into typicality and adequacy of representation,not to the rule b predominance inquiry.basic,at,a security market price can not be affected by a misrepresentation not yet made,and in an efficient market,a misrepresentation impact on market price is quickly nullified once the truth comes to light.thus,a plaintiff whose relevant transactions were not executed between the time the misrepresentation was made and the time the truth was revealed can not be said to have indirectly relied on the misrepresentation through its reliance on the integrity of the market price such a plaintiff claims,therefore,would not be typical of the claims of investors who did trade during the window between misrepresentation and truth revelation.fed.rule civ.proc.a.nor could a court confidently conclude that such a plaintiff would fairly and adequately protect the interests of investors who traded during the relevant window.rule a.the requirement that the theory predicate be established before class certification thus sheds little light on the question whether materiality must also be proved at the stage.
amgen is not aided by halliburton statement that market efficiency and the public nature of the alleged misrepresentations must be proved before a class action can be certified.as amgen notes,market efficiency,publicity,and materiality can all be proved on a classwide basis.furthermore,they are all essential predicates of the theory.unless those predicates are established,there is no basis for presuming that the defendant alleged misrepresentations were reflected in the security market price,and hence no grounding for any contention that investors indirectly relied on those misrepresentations through their reliance on the integrity of the market price.but unlike materiality,market efficiency and publicity are not indispensable elements of a rule claim.see matrixx initiatives,at slip,at listing elements of a rule claim.thus,where the market for a security is inefficient or the defendant alleged misrepresentations were not aired publicly,a plaintiff can not invoke the presumption.she can,however,attempt to establish reliance through the traditional mode of demonstrating that she was personally aware of the defendant statement and engaged in a relevant transaction based on that specific misrepresentation.halliburton,at slip,at.individualized reliance issues would predominate in such a lawsuit.see basic,at.the litigation,therefore,could not be certified under rule b as a class action,but the initiating plaintiff claim would remain live it would not be dead on arrival.at.
a failure of proof on the issue of materiality,in contrast,not only precludes a plaintiff from invoking the presumption of classwide reliance it also establishes as a matter of law that the plaintiff can not prevail on the merits of her rule claim.materiality thus differs from the and publicity predicates in this critical respect while the failure of common,classwide proof on the issues of market efficiency and publicity leaves open the prospect of individualized proof of reliance,the failure of common proof on the issue of materiality ends the case for the class and for all individuals alleged to compose the class.see brief for united states as amicus curiae unless the failure of common proof gives rise to a need for individualized proof,it does not cast doubt on the propriety of class certification.in short,there can be no actionable reliance,individually or collectively,on immaterial information.because a failure of proof on the issue of materiality,unlike the issues of market efficiency and publicity,does not give rise to any prospect of individual questions overwhelming common ones,materiality need not be proved prior to rule b class certification.
amgen also contends that certain policy considerations militate in favor of requiring precertification proof of materiality.brief for petitioners.an order granting class certification,amgen observes,can exert substantial pressure on a defendant to settle rather than incur the costs of defending a class action and run the risk of potentially ruinous liability.advisory committee note on subd.f of fed.rule civ.proc.see also mobility llc concepcion,slip,at class actions can entail a risk of in terrorem settlements absent a requirement to evaluate materiality at the stage,amgen contends,the issue may never be addressed by a court,for the defendant will surrender and settle soon after a class is certified.insistence on proof of materiality before certifying a class action,amgen thus urges,ensures that the issue will be adjudicated and not forgone.see also post,at scalia,dissenting expressing the same concerns.
in this regard,however,materiality does not differ from other essential elements of a rule claim,notably,the requirements that the statements or omissions on which the plaintiff claims are based were false or misleading and that the alleged statements or omissions caused the plaintiff to suffer economic loss.see matrixx initiatives,at slip,at.settlement pressure exerted by class certification may prevent judicial resolution of these issues.yet this court has held that loss causation and the falsity or misleading nature of the defendant alleged statements or omissions are common questions that need not be adjudicated before a class is certified.see halliburton,at slip,at loss causation need not be proved at the stage basic,at the falsity or misleading nature of the public statements allegedly made by the defendant is a common questio n see also schleicher,at falsity of alleged misstatements need not be proved before certification of a class action.
congress,we count it significant,has addressed the settlement pressures associated with class actions through means other than requiring proof of materiality at the stage.in enacting the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,stat,congress recognized that although private litigation furthers important interests,prime among them,deterring wrongdoing and providing restitution to defrauded investors,such lawsuits have also been subject to abuse,including the extract ion of extortionate settlements of frivolous claims.conf.the pslra response to the perceived abuses was,inter alia,to impos e heightened pleading requirements for actions,limit recoverable damages and attorney fees,provide a safe harbor for statements,impose new restrictions on the selection of and compensation awarded to lead plaintiffs,mandate imposition of sanctions for frivolous litigation,and authorize a stay of discovery pending resolution of any motion to dismiss.merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith dabit.see also ed.and supp.v.congress later fortified the pslra by enacting the securities litigation uniform standards act of,stat,which curtailed plaintiffs ability to evade the pslra limitations on federal litigation by bringing suits under state rather than federal law.see f ed.
while taking these steps to curb abusive lawsuits,congress rejected calls to undo the presumption of classwide reliance endorsed in basic.see langevoort,basic at twenty rethinking fraud on the market,and noting that the initial version of,sess,an unenacted bill that,like the pslra,was designed to curtail abuses in private securities litigation,would have undone basic see also common sense legal reform act hearings before the subcommittee on telecommunications and finance of the house committee on commerce,witnesses criticized the presumption and expressed support for requirement that plaintiffs prove direct reliance.nor did congress decree that plaintiffs prove each element of their claim before obtaining class certification.because congress has homed in on the precise policy concerns raised in amgen brief,w e do not think it appropriate for the judiciary to make its own further adjustments by reinterpreting rule to make likely success on the merits essential to class certification in suits.schleicher,at smith bayer,slip,at congress decision to address the relitigation concerns associated with class actions through the mechanism of removal provides yet another reason for federal courts to adhere in this context to longstanding principles of preclusion.
in addition to seeking our aid in warding off in terrorem settlements,amgen also argues that requiring proof of materiality before class certification would conserve judicial resources by sparing judges the task of overseeing large class proceedings in which the essential element of reliance can not be proved on a classwide basis.in reality,however,it is amgen position,not the judgments of the lower courts in this case,that would waste judicial resources.amgen argument,if embraced,would necessitate a on the issue of materiality at the stage.such preliminary adjudications would entail considerable expenditures of judicial time and resources,costs scarcely anticipated by federal rule of civil procedure c a,which instructs that the decision whether to certify a class action be made a t an early practicable time.if the class is certified,materiality might have to be shown all over again at trial.and if certification is denied for failure to prove materiality,nonnamed class members would not be bound by that determination.see smith,at slip,at.they would be free to renew the fray,perhaps in another forum,perhaps with a stronger showing of materiality.
given the tenuousness of amgen argument,amgen policy arguments ultimately return to the contention that private actions should be hemmed in to mitigate their potentially vexatiou s character.blue chip stamps manor drug stores.we have already noted what congress has done to control exorbitant actions.see supra,at.congress,the executive branch,and this court,moreover,have recognized that meritorious private actions to enforce federal antifraud securities laws are an essential supplement to criminal prosecutions and civil enforcement actions brought,respectively,by the department of justice and the securities and exchange commission.tellabs,makor issues rights,see conf,at brief for united states as amicus curiae.see also amchem,at the policy at the very core of the class action mechanism is to overcome the problem that small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to bring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights.quoting mace van ru credit.we have no warrant to encumber litigation by adopting an atextual requirement of precertification proof of materiality that congress,despite its extensive involvement in the securities field,has not sanctioned.
justice scalia acknowledges that proof of materiality is not required to satisfy rule b predominance requirement.see post,at.nevertheless,he maintains that full satisfaction of rule requirements is insufficient to obtain class certification under basic.in justice scalia view,the court decision in basic established a special rule a class action can not be certified unless all of the prerequisites of the presumption of reliance,including materiality,have first been established.post,at.
the purported rule is justice scalia invention.it can not be attributed to anything the court said in basic.that decision is best known for its endorsement of the theory.but the opinion also established something more.it stated the proper standard for judging the materiality of misleading statements regarding the existence and status of preliminary merger discussions.see,at,materiality in the merger context depends on the probability that the transaction will be consummated,and its significance to the issuer of the securities.the district court in basic certified a class of investors whose share prices were allegedly depressed by misleading statements that disguised ongoing merger negotiations,at.postcertification,the court granted summary judgment to the defendants on the ground that the alleged misstatements were immaterial as a matter of law,at.the court of appeals affirmed the class certification but reversed the grant of summary judgment,at.this court,in turn,vacated the court of appeals judgment and remanded for further proceedings on the defendants motion in light of the materiality standard set forth in the court opinion,at.notably,however,we did not disturb the district court order,which we stated was appropriate when made.at 
if justice scalia were correct that our decision in basic demands proof of materiality before class certification,the court in basic should have ordered the lower courts to reconsider on remand both the defendants entitlement to summary judgment and the propriety of class certification.instead,the court expressly endorsed the district court order while at the same time recognizing that further proceedings were necessary to determine whether the plaintiffs had mustered sufficient evidence to satisfy the relatively lenient standard for avoiding summary judgment.see anderson liberty lobby,s ummary judgment will not lie if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.unlike justice scalia,we are unwilling to presume that basic announced a rule requiring precertification proof of materiality when basic failed to apply any such rule to the very case before it 
amgen also argues that the district court erred by refusing to consider the rebuttal evidence amgen proffered in opposing connecticut retirement motion.this evidence,amgen contends,showed that in light of all the information available to the market,its alleged misrepresentations and misleading omissions could not be presumed to have altered the market price because they would not have significantly altered the total mix of information made available.brief for petitioners quoting basic,at.for example,connecticut retirement complaint alleges that an amgen executive misleadingly downplayed the significance of an upcoming food and drug administration advisory committee meeting by incorrectly stating that the meeting would not focus on one of amgen leading drugs.see app.to pet.for cert.amgen responded to this allegation by presenting public documents including the committee meeting agenda,which was published in the federal register more than a month before the meeting stating that safety concerns associated with amgen drug would be discussed at the meeting.see,at.see also fed.reg.
the district court did not err,we agree with the court of appeals,by disregarding amgen rebuttal evidence in deciding whether connecticut retirement proposed class satisfied rule b predominance requirement.the court of appeals concluded,and amgen does not contest,that amgen rebuttal evidence aimed to prove that the misrepresentations and omissions alleged in connecticut retirement complaint were immaterial,at characterizing amgen rebuttal evidence as an attempt to present a defense,which the court of appeals explained is a method of refuting an alleged misrepresentation materiality see also reply brief amgen evidence was offered to rebut the materiality predicate of the theory.as explained above,however,the potential immateriality of amgen alleged misrepresentations and omissions is no barrier to finding that common questions predominate.see part ii,supra.if the alleged misrepresentations and omissions are ultimately found immaterial,the presumption of classwide reliance will collapse.but again,as earlier explained,see supra,at,individual reliance questions will not overwhelm questions common to the class,for the class members claims will have failed on their merits,thus bringing the litigation to a close.therefore,just as a plaintiff class inability to prove materiality creates no risk that individual questions will predominate,so even a definitive rebuttal on the issue of materiality would not undermine the predominance of questions common to the class.
we recognized as much in basic itself.a defendant could rebut the presumption of reliance,we observed in basic,by demonstrating that news of the truth credibly entered the market and dissipated the effects of prior misstatements.at.we emphasized,however,that p roof of that sort is a matter for trial and presumably also for a motion under federal rule of civil procedure,at,the district court thus correctly reserved consideration of amgen rebuttal evidence for summary judgment or trial.it was not required to consider the evidence in determining whether common questions predominated under rule b.
for the reasons stated,the judgment of the court of appeals for the ninth circuit is affirmed.
it is so ordered.

i join the principal dissent,that of justice thomas,except for part.
the rule says that purchase or sale of a security in a well functioning market establishes reliance on a material misrepresentation known to the market.this rule is to be found nowhere in the united states code or in the common law of fraud or deception it was invented by the court in basic levinson.today court applies to that rule the principles of federal rule of civil procedure b,and thereby concludes logically enough that commonality is established at the certification stage even when has not been shown.that would be a correct procedure if basic meant the rule it announced to govern only the question of substantive liability what must be shown in order to prevail.if that were so,the new substantive rule,like the more general substantive rule that reliance must be proved,would be subject,at the certification stage,to the commonality analysis of rule b.in my view,however,the basic rule of a well functioning market plus purchase or sale in the market plus material misrepresentation known to the market establishes a necessary showing of reliance governs not only the question of substantive liability,but also the question whether certification is proper.all of the elements of that rule,including materiality,must be established if and when it is relied upon to justify certification.the answer to the question before us today is to be found not in rule b,but in the opinion of basic.
basic established a presumption that the was relied upon,not a mere presumption that the plaintiffs relied on the market price.and it established that presumption not just for the question of substantive liability but also for the question of certification.we granted certiorari to determine whether the courts below properly applied a presumption of reliance in certifying the class,rather than requiring each class member to show direct reliance on basic statements.at emphasis added.of course it makes no sense to presume reliance on the misrepresentation merely because the plaintiff relied on the market price,unless the alleged misrepresentation would likely have affected the market price that is,unless it was material.thus,as justice thomas dissent shows,the basic opinion is shot through with references to the necessary materiality.the presumption of reliance does not apply,and hence neither substantive liability will attach nor will certification be proper,unless materiality is shown.the necessity of materiality for certification is demonstrated by the last sentence of the basic opinion,which comes after the court has decided to remand the case for reconsideration of materiality under the appropriate legal standard the district court certification of the class here was appropriate when made but is subject on remand to such adjustment,if any,as developing circumstances demand.at.those circumstances are the establishment of facts that rebut the presumption,including of facts that show the misrepresentation was not material,or was not known to the market.
the court argues that if materiality were a predicate to certification on a theory,the basic court would not have approved the class certification order while remanding for reconsideration of whether the plaintiffs had mustered sufficient evidence to satisfy the relatively lenient standard for avoiding summary.see ante,at.the court manufactures an inconsistency on the basis of doctrine that did not govern class certification at the time of basic.we recently clarified that rule does not set forth a mere pleading standard.stores,dukes,slip,at.but review of the basic certification order shows that the district court analysis was based exclusively on the pleadings t he allegations of plaintiffs complaint are sufficient to bring this section b and rule b claim within the fraud on the market theory.app.to pet.for cert.in basic levinson,emphasis added see also ibid.citing complaint paragraphs as establishing fraud on the market.under a pleadings standard,the district court found that the plaintiffs had satisfied rule b with regard to fraud on the market,including its materiality predicate.see,at denial of reconsideration this court ruled on december that transaction causation,reliance could be established by the following proof of a material misrepresentation which affected the market price of the stocks with a resulting injury to the plaintiffs emphasis added.thus,even if the plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded materiality that the certification order was appropriate when made,basic,supra,at,the defendants retained an opportunity on remand to rebut the pleading in order to defeat certification.
certification of the class is often,if not usually,the prelude to a substantial settlement by the defendant because the costs and risks of litigating further are so high.it does an injustice to the basic court to presume without clear evidence and indeed in the face of language to the contrary that it was establishing a regime in which not only those market suits that have earned the presumption of reliance pass beyond the crucial certification stage,but all and suits do so,no matter what the misrepresentation.the opinion need not be read this way,and it should not.
the theory approved by basic a demonstration of materiality not just for substantive recovery but for certification.today holding does not merely accept what some consider the regrettable consequences of the opinion in basic it expands those consequences from the arguably regrettable to the unquestionably disastrous.

the court today allows plaintiffs to obtain certification of class actions without proof that common questions predominate over individualized questions of reliance,in contravention of federal rule of civil procedure b.the court does so by all but eliminating materiality as one of the predicates of the theory,which serves as an alternative mode of reliance.see basic levinson.without demonstrating materiality at certification,plaintiffs can not establish basic presumption.without proof of fraud on the market,plaintiffs can not show that otherwise individualized questions of reliance will predominate,as required by rule b.and without satisfying rule b,class certification is improper.fraud on the market is thus a condition precedent to class certification,without which individualized questions of reliance will defeat certification.
the court opinion depends on the following assumption plaintiffs will either establish materiality at the merits stage,in which case class certification was proper because reliance turned out to be a common question,or fail to establish materiality,in which case the claim would fail on the merits,notwithstanding the fact that the class should not have been certified in the first place,because reliance was never a common question.the failure to establish materiality retrospectively confirms that fraud on the market was never established,that questions regarding the element of reliance were not common under rule b,and,by extension,that certification was never proper.plaintiffs can not be excused of their rule burden to show at certification that questions of reliance are common merely because they might lose later on the merits element of materiality.because a plaintiff invoking basic presumption to satisfy rule b should be required to prove each of the predicates of that theory at certification in order to demonstrate that questions of reliance are common to the class,i respectfully dissent.
we begin with of the securities exchange act of,ed.and supp.v we have implied a private cause of action from the text and purposes of b and securities and exchange commission rule,cfr matrixx initiatives,siracusano,slip,at.see also superintendent of ins.of bankers life casualty,it is now established that a private right of action is implied under b the elements of an implied b cause of action for securities fraud are a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant scienter a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security reliance upon the or omission economic loss and loss causation.matrixx,supra,at slip,at quoting stoneridge investment partners,llc.this case concerns the reliance element of the b claim and its interaction with rule b.
to prove reliance,a plaintiff,whether proceeding individually or as a class member,must show that his stock transaction was caused by the specific alleged misstatement.p roof of reliance ensures that there is a proper connection between a defendant misrepresentation and a plaintiff injury.erica john fund,slip,at quoting basic,supra,at to satisfy this element,a plaintiff traditionally was required to sho w that he was aware of a company statement and engaged in a relevant transaction based on that specific misrepresentation.erica john fund,supra,at slip,at emphasis added.in the fraud cases from which securities claims historically arose,see,dura pharmaceuticals,broudo,discussing roots of actions,this requirement was easily met by showing that the seller made statements directly to the purchaser and that the purchaser bought stock in reliance on those statements.however,in a modern securities market many,if not most,individuals who purchase stock from third parties on an impersonal exchange will be unaware of statements made by the issuer of those securities.as a result,such are unable to meet the traditional reliance requirement because they can not establish that they engaged in a relevant transaction based on a specific misrepresentation.erica john fund,supra,at slip,at.
this concern was the driving force behind the development of the theory adopted in basic.because individuals trading stock on an impersonal market often can not show reliance even for purposes of an individual action,basic permitted plaintiffs to invoke a rebuttable presumption of reliance.erica john fund,supra,at slip,at basic presumes that in an open and developed securities market,the price of a company stock is determined by the material information regarding the company and its business.at quoting peil speiser,emphasis added misleading statements will therefore defraud purchasers of stock even if the purchasers do not directly rely on the misstatements.at.as a result,a n investor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price,and an investor reliance on any public material misrepresentations may therefore be presumed for purposes of a rule action.at emphasis added.
if a plaintiff opts to show reliance through fraud on the market,basic is clear that the plaintiff must show the following predicates in order to prevail an efficient market,a public statement,that the stock was traded after the statement was made but before the truth was revealed,and the materiality of the statement,at,both the court and respondent agree that materiality is a necessary component of fraud on the market.see,ante,at materiality is indisputably an essential predicate of the brief for respondent if the statement is not materially false,then no one in the class can establish reliance via the integrity of the market the materiality of a specific statement is,therefore,essential to the presumption,which in turn enables a plaintiff to prove reliance.
basic presumption is highly because it makes class actions possible by converting the inherently individual reliance inquiry into a question common to the class,which is necessary to satisfy the dictates of rule b rule b requires the party seeking certification to prove that questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.a plaintiff seeking class certification is not required to prove the elements of his claim at the stage,but he must show that the elements of the claim are susceptible to classwide proof.see,stores,dukes,slip,at,p laintiffs seeking b must prove that their shares were traded on an market,an element of the theory emphasis added.without that proof,there is no justification for certifying a class because there is no capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.at slip,at quoting nagareda,class certification in the age of aggregate proof.
if plaintiffs fail to show that reliance is a common question at the time of certification,certification is improper.for if reliance is not a common question,each plaintiff would be required to prove that he in fact relied on a misstatement,a showing which is simply not susceptible to classwide proof.individuals make stock transactions for divergent,even idiosyncratic,reasons.as the leading case recognized,a purchaser on the stock exchanges may be either unaware of a specific false representation,or may not directly rely on it he may purchase because of a favorable price trend,price earnings ratio,or some other factor.blackie barrack.the inquiry inherently individualized nature renders it impossible to generate the common answers necessary for certification under rule b.see basic,at requiring proof of individualized reliance from each member of the proposed plaintiff class effectively would have prevented respondents from proceeding with a class action,since individual issues then would have overwhelmed the common ones 
the court solution in basic was to allow putative class members to prove reliance through the presumption,at.as the court today recognizes,failure to establish fraud on the market leaves open the prospect of individualized proof of reliance.ante,at.notably,the court and the ninth circuit both acknowledge that in order to obtain the benefit of the presumption,plaintiffs must establish two of the predicates at class certification that the market was generally efficient,and that the alleged misstatement was public.see ante,at acknowledging that market efficiency and the public nature of the alleged misrepresentations must be proved before a class action can be certified same.see also erica john fund,at slip,at it is undisputed that securities fraud plaintiffs must prove,at certification inter alia,that the alleged misrepresentations were publicly known and that the stock traded in an efficient market the court is correct insofar as its statements recognize that fraud on the market is a condition precedent to showing that there are common questions of reliance at the time of class certification.
nevertheless,the court asserts that materiality by its own admission an essential predicate to invoking fraud on the market need not be established at certification because it will ultimately be proved at the merits stage.ante,at.this assertion is an express admission that parties will not know at certification whether reliance is an individual or common question.
to support its position,the court transforms the predicate certification inquiry into a novel inquiry occurring much later on the merits.according to the court,either plaintiffs will prove materiality on the merits,thus demonstrating ex post that common questions predominated at certification,or they will fail to prove materiality,at which point we learn ex post that certification was inappropriate because reliance was not,in fact,a common question.in the court second scenario,fraud on the market was never established,reliance for each class member was inherently individualized,and rule b in fact should have barred certification long ago the court suggests that the problem created by the second scenario is excusable because the plaintiffs will lose anyway on alternative merits grounds,and the case will be over.see ante,at f ailure of proof on the issue of materiality at the merits stage not only precludes a plaintiff from invoking the presumption of classwide reliance it also establishes as a matter of law that the plaintiff can not prevail on the merits of her rule claim but nothing in logic or precedent justifies ignoring at certification whether reliance is susceptible to rule b classwide proof simply because one predicate of reliance materiality will be resolved,if at all,much later in the litigation on an independent merits element.
it is the court,not amgen,that would have us put the cart before the horse,ante,at,by jumping chronologically to the b merits element of materiality.but rule,as well as common sense,requires class certification issues to be addressed first.see rule c a at an early practicable time after a person sues or is sued the court must determine by order whether to certify the action as a class action a plaintiff who can not prove materiality does not simply have a claim that is dead on arrival at the merits,ante,at quoting,at he has a class that should never have arrived at the merits at all because it failed rule b certification from the outset.without materiality,there is no presumption,questions of reliance remain individualized,and rule b certification is impossible.and the fact that evidence of materiality goes to both fraud on the market at certification and an independent merits element is no issue expressly held that a court at certification may inquire into questions that also have later relevance on the merits.see,at slip,at.the court reverses that inquiry,effectively saying that certification may be put off until later because an adverse merits determination will retroactively wipe out the entire class.however,a plaintiff who can not prove materiality can not prove fraud on the market and,thus,can not demonstrate that the question of reliance is susceptible of a classwide answer.
the fact that a statement may prove to be material at the merits stage does not justify conflating the doctrinally independent and distinct elements of materiality and reliance the court error occurs when,instead of asking whether the element of reliance is susceptible to classwide proof,the court focuses on whether materiality is susceptible to classwide proof.ante,at t he inquiry is whether proof of materiality is needed to ensure that the questions of law or fact common to the class will predominate the result is that the court effectively equates b materiality with materiality and elides reliance as a b element.but a plaintiff seeking certification under rule bears the burden of proof with regard to all the elements of a b claim,which includes materiality and reliance.as explained,a party seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with the rule that is,he must be prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties,common questions of law or fact.at slip,at.if the elements of fraud on the market are not proved at certification,a plaintiff has failed to carry his burden of establishing that questions of individualized reliance will not predominate,without which the plaintiff class can not obtain certification,at slip,at holding in rule a context that w ithout some glue holding the alleged reasons for all those decisions together,it will be impossible to say that examination of all the class members claims for relief will produce a common answer it is only by establishing all of the elements of the presumption that reliance can be proved on a classwide basis.therefore,if a plaintiff wishes to use basic presumption to prove that reliance is a common question,he must establish the entire presumption,including materiality,at the class certification stage.
nor is it relevant,as respondent argues,that requiring plaintiffs to establish all predicates of fraud on the market at certification will make it more difficult to obtain certification.see brief for respondent.in basic,four justices of a court created the presumption from a combination of newly minted economic theories,at,white,concurring in part and dissenting in part,and considerations of fairness,public policy,and probability,at majority opinion,to allow claims that otherwise would have been barred due to the plaintiffs inability to show reliance,at.basic is a judicially invented doctrine based on an economic theory adopted to ease the burden on plaintiffs bringing claims under an implied cause of action.there is nothing untoward about requiring plaintiffs to take the steps that the basic court created in an effort to save otherwise inadequate claims.
the majority approach is,thus,doctrinally incorrect under basic.its shortcomings are further highlighted by the role that materiality played in the development of the theory as a condition precedent to showing that there are common questions of reliance in the context.materiality,at the time of certification,has been a driving force behind the theory from the outset.this fact further supports the need to prove materiality at the time the theory is invoked to show that questions of reliance can be answered on a classwide basis.
before basic,two signposts marked the way for courts applying the theory.both demonstrate that the materiality of an alleged falsehood was not a mere afterthought but rather one of the primary reasons for allowing traditional proof of reliance to be brushed aside at certification.this fact weighs strongly in favor of the conclusion that materiality must be resolved at when the presumption is invoked to show that reliance can be proved on a classwide basis.
the first signpost was the ninth circuit opinion in blackie,termed by one court the seminal fraud on the market case.peil,at.see also basic,supra,at,white,dissenting the earliest court of appeals case adopting this theory cited by the court is blackie barrack,cert.denied,
blackie arose from a million loss reported by audio equipment manufacturer ampex in its annual report,at ampex independent auditors not only refused to certify the annual report but also withdrew certification of all financial statements because of doubts that the loss reported for was in fact suffered in that year.ibid.in resultant class actions,the defendants argued that reliance stood in the way of class certification under rule b because it was not a common question.
the ninth circuit disagreed.instead,it relieved plaintiffs from providing traditional proof of reliance,that causation is adequately established in the impersonal stock exchange context by proof of purchase and of the materiality of misrepresentations,without direct proof of reliance.at emphasis added.the court left no doubt that the materiality of the million shortfall in ampex financial statements was central to its determination that reliance could be presumed.it asserted that m ateriality circumstantially establishes the reliance of some market traders and hence the inflation in the stock price when the purchase is made,the causational chain between defendant conduct and plaintiff loss is sufficiently established to make out a prima facie case.ibid.materiality was not merely an important factor that allowed reliance to be presumed at certification materiality was the factor.it demonstrated that the defendants had committed a fraud on the market,that all putative class plaintiffs had relied on it in purchasing stock,and,therefore,that questions of reliance would be susceptible to common answers 
the second signpost prior to basic was a note in the harvard law review,which described the nascent theory.see note,the theory,harv.hereinafter harv.note.the sixth circuit opinion reviewed in basic termed the note t he clearest statement of the theory of presumption of reliance.levinson basic.indeed,in the briefing for basic itself,the plaintiffs,the united states,and plaintiffs amicus cited the article repeatedly as an authoritative statement on the subject.see brief for respondent,cited in peil,supra,at,brief for securities and exchange commission as amicus curiae,and brief for joseph harris et as amicus curiae,in basic levinson.
like blackie,the note also hinged the presumption of reliance on proof of materiality.harv.note in developed markets,which are apparently efficient,reliance should be presumed from the materiality of the deception emphasis added.ultimately,in language that will be familiar to anyone who has read basic,the note formulated a pivotal assumption underlying the theory as the belief that 
market prices respond to information disseminated or not disseminated concerning the companies whose securities are traded.in such a setting often described as an efficient market the reliance of some traders upon a material deception influences market prices and thereby affects even traders who never read or hear of the deception.harv.note footnote omitted.
again,the materiality of the alleged misstatement was a key component,without which the market could not be presumed to move.as a result,without materiality it is impossible to say that there has been a fraud on the market at all,and if that is not the case there is no reason to believe that the market price at which stock transactions occurred was affected by an alleged misstatement or,by extension,that any market participants relied on it.materiality should thus be proved when the presumption is invoked,or there is no with respect to questions of reliance.
nor did the importance of materiality diminish in the sixth circuit opinion reviewed in basic.rather,the court followed the path marked by the signposts discussed above.it excused plaintiffs from offering traditional evidence of reliance,so long as a defendant is shown to have made a material public misrepresentation that,if relied on directly,would fraudulently induce an individual to the value of the stock.levinson,at emphasis added.the court analysis made clear that materiality should be demonstrated at the time the presumption was invoked in order to invoke the presumption of reliance based upon the fraud on the market theory,a plaintiff must allege and prove that the were material ibid.citing blackie,at.
finally,the briefing before this court in basic itself built upon this framework and the foundational principle that materiality is an integral part of the theory,the basic defendants argued that the plaintiffs could not establish fraud on the market at certification even if the theory were valid because the alleged misstatement was immaterial.they contrast ed the likely market impact of disclosure of the million blackie loss with the disclosure of the information which respondents contend ed rendered basic statements materially misleading.see brief for petitioners in.the basic defendants concluded that the differences between a company million loss and a company sporadic contacts with a friendly suitor are t he fraud on the market theory,if it has vitality,should not be applied in a case such as this.at.
in response,the plaintiffs in basic did not argue that the defendants misunderstood the role of materiality in the theory.they instead advanced a interpretation of dicta from eisen carlisle jacquelin,
petitioners final argument that respondents will be unable to establish that basic repeated false and misleading statements impacted the price of basic stock over a fourteen month period represents an effort to litigate the merits of this case on the motion for class certification.as this court held in eisen carlisle jacquelin,we find nothing in either the language or history of rule that gives a court any authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine whether it may be maintained as a class action.brief for respondents in.
the court rejected this reading of eisen two terms ago,explaining that the very language the basic plaintiffs quoted was sometimes mistakenly cited as prohibiting inquiry into the propriety of certification under rules a and b.stores,at,slip,at.that reading,the court explained,is the purest dictum and is contradicted by our other cases.ibid.the basic defendants reply is consistent with 
putative class representatives,such as respondents,should not be permitted to invoke the fraud on the market theory while,at the same time,arguing that courts may not make any preliminary inquiry into the claimed impact on the market.see,resp.by seeking the benefit of the presumption,respondents necessarily invite judicial scrutiny of the circumstances in which it is invoked.reply brief for petitioners in.
well said.the history of basic is worth the volume of argument offered by the majority.new yo
