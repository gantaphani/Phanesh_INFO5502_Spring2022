hereinafter the company,a corporation headquartered in louis,missouri,appeals from a final order entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri following a bench trial,holding that the company valuation of its minority shares did not reflect the fair value of the shares pursuant to.swope,d memorandum and order.for reversal,the company argues the district court erred in holding that no marketability discount applied to the fair value determination of the company shares and failing to provide adequate reasons for its valuation determination.appellees minority shareholders,contending that the district court erred in failing to properly evaluate fair value by applying a minority discount rather than the enterprise value and failing to apply missouri statutory prejudgment interest rate to the award.in a consolidated appeal,the company claims that the district court abused its discretion by denying the company rule b motion without conducting a hearing to consider newly discovered evidence.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the orders of the district court in part,reverse in part and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
jurisdiction 
jurisdiction in the district court was proper based upon.jurisdiction on appeal is proper based upon.the notice of appeal was timely filed pursuant to fed.a.
background 
the following facts are undisputed based on evidence introduced at trial.bruce robert formed the company in as a business.schneider,worked for the company for years,helped build the company through his technical expertise,and eventually acquired an ownership interest in the business,buying shares in the and.in the,the company began to diversify by acquiring manufacturing companies with customers,and experienced substantial growth.the company,now comprised of six units,has continued to grow through an aggressive acquisition policy.the district court determined that the growth of the company is not likely to continue at its current rate absent the continuation of an aggressive acquisition policy,a factor unable to be reflected in the valuation of the company.see swope,d.
halvor anderson became associated with the company in august.he gradually rose within the company until he became its chief executive operating officer in october.anderson actively participates in the management of each division and the company as a whole.
on july,anderson proposed a merger which would change the company corporate status to a subchapter s election in an attempt to reduce corporate taxes.under that arrangement,the company could allocate income directly to the shareholders,who would pay the tax as individuals and shield the corporation from paying tax at the corporate level.two days later,the board of directors voted to recommend the merger to the shareholders.that same day,anderson mailed to the shareholders a notice of vote on the merger proposal.in order for a company to achieve and maintain subchapter s status,it may not have more than shareholders.at the time of the board meeting,the company had shareholders were robert family members and were members.anderson explained that,while it would have been possible to attain subchapter s status without squeezing out the minority shareholders,the company might then be at risk of the tax issue,because of shareholders had to agree to the election.anderson asserted that the merger action was taken to assure that the subchapter s election could be made and preserved into the future without being repealed,even though he also admitted that the bylaws could have been amended to provide that no person could transfer their shares in violation of the subchapter s election.
anderson,a minority shareholder,calculated a share price to reflect the value of the shares held by minority shareholders as of the merger date.prior to this decision,he did not consult the board of directors,an appraiser,an evaluation professional,an accountant,a member of senior management,or any family or members,nor did he consider appointing a committee to determine a fair value or to explore whether there was a duty to protect the interests of minority shareholders.anderson based his valuation of the stock on the following factors no market existed for the stock,the shares had traditionally been sold at of book value level,income from the shares projected to be lower in the following year,and the share price fell within the range of historical dividend figures.at the shareholders meeting,of the members voted against the merger,five abstained or were not present,and three voted in favor of the merger,including anderson and two other company employees.the dissenting minority shareholders asked anderson to reconsider the share price and suggested that he hire an appraiser,which he declined to do.
the merger was approved on july,and,a missouri corporation,merged with,a nevada corporation the surviving corporation.eleven of the minority shareholders accepted the per share as fair value for their stock.the others,including appellees,made a written demand on the company for the fair value of their stock.when negotiations failed,appellees filed a complaint for stock appraisal in the district court pursuant to,requesting a determination of the fair value of their shares as of july,the day before the merger.the case proceeded to a bench trial in federal court,based upon diversity jurisdiction.
the district court,sitting without a jury,heard testimony for seven days,including many expert witnesses from both sides.all the experts agreed that there are three potential levels of valuation for stock in corporations enterprise interest,which attempts to replicate the price that would be paid for the entire corporation by a third party marketable minority interest,which accounts for the fact that the shares do not represent control of the company but assumes they are readily marketable and minority interest,which discounts for lack of control and also for lack of liquidity.the expert witnesses valued the company according to these premises,and their valuations of the stock ranged from per share to per share.in addition,the company submitted evidence that when schneider,died in,his estate valued his shares of company stock at per share for estate and inheritance tax purposes.
on june,the district court issued a memorandum and order which held that a minority discount was appropriate but that a lack of marketability discount was inappropriate,and valued the shares at per share.the district court concluded that appellees were entitled to prejudgment interest and awarded simple interest at the rate of per year,to reflect the rate set forth in as the basic interest rate for money judgments on civil cases before district courts.the company appealed,and the minority shareholders to dispute the application of the minority discount and the prejudgment interest rate selected by the district court.on april,the company filed a.b motion to consider a irs report which independently valued the company majority stock for estate tax purposes at per share.on may,the district court denied the rule b motion.the company moved to consolidate the appeal of the rule b denial and the original appeal.we agreed to consolidate the appeals and requested expedited briefing on the rule b issue.
discussion 
this case arises from appellees proper exercise of their appraisal rights as dissenting shareholders under.seeking a determination of the fair value of their minority shares in the company.although the statute itself does not define fair value,missouri law requires a district court to consider every relevant fact and circumstance which enters into the value of the corporate property and which reflects itself in the worth of corporate stock.dreiseszun flm,dreiseszun.the missouri supreme court articulated its approach to determining fair value as purposely if not wisely establish ing a flexible general standard for fixing value between parties who are either unable or unwilling to voluntarily agree t here is no simple mathematical formula and each case presents its particular problem.phelps.while does not specifically address how to determine fair value,the missouri appeals court concluded that the determination of fair value pursuant to,when a shareholder of a corporation objects to a merger or consolidation,rests within the sound discretion of the trier of fact after every relevant fact and circumstance is considered.king,king.moreover,while the ultimate determination of fair value is a question of fact,the determination of whether a given fact or circumstance is relevant to fair value under.is a question of law which we review de novo.in the present case,the company contends that the lack of control over minority shares and the absence of a liquid market are relevant circumstances which reduce the value of the stock,warranting not only a minority discount,but also a lack of marketability discount.on de novo review of these issues of law,we disagree.
application of marketability discount 
the company argues that the district court failed to consider all relevant facts and circumstances when it refused to consider the lack of liquidity of the stock,and that the district court erroneously failed to discount the stock for lack of marketability.we disagree.
the fair value appraisal statute,was enacted in response to the legislature decision to change the requirements for shareholder approval of major corporate transactions by allowing majority rather than unanimous shareholder approval.in exchange,the legislature created appraisal rights to protect minority shareholders from being deprived of their ownership interests by majority shareholders.hunter mitek,hunter concluding that the purpose of the fair value statute is to substitute for the control power or value the minority relinquished flarsheim twenty five thirty two broadway,flarsheim remarking that the appraisal statute is the bargained exchange for the abolition of the requirement of unanimous consent to approve a transfer of the assets of a corporation see also,ssm health care system,noting that the appraisal remedy has its roots in equity and serves as a quid pro quo minority shareholders may dissent and receive a fair value for their shares in exchange for relinquishing their veto power.
the appraisal statute provides an equitable remedy,compensating minority shareholders for their lack of control and ensuring that they retain the same proportionate value of their stock regardless of undesired changes dictated by majority vote.dreiseszun,at the underlying purpose of the appraisal statute is to assure such dissenting minority shareholders an equitable,just,and fair value for their stock lawson mardon wheaton,smith,lawson mardon wheaton t he very nature of the term fair value suggests that courts must take fairness and equity into account in deciding whether to apply a discount to the value of the dissenting shareholders stock in an appraisal action.therefore,the proper valuation of minority stock must calculate the value of the corporation as a whole and award a share of that value to the dissenting shareholders.see hunter.at declaring that f air value means business value,and a dissenting shareholder is entitled to his proportional or share of the company value dreiseszun,at a share of common stock is evidence of unit ownership of the whole,each unit being of equal value such that the sum equals the value of the whole.citing corporations,see also cavalier oil harnett,cavalier oil holding that a minority shareholder is entitled to a proportionate interest in the corporation appraised as an entity in re valuation of common stock of mcloon oil,me mcloon i n the statutory appraisal proceeding,the involuntary change of ownership caused by a merger requires as a matter of fairness that a dissenting shareholder be compensated for the loss of his proportionate interest in the business as an entity.this valuation reflects the shareholder actual interest in the company prior to the corporate change,independent of market variables or influences,and dictates that the fair value of a dissenter minority share should remain equal to the value of the majority shares.see dreiseszun,at holding that the classification of stock as minority or majority shares must not affect actual value.
the american law institute explicitly confirms the interpretation of fair value as the proportionate share of the value of percent of the equity,by entitling a dissenting shareholder to a proportionate interest in the corporation,without any discount for minority status or,absent extraordinary circumstances,lack of marketability.american law institute,standards for determining fair value,principles of corporate governance analysis and recommendations ali a.see also business valuation selected advanced topics,model dissenting shareholder actions and fair value,american society of appraisers declaring a trend towards defining fair value as a share of the value of percent of the equity.comment e to explains that in an appraisal proceeding,absent extraordinary circumstances,the corporation should be valued as a whole and allocated proportionately.ali cmt.
contrary to the company contention,fair value in minority stock appraisal cases is not equivalent to fair market value.dissenting shareholders,by nature,do not replicate the willing and ready buyers of the open market.rather,they are unwilling sellers with no bargaining power.see harry haynsworth,valuation of business interests,mercer,explaining that fair market value attempts to reflect the context of a hypothetical sale between a willing seller and buyer,a situation that does not exist in the dissenting shareholder situation see also joseph anthony karlyn boraas,betrayed,belittled but triumphant claims of shareholders in closely held corporations,mitchell,contending that,particularly in the close corporation setting where there is no ready market for the shares and consequently no fair market value,f air value is not the same as,or for,fair market value.fair value carries with it the statutory purpose that shareholders be fairly compensated,which may or may not equate with the market judgment about the stock value.barry wertheimer,the shareholders appraisal remedy and how courts determine fair value,duke,wertheimer discussing the unreliability of market price due to its dramatic fluctuations and susceptibility to manipulation by insiders or majority shareholders.
the purpose of a marketability discount is to adjust for a lack of liquidity in one interest in an entity,on the theory that there is a limited supply of potential buyers for stock in a corporation.lawson mardon wheaton,at.because fair market value is irrelevant to the determination of fair value,market forces,such as the availability of buyers for the stock,do not affect the ultimate assessment of fair value in an appraisal proceeding.the american law institute interprets fair value as not including any discount,absent extraordinary circumstances,for lack of marketability.ali a.comment e to further clarifies that extraordinary circumstances must consist of more than an absence of a trading market in the shares.id.at cmt.see also advanced communication design,follett,follett allowing a marketability discount only in an extraordinary circumstance where an unfair wealth transfer occurred from the remaining shareholders to the dissenting shareholder.
the marketability discount is incompatible with the purpose of the appraisal right,which provides dissenting shareholders with a forum for recapturing their complete investment in the corporation after they are unwillingly subjected to substantial corporate changes beyond their control.see hunter.at the purpose of the appraisal statute is to award the dissenter the value of what he owned before a significant corporate change see also cavalier oil,at the appraisal process is not intended to reconstruct a pro forma sale but to assume that the shareholder was willing to maintain his investment position,however slight,had the merger not occurred.a discount for lack of marketability is inappropriate because the minority shareholders are not willing sellers.see first western bank wall olsen,first western bank observing that a marketability discount is especially inapplicable in a dissenters rights context,as a ready market does exist for the dissenters shares,namely the majority shareholder or the corporation itself columbia management wyss,noting that because a dissenting shareholder is exercising a right designed for his or her protection,and because the purchaser of the shares will be the corporation,not an outsider,this recognition of decreased market value may not be appropriate.imposing a marketability discount would benefit the majority shareholders at the expense of the minority shareholders,in direct conflict with the purpose of the statute.see follett,at noting that marketability discounts might create a result that allows majority shareholders to reap a windfall by buying out or that encourages corporate,which is contrary to the statutory purpose to provide a remedy to minority shareholders.
in fact,no missouri court has ever applied a discount for lack of marketability in a dissenting shareholders appraisal action.on the contrary,most courts have refused to apply a marketability discount in fair value cases.see cavalier oil,at rejecting under delaware law application of a marketability discount as contrary to the requirement that the company be valued as a going concern arnaud stockgrowers state bank,holding that under kansas law neither minority nor marketability discounts are appropriate when the purchaser of the stock is either the majority shareholder or the corporations,because the sale results in a windfall to those already in control lawson mardon wheaton,at new jersey t he history and policies behind dissenters rights and appraisal statutes lead us to conclude that marketability discounts generally should not be applied when determining the fair value of dissenters shares in a statutory appraisal action first western bank,south dakota deciding that a discount may not be applied to the valuation of shares in an appraised proceeding.
we conclude that the market for minority stock in a dissenting shareholders appraisal proceeding,absent extraordinary circumstances,is not a relevant fact or circumstance to consider when determining fair value.we hold that the facts of the present case do not constitute extraordinary circumstances warranting a discount for lack of marketability in the determination of the fair value of the stock.rather,the illiquid nature of the stock is precisely the type of minority stock held in a close corporation which missouri appraisal statute is designed to protect.to remain consistent with this purpose of compensating the dissenting shareholders for the full proportionate value of their stock,we affirm the decision of the district court to refrain from discounting the minority stock for lack of marketability.
ii.methodology of evaluation 
the company also argues that the district court erred in failing to provide a precise mathematical calculation of its determination of fair value.the ultimate determination of fair value is an issue of fact,so we review for clear error.see flarsheim,at proclaiming that under missouri law,the judgment of the trial court will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.the district court has wide discretion in determining fair value,king,at,and may ascertain proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court.weinberger uop.
because the district court determination of the stock price falls within the range proposed by the experts discussed in its opinion,we hold that there has been no error.the district court issued an extraordinarily thorough memorandum,summarizing the different valuation methods proposed by each expert and weighing the pros and cons of each method.the district court explained that it generally agreed with the expert reilly valuation of the company,with the exception that reilly price reflected too much optimism about the future growth prospects for the company.consequently,the district court adjusted its valuation of the entire company downward.
it is unfortunate that,after performing such a and thorough review of the record,the district court was not more explicit in elaborating how it reached its final calculation of price per share.regardless,the district court is not required to provide explicit detail or mathematical precision in fair value cases,since the very nature of most cases precludes proof of value and damage with the precision of mathematical computation.phelps.it is also permissible for a district court to arrive at a determination of fair value that is not advocated by any of the experts.see king,at.therefore,we hold that the district court determination of the was not clearly erroneous.
application of minority discount 
appellees argue that the district court erred by discounting the value of the company stock to account for its minority status.we agree.
the purpose of a minority discount is to adjust for lack of control over the business entity on the theory that shares of stock are not worth their proportionate share of the firm value because they lack voting power to control corporate actions.lawson mardon wheaton,at citing edwin hood et,valuation of closely held business interests,umkc.however,like a marketability discount,the application of a minority discount is not appropriate in an appraisal action,where the minority sellers are unwilling to dispose of their stock.see,at concluding that the application of a minority discount in determining the fair value of a dissenter shares frustrates the equitable purpose to protect minority shareholders.as discussed above,such a discount injects a market factor into the determination of fair value,which we have concluded is not a relevant fact or circumstance to be included in the calculation of the value of minority stock under an appraisal statute.the market can not adequately reflect the position of dissenting minority shareholders.see hansen,at s ince there is no market involved in an inside transfer of shares,the minority discount should not be applied.rather,minority shareholders are entitled to receive the full value of their shares as if they were able to retain the stock.
the application of a minority discount undermines the purpose of a fair value appraisal statute by penalizing minority shareholders for their lack of control and encouraging majority shareholders to take advantage of their power.the overriding principle holds that to fail to accord to a minority shareholder the full proportionate value of his shares imposes a penalty for lack of control,and unfairly enriches the majority shareholders who may reap a windfall from the appraisal process.cavalier oil,at.see,hunter.at observing that fair value can not be obtained by permitting majority shareholders to set a hypothetical market price for the stock because it would impermissibly allow the majority shareholders to determine the value of the minority stock based on the price the majority shareholders are willing to pay for the minority shares mcloon,at noting that a ny rule of law that gave the shareholders less than their proportionate share of the whole firm fair value would produce a transfer of wealth from the minority shareholders to the shareholders in control hansen,at stating that requiring the application of a minority discount when selling to an insider would result in a windfall to the transferee because it simply consolidates or increases the interests of those already in control,at warning that otherwise,the majority may squeeze out minority shareholders to the economic advantage of the majority and inflict a double penalty because t he shareholder not only lacks control over corporate decision making,but also upon the application of a minority discount receives less than proportional value for loss of that control.
most courts addressing the issue have refused to apply minority discounts,reasoning that using discounts injects speculation into the appraisal process,fails to give minority shareholders the full proportionate value of their stock,encourages corporations to squeeze out minority shareholders,and penalizes the minority for taking advantage of the protection afforded by dissenters
