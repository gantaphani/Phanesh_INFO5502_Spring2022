after the district court denied plaintiffs motion to remand this case to new jersey state court,we granted their petition for an interlocutory appeal.the issue before us is whether there is jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims,which allege that defendants manipulated the price of a stock via abusive naked short sales.short sales are subject to detailed federal regulation under regulation sho.new jersey does not have an analogous provision.however,the question of whether the naked short selling at issue in this case violates new jersey law including the state general securities fraud provisions need not be answered by reference to regulation sho.because the success of plaintiffs causes of action does not necessarily depend upon the contents of federal law,this case does not arise under the laws of the united states.the presence of an exclusive jurisdiction provision governing regulation sho does not change the analysis,as such provisions can not independently generate jurisdiction.
we hold that there is no jurisdiction over this suit.accordingly,we will reverse the order denying remand,and direct the district court to remand this case to the superior court of new jersey.
plaintiffs are shareholders in escala group,escala.named defendants are financial institutions that engage in equity trading.plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the superior court of new jersey alleging that defendants participated in naked short selling of escala stock,which increased the pool of tradable shares by electronically manufacturing fictitious and unauthorized phantom shares.plaintiffs also refer to these shares as counterfeit.plaintiffs claim that this alleged increase in escala shares diluted their voting rights and caused their shares to decline in value.the amended complaint pleads ten causes of action,with all claims asserted under new jersey law.these causes of action address i claims under the new jersey racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico act based on predicate acts of new jersey securities fraud and theft and ii common law claims for unjust enrichment,interference with economic advantage and contractual relations,breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and negligence.

although plaintiffs causes of action are all brought under state law,the amended complaint repeatedly mentions the requirements of regulation sho,its background,and enforcement actions taken against some defendants regarding regulation sho.it also cites data maintained to assist in complying with regulation sho close out requirement,and at times couches its allegations in language that appears borrowed from regulation sho.further,plaintiffs plead that defendants violated the trading rules and regulations requiring that they actually deliver shares to settle short sale transactions.there is no question that plaintiffs assert in their amended complaint,both expressly and by implication,that defendants repeatedly violated federal law.moreover,there is no new jersey analogue to regulation sho.
defendants removed the suit from the superior court of new jersey to the united states district court for the district of new jersey,premised on the existence of jurisdiction.plaintiffs sought remand.on december,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation suggesting that plaintiffs motion to remand be granted because plaintiffs may succeed on their new jersey rico claims and state common law claims without establishing liability under federal law,the amended complaint,on its face,does not raise necessarily a substantial issue of federal law.manning merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,wl,at.the district court disagreed in a march,opinion the case at bar is premised upon and its resolution depends on the alleged violation of a regulation promulgated under the exchange act.manning merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,wl,at.
