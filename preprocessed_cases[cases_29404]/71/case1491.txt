the issue in this case is whether an alleged oral promise made to a stockholder by the ceo of a corporation to sell of the corporation future private stock offering to the stockholder,when coupled with a corresponding oral promise by the stockholder to buy that,is enforceable where there has been no approval of the agreement by the board of directors and the agreement is not memorialized in a written instrument.the court of chancery held that the oral agreement between the stockholder and the ceo is unenforceable.we agree.
we so conclude on several grounds that are consistent with the holding of the court of chancery that the bilateral oral agreement creates a right to require the corporation to issue stock to the plaintiff within the meaning of section of the delaware general corporation law,and is invalid under that section for lack of board approval and a writing.the relevant statutory scheme,including section and other provisions of the corporation law,establishes a policy that commitments regarding the issuance of stock must be approved in writing by the board of directors.this policy seeks to preserve the board broad authority over the corporation and to protect the certainty of investors expectations regarding stock.
thus,based on the statutory structure of the corporation law as a whole,we affirm the judgment of the court of chancery.
alteon,defendant below and appellee,is a pharmaceutical company specializing in drugs for cardiovascular and renal diseases.charles grimes,plaintiff below and appellant,is a lawyer and an investor who,along with his wife,jane gillespie grimes,often purchases large blocks of stock but below to avoid insider obligations in small companies.grimes and his wife had held approximately of alteon stock at the time of the events that have given rise to this litigation.those events,as set forth in the complaint,may be summarized as follows.
kenneth moch,the president and chief executive officer of alteon,told grimes that alteon needed additional funds,and that alteon was considering a private placement stock offering.grimes told moch that he was concerned about his holdings being diluted,and that he would buy of any such offering.according to grimes,moch promised orally that he would offer grimes of the offering.in return,grimes promised orally to buy of the offering.grimes admits that there is no writing memorializing these promises.he also admits that alteon board did not approve this transaction.
subsequently,alteon publicly announced a private placement offering it did not allow grimes to participate in this private placement,which presumably was fully taken by other purchasers.the stock market reacted positively to the placement,and alteon stock price increased from to as high as per share.
decision of the court of chancery 
grimes sued alteon in the delaware court of chancery for damages and specific performance of the oral agreement between grimes and moch.alteon moved to dismiss the complaint under court of chancery rule b for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted.the motion made three arguments.first,alteon argued that any agreement between grimes and moch constituted a right under,and is thus invalid because it is not written and was not approved by the board of directors.second,alteon argued that the agreement was a preemptive right under.b and is thus invalid because it was not expressly provided in alteon certificate of incorporation.third,alteon argued that the agreement is too indefinite as to time,quantity,and price to constitute an enforceable contract.the court of chancery accepted the first ground and granted the motion to dismiss on that basis.the court rejected the second ground,but stated that it is highly questionable whether or not this would constitute a valid common law contract.because of our disposition of this case,we need not reach the second and third issues.
the vice chancellor rationale is expressed in a brief bench ruling holding that the agreement constituted a right within the meaning of,and thus fails for lack of board approval and a written document evidencing it the essence of the vice chancellor bench ruling is as follows 
i do agree with the defendants,however,that the right that is sought to be enforced here is a right within the meaning of section.i am also satisfied that the intent of section is,that the overall statutory scheme that contemplated by section and also by section that whenever investors are contracting to invest capital in a company or to purchase stock either directly or rights or options in stock,that the statutory scheme requires board approval and that there be a written instrument that evidences those arrangements.the reason is that where the overall capital structure of the corporation is concerned,it is a vitally important command of the law that the corporation know precisely what its capital stock is and what the potential calls on that capital will be.and it is for that reason the statute elevates that type of transaction to the level of requiring board approval and of requiring a writing.only then will everyone know what claims on the capital will be,who has rights to invest capital,and what rights the corporation has with respect to actual or potential is,investors who have entered into contracts with the company 
grimes has appealed to this court the judgment of the court of chancery dismissing his complaint.we agree with the essential holding of the court of chancery that the agreement is invalid because it was not approved by the board of directors and was not memorialized in a written instrument.we do so based on the statutory scheme of the corporation law pertaining to stock issuance,with particular emphasis on sections and.
stock issuance and the delaware general corporation law statutory scheme 
grimes argues that his arrangement with moch does not constitute a right within the meaning of.and,therefore,need not be approved by the board or evidenced by a written instrument as required by that statute.alteon argues that it does.grimes argues that section applies only to options and option like rights.the fatal defect in grimes claim is that the agreement purports to grant a right that was not expressly approved by the board of directors as required by the statutory scheme of the delaware general corporation law exemplified by section and section.
the agreement purports to bind the corporation to issue to grimes of a future issuance of stock.grimes right to require the issuance of stock to him arises only if and when there is a public or private offering of newly issued stock.because grimes claims a right to require the issuance to him of of any such offering,the corporation law applies and requires that the agreement and the issuance of the stock must be approved by the board of directors and evidenced by a written instrument.
one must read in pari materia the relevant statutory provisions of the corporation law.first there is the fundamental corporate governance principle set forth in.a that the business and affairs of every corporation shall be managed by and under the direction of the board of directors.one then turns to the board role in stock issuance set forth in the relevant sections of subchapter v of title.the provisions in this subchapter relate to the issuance of capital stock,subscriptions for additional shares,options and rights agreements.taken together,they are calculated to advance two fundamental policies of the corporation law to consolidate in its board of directors the exclusive authority to govern and regulate a corporation capital structure and to ensure certainty in the instruments upon which the corporation capital structure is based 
as this court has stated in requiring strict adherence to statutory formality in matters relating to the issuance of capital stock,the issuance of corporate stock is an act of fundamental legal significance having a direct bearing upon questions of corporate governance,control and the capital structure of the enterprise.the law properly requires certainty in such matters.delaware statutory structure implements these policies through a clear and easily followed legal roadmap of statutory provisions this statutory scheme consistently requires board approval and a writing.
various provisions in subchapter v set forth the formal requirements for the issuance of capital stock,the establishment of classes of stock,the consideration for the issuance of stock,and formalities regarding rights,options and subscriptions relating to capital stock.the statutes relating to the issuance of stock that provide the policy context that is relevant here are,and.taken together,these provisions confirm the board exclusive authority to issue stock and regulate a corporation capital structure.to ensure certainty,these provisions contemplate board approval and a written instrument evidencing the relevant transactions affecting issuance of stock and the corporation capital structure.
section a,relating to classes and series of stock,states that the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such stock must be adopted by the board of directors pursuant to authority expressly vested in it by the provisions of its certificate of incorporation.section,relating to the issuance of stock,states,the consideration for subscriptions to,or the purchase of,the capital stock to be issued by a corporation shall be paid in such form and in such manner as the board of directors shall determine.section,relating to the consideration for the issuance of stock,requires that such consideration shall be determined from time to time by the board of directors.section,relating to rights and options respecting stock,requires board approval and a written instrument to create such rights or options.section,relating to the issuance of additional stock,allows the directors to issue or take subscriptions for additional shares of its capital stock up to the amount authorized in its certificate of incorporation.section,relating to the formalities required of stock subscriptions,provides that subscription agreements are not enforceable against the subscriber unless in writing and signed by the subscriber.
the requirement of board approval for the issuance of stock is not limited to the act of transferring the shares of stock to the stockholder,but includes an antecedent transaction that purports to bind the corporation to do so.as noted,section requires the directors to determine the consideration for subscriptions to,or the purchase of,the capital stock of a corporation.thus,director approval of the transaction fixing such consideration is required.moreover,it is well established in the case law that directors must approve a sale of stock this duty is considered so important that the directors can not delegate it to the corporation officers 
grimes argues that the contract provides only that if alteon board should exercise its authority to issue additional alteon stock in a future private placement as it did here in the private placement of shares of common stock,then and grimes were obligated to purchase a certain percentage of that stock at whatever price alteon board set.that contract does not give and grimes the ability to force alteon to issue additional stock at any price,and thus does not implicate the board right to regulate the company capital structure.
this argument begs the fundamental policy question behind the statutory scheme requiring director approval for steps taken in connection with stock issuance.if the corporation is required by the grimes agreement to issue to grimes of an offering to sell stock,the board business judgment is or may be significantly encumbered.for example,the board would not be able to sell of the stock it chooses to issue to another willing purchaser or purchaser in a private placement or otherwise.it may offer those purchasers only of the offering.that constraint may limit the universe of prospective investors to those who would be content to have only of the stock to be issued.
an agreement that binds a company to allow a stockholder to remain at a holding level may be a considerable sacrifice for a corporation,or it may be a good business decision for the board to consider.focusing,however,on the problematic aspect of such a business decision,it would seem that a holding in a corporation is large enough that the investor may have considerable leverage over the corporation.such an agreement is tantamount to an agreement to permit grimes to have a continuing influence over the future direction of the corporation.moreover,potential investors might be deterred from investing in a corporation that had made such a commitment.therefore,the agreement might actually decrease the capital potentially available to a company in a future stock offering.a business decision weighing the advantages and disadvantages of the grimes transaction would be within the discretion of the board of directors.but that choice lies only in the board province,not that of the ceo without express board approval.
there is an important policy basis for this requirement.shares of stock are a species of property right that is of foundational importance to our economic system.thus,it is critical that the validity of those securities,especially those that are widely traded,not be easily or capriciously called into question.explicit board approval of a stock issuance or a commitment to issue stock makes it more likely that the board will have considered thoroughly the reasons for and against the issuance.thus,director approval of stock issuance or agreements affecting the respective rights of the corporation and a putative purchaser of stock reduces later disputes about their propriety and enhances corporate stability and certainty.this policy can be demonstrated by focusing on two of the applicable provisions in the statutory scheme of subchapter v of the corporation law,sections and.
this transaction fixed the form and manner of the consideration alteon could receive from grimes,thereby implicating.that provision states,the consideration for subscriptions to,or the purchase of,the capital stock to be issued by a corporation shall be paid in such form and in such manner as the board of directors shall determine.regardless of what label is put on the transaction entered into between grimes and moch,the transaction contemplated that grimes would eventually purchase the capital stock of alteon,and the agreement constrains the board determination of the consideration for the issuance of the stock.
this transaction has two features fixing consideration.first,alteon bound itself to offer of its stock to grimes as part of any offering.second,alteon could not charge grimes any more for this than it charged other investors for the remainder.
both of these features of the transaction served to cap the value of the cash consideration grimes was to give alteon on the transfer of the stock.this transaction restricted the manner of payment of consideration for alteon stock,because it required that it come from grimes.because grimes was a stockholder already,such a commitment could well have tangible negative effects for alteon raising of capital from sources other than grimes.in essence,the promise to grimes cost alteon a certain freedom in raising capital,and could well have lowered the ultimate price alteon could have charged for its capital stock.section mandates board approval for such promises relating to consideration,and that approval was absent in this case.
section a permits a corporation to create and issue,whether or not in connection with the issue and sale of any shares of stock or other securities of the corporation,rights or options entitling the holders thereof to purchase from the corporation any shares of its stock,provided that such rights or options are evidenced by or in such instrument or instruments as shall be approved by the board of directors.because it is indisputable that alteon board of directors never passed any such resolution approving this transaction,this agreement is invalid if it is a right or an option.
the predecessor provision to section was first passed in the first statute in the nation expressly to authorize the issuance of options although the delaware court of chancery had recognized the validity of options b
