the plaintiffs,who are former minority shareholders of singlepoint financial,singlepoint or the company,appeal from a grant of summary judgment by the court of chancery dismissing their claim for breach of fiduciary duty against singlepoint former directors and its stockholder.the claim arises from a transaction in which the stockholder forgave the corporation debt to him,in exchange for being issued stock whose value allegedly exceeded the value of the forgiven debt.the transaction,it is claimed,wrongfully reduced the and the voting power of the public stockholders minority interest,and increased correspondingly the value and voting power of the controller majority interest.after the debt conversion,singlepoint was later acquired by another company cofiniti in a merger.shortly thereafter,the acquirer,cofiniti,filed for bankruptcy and was liquidated.the plaintiffs then brought this action in the court of chancery,seeking to recover the value of which they claimed to have been wrongfully deprived in the debt conversion.the court of chancery dismissed the action on the ground that the claim was exclusively derivative,and that as a result of the cofiniti merger the plaintiffs had lost standing to assert the claim on behalf of singlepoint.
the issue presented on this appeal is one purely of law can singlepoint former minority stockholders bring a direct claim against the fiduciaries responsible for the debt conversion transaction complained of,or is such a claim exclusively derivative we hold,for the reasons discussed herein,that the claim is not exclusively derivative and can be brought by the former minority shareholders directly.we must,therefore,reverse the contrary ruling of the court of chancery.
in,plaintiff john gentile and defendant douglas bachelor,who were acquaintances and,discussed creating a new software company.late that year,gentile and bachelor presented the idea to pasquale david rossette,a childhood friend of gentile,who agreed to provide the initial investment.ultimately,gentile,rossette,and bachelor formed the company that came to be known as high technology financial services company that supported financial advisors and their clients with the ability to manage assets online.during its relatively short existence,singlepoint was unable to develop a commercially viable product or produce significant revenues.faced with significant financial difficulties throughout its existence,singlepoint turned to rossette,who was the company sole source of additional capital,for financial assistance on several occasions.
gentile,rossette and bachelor served as singlepoint initial directors.gentile was singlepoint first president and chief executive officer,and bachelor was its chief technology officer.when singlepoint encountered difficulties,it relied on rossette for more funding.in,after providing several cash infusions for the company,rossette insisted that gentile be replaced as president before he rossette would supply any more funding.gentile replacement,christopher mcgrath,resigned less than one year later,and bachelor became the new ceo.singlepoint financial woes continued,however,and in april,rossette decided to take over as ceo,a position he held for the remainder of singlepoint existence.
by march,rossette had advanced over million to singlepoint.as consideration for those loans,rossette received promissory notes that were convertible into shares of singlepoint common stock.as provided in the governing stock purchase agreement,the original conversion rate was of debt per share.on november,the conversion rate was reduced to of debt per share,and on october,the conversion rate was reduced to of debt per share.
before march,singlepoint capital structure consisted principally of almost million outstanding shares of common stock,plus over million of debt owed to rossette.by march,rossette concluded that the level of the company debt to him was deterring third party investment in singlepoint.accordingly,rossette decided to convert all but million about of his singlepoint debt into equity.the resulting debt conversion transaction is what gave rise to the plaintiffs claim for breach of fiduciary duty.
at the time of the debt conversion,rossette and bachelor were singlepoint only two directors.bachelor and rossette negotiated the terms of the conversion,with rossette purporting to represent himself individually,and bachelor purporting to represent the company.disregarding the contractual conversion rate of of debt per share then in effect,rossette and bachelor agreed to a significantly lower conversion rate of debt per share.they next convened a board meeting as the company sole directors,and in that capacity they agreed that of rossette debt would be converted into singlepoint equity at the per share rate.on that basis,rossette would receive over million shares of singlepoint common million shares more than he would have received under the contractual conversion rate of per share.
because the proposed debt conversion required issuing more shares of common stock than were currently authorized,a special shareholders meeting was held to amend singlepoint certificate of incorporation.the shareholders were informed of the proposal to authorize additional shares,but were not informed of the underlying convert over million of the rossette debt to equity.at the march,special shareholders meeting,the shareholders approved an increase of authorized shares of singlepoint common stock from million to million shares,thereby enabling the conversion to occur.before the conversion,rossette held approximately of the company equity after the conversion,he held as a result,the minority shareholders interest was reduced correspondingly,from to.
after the debt conversion,singlepoint began searching for an acquirer.in may,only two months later,rossette negotiated a merger with cofiniti singlepoint only direct competitor in which cofiniti would acquire singlepoint.under the merger terms,singlepoint shareholders would receive approximately shares of cofiniti common stock for each share of singlepoint common stock,and singlepoint would become a subsidiary of cofiniti.
to secure rossette approval of the merger,cofiniti offered rossette unique benefits.that did not occur fortuitously.rossette made it clear that for me to accept the terms and conditions of the merger as set forth they cofiniti would have to provide me the proper inducement to do so.the side benefits offered to rossette included a put agreement requiring cofiniti,after one year,to repurchase shares of cofiniti stock that rossette had received in the merger,at a share,for a total of million.that put agreement had significant value,because cofiniti stock had no public market and,therefore,could not easily be sold.no other stockholder of singlepoint was afforded similar side benefit treatment.
on october,singlepoint issued an information statement informing shareholders of the upcoming merger with cofiniti.the shareholders were told that approval of the merger is assured because several of our large stockholders,representing in the aggregate approximately of our outstanding common stock,have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the merger.the information statement further disclosed that rossette had converted over million of the debt the company owed him into singlepoint stock.the information statement did not disclose that the actual amount of the converted debt was over million,or the number of shares that were issued to rossette in the debt conversion,or at what price.nor did the information statement disclose the put agreement that rossette had received from cofiniti,or that the put agreement was what induced his approval of the merger,or that one year after the merger rossette would receive million.the merger was approved by a majority of the minority shareholders.the plaintiffs did not consent to,nor did they vote for,the merger,which closed on october.
within months of the merger,cofiniti was fatally undone by many of the same problems that had afflicted singlepoint.on march,cofiniti was forced to file for bankruptcy and,ultimately,to liquidate 
almost one year earlier,on february,the plaintiffs brought an appraisal action in the court of chancery,seeking a determination of the fair value of their singlepoint stock at the time of the cofiniti merger.the court of chancery determined that the fair value of singlepoint common stock was a times the value ascribed to those singlepoint shares in the debt conversion.the court of chancery refused,however,to entertain the minority stockholders claims that their shares had been improperly diluted by the issuance of excessive shares to rossette in the debt conversion.that dilution claim,the court held,was not cognizable in an appraisal proceeding,because the claim was not one for waste that belonged to and thus would be treated as an asset of the corporation 
i also reject the petitioners arguments to the extent that they attempt to recharacterize the share dilution claim as a claim for corporate waste,and thereby have the value of such a derivative claim added into the total enterprise value of singlepoint as an asset of the company the petitioners can not escape the rule and policy concerns set forth by the supreme court in cavalier oil by merely switching the label on what,in essence,is a claim for share dilution 
on march,the plaintiffs commenced this breach of fiduciary duty action in the court of chancery challenging in count i the debt conversion as an improper extraction of the economic value and voting power from their minority interest,and in count ii the unique put benefits rossette had received to induce his approval of the cofiniti merger.the defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiffs claims were derivative in nature,and that as a result of the cofiniti merger the plaintiffs had lost standing to bring those claims.the defendants also argued that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the substantive merits of the plaintiffs claims.in a decision handed down on october,the court of chancery dismissed the plaintiffs debt conversion claim count i.the court held somewhat inconsistently with its ruling in the appraisal action that the claim was derivative and that the plaintiffs had lost standing to raise it thereafter,the court of chancery granted the plaintiffs motion to certify an interlocutory appeal from its order dismissing the debt conversion claim.this court accepted that interlocutory appeal.
ii.the court of chancery decision 
in its october,opinion the court of chancery held that the debt conversion claim was derivative,and that as a result of the merger with cofiniti,the plaintiffs were no longer singlepoint shareholders with standing to assert the corporation claim.the court held that the dilution claim was derivative,because when a board of directors authorizes the issuance of stock for no or grossly inadequate consideration,the corporation is directly injured and shareholders are injured derivatively and that mere claims of dilution,without more,can not convert a claim traditionally understood as derivative,into a direct one.although the court of chancery acknowledged that a share dilution claim may be brought as a direct claim where voting rights are harmed because of the dilution it held that,to give rise to a direct claim,the dilution must result in a material decrease in voting power.here,the vice chancellor held,there was no material decrease in voting power,because the plaintiffs were minority shareholders of singlepoint both before and after the debt conversion.
the trial court reasoned that the gist of the plaintiffs debt conversion claim was that singlepoint was caused to sell its shares too cheaply,and as a result was deprived of the opportunity to sell those shares for a better price because that loss of opportunity was suffered only by the company,and because any to cancel the excess shares issued to rossette or to require rossette to restore their fair benefit only the company,the claim was derivative under the analysis mandated by tooley donaldson,lufkin jenrette,tooley accordingly,the court of chancery granted summary judgment dismissing the plaintiffs debt conversion claim.on appeal from a grant of summary judgment,our review is de novo 
iii.the parties contentions 
this appeal concerns only the grant of summary judgment dismissing the claim for breach of fiduciary duty arising out of the debt conversion the issue that we must decide is whether that claim was exclusively derivative in character.if it was,then the summary judgment grant must be affirmed if not,then the summary judgment must be reversed.
the argue that the plaintiffs debt conversion fiduciary duty claim is exclusively derivative,and that the vice chancellor correctly so held.under tooley whether a claim is derivative or direct depends solely upon two questions who suffered the alleged harm the corporation or the suing stockholders individually and who would receive the benefit of the recovery or other remedy the corporation or the stockholders,individually 
here,the defendants maintain,the only harm arguably resulting from the debt conversion was to the corporation,because in essence,the debt conversion claim is that singlepoint was caused to overpay for the debt forgiveness.more specifically,the claim is that the debt conversion rate per share was unfair and resulted in singlepoint issuing vastly more stock to rossette than it should have.no harm from that overpayment resulted to any stockholder individually defendants argue,because to the extent the overpayment invalidly increased the number of outstanding shares,the resulting dilution affected each and all of the conversion shares the shares owned by rossette.moreover,defendants assert,whatever form any damages recovery or other remedy might it be to cancel the excess shares or to require the acquirer to pay their fair only beneficiary of that remedy would be the company.lastly,defendants contend that to the extent the plaintiffs claim is for wrongful dilution of their voting power,restoration of that voting power is no longer possible because,as a result of the cofiniti merger and the cofiniti bankruptcy,for all practical purposes singlepoint and cofiniti no longer exist.
the defendants concede that a stock dilution claim may be brought as a direct claim if voting rights are harmed.they insist,however,that that can only occur where the loss of voting power is material.the defendants conclude that the court of chancery correctly found that the plaintiffs never had any material voting power to lose,because both before and after the debt conversion,the public shareholders of singlepoint held only a minority interest.
the plaintiffs vigorously contest these arguments.they claim that under tooley their claim is direct,for two alternative reasons.first,their debt conversion claim can not be derivative because only the shareholder not the injured.the reason plaintiffs say is that the company was insolvent,and therefore suffered no harm by issuing its valueless stock to expunge a sizeable portion of its debt to rossette but,even if economically worthless,the singlepoint stock did have voting power,and the debt conversion reduced the minority shareholders ownership percentage,and voting power,from about to.moreover,because of the significant over reduction in their share ownership percentage,the minority stockholders also suffered a corresponding reduction of the proceeds they would have otherwise received in the cofiniti merger.the plaintiffs contend that because singlepoint no longer exists,only the former minority stockholders can benefit from a judicial remedy.the only remedy now available would be a recovery of the fair value of the cofiniti merger proceeds the plaintiffs would have received but for the extraction of value resulting from the debt conversion.any such recovery would benefit only the former singlepoint minority.
second,and alternatively,the plaintiffs contend that their claim is direct under in re pictures.litigation their argument runs as follows even if the singlepoint shares had value,the debt conversion was a corporate transaction with a significant stockholder,that increased the voting power and economic value of that significant stockholder interest in singlepoint,at the expense and to the corresponding detriment of the minority shareholders.the plaintiffs claim that the court of chancery erred by reading into a requirement that for such a transaction to give rise to a direct claim,the loss of voting power must be material,that it must reduce the public stockholders voting power from majority to minority status.we conclude that the plaintiffs are correct and that tooley and,properly applied,compel the conclusion that the debt conversion claim was both derivative and direct.it therefore was error to dismiss the claim on the basis that it was exclusively derivative.
iv.analysis 
a.the applicable principles of law 
to analyze the character of the claim at issue,it is critical to recognize that it has two aspects.the first aspect is that the corporation singlepoint was caused to overpay for an asset or other benefit that it received in exchange here,a forgiveness of debt.the second aspect is that the minority stockholders lost a significant portion of the cash value and the voting power of their minority stock interest.those separate harms resulted from the same transaction,yet they are independent of each other.
normally,claims of corporate overpayment are treated as causing harm solely to the corporation and,thus,are regarded as derivative.the reason expressed in tooley terms is that the corporation is both the party that suffers the injury a reduction in its assets or their value as well as the party to whom the remedy a restoration of the improperly reduced value would flow.in the typical corporate overpayment case,a claim against the corporation fiduciaries for redress is regarded as exclusively derivative,irrespective of whether the currency or form of overpayment is cash or the corporation stock such claims are not normally regarded as direct,because any dilution in value of the corporation stock is merely the unavoidable result from an accounting standpoint of the reduction in the value of the entire corporate entity,of which each share of equity represents an equal fraction.in the eyes of the law,such equal injury to the shares resulting from a corporate overpayment is not viewed as,or equated with,harm to specific shareholders individually.
there is,however,at least one transactional species of corporate overpayment delaware case law recognizes as being both derivative and direct in character a breach of fiduciary duty claim having this dual character arises where a stockholder having majority or effective control causes the corporation to issue excessive shares of its stock in exchange for assets of the controlling stockholder that have a lesser value and the exchange causes an increase in the percentage of the outstanding shares owned by the controlling stockholder,and a corresponding decrease in the share percentage owned by the public minority shareholders because the means used to achieve that result is an overpayment or of shares to the controlling stockholder,the corporation is harmed and has a claim to compel the restoration of the value of the overpayment.that claim,by definition,is derivative.
but,the public or minority stockholders also have a separate,and direct,claim arising out of that same transaction.because the shares representing the overpayment embody both economic value and voting power,the end result of this type of transaction is an improper economic value and voting power from the public shareholders to the majority or controlling stockholder.for that reason,the harm resulting from the overpayment is not confined to an equal dilution of the economic value and voting power of each of the corporation outstanding shares.a separate harm also results an extraction from the public shareholders,and a redistribution to the controlling shareholder,of a portion of the economic value and voting power embodied in the minority interest.as a consequence,the public shareholders are harmed,uniquely and individually,to the same extent that the controlling shareholder is correspondingly benefited in such circumstances,the public shareholders are entitled to recover the value represented by that entitlement that may be claimed by the public shareholders directly and without regard to any claim the corporation may have.
the type of transaction was held to give rise to a direct claim in in re pictures,in that case,the plaintiffs,who were a class of former minority stockholders of pictures,challenged an transaction between and its largest stockholder,the company.before the transaction,voting in concert with other significant stockholders aligned with it held of common stock the minority stockholders the plaintiff shareholder class held.the plaintiffs alleged that had wrongfully caused to issue an excessive number of shares to in exchange for assets having less value.as a result,increased its stock interest in to about,which in turn reduced the public shareholders interest to approximately.this court held that because,as largest stockholder,did not suffer a dilution of cash value,of voting power,or of ownership percentage to the same extent and in the same proportion as the minority shareholders,the plaintiffs had suffered an injury that was unique to them individually and that could be remedied in a direct claim against the controlling stockholder and any other fiduciary responsible for the harm 
analysis of the debt conversion claim 
the plaintiffs contend that this case is functionally indistinguishable from,and thus is controlled by.the defendants respond and the court of chancery agreed that does not control,because for a loss of voting power to give rise to a direct claim,the loss must be material,meaning that the challenged transaction must reduce the holdings of the plaintiff class from majority to minority stockholder status a reduction that did not occur here.
because the defendants do not claim that this case is distinguishable from in any other respect,the issue is a narrow one that may be stated thusly where a type transaction reduces the voting power of the corporation public shareholders,must the reduction be from majority to minority stockholder status,for the public shareholders to have standing to assert a direct claim against the fiduciaries responsible we hold that the answer is no.we so conclude for three separate reasons.
first,a requirement of a reduction from majority to minority status finds no support in our case law.the court of chancery cited no authority supporting that conclusion and nothing in,which created the analytical framework for this issue,compels it.in,and the group of other stockholders with which customarily voted as a bloc,were the corporation majority stockholders.in,as here,the public stockholders held a minority interest,both before and after the challenged transaction.in both cases what was reduced was a significant portion of the economic value and voting power of that minority interest.in the minority interest was reduced from to approximately here,the minority interest was reduced from approximately to approximately.none of the analysis in relating to whether the claim was direct or derivative turned on the extent or degree of the reduction of the minority interest.this case is,therefore,functionally indistinguishable from,and governing rule should control.
second,the requirement of a material reduction in voting power should play no part in any analysis of whether a claim is direct,derivative,or both.such a requirement distracts nature of the harm inflicted upon the minority in a transaction,and denigrates the seriousness of the breach of fiduciary duty causing that harm.the type of transaction was found to be wrongful because it resulted in an improper extraction or expropriation,by the controlling shareholder,of economic value and voting power that belonged to the minority stockholders.the specific manner in which this was accomplished was causing the corporation to issue,to the controlling stockholder,shares having more value than the value of what the corporation received in exchange.the consequence was to increase the controlling stockholder percentage of stock ownership at the expense of the minority the resulting reduction in economic
