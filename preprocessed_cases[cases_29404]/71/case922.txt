marvin tipton brought this shareholder derivative action against ed and dixie kelley the kelleys on behalf of mill creek gravel,mill creek,alleging breach of a agreement.the case went to trial,whereupon the jury found a breach of the agreement and awarded mill creek million in damages.the kelleys now appeal on numerous grounds we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
the kelleys own a large tract of land near the arkansas border in southwestern missouri,which they refer to as lazy e estates.in april of,ed kelly was approached by businessmen marvin tipton and lindy barrett about the possibility of mining gravel on the kelleys property.tipton and barrett owned and operated,which acted as a service,arranging for businesses in need of gravel to enter private landowners property to remove rock and soil.after determined that lazy e estates contained gravel,it reached a verbal agreement with ed kelley to allow the mining of gravel from the property.in return,agreed to make royalty payments to the kelleys in the amount of fifty cents for each cubic yard of gravel or dirt removed.tipton proceeded to file a mine plan with the missouri department of natural resources requesting permission to mine acres on lazy e estates through the year.the plan was approved.later,in july of,ed kelley memorialized his verbal agreement with tipton in a written contract,which permitted either party to terminate the agreement upon thirty days written notice.the kelleys received approximately to in royalty payments under the contract.
although it is disputed who first introduced the idea,in the fall of ed kelley and tipton talked about kelley becoming a partner in.this never occurred,however,apparently because of barrett reluctance to the idea.at this point,without providing the notice,kelley terminated access to his property a few months later,however,in december of,ed kelley and tipton entered into a agreement the agreement or contract for the creation of a gravel mining corporation.again,it is disputed who initiated the idea or what the parties motivations were for entering the agreement tipton and kelley were the only two shareholders of mill creek stock,with ed kelley owning percent of the corporate stock,and tipton owning percent.the agreement contained no right of revocation,nor any provision setting a date by which the gravel plant was required to be in operation.the agreement did,however,provide that ed kelley shall lease to the corporation adequate property in the valley of his property known as lazy e estates for a gravel and rock operation with royalties of per yard.mill creek was subsequently registered as a corporation with the missouri secretary of state.
in early,a loan was obtained for the equipment and other expenses necessary to set up the mine site.in february of,mill creek filed a mine plan for twenty acres with the missouri dnr,which was approved.tipton testified at trial that the intent was to mine these twenty acres until mill creek could secure the acre mine plan of mentioned above,which would be revoked when failed to file an annual renewal.tipton appears to have been primarily in control of setting up the gravel plant during.he oversaw the work required to put in new roadways,assemble new gravel plant equipment,and generally get the gravel plant up and running.he did not receive a salary for his work.
by the fall of,the relationship between the parties began to sour.ed kelley became angered that the plant was still not operational,despite the fact that tipton had spent all loaned and an additional of the kelleys personal funds.consequently,just before thanksgiving,ed kelley told tipton that he had decided to take over the mining operations,and that tipton should focus his efforts on obtaining contracts to sell gravel.tipton,however,was not successful in selling any gravel.ed kelly,around this time,also asked tipton to contribute money in order to keep mill creek operational.tipton did not have any money,and was unable to borrow any money at that time because he had already signed a personal guaranty for the mill creek note.
in january of,kelley told tipton to get off the property and barred him from entering thereafter.at the time,kelley allegedly told tipton you own percent of nothing and nothing is nothing and if i have to,i bankrupt this corporation and start a new one tomorrow.instead of dissolving the corporation properly,however,the evidence at trial showed that the kelleys continued to perform some mining operations after tipton removal and sold some mill creek equipment,without remitting any sales to the mill creek treasury or following any corporate formalities.
on march,tipton filed a shareholder derivative suit in federal district court for the western district of missouri on behalf of mill creek against the kelleys alleging,inter alia that ed kelley breached the agreement insofar as he prohibited mill creek from mining gravel on his land.much of the trial consisted of testimony regarding tipton lost profits theory of damages.numerous witnesses were called upon to testify regarding the amount of gravel available on lazy e estates,the purposes to which that gravel could be put,the prevailing value of such gravel,and the demand for such gravel at present and in the future.after a trial,the jury found that kelley breached the agreement and returned a verdict for mill creek in the amount of million.over the kelleys objections,the district court then assessed costs against the kelleys in the amount of,and assessed tipton attorney fees against mill creek in the amount of.the kelleys filed motions for judgment as a matter of law and a new trial,which were denied.the kelleys now appeal the denial of those motions and the district court award of costs and attorney fees to tipton.
ii.analysis 
breach of contract 
the kelleys argue that the district court erred in denying their renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,claiming that tipton failed to present sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the kelleys breached the agreement.
we review a denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo,using the same standard as the district court.see lawrence cnf,cir.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate when there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party.we view the record in the light most favorable to tipton and give him the benefit of all reasonable inferences.lawrence,at.
the kelleys argue that they had no duty under the terms of the agreement to operate the business indefinitely,and therefore their decision to shut down the corporation was not a breach of the agreement.we conclude,however,that there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find a breach of the agreement,which provides,in relevant part ed kelley shall lease to the corporation adequate property in the valley of his property known as lazy e estates for a gravel and rock operation with royalties of per yard.contrary to the kelleys arguments,the agreement clearly creates a duty for ed kelley to lease his land to the corporation for a gravel and rock operation.the contract contains no right of revocation or requirement that the mine be operational by a certain date.a mine plan subsequently filed by the corporation extends until,making it possible for the jury to find that the parties intended the lease of the kelleys property to extend at least until that time.
the undisputed evidence in this case is that ed kelley ejected tipton from the property,and would not allow him to return to operate the mill creek mining business.the evidence further reveals that the kelleys thereafter attempted to continue mining operations for their own personal benefit and without respect for mill creek rights under the contract or tipton rights as a shareholder.for instance,the kelleys sold mill creek equipment for their own personal benefit without remitting the money from the sale to mill creek.furthermore,the kelleys sold property that mill creek intended to mine to a third party.finally,ed kelley failed to conduct required mill creek shareholder meetings or to file or mill creek tax returns.in light of this evidence,we believe a reasonable jury could find that the kelleys prevented mill creek gravel from performing mining operations on their property,essentially ruining that enterprise and salvaging what was left for themselves personally.as this was clearly a breach of kelley duty under the agreement,we hold that the district court denial of the kelleys renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law on this issue was correct.
lost profits 
tipton argued at trial that,as a result of ed kelley breach,mill creek was deprived of around million in profits that the gravel corporation would have generated due to increased growth in the area.the jury agreed,at least in theory if not in amount,and awarded mill creek about ten percent of what tipton asked for,or million.on the kelleys renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,the district court upheld the award,stating it can not be said that there was a complete absence of probative facts to support plaintiff claim for lost profits,and that the jury could conclude,as it apparently did,that mill creek could have achieved profits of approximately of plaintiff estimates.
the kelleys argue that the district court erred in denying their renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law with regard to the issue of lost profits.the kelleys claim that tipton failed to present sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find lost profits and did not meet the exacting burden of proof for establishing lost profits under missouri law.

this court has observed that u nder missouri law there is no per se rule that a new business may not,regardless of the facts and circumstances,recover for loss of net profits or net gain.handi caddy,american home products,cir.while the general rule requiring proof of expected profits with reasonable certainty places a greater burden upon a newly established business,it does not mean a new business can never recover lost profits.
id.at.thus,while new businesses labor under a greater burden of proof in overcoming the general rule that evidence of expected profits is too speculative,uncertain,and remote to be considered,handi caddy,at,lost profits may nevertheless be recovered if they are made reasonably certain by proof of actual facts,with present data for a rational estimate of their amount.coonis,at quotations and citation omitted 
given this difficult standard,we hold that tipton did not prove lost profits with reasonable certainty.essentially,tipton theory of lost profit damages was that in light of increased growth in the area,mill creek would have been able to sell all the gravel and dirt within the mine plans for an enormous profit he introduced the following evidence to support this theory at trial that there was gravel and available to mill creek that the market value for gravel was per yard,and per yard for that the gravel available to mill creek could be used for some construction and landscaping purposes that one purchaser would have bought mill creek gravel for future projects,but he did not say how much and that there would be a demand for the gravel due to the growth of the area and the nearby construction of two highways.
this evidence was insufficient under missouri law to support the jury lost profits award.tipton never showed that mill creek was reasonably certain to make any profit,much less the million profit that the jury awarded or the million profit that tipton claimed was actually lost.the primary problem with tipton evidence was that his entire profits calculation was based on the proposition that there would be an increased demand for gravel in the area at some time in the future.projecting million in lost profits upon a future demand that does not yet exist is exactly the kind of conjectural assumption that is disfavored by all missouri courts that have addressed the issue of lost profits 
even if such growth did occur,it is still a matter of speculation as to whether this increased demand would create business for mill creek.presumably,the corporation would need to bid for contracts along with its competitors,and there is no guarantee that it would win any contracts that would create profits.in fact,the evidence suggests that mill creek would have been at a competitive disadvantage in this regard because of the high clay content of the gravel,the sharpness of the gravel,the porousness of the gravel,the limited uses to which the gravel could be put,and the inferior roads over which mill creek trucks would need to travel 
furthermore,tipton was able to produce almost no evidence that any buyer would purchase mill creek gravel many buyers flatly refused to buy the gravel because of its inferior quality.the undisputed evidence was that the corporation had no contracts to sell gravel,even though tipton and other mill creek employees dedicated some time attempting to secure contracts for the gravel that would be forthcoming from the mine.despite these efforts,only a small amount of the paltry eighty tons of gravel produced by the mine was ever sold.given these deficiencies,tipton assertion that mill creek would have sold all of the rock and dirt existent on the property for a sum total of million in profits strikes us as wishful thinking.
thus,we hold that,in light of the difficult standard for proving lost profits under missouri law,the evidence was insufficient for a reasonable jury to find that mill corporation that was in debt,had sold almost none of its product,and had a product that many purchasers were not interested in reasonably certain to make a profit.
the evidence suggests,however,that there was some smaller amount of actual damage to the corporation,such as the kelleys sale of corporation equipment for their own personal benefit,sale of land that the corporation intended to mine,and the small sales of gravel from the pile that were not remitted to the corporation.we also hold that mill creek may be entitled to recover the loss it incurred to get its gravel operation up and running in reliance on the agreement.see restatement second of contracts as an alternative to the measure of damages stated in expectation damages,the injured party has a right to damages based on his reliance interest,including expenditures made in preparation for performance see also john calamari,the law of contracts ed.west when the aggrieved party can not establish a loss of profits with sufficient certainty,the party may recover expenses of preparation and of part performance,as well as other foreseeable expenses incurred in reliance upon the contract.because the jury did not identify or distinguish these other breach of contract damages from the lost profit damages in its million award to the corporation,we find it is necessary to remand the case for a new trial on damages to calculate the amount due to the corporation without consideration of lost profits.
evidentiary issues 
the kelleys also appeal the district court denial of their motion for a new trial.they argue that the district court made a number of erroneous and prejudicial evidentiary rulings,including allowin
