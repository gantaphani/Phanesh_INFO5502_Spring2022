glen holmstrom,a citizen of new jersey,brought this shareholder derivative action in illinois state court against officers and directors of officemax,incorporated.the suit was removed to federal court by one of those directors,gary peterson,an ohio citizen,based on diversity of citizenship.holmstrom then moved to remand the case to state court.the district court granted the motion to remand,and peterson appealed the district court decision.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
background 
after holmstrom brought this shareholder derivative action in illinois state court,peterson removed the action to the united states district court for the northern district of illinois on the basis of diversity of citizenship.now in district court,holmstrom moved to remand the case because the complaint also named an illinois citizen as a defendant,and,thus,removal was barred by the forum defendant rule.see b.peterson contended,however,that b only precluded removal when a resident of the forum state actually is joined and served as a defendant at the time of removal.here,at the time peterson removed the case,the illinois citizen had not been properly joined and served.
the district court recognized that the language of b only prohibits removal in diversity cases when one of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the state in which such action is brought.id.emphasis added.thus,literally applied,the forum defendant rule,as embodied in b,would not preclude peterson removal because,at the time he removed the case,no illinois defendant had been joined and served.however,the district court concluded that the reason for limiting the forum defendant rule to situations where a citizen of the forum state is properly joined and served is to ensure that parties do not name citizens of the forum state solely for the purpose of preventing removal,without any intention of effecting service on the defendant.because there was no indication that holmstrom had named the illinois defendant in his complaint only to prevent removal,the district court held that literal application of the forum defendant rule in this case would defeat the purpose of the statute.the district court,therefore,granted holmstrom motion to remand.peterson appealed.
discussion 
peterson asserts that the district court erred when it determined that the forum defendant rule barred removal of this case even though,at the time of removal,no citizen of the forum state properly had been joined and served in this action.peterson claims that the district court application conflicts with the plain language of b and constitutes an impermissible,judicially crafted exception to the forum defendant rule.however,before we may proceed to the merits of peterson appeal,we must determine whether we have appellate jurisdiction.
section d of title of the united states code prohibits review of a district court order remanding a case to state court subject only to one exception not relevant here.d an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.although the language of the statute appears absolute,the supreme court held in thermtron products,hermansdorfer,d,that d must be read in pari materia with c.id.at.thus,the review prohibition is limited to remand orders based on those grounds specified in c.id.the two grounds specified in c are any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction and lack of subject matter jurisdiction.c.because failure to comply with b forum defendant rule does not result in a lack of subject matter jurisdiction,see hurley motor coach,cir,the issue before this court is whether failure to satisfy the forum defendant rule constitutes a defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction for purposes of c.if it does,d bars appellate review of a remand order based on such a failure.
history of c 
as set forth above,c provides that 
a motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within days after the filing of the notice of removal under section a.if at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,the case shall be remanded.
c.the language of c,however,has changed several times over the years,and the courts current interpretation of c reflects this history.
at the time the supreme court decided thermtron products,c read in pertinent part 
if at any time before final judgment it appears that the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction,the district court shall remand the case,and may order the payment of just costs.
thermtron,at.although this version of c spoke in terms of improvident removal,it was construed by the courts to mean removals that were defective in terms of the statutory conditions that congress had placed on removal.a removal was improvident if there was a legal defect in the removal.sheet metal workers int l ass seay,cir.as this court explained,it was logical and reasonable to interpret the term to mean noncompliance with congress specific and detailed statutory provisions.rothner city of chicago,cir.on the other hand,removal and remand orders based on doctrines such as forum non conveniens,abstention or supplemental jurisdiction were held to be outside of d prohibition because they were not tied to the statutory criteria for removal.see snapper,redan,cir.
section c was amended in.the new language provided 
a motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect in removal procedure must be made within days after the filing of the notice of removal under section a.if at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,the case shall be remanded.
c.the amendments sought to confirm the courts narrow reading of c by replacing the term improvidently with defect in the removal procedure.thus,under this version,courts uniformly continued to consider remands based on forum selection clauses,abstention and supplemental jurisdiction to be beyond the statute ambit.see snapper,at.however,the primary importance of the amendment lay in the establishment of a time limit for bringing nonjurisdictional motions to remand,not in defining the breadth of remand decisions falling within the scope of c.see snapper,at.
as noted by the eleventh circuit,a lthough the language of c worked well in the contexts of forum selection clauses,abstention,and supplemental jurisdiction,the language proved more troublesome for the courts in another context,specifically,application of the forum defendant rule.id.at.some courts believed that failure to comply with the forum defendant rule was substantive in nature.however,r ecognizing that it would make little sense to exempt such a remand from the time limit of c,most courts held that the time limit of c did apply.id.at.other courts,however,refused to follow this path,resulting in a conflict among the circuits.it is in this context,the eleventh circuit explains,that the next amendment to c must be understood.id.
the statute was amended in to produce the current version 
a motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within days after the filing of the notice of removal under section a.if at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,the case shall be remanded.
c.the committee report accompanying the amendments to c noted that the intent of the amendment to c was to impose a limit on all motions to remand except in those cases where the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,cong.sess,code cong.at.the report noted that the wording of the amendment had not expressed this intent clearly enough,and that the lack of clarity had led to different interpretations by different courts.id.presumably the lack of clarity to which the report referred was the phrase defect in removal procedure,as that was the only language removed by the amendment.thus,it would appear that the amendment was designed to ensure
