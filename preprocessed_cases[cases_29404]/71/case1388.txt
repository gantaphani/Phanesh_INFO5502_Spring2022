plaintiffs,who were minority shareholders in a corporation,sued the majority shareholder and another shareholder.they alleged defendants,in convincing plaintiffs to sell their shares,committed a breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,and elder abuse.a jury,however,rejected their claims and returned verdicts in favor of defendants.thereafter,the trial court denied defendants claim for expert witness fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section,which defendants requested because they made a pretrial offer of settlement more favorable to plaintiffs than was the eventual judgment.the trial court also denied the motion of one of the defendants the majority shareholder for attorney fees,entitlement to which he claimed under the agreements executed by plaintiffs when they sold their shares.plaintiffs appeal,contending the evidence does not support the judgment in defendants favor.defendants also appeal.they assert they are entitled to expert witness fees,and the majority shareholder contends the trial court erred by denying his motion for attorney fees 
in the unpublished portion of our opinion,we conclude plaintiffs waived their assertions that the evidence does not support the judgment,or,in other words,that the trial court should have entered judgment in plaintiffs favor as a matter of law,because plaintiffs presented an unacceptable statement of facts in their opening brief.while they give lip service to the proper standard on appeal,they do not,in fact,construe the record in its light most favorable to the judgment.consequently,their arguments are based on an improper view of the facts.
the argument of the majority shareholder that he was entitled to attorney fees has merit.his agreements with plaintiffs at the time of his purchase of their shares provided for an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in any dispute under the agreements.also in the agreement,plaintiffs stated they were not relying on the majority shareholder representations.at trial,the majority shareholder asserted this provision of the contract as a defense,thus creating a dispute under the agreements.the trial court therefore erred in determining that the agreements did not provide for an award of attorney fees in this action.
defendants assertion the trial court erred in denying expert witness fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section also has merit.defendants made a pretrial offer of settlement,proposing to pay plaintiffs an amount within the approximate range defendants would have been required to pay if they had not prevailed.we find the trial court refusal to award expert witness fees was an abuse of discretion.
plaintiffs appeal after a jury verdict in favor of defendants.accordingly,our summary of the significant facts will cast the evidence in its light most favorable to the judgment,drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all conflicts in favor of defendants.howard owens corning th,d.in their opening brief,plaintiffs state because this appeal is from a jury verdict in favor of defendants,the facts set forth herein are based upon the testimony of the defendants and defense witnesses.this statement and,as will be seen,plaintiffs statement of facts in their opening brief do not properly reflect the standard of review.we do not limit our review to the evidence presented by the defense instead,we consider the entire record and construe it,as noted above,in its light most favorable to the verdict.kasparian county of los angeles th,d.
the parties and deltam 
in,defendant allen miller,created deltam systems,deltam,as a closely held corporation engaged in the silicon valley business of placing information technology workers in temporary positions.defendant stephen haessler assisted in forming the company but later left to work in portland,oregon.miller and haessler each received founders stock in deltam for their efforts.at the times relevant to this litigation,miller owned more than percent of the outstanding shares.
miller solicited friends,neighbors,and business associates to buy stock and supply funding for the new company.plaintiffs were among those early shareholders.plaintiffs carroll and priscilla bravo purchased shares at per share,for a total investment of.plaintiffs joseph and patricia george invested,purchasing shares at per share.plaintiffs douglas and helen mahr bought shares at per share,totaling.plaintiffs gary and millie thompson invested at two different prices,buying shares at per share and shares at per share,for a total investment of.sidney and mara diamond invested,purchasing shares at per share.while mara diamond is a plaintiff in this action,sidney was not a plaintiff and passed away about two months after the complaint was filed.before plaintiffs purchased their shares,they certified that they had sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters to evaluate the risk in purchasing stock.
deltam,with miller as the chief executive officer,attempted to grow through its first years of existence.changes in tax laws and other challenges,however,made it difficult for deltam to prosper.in,the corporation almost collapsed with a severe cash shortage.after,deltam began placing foreign nationals in information technology jobs.by march,the company posted its largest profit to date,about for the prior year.
plaintiffs sale of shares 
some deltam shareholders,including sidney diamond,were dissatisfied with the performance of the company and wanted a way to recoup their investment.at a shareholders meeting in september,miller proposed a share repurchase plan that would be made available to all shareholders.because of legal hurdles,deltam was unable to offer the repurchase plan,so miller,personally,offered to buy minority shareholders stock.in a letter to shareholders in december,miller stated he intended to purchase shares from anyone who desired to sell.the letter included deltam financial statements.miller then called each shareholder,offering to buy the shares for per share.he did not tell the shareholders,as plaintiffs alleged,that deltam was in poor financial condition.
in late december and early january,plaintiffs sold their shares to miller.other shareholders elected not to sell their stock.in a share purchase agreement,signed by each plaintiff,they stated seller represents and warrants to purchaser and the company that seller decision to sell or otherwise convey the shares as provided herein was not made in reliance upon any representation made by purchaser,the company or its officers,directors,agents or others acting with or on behalf of any of them and seller is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of this sale and has the ability to protect seller own interests in this transaction.
deltam after plaintiffs sold shares 
after miller completed the purchase of plaintiffs shares,haessler agreed to return to deltam as a paid consultant.haessler desired a larger stake in deltam,so miller sold or transferred some the stock he obtained from plaintiffs to haessler for per share.miller also pledged additional stock he obtained from plaintiffs to sell in the future to haessler for per share,conditioned on haessler meeting specified goals.
in,more than one year after plaintiffs sold their deltam stock,an economic upturn began in silicon valley.after rejecting several acquisition offers,deltam accepted an offer of acquisition three years after plaintiffs sold their shares,in late,for per share from corestaff.
plaintiffs filed suit against miller and haessler,alleging fraud,concealment,and breach of fiduciary duty,and seeking rescission of their sale of stock.they also alleged miller and haessler conspired to commit these torts.after trial,the jury returned special verdicts in favor of defendants on all causes of action.plaintiffs filed,but the trial court denied,a motion for new trial in which plaintiffs contended defendants breached their fiduciary duties to plaintiffs as a matter of law.defendants,as prevailing parties,filed a memorandum of costs.plaintiffs responded with a motion to tax costs,asserting defendants were not entitled to recover in expert witness fees.the trial court granted the motion to tax costs with respect to expert witness fees.miller moved for in attorney fees pursuant to the share purchase agreements.the trial court denied the motion.
discussion 
attorney fees 
when plaintiffs sold their stock to miller,they each signed a document entitled share purchase agreement.contained in that agreement is the following attorney fees provision the prevailing party in any dispute under this agreement shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys fees incurred in such dispute.
in their original complaint,plaintiffs asserted that venue in sacramento was proper because the share purchase agreements were entered into there.they alleged they signed the share purchase agreements in reliance on miller representations.and they claimed the right to an award of attorney fees as a further direct and legal result of the above described conduct of defendant,plaintiffs incurred attorney fees,costs and expenses to bring the instant action and prosecute defendant for his fraud,misrepresentations,deceit and breaches of fiduciary duties to plaintiffs,all to their damage and in an amount to be ascertained at trial.plaintiffs thompsons,bravos,and mahrs are entitled to attorney fees in accordance with paragraph of the share purchase agreements attached hereto as exhibits a,b and c.plaintiffs two amended complaints made essentially the same allegations with respect to the share purchase agreements and their right to recover attorney fees on every cause of action pursuant to those contracts.defendants answer likewise claimed a right to attorney fees under the share purchase agreements and asserted as a defense plaintiffs statements in those agreements that they were not relying on the representations of miller 
during trial,plaintiffs sought to overcome miller assertion of the share purchase agreements as a defense to the causes of action.they continued to assert their right to attorney fees under those agreements.during the opening statements,plaintiffs conceded miller right to recover attorney fees should he prevail and in this lawsuit one of the issues that you will decide is whether this agreement was obtained by fraudulent representations or concealments of known facts because if it was it is not enforceable and that one of the issues in this case.reading the agreement also provides the prevailing party in any dispute under this agreement shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys fees incurred in such dispute.finished reading.so you do get attorneys fees unless you have this written agreement.the clients do get paid for their attorney fees,they have to suffer that for themselves.so now he has a provision in here if they want to fight this and they lose they will have to pay his attorney fees,another way of discouraging them from this litigation.
after the jury verdicts in defendants favor,plaintiffs sought to have the trial court rescind the share purchase agreements and set aside the judgment.the trial court refused.
miller filed a motion for in attorney fees.finding that the share purchase agreements did not give miller the right to recover attorney fees and that plaintiffs were not estopped from so asserting,the trial court denied the motion for attorney fees.the court held in the instant case,the causes of action on which defendant prevailed sounded in tort not contract.the fact that plaintiffs sought rescission of the share purchase agreements as one possible remedy for the alleged fraud does not mean that the action sounds in contract.the court has already determined,in this case,that rescission is a remedy,not a separate cause of action.the question,then,for this court,is whether the fee provision at issue is broad enough to encompass plaintiffs tort claim.the court finds that it is not.exxess electronixx heger realty corporation th,d exxess electronixx is on point.its reasoning is persuasive.the fee provision covers disputes under the contract.it is too narrowly drawn to encompass the tort claims asserted in this action.
miller contends the trial court erred in determining that the share purchase agreements did not provide for an award of his attorney fees in this action.he asserts he is entitled to an award because he used a provision of the agreements to defend against plaintiffs claims.
the parties did not present extrinsic evidence to interpret the attorney fees provision of the contract.therefore,we must determine,de novo,whether the applicable statutes and the share purchase agreements entitled miller to the award he sought.exxess electronixx,supra,th at,d.except as attorney fees are specifically provided for by statute,the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement,express or implied,of the parties code civ.as to tort claims,the question of whether to award attorneys fees turns on the language of the contractual attorneys fee provision,whether the party seeking fees has prevailed within the meaning of the provision and whether the type of claim is within the scope of the provision.citation.this distinction between contract and tort claims flows from the fact that a tort claim is not on a contract and is therefore outside the ambit of civil code section.citations.exxess electronixx,supra,th at,d.
in exxess electronixx,the contract provided for an award of attorney fees for an action or proceeding to enforce the terms of the contract or declare rights hereunder.exxess electronixx,supra,th at,d.finding that the tort claims were asserted in that action neither to enforce the terms of the contract nor to declare rights thereunder,the reviewing court concluded the prevailing party was not entitled to an award of attorney fees.
here,miller is a prevailing party.to determine whether he is entitled to an award of attorney fees,we must determine,consistent with the language of the share purchase agreements,whether this action entailed any dispute under the share purchase agreements to answer this question,we apply the ordinary rules of contract interpretation.under statutory rules of contract interpretation,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract the clear and explicit meaning of these provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage,controls judicial interpretation thus,if the meaning a layperson would ascribe to contract language is not ambiguous,we apply that meaning citation.exxess electronixx,supra,th at,d.
because the attorney fees provision of the share purchase agreements differed from the attorney fees provision of the contract in exxess electronixx,that case is not directly on point.there,the prevailing party was entitled to an award in an action to enforce the contract or declare rights under it.here,the provision is different,providing for an award in a dispute under the agreements.a major difference between the two provisions is the term dispute instead of action.another difference is exxess electronixx dealt with an action to enforce the terms of a contract we deal with a dispute under a contract.
miller contends that,because the statement by plaintiffs in the share purchase agreements that they were not relying on representations made by miller became his primary defense to plaintiffs tort claims,this action involved a dispute under the share purchase agreements.the defendant in exxess electronixx made this same argument,that its defense was based on a provision of the contract that also contained an attorney fees provision.
in exxess electronixx,the court appeared to agree that use of a contract provision as a defense in a tort action could give rise to recovery of attorney fees under that contract.the court went on to find,however,that the specific attorney fees provision found in that contract did not allow such use.the court discussion is instructive 
the defendant argues that it is entitled to fees because its defense to the was based on a provision of the lease,in particular,the as is clause.according to the defendant,all of the plaintiff
