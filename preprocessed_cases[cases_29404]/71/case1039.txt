this litigation arises out of the issuance of an allegedly false and misleading proxy solicitation for a stock option plan.new york city employees retirement system nycers alleged that the false solicitation denied it its right to an informed shareholder vote and caused it to suffer economic loss through share dilution.the district court dismissed nycers consolidated complaint.the court determined that nycers claim was derivative,not direct,and stock dilution,alone,did not establish economic loss.
we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm the district court dismissal of nycers consolidated complaint.nycers pled a direct injury,but failed to assert any cognizable economic loss.
nycers also appeals the district court denial of leave to amend its consolidated complaint to reallege a claim that was asserted in the initial complaint,but which it omitted from the consolidated complaint.the district court,applying federal rule of civil procedure a,concluded that no factors weighed against further amendment,but nonetheless determined that by not realleging the claim in the consolidated complaint,nycers had waived it.we conclude that the district court erred in applying a waiver rule to the omitted claim,and,because the district court determined that leave to amend should otherwise be granted,a ruling not challenged in this appeal,we grant nycers leave to amend to reallege the omitted claim.
background 
nycers is a public pension fund that manages retirement assets for over current and former employees of the city of new york.apple is a california corporation based in cupertino,california.
plaintiffs vogel and mahoney,individual apple shareholders,filed the original complaint in this action,alleging claims under b,a,and a of the securities exchange act sea.nycers was appointed lead plaintiff pursuant to the private securities litigation reform act of pslra and filed a consolidated class action complaint against apple and fourteen of its officers and directors.the consolidated complaint alleges direct class claims under a and a of the sea for a misleading proxy solicitation and a state law claim for breach of the fiduciary duty of candor for various proxy solicitations,form annual reports,and registration statements.nycers bases its allegations on the backdating of stock options by apple 
according to nycers,apple shareholders suffered injury through impairment of their right to a fully informed vote and substantial dilution of their shares.nycers asserts that,from to,shareholders unwittingly authorized issuance of a total of million shares,or of apple stock.the consolidated complaint prays for rescission of the votes,compensatory damages for share dilution,an order for an accounting,a declaration of defendants liability,and attorney fees and costs.
for the a claim,nycers alleges three falsities in apple proxy solicitation.first,the solicitation states that apple compensation practices align ed the interests of employees and stockholders,because stock options would have value only if the company stock price increases.nycers alleges falsity because backdated options can have value even if apple stock price does not increase,thereby decoupling employee and shareholder interests.second,the solicitation states that granted options did not make up for the below market cash compensation paid to executive officers.nycers alleges misrepresentation because backdating can surreptitiously increase compensation.third,the solicitation states that in march,steve jobs,apple current chairman and ceo,cancelled his outstanding options in exchange for ten million split adjusted shares of restricted stock.nycers alleges misrepresentation because some of the cancelled options were backdated,improperly providing jobs with extra shares valued at over million.for its state law claim,nycers identifies a longer list of falsities in the various documents,notably,affirmations that options were priced at fair market value on the date of the grant.
on november,the district court dismissed the consolidated complaint with leave to amend solely to assert derivative claims.vogel jobs,no.c jf,wl,at.in rejecting the a claim,the court stated that the consolidated complaint failed to allege facts giving rise to a direct claim and,alternatively,failed to plead loss causation under the pslra.id.at.without a primary violation under a,nycers a control person claim failed.id.at.furthermore,the state law claims presumably failed because the a analysis was based on an interpretation of state law.id.at.

discussion 
disclosure claims under a of the sea and sec rule 
to state a claim under a and rule,a plaintiff must establish that a proxy statement contained a material misrepresentation or omission which caused the plaintiff injury and that the proxy solicitation itself,rather than the particular defect in the solicitation materials,was an essential link in the accomplishment of the transaction.tracinda.daimlerchrysler ag,cir quotation marks omitted see also desaigoudar meyercord,cir stating that such a plaintiff must also demonstrate that the misstatement or omission was made with the requisite level of culpability and that it was an essential link in the accomplishment of the proposed transaction.in addition,private plaintiffs must meet the heightened pleading standards of the pslra,as well as its loss causation requirement.stoneridge inv.partners,llc.on appeal,the parties dispute whether nycers states a claim under a that is both direct and adequately alleges loss causation.

nature of nycers claim 
a claim asserted under a of the sea may be brought either as a direct or a derivative claim.case borak.the characterization of a claim as direct or derivative is governed by the law of the state of incorporation.lapidus hecht,cir.in the present case,california law applies,but there appears to be no difference between delaware and california law on this issue.
in,the delaware supreme court stated that an analysis of whether a claim is direct or derivative must be based solely on the following questions who suffered the alleged corporation or the suing stockholder who would receive the benefit of the recovery or other remedy tooley donaldson,lufkin jenrette.a plaintiff classification of the suit is not binding.id.to establish a direct action,t he stockholder claimed direct injury must be independent of any alleged injury to the corporation.the stockholder must demonstrate that the duty breached was owed to the stockholder and that he or she can prevail without showing an injury to the corporation.id.at.
in the pleadings,nycers alleges that apple shareholders were deprived of the right to a fully informed vote.this claimed injury is independent of any injury to the corporation and implicates a duty of disclosure owed to shareholders.see in re tyson foods.ch where a shareholder has been denied one of the most critical rights he or she right to a fully informed harm suffered is almost always an individual,not corporate,harm.dieterich harrer.ch dieterich disclosure allegations are direct claims,as they are based in rights secured to stockholders by various statutes.thus,under state law,nycers claim for injury to its right to a fully informed vote is a direct claim.see also in re morgan chase,w here it is claimed that a duty of disclosure violation impaired the stockholders right to cast an informed vote,that claim is direct.citing in re pictures,del because nycers a claim is direct,the district court erred in dismissing the consolidated complaint on the ground the claim was derivative and had to be pleaded as such.
economic loss 
treating the claim as a direct claim under a of the sea and sec rule,the private plaintiffs had to allege loss causation.see stoneridge,at discussing a claim under b of the sea,
