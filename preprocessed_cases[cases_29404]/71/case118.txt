this interlocutory appeal presents a question of first impression whether the foreign sovereign immunities act of fsia,stat,immunizes an instrumentality of a foreign sovereign against claims that it violated federal securities laws by making misrepresentations outside the united states concerning the value of securities purchased by investors within the united states.plaintiffs appellees atlantica holdings,atlantica baltica investment holding,baltica blu funds,blu funds allan and anthony kiblisky the kibliskys and jacques gliksberg gliksberg collectively,plaintiffs brought this action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,alleging that defendant appellant sovereign wealth fund samruk kazyna jsc sk fund,a sovereign wealth fund of the republic of kazakhstan,misrepresented the value of certain notes the subordinated notes issued by bta bank jsc bta bank,a kazakhstani corporation by sk fund,in connection with a restructuring of bta bank debt.plaintiffs seek to hold sk fund liable for these misrepresentations under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of the exchange act,stat.codified in relevant part at b,a.
the district court jesse furman,judge held that the fsia furnished both jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims and personal jurisdiction over sk fund,and therefore denied sk fund motion to dismiss.we agree with the district court that sk fund is not immune from suit under the fsia because plaintiffs claims are based upon an act outside the territory of the united states that cause d a direct effect in the united states.a.we further decline to exercise appellate jurisdiction to consider sk fund argument that the district court could not exercise personal jurisdiction over it consistent with due process.accordingly,we affirm the order in part and dismiss the balance of sk fund appeal.
sk fund,a company wholly owned by the government of the republic of kazakhstan,is the majority owner of bta bank,a kazakhstani corporation.in february,sk fund acquired of bta bank common stock by making a billion investment in the bank.shortly thereafter,in april,bta bank announced that it had ceased principal payments on all of its outstanding financial obligations.atlantica and baltica,each a panamanian investment fund,were creditors of bta bank,having purchased certain of its outstanding debt securities.these securities could only be held in accounts maintained in specific clearing systems,access to which is generally limited to large financial institutions direct participants.however,direct participants could hold bta bank securities for either their own account or their customers benefit.atlantica and baltica were customers of ubs financial services ubs,a large financial institution that was evidently a direct participant.
after ceasing to make principal payments on its outstanding securities,bta bank undertook a restructuring of its capital structure in the restructuring.in connection with the restructuring,bta bank issued a plus page information memorandum the information memorandum that incorporated by reference a deed of undertaking executed by sk fund the deed of undertaking.the information memorandum was made available to bta bank existing creditors on its website.an individual seeking to access the document was required to certify that he or she was located outside the united states and was not a resident of the united states,not a person or was an accredited investor,as defined in rule a of sec regulation d,a,or a qualified institutional buyer qib,as defined in sec rule.according to plaintiffs,sk fund dominance of and control over bta bank,and the inclusion in the information memorandum of certain statements from s k fund by reference establish that s k fund was involved in the production of the information memorandum and was aware of its contents.
the information memorandum described the terms of the restructuring.sk fund would receive additional equity in bta bank,becoming an owner.preexisting holders of bta bank debt would receive,in exchange for their old securities,new ones,including the subordinated notes.like bta bank old securities,the new ones issued in connection with the restructuring could be held only by direct participants.again,however,direct participants could hold the new securities either for their own accounts or for their customers benefit.the new securities were subject to transfer restrictions.in particular,because they would not be registered under united states securities laws,they could be transferred only to persons or qibs in transactions exempt from this country registration requirements.see louis loss et,fundamentals of securities regulation ed.interests in the new securities could be transferred on the books of a direct participant,but such transfers were subject to the same restrictions.
as required for the restructuring to become effective,it was initially approved by bta bank creditors in may and then by a court in kazakhstan in july.as creditors,atlantica and baltica committed to participate in the restructuring,to accept subordinated notes in exchange for their existing securities by communicating with their broker in the miami office of ubs.atlantica and baltica later acquired additional subordinated notes on the secondary market between september and october,and the other plaintiffs,who had not previously been creditors of bta bank,acquired subordinated notes on the secondary market as well blu funds made its investment in april,the kibliskys made theirs in january,and gliksberg made several purchases between september and may.blu funds,like atlantica and baltica,is a panamanian investment fund the kibliskys live in miami,and gliksberg lives in highland park,illinois.
plaintiffs purchases were all made through ubs miami office,which sent plaintiffs orders to its in new york using funds from plaintiffs ubs accounts.the orders were filled,and the transactions completed,in new york.plaintiffs allege that bta bank and sk fund marketed the subordinated notes extensively in the united states,and directed that marketing to investors,in particular,the complaint avers that sk fund sent representatives to the united states,in the district court words,to meet with investors and to assure them of the health of bta bank balance sheet.atlantica holdings,sovereign wealth fund samruk kazyna jsc,d.these efforts were successful,according to plaintiffs a bta bank powerpoint presentation from january indicates that united states investors held of the subordinated notes.
plaintiffs claim to have made their investments in the subordinated notes in reliance on a number of misrepresentations contained in the information memorandum and made subsequently by sk fund and bta bank.principally,the information memorandum including the portion describing the obligations undertaken by sk fund in the deed of undertaking stated that bta bank would not pay sk fund any dividends on its equity holdings until the bank newly issued securities,including the subordinated notes,were paid in full.this representation,in addition to other financial disclosures in the information memorandum,was allegedly false in light of a complex,undisclosed series of transactions between bta bank and sk fund the negative carry swap pursuant to which bta bank paid interest on sk fund deposits at a rate significantly higher than bta bank was earning on bonds it had purchased from sk fund.according to plaintiffs,the negative carry swap resulted in sk fund effectively siphon ing hundreds of millions of dollars from bta bank at the expense of other creditors.
the negative carry swap began to come to light in may,when bta bank issued an investor presentation disclosing that it was paying more on its liabilities than it was taking in on its assets,and when the investment bank morgan published a research report disclosing additional details of bta bank yield mismatch.as a result of these disclosures,the value of the subordinated notes decreased to less than of face value by june,and then to less than of face value by january.
between july and december,following the initial round of disclosures regarding the negative carry swap,sk fund officers made a number of public statements to american press outlets,including bloomberg,seeking to prop up the value of bta bank securities by assuring investors that sk fund would guarantee bta bank ongoing viability.plaintiffs allege that these statements,too,were false or misleading bta bank eventually defaulted on its debt in january,less than eighteen months after the restructuring.bta bank then went through a second restructuring the restructuring,pursuant to which sk fund gained a ownership interest in the bank.
plaintiffs allege that bta bank made additional false or misleading statements in,after its default.in powerpoint presentations prepared in connection with the restructuring,bta bank failed to disclose its liability on instruments called recovery units,which it had issued to some creditors during the restructuring.these recovery units entitled holders to participate pari passu with bta bank senior creditors in the event that the bank defaulted.when the market eventually learned of these previously undisclosed senior liabilities,the value of the subordinated notes held by plaintiffs plunged even further.
plaintiffs commenced this action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on december,and filed an amended complaint the complaint on april.the complaint asserts claims under sections b and a of the exchange act against sk fund because bta bank was bankrupt at the time,plaintiffs did not sue bta bank,although they later brought a separate action against it,which is now also before judge furman in the southern district.on may,sk fund moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety for lack of jurisdiction under the fsia,lack of personal jurisdiction,failure to state a claim,and failure to plead fraud with particularity.
on march,the district court issued an opinion denying the bulk of sk fund motion.atlantica holdings,d.with respect to the fsia,the district court held that it had jurisdiction under both the first and third clauses of the statute exception,which provide,respectively,that a foreign state is not immune from suit in actions based upon the state commercial activity in the united states or in actions based upon its commercial activity outside the united states that has a direct effect in the united states.a.in a footnote,the district court concluded that because the fsia authorizes personal jurisdiction over a foreign state whenever it is not immune from suit,see b,the conclusion that sk fund was not immune under the fsia exception also meant that the district court could exercise personal jurisdiction over sk fund.see atlantica holdings,d at.
with respect to the merits of plaintiffs claims,the district court concluded that plaintiffs had adequately alleged a domestic securities transaction under morrison national australia bank,and absolute activist value master fund ficeto,cir,and had adequately alleged reasonable reliance on sk fund alleged misstatements and omissions.see atlantica holdings,d at.however,because only blu funds and atlantica had purchased subordinated notes after july,the other plaintiffs could not have relied on any statements from july or later in deciding to invest accordingly,the district court dismissed those plaintiffs claims related to those statements.id.at the court also rejected sk fund arguments that plaintiffs had not adequately alleged loss causation,had failed to plead scienter with particularity,and had not adequately alleged liability under section a of the exchange act.id.at.
the denial of a motion to dismiss on sovereign immunity grounds is an immediately appealable collateral order,see rogers petroleo brasileiro,cir,and sk fund filed a timely notice of appeal from the district court order on march.sk fund also sought a certificate of appealability pursuant to b with respect to the district court morrison holding,which the district court granted on may.atlantica holdings,sovereign wealth fund samruk kazyna jsc,cv,wl may.on july,however,a panel of this court denied leave to appeal the morrison issue.in light of that decision,the only issues argued by the parties on appeal are whether the fsia immunizes sk fund against plaintiffs claims and whether the district court may properly exercise personal jurisdiction over sk fund.
discussion 
the fsia provides the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign in the united states.republic of argentina weltover,quoting argentine republic amerada hess shipping.under the fsia,a foreign state is immune from the jurisdiction of state and federal courts in the united states unless one of a number of statutory exceptions applies.u.see id.providing exceptions.federal courts have jurisdiction over an action against a foreign state if,and only if,one of those exceptions applies.id.a.here,plaintiffs concede that sk fund qualifies as a foreign state for fsia purposes.see id.a providing that an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state is a foreign state id.b providing that a majorityowned corporation formed under the laws of the foreign state is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state.therefore,the question whether the district court had jurisdiction depends on whether one of the fsia exceptions to immunity applies.
the single most important exception to foreign state immunity under the fsia,hanil bank bank negara indon.persero,cir,and the only one at issue in this case,is the exception.this exception,which contains three independent clauses,provides that a foreign state is not immune from jurisdiction in any case in which 
the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states by the foreign state or upon an act performed in the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere or upon an act outside the territory of the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the united states.
a.plaintiffs argue,and the district court held,that sk fund is not immune from jurisdiction because both the first and third clauses of the exception apply in this case.see atlantica holdings,d at.because we agree with plaintiffs and the district court that the third clause applies,we do not reach the parties arguments regarding the first clause.
the third clause of the exception is known as the clause.under the clause,a foreign state is not immune from jurisdiction if the plaintiff lawsuit is based upon an act outside the territory of the united states that was taken in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state outside this country and that cause d a direct effect in the united states.weltover,at first and third alterations in original quoting a.sk fund primarily argues that the district court misperceived what plaintiffs claims are based upon,and that the actions upon which plaintiffs claims are actually based did not cause a direct effect in the united states.we address these two arguments in turn.because the district court based its decision on undisputed facts drawn from plaintiffs complaint and sk fund evidentiary submissions,our review is de novo.see virtual countries,republic of south africa,cir.
the supreme court has explained that,within the meaning of a,an action is based upon the particular conduct that constitutes the gravamen of the suit.obb personenverkehr ag sachs,quoting saudi arabia nelson,rather than individually analyzing each of the plaintiffs causes of action,we zero in on the core of their suit id.sachs,handed down just this term,describes the gravamen as the basis or foundation of a claim,those elements that,if proven,would entitle a plaintiff to relief.id.at quoting nelson,at.thus,suits for personal injuries sustained at a railway station in austria,see id.at,or in a prison in saudi arabia,see nelson,at,rest on conduct that plainly occurred abroad.sachs.at.in this case,identifying the gravamen of plaintiffs complaint is straightforward.plaintiffs core claim is that they were misled as to the value of the subordinated notes by certain misrepresentations made by sk fund and bta bank.so the gravamen of plaintiffs complaint is those misrepresentations.see black law dictionary ed defining gravamen as t he substantial point or essence of a claim,grievance,or complaint.
sk fund disputes whether statements made by bta bank in investor presentations and in the information memorandum may properly be attributed to it for jurisdictional purposes.see first city bank banco para el comercio exterior de cuba,establishing presumption that government instrumentalities established as juridical entities distinct and independent from their sovereign should normally be treated as such.to be sure,plaintiffs seeking jurisdiction under the fsia must allege facts sufficient to establish an exception to sovereign immunity under the fsia.see robinson,at.in this case,however,insofar as bta bank statements constitute part of the gravamen of the complaint,plaintiffs have advanced a section a control person theory which,if proven,would entitle them to relief from sk fund on the basis of bta bank alleged misrepresentations.sachs.at see a holding liable any person who,directly or indirectly,controls any person liable under any provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder.the district court rejected sk fund challenge to the sufficiency of plaintiffs section a control allegations in a portion of its ruling not before us on appeal.
thus,we need not reach the question whether plaintiffs have shown that bta bank is sk fund alter ego,see fid.guar.braspetro oil servs,cir per curiam under certain circumstances,the acts of a state alter ego may be attributed to the state in determining whether a applies,so as to recover under their section b theory.see b b holding liable any person who make s any untrue statement of material fact janus capital,first derivative traders,reiterating section b requirement that defendant make the actionable misrepresentation.sachs makes clear that in assessing whether an action is based upon acts outside the united states,for fsia purposes,we look not to the analysis of each individual claim,but to the overall question where a lawsuit foundation is geographically based.see sachs.at in nelson,we did not undertake such an exhaustive,analysis of plaintiffs causes of action,nor did we engage in the analysis that would have been a necessary prelude to such an undertaking.and here,the parties agree that all the misrepresentations at issue occurred outside the united states.
for these reasons,we conclude that plaintiffs claims against sk fund based upon at least the misrepresentations alleged in their complaint sk fund does not dispute that those misrepresentations were made outside the united states.see appellant br.at plaintiffs cite certain statements made by bta bank and sk fund in kazakhstan emphasis added.nor does sk fund dispute that they were made in connection with a commercial activity of sk fund outside this country.accordingly,this action is based upon an act outside the territory of the united states in connection with a commercial activity of sk fund elsewhere,and the only question remaining is whether that act cause d a direct effect in the united states.a.
plaintiffs argue,and the district court held,that losses suffered by united states investors in the subordinated notes as a result of sk fund alleged misrepresentations about those securities value qualify as a direct effect in this country.see atlantica holdings,d at.we agree.
in order to be direct,an effect need not be substantial or foreseeable,but rather must simply follow as an immediate consequence of the defendant activity.weltover,at second alteration in original quoting weltover,republic of argentina,cir.in weltover,the supreme court held that argentina nonpayment of funds into a new york bank account that had been designated as the place of payment on certain bonds issued by that country caused a direct effect in the united states because m oney that was supposed to have been delivered to the new york bank for deposit was not forthcoming.at.based on weltover holding,courts have consistently held that,in contract cases,a breach of a contractual duty causes a direct effect in the united states sufficient to confer fsia jurisdiction so long as the united states is the place of performance for the breached duty.see,rogers,at hanil bank,at commercial bank of kuwait rafidain bank,cir see also odhiambo republic of kenya.
here,of course,plaintiffs are asserting tort claims,not contract claims.in tort,we have reasoned,the analog to contract law place of performance is the locus of the tort.antares aircraft,federal republic of nigeria,cir.a tort known as the locus delicti,or place of wrong is the place where the last event necessary to make an actor liable for an alleged tort takes place.restatement of conflict of laws hereinafter first restatement.and,s ince a tort action traditionally has not been viewed as complete until the plaintiff suffers injury or loss,the cause of action has generally been considered to arise at the place where this damage was sustained.sack low,cir see,christopher whitlock,myth of mess international choice of law in action,the first restatement defines the place of wrong as the state where the last event necessary to make an actor liable for an alleged tort takes place.usually this is the location where the plaintiff was injured,since liability does not arise without injury.footnotes omitted quoting first restatement.thus,a determination that a tort locus is the united states is,in effect,often a determination that the plaintiff has been injured in this country by the defendant tortious actions meaning that those actions caused a direct effect the plaintiff injury in this country.as a result,such a determination will ordinarily be sufficient,if not invariably necessary,to confer fsia jurisdiction under our precedents.see antares aircraft,at leaving open the possibility that even a foreign tort may have had sufficient contacts with the united states to establish the requisite direct effect in this country see also hanil bank,at noting that the united states need not be the location where the most direct effect is felt,simply a direct effect.
we have previously held that the locus of an alleged misrepresentation actionable under section b is the forum where the loss is sustained,not where fraudulent misrepresentations are made.sack,at quoting argued that it was.at the time,there was no federal statute of limitations for such claims,so courts looked to the law of the forum state in that case,new york.new york borrowing statute provides that claims arising in another state are governed by that state statute of limitations if it is shorter than new york.see.the sack defendants argued that the plaintiffs claim arose in massachusetts,raising the question of where a section b claim arises.in answer,judge friendly looked to the first restatement to identify the locus of a cause of action for fraud or deceit,the closest common law analogy to an action under section b.at.the first restatement provides that the locus of a fraud claim is the place where the plaintiff sustains a loss.id.at accord,in re thelen llp,cir.in particular,the first restatement contains an illustration for claims that judge friendly deemed quite pertinent 
a,in state x,owns shares in the m company.b,in state y,fraudulently persuades a not to sell the shares.the value of the shares falls.the place of wrong is 
sack,at quoting first restatement note.on this basis,the sack court held that an alleged misrepresentation actionable under section b just like a claim for where its economic impact is felt,normally the plaintiffs residence.see also block first blood,cir relying on sack holding to conclude that a section b claim arose in the forum where the plaintiffs resided.
if the locus of a section b claim is the place where the plaintiff suffers economic loss from reliance on the defendant misrepresentations,then it follows that in a securities fraud case,an fsia direct effect may be felt where the plaintiff suffers such loss.see antares aircraft,at in tort,the analog to contract law place of performance is the locus of the tort.to be sure,locating an economic injury within the united states,without more,will not suffice to bring a foreign sovereign within the commercial activities exception.see id.t he fact that an american individual or firm suffers some financial loss from a foreign tort can not,standing alone,suffice to trigger the exception.but here,as the district court correctly determined,plaintiffs have adequately shown that sk fund contemplated investment by united states persons and that sk fund alleged misrepresentations caused a direct effect in the united states when at least some investors in the subordinated gliksberg and the an economic loss in this country as a result of those misrepresentations.see atlantica holdings,d at a ccording to the amended complaint,defendant made a series of false or misleading statements about the financial health of bta bank that,when the dust settled,left holders of the notes including many united states investors with assets worth less than ten percent of their face value.on such facts,we have no difficulty concluding that plaintiffs loss follow ed as an immediate consequence of sk fund alleged misrepresentations concerning securities that were marketed in the united states and directed toward united states persons.weltover,at internal quotation marks omitted.
as noted,plaintiffs amended complaint alleges that the kibliskys reside in miami and that gliksberg resides in illinois.plaintiffs allege that gliksberg and the kibliskys purchased subordinated notes following the restructuring in reliance on the information memorandum,which allegedly included a number of misrepresentations about the value of the subordinated notes.they made these purchases by placing orders through their broker in the miami office of ubs.after the falsity of sk fund alleged misstatements was revealed,the subordinated notes lost substantially all of their value.nothing in the amended complaint or the parties other submissions suggests that gliksberg and the kibliskys were injured by sk fund alleged misstatements anywhere other than their place of residence.the locus of sk fund alleged securities fraud,then,was the united states.see sack,at first restatement note.and the fact that the locus of the fraud was the united states means at least in circumstances where the securities were also marketed here and,as the district court noted,the defendant contemplated and acted to encourage investment by united states persons the clause is satisfied.see antares aircraft,at.
sk fund advances three primary arguments against our conclusion,none of which is persuasive.first,sk fund emphasizes that the plaintiffs other than gliksberg and the kibliskys are not american,and therefore could not have been injured in the united states by sk fund alleged misrepresentations.the import of this argument is not entirely clear perhaps sk fund means to suggest that fsia immunity must be overcome on a basis,so that even if sk fund misrepresentations had a direct effect on gliksberg and the kibliskys in the united states,the other plaintiffs claims would have to be dismissed.regardless,the premise of sk fund argument that plaintiffs must demonstrate a direct effect on themselves in the united states to overcome fsia immunity is incorrect the fsia requires only that sk fund alleged misrepresentations had a direct effect in the united states.in other words,had all of the plaintiffs been foreigners,they could have successfully premised fsia jurisdiction on the effect that sk fund alleged misrepresentations had on united states investors,provided that plaintiffs could adequately establish the existence of united states investors so affected.verlinden central bank of nigeria,noting that the fsia allow s a foreign plaintiff to sue a foreign sovereign in the courts of the united states,provided the substantive requirements of the act are satisfied.
this conclusion that an fsia plaintiff need only show a direct effect on someone in the united states,plaintiff or not follows directly from the text of the clause,which provides that a foreign state is not immune from jurisdiction where the action is based upon an act outside the territory of the united states and that act causes a direct effect in the united states.a emphasis added.simply put,the statute says that the act on which the plaintiff claims are based must have had a domestic effect,not that the plaintiff claims must be based upon the act domestic effect.our case law,moreover,confirms this understanding of the fsia text.in rafidain bank,a kuwaiti bank sued two iraqi banks for breaching certain loan agreements.this court found jurisdiction under the clause based on the defendants of funds into the united states,even though the united states was not the place of performance of any contractual obligations owed to the plaintiff because the payments were to be made not directly to the plaintiff but to new york bank accounts held by the lead banks of the various lending syndicates in which the plaintiff participated.id.at.we explained that t he focus of a is the activity of the sovereign,not the location of the plaintiff if the sovereign activity is commercial in nature and has a direct effect in the united states,then the jurisdictional nexus is met,no immunity attaches,and a district court has the authority to adjudicate disputes based on that activity.id.at.for these reasons,the fact that plaintiffs here have shown a direct effect on gliksberg and the kibliskys in the united states is more than sufficient to satisfy the clause with respect to plaintiffs entire lawsuit.
next,sk fund suggests that a financial loss to american investors can not qualify as a direct effect for fsia purposes.we reject this argument,which rests on a misreading of our precedents.in contract cases,fsia jurisdiction is often premised on a financial loss,see,weltover,at money that was supposed to have been delivered to a new york bank for deposit was not forthcoming,and tort cases are no different.
to be sure,we have said that the fact that an american individual or firm suffers some financial loss from a foreign tort can not,standing alone,suffice to trigger the fsia clause.antares aircraft,at emphasis added.thus,where an american citizen suffered a personal injury abroad at the hands of a foreign state and returned to this country permanently disabled,we held that his ongoing disability was not a direct effect of the foreign state actions,given that his initial injury occurred abroad.see martin republic of south africa,cir accord,princz federal republic of germany,d.the lingering effects of a personal injury suffered overseas can not be sufficient to satisfy the direct effect requirement of the fsia.see also first restatement note w hen a person sustains bodily harm,the place of wrong is the place where the harmful force takes effect upon the body.similarly,where an american firm airplane was detained by a foreign state in that state own territory,we held that the resulting financial damage to the firm in the united states was not a direct effect,since the locus of the tort the place where the airplane was detained was in a foreign country.antares aircraft,at accord,westfield federal republic of germany,cir holding that the third reich conversion of plaintiff art in germany did not have a direct effect in the united states first restatement note when harm is caused to land or chattels,the place of wrong is the place where the force takes effect on the thing.and,where an american citizen was allegedly defrauded by a foreign state in its own territory,we held that her being forced to live in much reduced circumstances upon returning to the united states was not a direct effect in that case,too,the plaintiff initial injury was suffered and the alleged tort itself was therefore completed outside this country borders.guirlando ziraat bankasi,cir.
but in all of those cases,unlike in this one,the initial injury caused by the defendant allegedly tortious conduct occurred in a foreign country,not in the united is,those cases all involved foreign tort s.antares aircraft,at.this distinction is critical.where an american plaintiff is injured abroad,it will often be easy for the plaintiff to cite some downstream financial harm suffered in the united states where the plaintiff lives or is headquartered,and in those circumstances,courts must take care to distinguish the initial injury caused by the defendant allegedly tortious conduct from the less immediate downstream consequences of that injury otherwise,the commercial activity exception would in large part eviscerate the fsia provision of immunity for foreign states.see united world trade,mangyshlakneft oil prod.ass n,cir congress did not intend to provide jurisdiction whenever the ripples caused by an overseas transaction manage eventually to reach the shores of the united states.here,by contrast,for gliksberg and the kibliskys as well as for other united states investors who bought subordinated notes in reliance on sk fund misrepresentations,the financial loss suffered when their investments declined in value was their initial injury.in cases where the plaintiff initial injury occurs in the united states that is,where this country is the locus of the tort there is no reason why that initial injury should not count as a direct effect merely because it happens to take the form of a financial loss.
because united states investors in the subordinated notes were initially injured in this country rather than abroad by sk fund alleged tortious conduct,this case resembles cases against foreign states more than it does the cases cited by sk fund involving foreign torts.in cases,courts have consistently held that the clause is satisfied by allegations that a plaintiff was injured in the united states by a faulty product manufactured by the defendant abroad.see lyon agusta,cir aldy ex rel.aldy valmet paper,cir vermeulen renault,cir rote zel custom,llc,cv,wl,at,see also first restatement note w hen a person sustains bodily harm,the place of wrong is the place where the harmful force takes effect upon the body.this persuasive authority lends additional support to our conclusion that sk fund alleged misrepresentations caused a direct effect in the united states.
finally,sk fund argues that the relationship between its alleged misrepresentations and plaintiffs financial loss is too attenuated for that loss to qualify as a direct effect.in particular,sk fund argues that united states investors in the subordinated notes including gliksberg and the kibliskys could only have obtained the information memorandum containing sk fund alleged misrepresentations from intermediar ies such as ubs,whose conduct in forwarding the document to investors was an intervening act between the commercial activity and any resulting effect in the united states.appellant br.at.this argument,too,is unavailing.
the intervening actions of a third party may sometimes break the causal chain between a defendant allegedly tortious actions and an effect felt in the united states rendering the effect in this country not direct where the defendant actions affect the third party,who in turn takes some independent action that causes a further effect in the united states.see virtual countries,at.in virtual countries,the republic of south africa issued a press release suggesting that it might contest an american company ownership of a web domain name the company claimed that this press release had a direct effect in the united states by discouraging third parties to do business with and invest in it.we held that this effect was not direct because it fell at the end of a long chain of causation and was mediated by numerous actions by third parties 
first,the republic issued the press release.then wire services and newspapers in south africa and elsewhere obtained the release and wrote articles about it.current or potential investors perhaps in the united states,perhaps in other countries,and perhaps in both and a potential strategic business partner in south africa,allegedly then learned of the release contents.drawing on news reports,they then formed their own independent assessments of the republic intentions and the possible effect of those intentions on the plaintiff company and people who would do business with it only then could investors and the prospective business partner have decided to give effect to their doubts as to the validity of the plaintiff current registration of the domain name and their fears of reprisal by the republic,by declining to invest in or do business with the plaintiff company.
id.at.thus,the press release after being communicated through press outlets had its initial effect on third party investors and business partners,who had to take further action as a result of the press release in order for the american plaintiff to be affected at all 
this case is different.here,the conduct cited by sk fund ubs distribution of the information memorandum was not in any sense undertaken in reliance on or as a result of sk fund alleged misrepresentations specifically.in other words,intermediaries such as ubs would have distributed the information memorandum regardless of whether it contained misrepresentations about bta bank financial situation,so that the conduct of such intermediaries can not have been an effect of any such misrepresentations.nor was it ubs distribution of the information memorandum as distinguished from the misrepresentations themselves that ultimately caused plaintiffs injury.unlike the press release in virtual countries,sk fund misrepresentations acted directly on those whom they allegedly affected,namely,the investors induced to purchase subordinated notes that were worth less than advertised.
again,cases furnish a helpful analogy.although a defective product may reach the plaintiff only through a long sequence of sales and shipments,that sequence does not attenuate the causal chain between the manufacturing defect and the plaintiff injury because the sequence is in no way a function of the defect.see,vermeulen,at t he injuries plaintiff suffered in an automobile accident on the roads of georgia were the result of defendant negligent design and manufacture of the lecar passenger restraint system.we can hardly imagine a more immediate consequence of the defendant activity.lyon,at finding fsia jurisdiction while recognizing that much time passed between the manufacture and the injury and that the defective aircraft even changed hands.likewise,the fact that a misrepresentation reaches an investor in an offering document distributed by a third party does not attenuate the causal chain between the misrepresentation and the investor loss.
although it bears reiterating that an effect need not be foreseeable to be direct,see weltover,at,we do not intend to indeed,we have no occasion to foreclose entirely the possibility that an alleged misstatement by a foreign state may be so far removed from the american investor who eventually relies on it that fsia jurisdiction will not lie.see,filler hanvit bank,d,finding no fsia jurisdiction over claims against korean banks that made alleged misstatements about their finances in korea,which were then incorporated into audit reports prepared by a belgian company doing business with the banks,and which were later sent to and relied upon by the plaintiffs in investing in the belgian company,vacated on other grounds,cv,cv,wl,at july.here,however,plaintiffs allege,and sk fund does not dispute,that bta bank and sk fund marketed the subordinated notes extensively in the united states,and directed that marketing to investors.gliksberg and the kibliskys placed their orders with ubs,which was a direct participant in the restructuring,and the parties to the restructuring contemplated that direct participants would be able to hold the newly issued securities for the benefit of their customers,including accredited investors in the united states.given that investors in securities offerings frequently make their purchases through underwriters who distribute offering documents on behalf of the issuer,adopting sk fund argument that ubs actions broke the causal chain between sk fund misrepresentations and the losses suffered by united states investors could effectively result in near blanket immunity for foreign states against claims.we do not believe that such a result would be consistent with,much less required by,our
