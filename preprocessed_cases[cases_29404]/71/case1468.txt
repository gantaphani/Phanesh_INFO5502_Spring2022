the issue on this appeal is what remedy is appropriate in a short form merger under,where the corporation minority stockholders are involuntarily cashed out without being furnished the factual information material to an informed shareholder decision whether or not to seek appraisal.the court of chancery held that because the notice of merger did not disclose those material facts,the minority shareholders were entitled to a remedy,wherein those shareholders who elect appraisal must opt in to the proceeding and escrow a portion of the merger proceeds they received.we conclude that although the court of chancery correctly found that the majority stockholder had violated its disclosure duty,the court erred as a matter of law in prescribing this specific form of remedy.
under glassman unocal exploration corporation the exclusive remedy for minority shareholders who challenge a short form merger is a statutory appraisal,provided that there is no fraud or illegality,and that all facts are disclosed that would enable the shareholders to decide whether to accept the merger price or seek appraisal.but where,as here,the material facts are not disclosed,the controlling stockholder forfeits the benefit of that limited review and exclusive remedy,and the minority shareholders become entitled to participate in a class action to recover the difference between fair value and the merger price without having to opt in to that proceeding or to escrow any merger proceeds that they received.because the trial court declined to order that remedy,we must reverse.
factual and procedural background 
the facts pivotal to this appeal,all drawn from the court of chancery opinion deciding cross motions for summary judgment,are undisputed pubco corporation pubco or the company is a delaware corporation whose common shares were not publicly traded.over percent of pubco shares were owned by defendant robert kanner,who was pubco president and sole director.the plaintiff,barbara berger,was a pubco minority shareholder.
sometime before october,kanner decided that pubco should go private.as the owner of over of pubco outstanding shares,kanner was legally entitled to effect a short form merger under.because that short form procedure is available only to corporate controlling shareholders kanner formed a shell subsidiary,pubco acquisition,and transferred his pubco shares to that entity to effect the merger.in that merger,which took place on october,pubco minority stockholders received cash per share.
under the short form merger statute,the only relevant corporate action required to effect a short term merger is for the board of directors of the parent corporation to adopt a resolution approving a certificate of merger,and to furnish the minority shareholders a notice advising that the merger has occurred and that they are entitled to seek an appraisal under.section requires that the notice include a copy of the appraisal statute,and delaware case law requires the parent company to disclose in the notice of merger all information material to shareholders deciding whether or not to seek appraisal 
in november,the plaintiff received a written notice the notice from pubco,advising that pubco controlling shareholder had effected a short form merger and that the plaintiff and the other minority stockholders were being cashed out for per share.the notice explained that shareholder approval was not required for the merger to become effective,and that the minority stockholders had the right to seek an appraisal.the notice also disclosed some information about the nature of pubco business,the names of its officers and directors,the number of its shares and classes of stock,a description of related business transactions,and copies of pubco most recent interim and annual unaudited financial statements.the notice also disclosed that pubco stock,although not publicly traded,was sporadically traded,and that in the months preceding the merger there were thirty open market trades that ranged in price from to per share,at an average price of.finally,the notice provided telephone,fax and contact information where shareholders could request and obtain additional information.
in its summary judgment opinion,the court of chancery found that except for the financial statements,the disclosures in the notice provided no significant detail.for example,the description of the company comprised only five sentences,one of which vaguely stated that t he company owns other income producing assets.no disclosures relating to the company plans or prospects were made,nor was there any meaningful discussion of pubco actual operations or disclosure of its finances by division or line of business.rather,the unaudited financial statements lumped all of the company operations together.the financial statements did indicate that pubco held a sizeable amount of cash and securities,but did not explain how those assets were,or would be,utilized.finally,the notice contained no disclosure of how kanner had determined the per share merger price that he unilaterally had set.
as our law required,the company attached to the notice a copy of the appraisal statute,but the copy attached was outdated and,therefore,incorrect.the appraisal statute had been updated by changes that became effective in august months before the notice was sent to the version attached to the notice did not reflect those changes.pubco never sent a corrected copy of the updated appraisal statute to its former minority stockholders.
on december,the plaintiff initiated this lawsuit as a class action on behalf of all pubco minority stockholders,claiming that the class is entitled to receive the difference between the per share paid to each class member and the fair value of his or her shares,irrespective of whether any class member demanded appraisal.pubco and kanner then moved to dismiss the complaint under court of chancery rule b.the plaintiff responded to that motion,and simultaneously filed an opening brief in support of her for summary judgment under court of chancery rule.thereafter,the defendants abandoned their motion to dismiss,and filed a for summary judgment.briefing on the was completed on april,and the court of chancery handed down its memorandum opinion on may,granting the in part and denying them in part.the rulings in that opinion were embodied in a final order and judgment entered on july.
the court of chancery opinion 
in its opinion,the court of chancery addressed two issues.they were whether the notice contained material misstatements or omissions that constituted disclosure violations,and if so,what was the appropriate remedy.
the court found two separate disclosure violations.the first,which was not contested,is that the wrong version of the appraisal statute had been attached to the notice.that violated the delaware appraisal statute which explicitly requires its inclusion in any notice of a merger giving rise to appraisal rights.the second violation,which was disputed,was that the notice did not disclose how kanner set the per share price.the defendants argued that that nondisclosure was not material,because kanner could have used whatever valuation methodology he desired,including even rolling the dice.rejecting that argument,the trial court held 
defendants argue that it can not be material,because in a short form merger the parent has no obligation to set a fair price and,therefore,has no obligation to explain how or why the price set is fair because kanner did not have to set a fair price and,therefore,could have used any matter how set the merger consideration,defendants argue that disclosure of kanner methodology is unnecessary.
defendants argument entirely misses the mark,however,because the issue is not about is about materiality.in the context of pubco,an unregistered company that made no public filings and whose notice was relatively terse and short on details,the method by which kanner set the merger consideration is a fact that is substantially likely to alter the total mix of information available to the minority stockholders.where,as here,a minority shareholder needs to decide only whether to accept the merger consideration or to seek appraisal,the question is partially one of trust can the minority shareholder trust that the price offered is good enough,or does it likely undervalue the company so significantly that appraisal is a worthwhile endeavor when faced with such a question,it would be material to know that the price offered was set by arbitrarily rolling dice.in a situation like pubco,where so little information is available about the company,such a disclosure would significantly change the landscape with respect to the decision of whether or not to trust the price offered by the parent.this does not mean that kanner should have provided picayune details about the process he used to set the price it simply means he should have disclosed in a broad sense what the process was,assuming he followed a process at all and did not simply choose a number randomly 
having adjudicated these disclosure violations,the court of chancery next considered the question of remedy.the court reasoned that in a short form merger,rescissory remedies,rescission or rescissory damages are unavailable for disclosure violations,because under section a short form merger becomes effective before any disclosures to the minority stockholders are made.instead,therefore,minority shareholders have a statutory right to appraisal in a merger under section,so a proper remedy would preserve that right such a remedy is a.the issue flowing from that ruling,which the parties hotly disputed,was what the content of that remedy should be.
each side advocated a different form of and relied upon one or both of two court of chancery decisions that involved disclosure violations in short form,mergers.the plaintiff relied upon nebel southwest,a decision.in nebel,the court determined that the appropriate remedy for the adjudicated disclosure violation was that the minority shareholders should receive the difference between the merger consideration and the fair value of their shares,to be determined in a parallel appraisal proceeding in which the shareholders were not required to opt in.the defendants advocated the remedy awarded in gilliland motorola,a decision where the court attempted to mirror as best as possible the statutory appraisal remedy,by requiring the minority shareholders seeking that remedy to opt in and to escrow a portion of the merger consideration they received 
in the instant case,the court of chancery concluded that the remedy should be modeled upon that previously awarded in gilliland 
the remedy fashioned in gilliland attempted to mirror as best as possible the statutory appraisal remedy.because i agree that nebel does not directly address the issue of defining the contours of the remedy,and because i believe the gilliland approach wisely follows the general assembly instructions by patterning itself after the statute,i conclude this case is governed by gilliland 
the court directed the parties to submit an order calling for a remedy based on the gilliland decision,and that should require four things 
first,pubco must make supplemental disclosures to address the violations discussed above namely,pubco must disclose the method,if any,used by kanner to set the merger consideration and must include a correct and current copy of the appraisal statute.second,the order should require minority stockholders to make a choice to participate in the action,in order to replicate the situation they would have faced if they had received proper notice.as in gilliland,these procedures will not be as stringent as those under the statute,and stockholders seeking to will need to provide only proof of beneficial ownership of the pubco shares on the merger date.third,this action should be structured to replicate a modicum of the risk that would inhere if this were an actual appraisal action,the risk that the court will appraise pubco at less than per share and the dissenting stockholders will receive less than the merger consideration finally,the order should then call for a valuation of the pubco shares as of the date of the merger using the method prescribed by the appraisal statute.
these requirements were embodied in a final order and judgment entered by the court of chancery on july,from which the plaintiff has timely appealed.
a.the claims,issues,and standard of review 
because the plaintiff challenges a short form merger under section,the starting point for analysis is glassman which holds that in a merger there is no entire fairness review and that the exclusive remedy is a statutory appraisal.glassman cautions,however,that those limited review and exclusive remedy protections are not absolute or unqualified.they are available only absent fraud or illegality.moreover,a lthough fiduciaries are not required to establish entire fairness in a merger,the duty of full disclosure remains where the only choice for the minority stockholders is whether to accept the merger consideration or seek appraisal,they must be given all the factual information that is material to that decision.
the question not reached,and therefore not addressed,by glassman is what consequence should flow where the fiduciary fails to observe its duty of full disclosure that is the only issue before us and it is one of first impression 
the court of chancery held that where minority shareholders who are cashed out in a short form merger are deprived of information material to deciding whether or not to seek appraisal,they are entitled to a remedy with the following features.first,the shareholders must be furnished the material information of which they were deprived.second,the shareholders must then be afforded an opportunity to choose whether or not to participate in an action to determine the fair value of their shares.third,shareholders who choose to participate must formally opt in to the proceeding and place into escrow a prescribed portion of the merger consideration that they received.paraphrasing gilliland,the court of chancery identified the purpose of the escrow requirement as to replicate a modicum of the risk that would inhere if the proceeding were an actual appraisal 
on appeal,the does not contest the supplemental disclosure requirement of the order awarding the remedy,only its opt in and escrow features.the appellant claims that as a matter of law,all minority shareholders should have been treated as members of a class entitled to seek the recovery,without being burdened by any precondition or requirement that they opt in or escrow any portion of the merger proceeds paid to them.that,the plaintiff contends,is the only proper application of both glassman and the short form merger statute.
the,not surprisingly,take the opposite position.they contend that the adjudicated remedy,modeled after the court of chancery earlier gilliland decision,is the only outcome that properly implements the policies which underlie the delaware appraisal statute and animate the rulings in glassman.
because the court of chancery has broad discretion to craft an appropriate remedy for a fiduciary violation the propriety of a remedy is ordinarily reviewed for abuse of discretion.here,however,the appellant claims that the disputed remedy was erroneous as a matter of law,because the trial court erred in formulating or applying legal principles and in granting summary judgment to the defendants a claim of that kind is one that we review de novo 
discussion 
the remedial alternatives 
to repeat,the issue presented here is in a short form merger where the exclusive remedy is an appraisal,what is the consequence of the controlling stockholder failure to disclose the facts material to an informed shareholder decision whether or not to elect that exclusive remedy in the abstract,four possible alternatives present themselves,of which only two are advocated by either side.the remaining two alternatives are advocated by no party.we nonetheless identify and consider them,because to do otherwise would render our analysis truncated and incomplete.
the alternatives advocated by each side,respectively,are the two forms of remedy earlier described.the defendants argued,and the court of chancery agreed,that the appropriate remedy is the ordered in gilliland.under that remedial structure,fully informed minority shareholders who opt in and place into escrow a portion of the consideration they received may prosecute an action to recover the difference between adjudicated fair value and the merger consideration.the plaintiff advocated the second alternative form of class action to recover the difference between fair value and the merger consideration,wherein the minority shareholders are automatically treated as members of the class with no obligation to opt in or to escrow any portion of the merger consideration.under either structure,the only issue being litigated would be the appraised fair value of the corporation on the date of the merger,applying established corporate valuation principles 
of the remaining two remedial alternatives those advocated by neither side,the first would be a replicated appraisal proceeding that would duplicate the precise sequence of events and requirements of the appraisal statute.under the replicated appraisal approach,the minority shareholders would receive in a supplemental disclosure all information material to making an informed decision whether to elect appraisal.shareholders who elect appraisal would then make a formal demand for appraisal and remit to the corporation their stock certificates and the entire merger consideration that they received.thereafter,the corporation would have the opportunity,as contemplated by the appraisal statute,to attempt to reach a settlement with the appraisal claimants.where no settlement is reached,a formal appraisal action could then be commenced by the dissenting shareholders or by the corporation.
under the fourth alternative also not advocated by either side,there would be no remedial appraisal proceeding at all.rather,the consequence of the fiduciary adjudicated failure to disclose material facts would be to render glassman inapplicable.as a result,the remedy would be the same as in a long form cash out merger under.shareholder class action for breach of fiduciary duty,where the legality of the merger and the liability of the controlling stockholder fiduciaries are determined under the traditional entire fairness review standard 
selecting the most appropriate alternative 
the four alternative possibilities having been identified,the question then becomes which remedy is the most one ordered by the court of chancery or one of the three alternative forms to decide that issue,we must first answer a predicate question by what analytical standard do we determine which remedial alternative is optimal we conclude that the optimal alternative would be the remedy that best effectuates the policies underlying the short form merger statute section,the appraisal statute section and the glassman decision,taking into account considerations of practicality of implementation and fairness to the litigants.a reasoned application of that standard permits the remedial alternatives to be ranked in an objective and transparent way.
applying that standard leads us to conclude that the fourth alternative would merit the lowest priority.under that alternative,a violation of the disclosure requirement would render glassman inapplicable and deprive the majority stockholder fiduciary of the benefit of glassman limited review and exclusive remedy.in that setting to reiterate,the minority shareholders would be entitled to the same remedies as are available in a fiduciary duty class action challenging a long form merger.
the strongest argument favoring this approach would run as follows under glassman,full disclosure of all material facts is a necessary condition for the fiduciary to enjoy glassman limited review and exclusive appraisal remedy.therefore,a violation of that disclosure condition should deprive the fiduciary of those benefits.that argument,although unassailable in terms of logic and equity is flawed in one highly important respect.to accept it would disregard the intent of the general assembly,as described in glassman and stauffer standard brands,incorporated that in a legally valid,short form merger the minority shareholders remedy should be limited to an appraisal.moreover,validating such an approach would disserve the purpose of glassman disclosure requirement,which is to enable the minority stockholders to make an informed decision whether or not to seek an appraisal.a remedy that sidesteps appraisal altogether would frustrate that purpose.
unlike this approach,the remaining three alternative remedies would give effect albeit in varying degrees to that legislative intent.therefore,in the hierarchy those alternative remedies should rank above the one that abjures appraisal.
that observation brings into focus a second replicated appraisal remedy that would duplicate precisely the sequence of events and requirements of the appraisal statute.under that approach,the minority shareholders would receive a supplemental disclosure,to enable them to make an informed decision whether or not to elect an appraisal.shareholders who elect that remedy must then make a formal demand for an appraisal,and then remit to the corporation their stock certificates and all the merger consideration they received.
this approach would place the minority shareholders in the situation they would find themselves had they received proper disclosure to begin with.the strongest argument favoring this alternative is that it would give maximum effect to the legislative intent recognized in glassman.the flaw of this approach,however,is that it would effectuate that legislative intent at an unacceptable cost measured in terms of practicality of application and fairness to the minority.in gilliland,the court of chancery so recognized,implicitly acknowledging the impracticality of such an approach by refusing to order a replicated appraisal remedy 
the procedures to be followed,however,will not be as stringent as those under the statute.for example,the court will not require beneficial or street name owners to demand through their record holder.the court is concerned that,given the substantial passage of time since the merger,it would be difficult for stockholders to secure the cooperation of the former record holders or nominees needed to perfect demand in accordance with the statute.instead,stockholders seeking to will need to provide only proof of beneficial ownership of their shares on the merger date 
the gilliland court also recognized again,implicitly that it would be unfair to require shareholders who desire an appraisal to remit the entire merger consideration they received to the corporation,as would occur in a replicated appraisal.instead,the court required only that those stockholders who choose to participate in the action to pay into escrow a portion of the merger consideration they have already received.the gilliland court thereby acknowledged the unfairness of requiring the minority stockholders to bear the risk of the corporation creditworthiness,which would result from their having to pay back a portion of the merger proceeds to the company.instead,the court ordered that the proceeds be placed into an escrow account,with the escrowed funds representing only a portion of the merger consideration the minority actually received.
implicit in the gilliland remedy is the recognition that it is unfair to the minority shareholders,on whose behalf significant litigation expense and effort were successfully devoted,to limit their relief to requiring the fiduciary merely to fulfill the disclosure obligation it had all along.a remedy limited to awarding a second statutory appraisal would deny the minority any credit for that expense and effort,after having been forced to prosecute that litigation solely because the controlling shareholder had violated its fiduciary duty.a replicated appraisal remedy would also give controlling shareholders little incentive to observe their disclosure duty in future cases,since the cost of the remedy to the controllers would be negligible.both in gilliland and in this case the court of chancery eschewed that approach,concluding instead that the appropriate remedy should be a quasi appraisal.both parties agree with that co
