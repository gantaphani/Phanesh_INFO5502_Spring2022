we must decide whether a material misrepresentation in a prospectus caused actionable loss to shareholders when the price of the company stock did not decline in the weeks immediately following disclosure of the correct information.
section a of the securities act of imposes civil liability on any person who offers or sells a security by the use of any means or instruments in interstate commerce by means of a prospectus or oral communication,which includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements not misleading.l a.accordingly,to prevail under section a,a plaintiff must demonstrate an offer or sale of a security,by the use of a means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,by means of a prospectus or oral communication,that includes an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state a material fact that is necessary to make the statements not misleading by any person.miller thane int l,cir,amending cir.the act defines person to include individuals and corporations.a.additionally,e very person who,by or through stock ownership,agency,or otherwise controls any person liable under section a shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such controlled person.id.
section liability may be avoided by way of an affirmative defense of lack of loss causation.the statute provides that if a person proves that any portion or all of the amount recoverable under subsection a of this section represents other than the depreciation in value of the subject security resulting from such part of the prospectus or oral communication not being true or omitting to state a material fact then such portion or amount shall not be recoverable.b.consequently,a section defendant is liable only for depreciation that results directly from the misrepresentation at issue.miller,at.
with the relevant statutory framework in mind,we turn now to the facts of this case.in november,defendant thane international,thane,a company that markets consumer products through homeshopping channels,infomercials,and other similar means,and reliant interactive media reliant agreed to merge.the merger agreement provided for reliant shareholders to receive shares of thane for their shares of reliant.the imputed merger price the value of reliant stock each reliant shareholder exchanged for each thane approximately.significantly,the prospectus thane filed with the securities and exchange commission sec stated that thane stock,which had not been publicly traded previously,was approved for quotation and trading on the nasdaq national market upon completion of the merger,subject to thane compliance with the minimum bid price requirements of per share.nevertheless,after the merger was consummated on may,thane shares commenced trading not on the nasdaq national market system nms,but on the nasdaq bulletin board otcbb.
in the nineteen days twelve trading days between may and june,thane shares traded between and,above the merger price that reliant shareholders had paid.on june,however,the stock closed at.the next day thane reported disappointing earnings for the fiscal year,and the stock closed at.it soon thereafter dropped below,never to rise again above that minimum price for listing on the nms.
on august,thane announced further disappointing quarterly earnings,partly caused by a slump in the industry.it also reported that it had originally delayed listing on the nms in order to time it with a secondary public offering,but that recent business developments had put listing on the nms on hold.thane shares tumbled to by august.in february,thane bought out existing shareholders at a price of per share.
in september,a class of individual reliant investors who acquired shares of thane in the merger investors filed suit against thane and four of its executives collectively,thane in federal district court,alleging violation of section a of the securities act of,a,and control person liability under section of the securities act of,id,and seeking rescission of the merger,recovery of damages,and fees.specifically,the investors alleged that thane prospectus contained materially misleading representations because it implied that thane shares would list on the nms.
after certifying the investors class and conducting a bench trial,the district court held that thane did not violate section a.miller thane int l,d.the court found that the prospectus did not contain misleading representations,id.at,and that even if it did,any misleading representations were not material because thane stock price did not depreciate below the merger price after the market became aware of the truth,id.at.
in a prior appeal,we reversed,ruling that the district court clearly erred.miller,at miller i.in our view,the prospectus contained statements that,although literally true,constituted misleading representations regarding where thane stock would list.id.at.moreover,we held that those representations were material because a reasonable investor would have wanted to know that thane stock would be listed on the otcbb instead of the nms in light of the advantages associated with the latter market.id.at.even though there were materially misleading representations,however,we recognized that thane could still prevail by establishing the affirmative defense of lack of loss causation.see b.without expressing any opinion as to the strength of thane argument,we remand ed to the district court to address the issue of loss causation in the first instance,and to conduct other proceedings as appropriate.miller i,at.
on remand,the district court granted thane motion for judgment on loss causation.the district court observed that there could be no loss as long as thane stock price remained at or above the price of that the investors had paid for the stock in the merger and that,consequently,there could be no loss causation if the stock price did not drop below after reacting to the nonlisting on the nms.the stock remained at or above that price for nineteen days.accordingly,the district court focused on whether the stock price impounded,absorbed the nonlisting on nms in this period.it held that thane had carried its burden to show that the stock did so.the investor class timely appealed.
in this second appeal,the investors advance two arguments that the district court erred as a matter of law in finding an absence of loss causation.
the investors first argue that the district court award of judgment to thane on loss causation is foreclosed by miller i.in their view,our holding in the investors favor on materiality forecloses an award of judgment to thane on loss causation.
but loss causation and materiality are different concepts in the statutory scheme.indeed,the statute provides a loss causation defense even when there are materially misleading representations.b.if a ruling on materiality foreclosed an affirmative defense of loss causation,that affirmative defense would be,as thane correctly recognizes,a nullity.
moreover,the materiality inquiry concerns whether a reasonable investor would consider a particular misstatement important.miller i,at discussing reasonable investor test for materiality in a section a claim see tsc,northway.it is hypothetical and objective.basic levinson.by contrast,the loss causation inquiry assesses whether a particular misstatement actually resulted in loss.miller i,at.it is historical and.see lane page,d,contrasting ex post causation and ex ante materiality assessments.in any event,our remand to determine loss causation in the first instance would not have made sense if a particular ruling on loss causation were foreclosed.miller i,at.
in re gilead sciences securities litigation,cir,is fully consistent with this framework.in that case,we reversed the dismissal of a securities claim,rejecting the district court view that a temporal gap between a misrepresentation and a drop in stock price rendered loss causation per se implausible.id.at.relying on an observation in a prior case on materiality,we explained that markets are sometimes not immediately responsive to misrepresentations.id.citing joint council pension trust f
