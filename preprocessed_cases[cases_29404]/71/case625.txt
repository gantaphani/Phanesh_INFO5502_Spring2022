gregory setser appeals his convictions,and deborah setser her sentence,on multiple counts stemming from a dollar ponzi scheme.finding no reversible error,we affirm.
gregory and deborah setser,who are siblings,were convicted of involvement in a ponzi scheme focused on soliciting funds from christian groups for largely mythical deals involving real estate and retail products.as in a classic ponzi scheme,as new investments came in eventually totaling million,some of the new money was used to pay earlier investors.the for the personal use of the setsers and their was shown to be about million.
gregory setser was in overall charge.he operated a company called ipic.he told potential investors that ipic business model was to buy a wide variety of products cheaply overseas and resell them to retailers or governments at a profit.deborah setser involvement was focused on an entity called the home recovery network hrn,which purported to deal in real estate.the scheme ground to a halt in november,when ipic was shut down and the setsers were arrested.investors suffered substantial losses.
at trial,the government presented evidence that the company did little legitimate business,buying only enough products to convince curious investors of the enterprise legitimacy.
the sec and fbi began parallel civil and criminal investigations of ipic in august.the sec initiated a civil action against ipic,hrn,and the setsers on november.alleged were violations of the securities laws.appointment of a receiver to preserve the defendants assets was requested.the district court appointed dennis roossien as receiver.he was granted the authority to enter and secure any premises of the defendants in order to take possession,custody,or control of their assets.
on november,eleven days before the civil suit was filed,a grand jury returned a sealed indictment against the setsers and three other defendants.on november,the day after the filing of the civil suit,the indictment was unsealed and the defendants arrested.after the arrests,the receiver and his agents entered ipic offices and seized various assets.many records were later turned over to law enforcement agents with the permission of the receiver.
the district court denied a motion to suppress this evidence.the setsers argued that the receiver was acting as an agent of the fbi and irs criminal investigators.though there was no search warrant,the district court found that the receiver had seized only the documents covered by the receivership order.properly having possession,the receiver could give documents to the fbi.
after a jury trial,both defendants were convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud,in violation of securities fraud,in violation of a and conspiracy to commit money laundering,in violation of h and money laundering,in violation of section a a.gregory setser was also convicted of ten counts of substantive wire fraud,in violation of one count of substantive mail fraud,in violation of section and five additional counts of money laundering.the jury acquitted deborah setser on the additional money laundering counts.the court granted both defendants judgments of acquittal with respect to two mail fraud counts.
deborah setser received a range sentence of three terms and one term,to be served concurrently.gregory setser was sentenced to serve multiple concurrent terms,a consecutive term for the securities fraud count,and another consecutive term for one of the money laundering counts.his total was years imprisonment.
discussion 
gregory setser order and search 
when we review the denial of a motion to suppress,factual findings are examined for clear error whether the law enforcement action was constitutional is considered de novo.united states stevens,cir.evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,which on this issue was the government.id.
there are three parts to setser allegations of improper conduct with regard to the receivership order the receivership order failed to comply with the fourth amendment particularity requirement,making it an impermissible general warrant the receiver nonetheless exceeded his authority by seizing documents completely unrelated to the purpose for which he was appointed and the receiver was late in posting his bond.
particularity requirement 
some fourth amendment protections apply to civil as well as criminal investigations.see franks smith,cir.a search warrant is to describe the place to be searched and the things to be seized with particularity.united states layne,cir.setser views the receivership order as the equivalent of a warrant,to which the particularity requirement must be applied.
while setser concedes that other cases have found,in his words,that a receiver may conduct a warrantless search of a premises,he argues that such cases are inapplicable here.he argues that a supreme court decision altered the previous understanding of receiver searches.see new york burger,d.in that case,the supreme court addressed the validity of a state regulatory scheme permitting warrantless inspections of automobile junkyards.the court applied what it called an established exception to the requirement of warrants,which was for government inspectors to search closely regulated businesses in certain circumstances.id.at.required was a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant,including giving the search a properly defined scope and limit ing the discretion of the inspecting officers.id.
receivers are not like the burger state inspectors.they,because of the nature of the regulated business,may be permitted on their own and without prior court approval to make broadly intrusive and unannounced inspections in order to assure compliance with the state rules.a receiver takes over property only after a court has agreed with the arguments and evidence that such a takeover is necessary.the burger requirement of a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant in some circumstances therefore does not add anything new to the prior rules for receivers.
two years before burger,we held that a receiver,who has properly come into possession of property,may turn the property over to law enforcement officials without a warrant.united states gray,cir.we did not discuss in gray the breadth of authority that may validly be given a receiver to seize property.setser alleges there are limits,and among them is something akin to the requirement that a search warrant provide specific guidance on what is and what is not within the scope of permissible search and seizure.setser acknowledges that no court has ever held that the equivalent of a warrant must be issued in order for a receiver to be permitted to seize the property of the subject entity.
one reason that particularity is not translatable to the receiver context is that once appointed,the receiver often takes possession of all property of the distressed or distrusted entity.that seizure of all assets on behalf of the court is a central purpose for the appointment of a receiver.the setser receivership order was an exercise of that broad authority 
this court hereby takes exclusive jurisdiction and possession of the assets,monies,securities,claims in action,and properties,real and personal,tangible and intangible,of whatever kind and description,wherever situated,of defendants and relief defendants receivership assets,and the books and records of the defendants and relief defendants receivership record.
setser is challenging the breadth of the receivership order itself.we have found no statutory or judicially created limits of the nature setser argues exist to a receiver right to seize assets.in fact,the statutory authority of a receiver appointed by the court is as broad as this receiver order 
a trustee,receiver,or manager appointed in any cause pending in any court of the united states,including a debtor in possession,shall manage and operate the property in his possession as such trustee,receiver or manager according to the requirements of the valid laws of the state in which such property is situated,in the same manner that the owner or possessor thereof would be bound to do if in possession thereof.
in conclusion,the receiver was authorized to seize all the named categories of assets and records of the identified defendants.because the receiver was taking possession of everything in those categories that had been the property of the defendants for whom the receivership was authorized,further particularity would have served no purpose.after the seizure,the receiver had possession of the property only because he had been authorized by court order.we find no basis to support the argument that more was needed.
scope of search under the receivership order 
setser next contends that even if the receivership order as written was valid,the receiver exceeded even the most expansive interpretation of the authority it granted by conducting a general,exploratory search and seizure of documents unrelated and inconsequential to the receivership.
he argues that many of the documents and items taken by the receiver,particularly those from various residences,exceeded the scope of the receiver mandate.citing the sec complaint,setser alleges the receiver could only marshal,conserve,protect and hold funds and assets of the defendants.in his view,the search went beyond the boundaries of a valid warrant and was presumptively unconstitutional,coolidge new hampshire,d stanley georgia,d.he quotes the testimony of one agent who assisted in the search to argue that the searchers were predisposed towards including,rather than excluding,documents from the search,that some documents taken were unrelated to the location or preservation of assets,and that documents were turned over to the fbi,in some cases,before anyone representing the receiver had viewed them at all.
as a remedy,setser suggests the suppression of all evidence against him because the search was conducted in flagrant disregard of the receivership order.see united states shi yan liu,cir.recognizing that this circuit has not adopted the flagrant disregard standard,he argues in the alternative that the evidence that was actually outside the scope of the receivership order must be suppressed.
setser does not identify the evidence that allegedly was seized outside the scope of the order and later admitted at trial.we do not rule in the abstract on questions of suppression.we must know what evidence was admitted in violation of some specifically identified right.see united states freeman,cir must specifically delineate how the introduction of the evidence affected the claim being made.setser response is that the scope of the receiver seizures and the massive amount of evidence introduced at trial made identification of specific illegal evidence impossible.he seeks a remand for hearings to determine what evidence was illegally seized.
setser alleges that the search led to seizing photographs,business brochures,videotapes,calendars,organizational charts,credit card bills,wedding invoices and letters of recommendation,and that search team members were instructed to retrieve information about how the ipic business was operated,putting the search beyond the parameters of simply preserving its assets.there apparently was a massive amount of evidence obtained and later introduced.yet we find no support that the evidence was anything other than what the receivership order allowed to be seized,which in summary were the properties,real and personal,tangible and intangible,of the defendants and their businesses.that seizure was necessary in order that the businesses could be operated.because of the manner in which these businesses had been operated,or at least as jurors became convinced they had been,seizure of relevant documents revealed substantial criminal activity.
at least at the level of practicality,we agree with setser that it would have been difficult to address in a pretrial motion to suppress the significant quantity of evidence that was seized and likely would be introduced.even in this appeal,though,we are satisfied that the evidence that convicted setser was incriminating because it reflected the criminal manner in which the businesses were operated,which also means the evidence was the kind of records and other property that the receiver had the authority to seize.absent any showing or meaningful suggestion of what evidence was introduced that might have been improperly acquired,we do not further pursue this issue.
delay in posting the receiver bond 
setser next argues that the receiver lacked authority to enter premises and seize documents because he did not post a required bond until after he had conducted the searches.see.the government does not dispute that a bond was not timely obtained.
setser cites a district court case as his primary authority for this proposition.warfield arpe,wl,at.there,a receiver did not timely file his order of appointment in a different state,a filing that became necessary once some of the assets were found to be present there.a statute provides that the failure to file such copies in any district shall divest the receiver of jurisdiction and control over all such property in that district.in warfield,the court upheld a new appointment and timely filing of the necessary papers to correct the defect.wl,at.
the statute in question in warfield also provides that upon giving bond as required by the court,the receiver is vested with the control of the property and a right to take possession.setser does not dispute the government claim that he never raised this issue at his criminal trial.thus,we at most review for plain error.even when there is error,the defect must seriously affect the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states olano,d internal quotation marks omitted.we can not find that the purely technical defect of the late but eventual obtaining of a bond in any way affects a substantial right,as no evidence was obtained and then introduced that could not later have been obtained and introduced after correcting the defect in the bond.
we therefore reject all of setser arguments that the search performed under the receivership order was invalid.
ii.gregory setser of law enforcement officials 
fourth amendment violation in search of property 
setser next argues that law enforcement officials violated his fourth amendment rights in their conduct after they took possession of records and assets from the receiver.he suggests that because the receiver lacked the authority to seize all the documents he took,law enforcement agents needed to obtain a warrant in order to review the information obtained from the receiver.
in our previously discussed gray opinion,we found that a property owner no longer had a reasonable expectation that those records would remain private once a court has appointed a receiver,and the receiver has taken custody of records under the authority given him.gray,at.there is,in other words,no violation of the fourth amendment for a receiver who is the lawful custodian of the records to turn them over to law enforcement agents,at their request.id.
though gray analysis is relatively brief,its logic is clear when read in conjunction with the statutes governing the appointment and conduct of receivers.a receiver is vested with complete jurisdiction and control of all such received property with the right to take possession thereof.a receiver shall manage and operate the property in his possession in the same manner that the owner or possessor thereof would be bound to do if in possession thereof.id.b.
understanding the receiver authority,we now examine what must be shown to establish a fourth amendment violation.a defendant must show that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the property searched.united states gomez,cir.the showing requires the defendant to prove an actual,subjective expectation of privacy,and that the expectation is one which society would recognize as reasonable.united states kye soo lee,cir.because the first factor simply examines whether a defendant actually expected privacy,which is not difficult to assert,the dispositive factor is almost always the second one.this second factor,the reasonableness of a privacy expectation,can be viewed from several practical perspectives 
whether the defendant has a possessory interest in the thing seized or the place searched,whether he has the right to exclude others from that place,whether he has exhibited a subjective expectation that it would remain free from governmental invasion,whether he took normal precautions to maintain his privacy and whether he was legitimately on the premises.
gomez,at quoting united states haydel,cir.unit a july.
we consider what occurred in the present case in terms of the list we just quoted from our precedents.once the receiver took possession of the property,setser possessory rights were lost.setser could neither exclude others from the seized property nor take precautions to maintain the privacy of the property.after appointment,the receiver was vested with complete jurisdiction and control of the property and had the right to take possession of it.the receiver was required to manage and operate the property in the same manner as its original owner.id.the receiver became the possessor,and as such could consent to the search of the seized documents,united states brigham,cir en banc.
we also find justification for what occurred from the fact that a receiver is to be appointed only after a prima facie showing of fraud and mismanagement.sec first fin.group of,cir.unit a may.it would make little sense to hold that setser continued to exercise veto power over the receiver uses of his property when the purpose of the receivership was to preserve assets from fraudulent depletion.
we conclude that after a receiver validly takes possession of records and other property,becoming their lawful custodian,the original owner has lost any reasonable expectation that those records would remain private.gray,at.accordingly,setser fourth amendment rights were not violated when the receiver turned over the property he seized from setser to law enforcement officials.
unlawful collusion 
setser would have us find that the government impermissibly mixed the receiver civil investigation with the criminal case against him.the purpose,setser argues,was to deprive him of the rights criminal defendants enjoy,while using more liberal civil discovery techniques to gain evidence for the criminal case.setser argues that because the governmental parties intentionally orchestrated their actions and manipulated the administration of criminal justice in order to secure documents and papers to be used in the criminal prosecution,the district court erred in refusing to suppress the evidence discovered in the receiver search and then turned over to the fbi.
setser asks this court to find that this behavior violated both the fourth amendment and his fifth amendment right to due process of law.he alleges that the proper remedy is either dismissal of the indictment or remand for a hearing on what evidence should have been suppressed.
setser argues that the government may not bring a parallel civil proceeding and avail itself of civil discovery devices to obtain evidence for subsequent criminal prosecution.united states parrott.the precedents on which he relies have a supreme court ruling as their source.see united states kordel,d.we examine that original authority,then turn to the more recent authorities.
in kordel,the court distinguished its facts from five situations in which a finding of a constitutional due process violation might be made 
we do not deal here with a case where the government has brought a civil action solely to obtain evidence for its criminal prosecution or has failed to advise the defendant in its civil proceeding that it contemplates his criminal prosecution nor with a case where the defendant is without counsel or reasonably fears prejudice from adverse pretrial publicity or other unfair injury nor with any other special circumstances that might suggest the unconstitutionality or even the impropriety of the criminal prosecution.
id.at.numbering added.
the precedents cited by setser involved situations in which one or more of these kordel situations existed.in one,the government coordinated a civil sec investigation with a criminal investigation and deceived the defendants into believing there was no criminal investigation.united states stringer,d,rev,cir,cert.denied,d,cert.denied,d,cert.denied,d.the district court had dismissed the indictment after finding that the government impermissibly develop ed a criminal investigation under the auspices of a civil investigation.id.at.after setser filed his opening brief in this case,the ninth circuit disagreed and reversed.the court of appeals relied on the fact that the sec made no affirmative misrepresentations to the defendants,disclosed the possibility of a criminal investigation on a form,and engaged in no tricks to deceive defendants.stringer,at.
in the other principal case relied on by setser,the trial court found that the government coordinated two investigations in a manner intended to mislead the defendants into believing there was no criminal investigation against them,including obtaining the defendants depositions in the civil investigation with the intent to create evidence against them in the criminal case.united states scrushy,d.in the court view,the government overall coordination of the investigations,and especially its apparent arrangement of a deposition in the civil case to create a perjury trap for criminal prosecution purposes,while not informing the defendant that any criminal investigation was under way,was such an impermissible departure.id.at.although the government did not outright lie to the defendant,it manipulated the inescapably intertwined investigations to an extent the district court found improper.id.
a recent decision by this circuit refused to find impermissible commingling of civil procedures involved in an interview conducted for possible naturalization of an immigrant and criminal investigations into that immigrant conduct.united states posada carriles,cir,cert.denied,d.we restated the fundamental point that the government may conduct simultaneous civil and criminal proceedings without violating the due process clause or otherwise departing from proper standards in administering justice.id.at.deception as to the purposes of the investigation,or using otherwise meaningless civil proceedings as a pretext for acquiring evidence for a criminal prosecution,taking advantage of a person who does not have counsel,or other special circumstances may invalidate the prosecution.id.
setser can point to no trickery or cloaking of the criminal investigation as civil.setser was not lured into any cooperation by the false premise that the investigation was purely civil.there is likewise no issue here,a common theme in the other cases.ultimately,setser argument fails on the facts.he does not present evidence of strategic,intentional cooperation of the sort the district courts in stringer and scrushy found damning.for example,setser claims that the governmental parties had been cooperatively investigating and communicating for months prior to the searches.but,as the government points out,his only record support for this assertion is a single phone call from an investigator from the texas state securities board to an fbi agent assigned to the case.setser does not provide evidence to contradict the government assertion and district court conclusion that the state investigator was herself on the criminal side of the probe.
setser also points to the coordination inherent in the fbi execution of arrest warrants at the same time as the receiver agents were conducting their search of setser home and other premises.the government acknowledges that the two groups communicated in advance,but claims their cooperation was limited to logistical concerns such as ensuring the receiver did not interfere with the conduct of the arrests.some of the search protocols for the receiver team referred to the fbi as having some role in terminating modem connections,and the receiver apparently permitted the fbi to review some documents before he himself reviewed them.
setser made these points to the district court,which found that the fbi did not help formulate the search protocols.whether or not the receiver read documents before p
