background 
procedural history.
in may,after a search of mintmire law office in florida,the government unsealed a indictment charging him with a violation of c for attempted obstruction of a federal grand jury investigation into the sale of corporate stock of clements,a corporation that mintmire had represented.the indictment alleged that from august to september,mintmire attempted to dissuade grand jury witness kevin bell bell and also encouraged bell to dissuade disclosing facts concerning the formation of clements through the merger of lucid concepts,lucid and clements citrus sales of florida,citrus.
on august,the government filed a superseding indictment,adding a second count against mintmire charging him with violating by obstructing a boston sec proceeding related to cmerun,a company formed from another company that mintmire had represented,fundae fundae.specifically,the new count charged mintmire with attempting to conceal his control of the companies shares by failing to produce subpoenaed documents to the sec and by falsely testifying in his deposition regarding common shareholders of the two companies and mintmire alleged loans to those shareholders.
thereafter,mintmire moved to dismiss count two on the ground that the southern district of florida was not the proper venue to prosecute him for obstruction of the sec proceeding.in an apparent response to the venue issue,the government amended count two to allege a violation of c,instead of,which allowed it to take advantage of the venue provision contained in i the government further modified count two to allege that mintmire had paid attorneys representing persons subpoenaed by the sec while withholding documents from those attorneys and their clients and count one to allege that mintmire attempted to dissuade bell from disclosing that shareholders in lucid prior to the merger and clements after the merger were nominee shareholders 
after mintmire renewed and amended his motion to dismiss count two for lack of venue,the district court referred the venue issue to magistrate judge frank lynch,who recommended that mintmire venue motion be denied.mintmire also moved to dismiss count two and asserted that it violated the ex post facto clause of the constitution because c did not become effective until after mintmire produced documents and was deposed in the sec proceeding.
on december,the government added a third count charging mintmire with violating and by conspiring to obstruct the sec proceeding in order to hide the fact that fundae shareholders were really nominees who had given control of their stock to mintmire.according to the government,mintmire committed the following overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy in september and october in the southern district of florida mintmire contacted,agreed to pay,and paid keith logue logue,an attorney in atlanta,georgia,to make unsolicited contact with persons subpoenaed by the sec mintmire falsely informed sec counsel that he had provided all relevant subpoenaed documents while failing to provide documents in his possession to a nominee shareholder and mintmire misrepresented to the sec his relationship with the nominee shareholders,the common shareholders of fundae and clements,and investment loans made to shareholders.
mintmire then moved to dismiss both counts two and three as motivated by prosecutorial vindictiveness in an attempt to punish mintmire for the exercise of his constitutional and statutory rights and alternatively,to sever counts two and three from count one on the basis that the government sought to take advantage of prejudicial spillover by trying all three counts together.
all three counts were tried in the district court from january until february.after the close of evidence,the district court dismissed count two as violative of the ex post facto clause.however,the court denied mintmire motion for a judgment of acquittal on count one,and it permitted count three to go forward on the theory that mintmire had conspired with logue to obstruct the sec proceeding 
during the charge conference,mintmire requested that the court instruct the jury that the government had the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that t he defendant was not providing lawful,bona fide,legal representation in connection with or anticipation of an official proceeding,while the government requested that the jury be instructed that it must first find that mintmire was acting as a lawyer before any burden shifted onto the government.the district court expressed uncertainty as to whether the issue was a factual question for the jury or a legal question for the court.however,the court ultimately decided,and instructed the jury accordingly,that the jury had to first find that mintmire and logue as to count three was acting as a lawyer and,upon that showing,the government was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that mintmire and logue as to count three was not providing bona fide legal services 
the law provides a complete defense commonly referred to as an affirmative defense to the offenses charged in counts and of the indictment because one who is performing bona fide legal representation services does not have an improper purpose.his purpose to zealously represent his client is fully protected by the law.if you find that the defendant provided legal representation services,in connection with the charged conduct in counts or,and the defendant was providing lawful,bona fide legal representation services in connection with or in anticipation of an official proceeding,that is,a grand jury or sec investigation,then you must find the defendant not guilty.in order to find the defendant guilty,the government must prove all of the elements beyond a reasonable doubt as i originally read to you as to counts and.if you find the defendant provided legal representation services,in connection with the charged conduct in counts or,the government must also prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not providing lawful,bona fide legal representation services in connection with or anticipation of an official proceeding.
keith logue is named as a coconspirator in count.if you find that keith logue provided legal representation services in connection with the charged conduct in count,and keith logue was providing lawful,bona fide legal representation services in connection with or in anticipation of an official proceeding,then you must find the defendant not guilty.in order to find the defendant guilty,the government must prove all of the elements beyond a reasonable doubt as i originally read as to counts and.if you find that keith logue provided legal representation services,in connection with the charged conduct in count,the government must also prove beyond a reasonable doubt that keith logue was not providing lawful,bona fide legal representation services in connection with or in anticipation of an official proceeding.
the jury returned guilty verdicts on both remaining counts one and three.although mintmire renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal as to those counts and moved for a new trial,those motions were denied.mintmire was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment of months,terms of supervised release,a fine of,and the prohibition of engag ing in any business that offers securities,investments,or business opportunities to the public.this appeal followed 
evidence presented by the government at trial 
nasd applications by fundae and clements 
during the trial,a representative of the national association of securities dealers nasd about the application procedure for companies to make market,that is,be traded in their particular stock.a company submits an application form for review through a nasd broker who collects the relevant information on behalf of the applicant companies and represents that the information contained therein is reliable and accurate.
with respect to applications submitted by small companies,nasd review focuses on how the company was formed,the identities of the shareholders and officers,and how those shareholders acquired their shares in the company.in order for a free trading market to exist,nasd requires and the sec has approved that a certain number of shareholders must be freely trading stock must not be controlled by just one or two individuals.thus,if a number of individuals are listed as shareholders,but all of their shares are controlled by one person,a full sec disclosure is required.
on june,nasd received an application from the broker public securities on behalf of fundae indicating that the i ssuer was introduced by don mintmire of mintmire associates,councel sic transfer agent to the issuer.mintmire has been known to public securities for years and has been council sic to other issues filed by this firm.also attached to the application was a list bearing a facsimile data line from of individual and corporate shareholders in fundae,including twelve individuals with addresses in atlanta,georgia mary catherine mcgowan,jeffrey merback,jennifer froehlich,brandon bell,anne marie fourdan,john marratt,lisa reisman,roxanne brock,julie watson,sammy peroulas,kim davies,and carmen ockletree and fourteen individuals with addresses in florida rene dervaes,the sole officer and director of fundae,angie,angela bartoletta,amy anne melice,psj holdings,marco beach gardens,paul safran,felice melice,samuel melice ii,john stagl,charles adams,adams,kerry mathieu and devin.
nasd identified a number of deficiencies in the application because fundae had so few shareholders and very little capital,and therefore nasd requested that public securities submit additional information.public securities replied on letterhead with a response signed by mintmire,stating in part 
please provide the staff with details surrounding the issuers rule and offering.your answer should include,but is not limited to,who solicited investors,how they were known to the solicitor and how many individuals were solicited including those that did not purchase.in addition,please provide the staff with a copy of the executed subscription agreements and respective checks.
answer no investors were solicited who did not purchase.the investors were known to the director of the company darvaes and purchased shares through that individual.each of the investors is considered to be a sophisticated investor,understands corporate books and records and had total access to all company records prior to investing.specifically each investor had the nonfinancial and financial data required by rule of regulation d and specifically rule b.copies of the executed subscription agreements are attached.checks are unavailable.the funds were deposited into an independent escrow account prior to transfer to the company upon acceptance of the subscriptions.
in response to question six,that asked for a description of the relationships or affiliations that existed among and between the shareholders,mintmire explained that angela bartoletta was the sole officer and director of angie,outlined the familial relationship between amy anne,samuel and felice melice,and otherwise represented w e confirm that there are no other relationships among and between the shareholders to the best of our knowledge and a ll relationships have been disclosed.finally,nasd asked public securities to p lease indicate if any person has dispositive control over any shares of the issuer other than the corresponding shareholder listed on the shareholder list,to which mintmire letter declared no one has such control.although the subscription agreements,which were signed although undated,were attached to public securities responses on behalf of on behalf of fundae,nasd was concerned because the checks ostensibly used to purchase the stock were not attached to the agreements.
after reviewing the responses,nasd notified public securities that it had discovered that several of the shareholders on the shareholder list of the issuer are involved in other companies that involve donald mintmire and mar k mintmire and therefore,nasd requested more explanation of the shareholder relationships and if any of the shareholders on the shareholder list of the issuer are acting as a group.nasd also requested another form of proof that the shareholders had actually paid for the shares because the checks used to purchase the stocks had not been produced.public securities responded by attaching a january bank statement showing a deposit for and a total balance for the same amount,along with the following statement drafted by mintmire 
we have reviewed the matter at length with our client.certainly there are other shareholders who have invested in companies in which the two named individuals are also investors principals.there is no relationship between the two individuals and any other investors except that the investors are known to the individuals,are willing to invest in individual companies as the opportunities arise,and most certainly relied to some extent upon the judgement and knowledge of one or both individuals.however,these investors do not act as a group,are not acting as a group and make an individual judgement on each particular company to which they are introduced.that is why the shareholder list varies except for some of the shareholders who are interested in investing in all of the companies.
thereafter,nasd again requested from public securities documentary evidence of receipt of funds from the individual shareholders that have purchased shares in the issuer offerings,checks.public securities responded with copies of and checks made out to or mintmire trust account in december and one in december.
on october,nasd notified public securities that it had approved fundae to submit a quote on the otc bulletin board for common stock,and fundae was quoted on the otc stock exchange.fundae later merged and changed its name to cmerun corporation.
on may,clements who had also been referred by mintmire submitted an application to nasd.nasd noted various deficiencies in the application and materials,and public securities through mintmire and nasd again requested additional evidence of the independence of the shareholders.mintmire responded with the following information names,addresses,and number of shares purchased by the shareholders,some of whom were also fundae shareholders brandon bell,kimberly davies,anne marie fourdan,jeffrey merback,and julie taylor watson a chart indicating that shares had been transferred to kevin bell by davis while shares had been issued to stacy wolfgang who then transferred the shares to individuals and an agreement between lucid and citrus indicating that lucid acquired citrus shares and formed clements with mintmire as the issuer.
the sec investigation of cmerun 
in july,the sec began investigating cmerun regarding possible false statements that may have led to the resignation of the company accounting firm.later in its investigation,the sec focused on its belief that fundae was a blind pool company that existed solely to acquire other companies specifically,the sec noticed that cmerun documents included the names of both mintmire and his son mark mintmire,who resided in atlanta,georgia along with a number of shareholders who were not sophisticated investors with high incomes.the sec issued a number of subpoenas to mintmire and requesting all documents relating to fundae and to both the individual and corporate shareholders,devin,a shareholder of fundae for whom mintmire was the registered agent,and other listed fundae shareholders requesting documents and later,testimony 
mintmire also testified to the sec that fundae put together the investors rene dervaes knew some of the shareholders his son mark mintmire had helped solicit some of their mutual friends he had loaned initially to fundae with the oral understanding that it would be repaid and he recalled speaking to some of the shareholders about the loan agreements.the sec ultimately chose not to charge criminally mintmire nor file civil claims against him because it found there was no substantial harm to investors and the sec resources that would be required to investigate and prosecute were not merited by the enforcement value.
during his testimony before the sec,mintmire estimated that he had made approximately from the sale of fundae shares and that his son mark mintmire had made around.evidence was also introduced at trial that in,mintmire purchased shares of clements at three cents per share and traded shares over the next four days at prices ranging from to per share,and in and,mintmire transacted over in shares of clements.

keith logue involvement with the shareholders 
keith logue,an attorney in atlanta and a previous law partner of mintmire whom mintmire had known for fifteen years,testified at trial regarding his involvement with two of the listed shareholders.logue was given immunity by the government,although he denied that he had done anything wrong or that mintmire had improperly influenced him.
mary catherine mcgowan 
logue first involvement was with mary catherine mcgowan after she received a subpoena to testify before the sec.according to mcgowan,at mark mintmire request,she contacted mintmire who directed her to logue.logue confirmed that he was contacted by mintmire about representing mcgowan regarding her testimony before the sec in atlanta as mintmire had done in the past when he referred clients to logue and that mintmire informed logue he would pay for the representation.mintmire explained to logue that mcgowan was one of many shareholders in a company who had executed some documents.thereafter mcgowan met with logue in atlanta and,with logue representing her,later gave a sworn statement to the sec.
prior to her testimony,mcgowan had also received a document subpoena from the sec and had produced in response a few cancelled checks,a scanned version of one of the signature guarantees for fundae,and other documents that she obtained from the mintmires.when a question arose during the course of her deposition regarding whether the subpoena to her included documents dealing with companies other than fundae,logue and the sec counsel agreed to address the issue later.sometime after the deposition,mcgowan found backdated cancelled checks involving at least one other company besides fundae,and according to mcgowan,when she asked logue about producing them to the sec,he told her not to produce them and that he would contact the sec on her behalf.mcgowan testified that she believed that logue actually spoke to sec counsel and informed them that if the sec wanted the additional documents they would have to issue another subpoena.mcgowan also testified that she was pleased with logue representation of her and his advice that they should not produce any documents not demanded by the subpoena,and that logue told her to tell the truth.
logue recalled that he met with mcgowan and advised her that it was in her best interest to testify,to tell the truth,and to produce whatever documents she had in her possession.logue testified that he believed the sec investigation involved only fundae,but he admitted that he was unsure of whether mcgowan was a target of the sec investigation.logue further testified that he believed that the subpoena to mcgowan,which listed a number of companies,sought only documents related to fundae and not to other companies.logue recalled speaking to mcgowan about the documents a number of times following the deposition and being told by mcgowan that she could not find any additional documents.logue did not recall calling sec counsel,but indicated that he must have done so because he remembered telling sec counsel that he would follow up and he was pretty good about returning phone calls.counsel for the sec testified that he did not have any conversations with logue after mcgowan testimony,even though he had left a series of messages about obtaining those documents.the sec did not issue an additional subpoena for the documents.
although mcgowan testified that logue had never discussed his fee arrangement with her,mcgowan was presented at trial with an invoice for logue services,addressed to her,for and a check payable to logue and signed by mintmire for the invoice amount.the check was drawn on the company account for imaginenet,a name mcgowan claimed did not recognize until she was shown a check from her personal bank account made out to imaginenet.logue acknowledged that he had never submitted his bill for legal services to mcgowan but,instead,had sent the bill to mintmire because he mintmire had indicated he would pay it.
logue also admitted that he had tried to contact additional shareholders,but he denied that those contacts were an attempt to represent them and instead were his efforts to gain insight into the investigation.
kevin bell 
in august,when the government was conducting a grand jury investigation concerning the sale of stock in clements,logue received another request from mintmire about representing kevin bell,who was listed as a lucid shareholder and who had received a subpoena via mintmire office to testify before a federal grand jury in florida.mintmire sent to the subpoena to bell with a note stating w e accepted this on your behalf if this is unacceptable you should talk to your lawyer about it.pursuant to your instructions we are forwarding a copy to your attorney,keith logue,at fax number y ou advised his phone number was bell testified that when he received the subpoena and note from mintmire,he had no idea who logue was and that it was mintmire who put him in touch with logue after he received the subpoena.

logue testified that he did his own due diligence on the case,interviewing bell,retrieving files off edgar,reviewing information with bell,and calling to reschedule bell grand jury appearance.bell told logue that he did not know anything about lucid.logue did not accompany bell to his grand jury appearance in florida,and the bill for his services to bell was submitted to and paid by mintmire.although logue was shown a government exhibit with a notation in his handwriting stating could get list from jeff,he testified that he could not recall such a list nor did he recall speaking to either jeff merback or kevin bell about a list of potential witnesses.
according to bell,he met with logue at a coffee shop in atlanta where logue pulled out a yellow pad with a time line on it and explained the organization of lucid the company of which bell had been listed as president.after logue told bell he respected and owed mintmire,bell became skeptical of logue allegiance and declined to have logue accompany him to florida for the grand jury appearance.bell later learned that logue had rescheduled bell grand jury appearance for a later date without bell consent.on the rescheduled date,bell traveled to florida and testified before the grand jury.

evidence presented by mintmire at trial 
mintmire presented two witnesses in his at trial.the principal witness for mintmire was a miami attorney,robert josefsberg,who was allowed to testify as an expert witness on legal ethics and attorneys duties in grand jury and regulatory investigations.josefsberg attempted to bolster mintmire affirmative defense under c,which provides an exemption from obstruction for those providing bona fide legal services,and he testified that mintmire represented virtually everyone including every shareholder who received a subpoena.josefsberg also repeatedly stated that mintmire was not guilty of obstruction.specifically,josefsberg testified that mintmire was providing legal services when he recommended in response to the government subpoena that logue represent kevin bell in the grand jury investigation counsel for one party may provide information and theories on how to deal with the facts to counsel for a witness mintmire acted properly when he advised bell that witnesses have a right not to speak voluntarily with investigators,when he counseled bell to advise others to state that they did not remember where the record establishes that they did not remember,and when he monitored the grand jury investigation by,among other things,debriefing bell and attempting to obtain a list of potential witnesses mintmire was providing bona fide legal services in connection with the grand jury investigation and the sec proceeding and acted properly when he fulfilled his moral duty to minimize his son involvement in the case and logue interpretation of the sec subpoena served on mcgowan was appropriate and the sec should have moved to compel production or issued a new subpoena if it disagreed with that interpretation.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,mintmire claims insufficient evidence supports the jury guilty verdict as to both counts.he also claims that the trial court erred by not acquitting him based upon the safe harbor provision of c and by improperly shifting the burden of proof under c to him by instructing the jury to decide if mintmire as related to count one and keith logue the alleged unindicted of count three were acting as lawyers when they committed the acts in question.finally,mintmire argues that the trial was tainted by the government joinder of counts two and three,which charged obstruction of and conspiring to obstruct the sec investigation into cmerun,with count one,which related to obstruction of a different grand jury investigation,such that the presentation of evidence as to both instances created prejudicial spillover and was confusing and corrupting of a fair trial.mintmire claims this was compounded by the acquittal as to count two,which the district court dismissed on mintmire motion at the close of evidence having found that the alleged acts the effective date of c.
sufficiency of the evidence.
mintmire challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions on counts one and three involves questions of law which we review de novo.united states dodds,cir.a factual finding will be sufficient to sustain a conviction if,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d emphasis in original.a ll reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of supporting the jury verdict.united states sawyer,cir per curiam citing glasser united states.
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and,as we must,drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility assessments in the government favor,united states harris,cir,we find that there was more than sufficient evidence to sustain mintmire convictions under counts one and three.first,as to count one,the trial court properly instructed the jury that the government was required to prove the following there was an official proceeding taking place,in this case,a grand jury investigation mintmire engaged in conduct which constituted a substantial step toward the commission of the crime of obstruction of an official proceeding mintmire acted corruptly,with an improper purpose and to engage in conduct knowingly and dishonestly with the specific intent to subvert,impede or obstruct the grand jury investigation and t he natural and probable effect of mintmire conduct would be the interference with the due administration of justice.see,united states thomas,cir discussing analogous elements of.
in this case,we have no hesitation in concluding that the jury was presented with ample evidence from which it could find that mintmire violated c by attempting to obstruct a grand jury investigation.as to the first element,there is no dispute that an official proceeding as defined by the statute was indeed underway.as to the second and third elements,substantial evidence was presented from which a jury could infer that mintmire engaged in conduct which constituted a substantial step toward the commission of the crime of obstruction of an official proceeding and that mintmire acted corruptly.the evidence before the jury suggested that from the moment kevin bell was subpoenaed,mintmire controlled his participation in the grand jury proceedings.as part of mintmire initial contact with bell regarding his grand jury subpoena,mintmire created documentation that made it appear that bell had given mintmire the name and number of attorney logue.in reality,however,bell testified that mintmire told him that he had received a grand jury subpoena directed to bell and that he would have someone logue explain it to him.bell version of the events was consistent with uncontroverted evidence that mintmire had referred matters to logue in the past,including the matter involving mcgowan who was subpoenaed in the sec investigation,and mintmire and logue had known each other for over fifteen years.
evidence was also presented at trial that mintmire attempted to orchestrate bell testimony to the grand jury.mintmire sent notes to logue so that he could coach bell according to mintmire version of events,but bell made clear that he was unaware of the following events at one point he had owned five million shares of clements stock millions of bell shares had been cancelled and he was an officer and director of clements bell also knew nothing about an agreement between lucid concepts,and clements citrus sales of florida,whereby the latter shares were acquired by agreement ostensibly signed by bell with mintmire acting as the issuer.moreover,the jury had evidence before it that,in stark contrast to mintmire attempts through logue to coach bell,mintmire represented to nasd during its inquiry concerning the clements application that five million shares had been transferred to kevin bell by a person named davis and bell was an officer and director of lucid clements.kevin bell testified at trial that he did not recognize the name of the chinese guy.the jury also was presented with mintmire sworn deposition before the sec,which contained numerous misrepresentations that were disputed by witnesses at trial,including that monies given to the nominee shareholders were loans and that the shareholders were aware of that fact.this evidence gives context to mintmire recorded conversations with bell for example,when mintmire reminds bell that the money was for fees mintmire asks him,w hat did i tell you about that 
additionally,despite the testimony advanced by mintmire legal expert,josefsberg,that a father has a right,even a moral obligation,to shield his son,the jury could infer that mintmire had ignobly embroiled his son in his misconduct.it is impossible to justify mintmire suggestion to through bell to other potential they keep mintmire son out of it to the extent that they can.mintmire knew that his son had recruited a number of unsophisticated investors to serve as nominee shareholders,paying them to sign documents and to have those documents verified by various bank officials.
mintmire also suggested that bell tell the other shareholders that it was acceptable for them to testify that all they could remember was that they signed documents.while before the sec,mintmire had described some of these nominee shareholders to be individuals who were not operating as a group and who exercised independent judgment.to the contrary,there was more than sufficient evidence to refute mintmire representation and to show that mintmire controlled their shares.by attempting to persuade bell to tell the shareholders that they merely had signed documents,and had relied on him in doing so,mintmire was attempting to conceal the truth from the grand jury,his son was heavily involved in the illicit conduct.
the above ample evidence and other evidence presented at trial allowed the jury to conclude that mintmire was committing substantial steps toward the crime of obstruction,acting corruptly,and that the probable result of his actions would be withholding information from,or putting misinformation before,the grand jury.accordingly,the jury verdict as to count one that mintmire interfered with the due administration of justice is amply supported by the record.
this same reasoning applies to mintmire argument regarding count three charge of conspiracy to obstruct the sec proceeding with logue with respect to that count,the court instructed the jury that the government had to prove mintmire and logue came to a mutual understanding to try to accomplish an unlawful plan,in this case,to corruptly obstruct,influence and impede or endeavor to obstruct,the sec proceeding that mintmire,knowing the unlawful purpose of the plan,willfully joined in it that mintmire or logue knowingly committed at least one overt act and that the overt act was committed at or about the time alleged in the indictment in an effort to conceal the fact that the shareholders in fundae were just nominees and that mintmire was in actual control of their shares.
the jury was presented with evidence that even prior to the formation of the conspiracy,mintmire made various misrepresentations to nasd in response to their inquires regarding fundae,including falsely stating that the investors were known to the director of the company sophisticated and had total access to all company records prior to investing.later,after nasd discovered that some of the shareholders for fundae also appeared as shareholders with other companies that involve donald mintmire and mar k mintmire,and nasd inquired if those shareholders were operating as a group,mintmire represented that these investors do not act as a group,are not acting as a group and make an individual judgement on each particular company to which they are introduced.mintmire had also represented that no one but the shareholders on the list had dispositive control of the company.these representations,of course,were contrary to the overwhelming evidence that the shareholders were nominees whose acquisition and management of stock was totally controlled by mintmire.
moreover,despite his critical role in recruiting and organizing the shareholders,mark mintmire was not mentioned at all in the nasd responses provided by mintmire.in response to a nasd inquiry requesting that mintmire describe all relationships or affiliations existing among and between the shareholders,mintmire only discussed the relationships between the florida shareholders,and did not mention either the atlanta shareholders,or that his son,mark mintmire,recruited all those shareholders.
against the backdrop of those misrepresentations,the jury learned that mary catherine mcgowan received a subpoena to testify before the sec,and that mintmire retained attorney logue to represent her in those proceedings and paid for her legal bill.when mcgowan appeared before the sec in order to give her sworn statement with logue as her counsel,logue objected allegedly pursuant to his interpretation of the subpoena to mcgowan producing documents relating to any entities other than fundae despite the subpoena inclusion of other listed companies.although logue remembered that mcgowan contacted him after the deposition and told him that she could not find additional documents,mcgowan testified to the direct opposite that is,that she had called logue and told him that she had found additional documents.likewise,logue testified that as he was pretty good about returning phone calls,he was certain he had called sec counsel and informed him that mcgowan could not find any additional documents.again,this testimony was diametrically opposed to that of sec counsel,who testified that he left logue multiple messages and that logue never returned his calls.
contrary to mintmire argument,the discrepancies between logue testimony and the testimony of mcgowan and sec counsel did not merely concern whether logue gave good advice,or whether the sec was sufficiently aggressive.rather,the credibility related also to whether logue deliberately tried to hide information from the sec.specifically,because of the interrelation among the shareholders and his previous misrepresentations,mintmire had reason to fear the investigation would uncover facts showing that the nominee shareholders had been duped into unwittingly participating in multiple corporations whose stock he controlled.
mintmire also makes much of the fact that he,and sometimes logue,told some of the shareholders to tell the truth.but the truth was necessarily limited to the information supplied by mintmire and his son and later logue to the nominee shareholders during the course of the scheme.that was very little.of course,we must resolve all reasonable inferences,and the jury credibility choices in favor of the jury verdict.united states gupta,cir.this is not a close call.the evidence was ample and easily sufficient to support mintmire conviction on counts one and three.
jury instructions.
we review the legal correctness of a jury instruction de novo but defer to the district court on questions of phrasing absent an abuse of discretion.united states prather,cir citations omitted.district courts have broad discretion in formulating jury instructions,so long as the charge as a whole accurately reflects the law and the facts.id.we will not reverse a conviction on the basis of a jury charge unless the issues of law were presented inaccurately,or the charge improperly guided the jury in such a substantial way as to violate due process.id.quotation marks and citation omitted.
mintmire argues that because counts one and three both involved attorney conduct,he was entitled to the benefit of the safe harbor provision of c this chapter does not prohibit or punish the providing of lawful,bona fide,legal representation services in connection with or anticipation of an official proceeding.mintmire argued he was acting as an attorney in his communications with kevin bell count one and keith logue count three.he also asserts that the trial court instruction about the statutory safe harbor was in error for two reasons improperly asked the jury to decide if he and logue were acting as lawyers and therefore treated section c as an affirmative defense as opposed to an element of counts one and three and failed to set forth the standard by which to judge the affirmative defense,and improperly shifted the burden of proof to mintmire.we disagree.
we find our precedent establishes that section c is an affirmative defense,not an element of the crimes of which mintmire was convicted.see united states kloess,cir.with respect to the availability of section c as a defense,the district court instructed the jury as follows 
the law provides a complete defense commonly referred to as an affirmative defense to the offenses charged in counts and of the indictment because one who is performing bona fide legal representation services does not have an improper purpose.his purpose to zealously represent his client is fully protected by the law.if you find that the defendant provided legal representation services,in connection with the charged conduct in counts or,and the defendant was providing lawful,bona fide legal representation services in connection with or in anticipation of an official proceeding,that is,a grand jury or sec investigation,then you must find the defendant not guilty.in order to find the defendant guilty,the government must prove all of the elements beyond a reasonable doubt as i originally read to you as to counts and.
