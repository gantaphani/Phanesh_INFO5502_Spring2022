introduction 
this case involves a lawsuit based upon the securities act of et,hereafter referred to as the act section a of the act creates civil liability for the sale of an unregistered security a.the purchaser can sue the seller in either state or federal court for rescission and recovery of the purchase price section of the act provides that the action is subject to a statute of limitations that begins to run when the sale is made.
here,three purchasers sued a seller of an unregistered security.the buyers,conceding that they had filed their action past the applicable statute of limitations,relied upon the doctrine of equitable tolling to halt the running of the limitations period.they based their equitable tolling theory on evidence that the seller had affirmatively misrepresented to them that the security was registered.in a bench trial,the trial court found that the principle of equitable tolling applied to a section a action and that the buyers had established its evidentiary foundations.the trial court awarded the buyers a total judgment of.
on this appeal,we decide a question of first impression does the principle of equitable tolling apply to a section a action no california or federal appellate court has addressed this question.the federal district courts are in conflict,with the vast majority of those courts finding the doctrine inapplicable.we adopt the majority view for two reasons.first,the lynchpin of equitable defendant ability to conceal from a plaintiff the right to bring a not present in a section a action,because whether a security is registered is a matter of public record.hence,there is no reason to equitably toll the time in which a lawsuit must be filed.second,the language of section provision setting forth a statute of limitations for,inter alia,a section a against applying the equitable tolling doctrine.in section,congress included a discovery rule for certain classes of claims but omitted that rule for a section a claim.this omission reflects congressional intent to prohibit the use of the equitable tolling doctrine in a section a action.
plaintiffs concede that they filed the lawsuit beyond the statutory period.consequently,our resolution of this issue in favor of the seller is dispositive of the appeal and renders it unnecessary to address any of his other claims of error.we reverse with directions to enter judgment in favor of the seller.
factual and procedural 
the plaintiffs are three brothers robert,john and thomas sagehorn the defendant is michael engle.the transaction at issue involved shares in genesis fund.
in march,defendant invited robert to invest in genesis fund.thereafter,defendant gave robert copies of the fund brochure and subscription agreement.after signing the subscription agreement,robert made his initial purchase of genesis fund shares on march.several months later,robert told his two brothers about the investment.on or about july,thomas made his only purchase of shares in genesis fund for.john made two purchases of genesis fund shares for a total of.the first was in september and the second was in august.robert made several purchases in the fund,for a total of.robert last purchase was made in january.
in late,plaintiffs learned that genesis fund had suffered substantial investment losses.in july,they filed suit.in the trial court,plaintiffs conceded that their action had been filed more than one year after each plaintiff had made his last purchase of shares in genesis fund.to avoid a defense of the statute of limitations,plaintiffs relied upon the doctrine of equitable tolling.as will be explained in more detail below,equitable tolling suspends the running of the statute of limitations during the period a plaintiff exercises due care,but remains ignorant of the facts entitling him to sue because of the defendant concealment of those facts.
at trial,the parties presented conflicting evidence on the issue of equitable tolling.plaintiffs theory was that defendant had affirmatively misrepresented to them that genesis fund shares were registered securities.plaintiffs argued that they did not learn the true fact of until within a year of filing suit.the parties presented documentary evidence such as the genesis fund brochure,genesis fund subscription agreements,and letters written by defendant to plaintiffs.in addition,the three plaintiffs testified to what defendant had told them about the status of genesis fund.defendant presented contrary testimony.
the trial court first resolved the legal issue in favor of plaintiffs it adopted the minority view that the statute of limitations is subject to equitable tolling when there is fraudulent concealment.the trial court then resolved the factual issue in favor of plaintiffs.the court noted that one provision in the subscription agreement that defendant had provided to plaintiffs stated that genesis fund was not registered.however,the court went on to find that this language was contradicted by other language in the agreement and was ambiguous in light of still another provision.in addition,the court found that defendant subsequent letters to plaintiffs contradicted the subscription agreement statement of.the court concluded these facts,along with testimony from plaintiffs that they relied on the belief that genesis fund was registered in large part based on defendant affirmative oral and written representations,are sufficient to find that plaintiffs were not on notice of the status of genesis funds at the time they signed the subscription agreement.therefore,the court finds that equitable tolling applies from november,when defendant affirmatively represented genesis fund to be like a mutual fund,to october,when plaintiff robert sagehorn returned from the genesis fund meeting in mexico city and discovered plaintiffs investments were in serious trouble.since the complaint was filed on july,it is not barred by the statute of limitations.
the trial court rejected defendant other arguments and defenses and entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs.this defense appeal follows.
discussion 
the primary purpose of the act is to protect investors by requiring publication of material information thought necessary to allow them to make informed investment decisions concerning public offerings of securities in interstate commerce.citations.the registration requirements are the heart of the act,and imposes strict liability for violating those requirements.liability under is a particularly important enforcement tool,because in many instances a private suit is the only effective means of detecting and deterring a seller wrongful failure to register securities before offering them for sale.citations.pinter dahl,d,italics added.
section a therefore creates strict liability if a sale violates the registration provisions of section of the act.section of the act contains the statute of limitations for bringing a civil action for sale of an unregistered security a,for fraud in the sale of a security a,and for making a false registration statement.the first portion of section reads 
no action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under section or a of this title unless brought within one year after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission,or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence,or,if the action is to enforce a liability created under section a of this title,unless brought within one year after the violation upon which it is based,italics added.
the statute begins to run when the unregistered security is sold.snyder newhard,cook.
the second portion of section contains the following language.as explained below,this provision constitutes a statute of repose.
in no event shall any such action be brought to enforce a liability created under section or a of this title more than three years after the security was bona fide offered to the public,or under section a of this title more than three years after the sale.
a statute of repose is a subspecies of the statute of limitations.a statute of repose runs from a fixed date readily determinable by the defendant,such as,for example,the date of sale,transaction
