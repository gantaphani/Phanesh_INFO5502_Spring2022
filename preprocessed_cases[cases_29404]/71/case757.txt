plaintiffs appeal from september,and december,orders of the district court dismissing this action.these orders were based on findings that plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted pursuant to.b and failed to plead fraud with particularity pursuant to.b.these are the subjects of plaintiffs appeal under case no.plaintiffs also appeal from a march,order of the district court denying their motion for a hirsch remand,which is the subject of the second appeal under case no.because the district court did not consider plaintiff amended complaint before deciding the motions at issue,we vacate and remand for further consideration.
substantive background 
plaintiffs are members of the general public who purchased common stock in mid western waste systems,maw,a publicly traded corporation,under the securities exchange act.maw later disclosed serious financial irregularities and filed for bankruptcy protection,causing the investors stock to lose value.plaintiffs sued certain maw officers certain maw accountants,coopers lybrand and coopers lybrand collectively,coopers.coopers performed accounting services for maw,which included the audit of financial statements which were part of maw filings with the securities and exchange commission sec.
plaintiffs claim that they were sold the maw stock at inflated prices that false financial information about maw was disseminated to them and,that they suffered a great monetary loss when maw,without warning,filed for bankruptcy protection.
ii.procedural background 
plaintiffs brought claims against coopers for securities fraud violations pursuant to b and for their role in assisting the sale at an inflated price of maw stock,all in violation of the private securities litigation reform,pslra.
plaintiffs also assert claims of professional negligence and negligent misrepresentation under ohio law against coopers.coopers filed its motion to dismiss,asserting that plaintiffs complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted pursuant to.b,or alternatively,failed to allege fraud with the particularity required by pslra and.b.
the district court granted coopers motion,in part,on september,and provided an opportunity for plaintiffs to amend their complaint.plaintiffs did not file an amended complaint,but filed their notice of intent to stand on amended class action complaint,not realizing that the amended complaint had not been considered this led to the entry of the december,order dismissing plaintiffs entire claim with prejudice and,the preparation of plaintiffs appeal under case no.plaintiffs claim that the district court erred by basing its decision to dismiss their claim upon the original complaint filed in april rather than on the amended complaint filed and accepted by the district court of new jersey in october.
while pursuing their appeal on case,plaintiffs noticed that certain documents were not part of the record below.this prompted them to file three motions,one of which was a motion for a hirsch remand.had the district court granted plaintiffs hirsch remand motion,and this court had agreed to remand,it would have allowed the district court to reconsider its previous judgment of dismissal based on a full evaluation of the case record.first national bank of salem,ohio hirsch,cir.however,subsequent to a hearing on the matter,the district court denied plaintiffs motion for hirsch remand,but granted their motion to supplement the record.the denial of plaintiffs hirsch remand motion is the subject of plaintiffs second appeal under case no.
iii.discussion 
standards of.motion for dismissal pursuant to.b 
the propriety of a dismissal pursuant to.b is a question of law that is subject to de novo review.in re sofamor danek group,cir.the court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,accept all the factual allegations as true,and determine whether the plaintiff can prove a set of facts in support of its claims that would entitle it to relief.mayer mylod,cir.a court may not grant a rule b motion based on disbelief of a complaint factual allegations.lawler marshall,cir.finally,this court may consider the full text of the sec filings,prospectus,analysts reports and statements integral to the complaint,even if not attached,without converting the motion into one for summary judgment under.see meyer pincus oppenheimer,cir.
the standard of review require s more than the bare assertion of legal conclusions.see columbia natural resources,tatum,cir.and,this court need not accept as true legal conclusions or unwarranted factual inferences.morgan church fried chicken,cir.
plaintiffs claims for professional negligence and negligent misrepresentation are tested for their ability to state a claim under state law.in diversity cases,this court applies state law in accordance with the controlling decisions of the ohio supreme court.erie tompkins.bailey farms,chem,cir.if the state supreme court has not yet addressed the issue presented,this court must predict how it would rule,by looking to all available data,including state appellate decisions.kingsley associates,moll plasticrafters,cir.
motion for hirsch remand 
a denial of a hirsch remand is essentially a denial of a motion under.b.see begala pnc bank,cir.this court reviews the denial of.b motions for an abuse of discretion.see good ohio edison,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when it relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact,uses an incorrect legal standard,or applies the law incorrectly.united food commercial workers union,local,southwest ohio regional transit authority,cir.legal conclusions are subject to de novo review.see suster marshall,cir.
private securities litigation reform act fed.civ.b have plaintiffs stated a claim 
under.b,i n all averments of fraud the circumstances constituting fraud shall be stated with particularity.plaintiffs may not simply rely on the proposition that defendants must have known or should have known of,and participated in,the fraud.generalized and conclusory allegations that the defendants conduct was fraudulent do not satisfy rule b.decker,cir.as courts have noted,rule b has three broad purposes 
in the context of securities litigation it has generally been held that rule b serves three purposes it ensures that allegations are specific enough to inform a defendant of the act of which the plaintiff complains,and to enable him to prepare an effective response and defense it eliminates those complaints filed as a pretext for the discovery of unknown b claimant must know what his claim is when he files and it seeks to protect defendant from unfounded charges of wrongdoing which injure their reputations and goodwill.
vennittilli primerica,quoting benoay decker.therefore,plaintiffs are required to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b.under this court interpretation of the required state of mind under pslra 
p laintiffs may plead scienter in or rule cases by alleging facts giving rise to a strong inference of recklessness,but not by alleging the facts merely establishing that a defendant had the motive and opportunity to commit securities fraud.consequently,we must reject the reasoning of the district court to the extent it concluded that plaintiffs just plead specific facts that create a strong inference of knowing misrepresentation on the part of the defendants in order to establish a defendant scienter in a securities fraud case brought under or rule.
in re comshare.sec,cir.
while rejecting a stringent pleading requirement,the sixth circuit has nonetheless required the plaintiff to plead facts which indicate a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate or defraud,ernst ernst hochfelder,d.this mental state is recklessness,and a plaintiff may survive a motion to dismiss by pleading facts which give rise to a strong inference of recklessness.in re comshare,at.by this court interpretation,recklessness is highly unreasonable conduct which is an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care.while the danger need not be known,it must at least be so obvious that any re
