corporations code section prohibits the sale of unregistered securities violation of this prohibition is a crime,punishable by incarceration for up to three years and a fine up to million,subd.a.but not all securities must be registered.there are many grounds of exemption from the registration requirement,and sale of an unregistered but exempt security is not a crime.
here,defendants javier salas and stephen patrick,charged with selling unregistered securities,claimed they believed in good faith that the securities they sold were exempt from registration.the trial court instructed the jury that this good faith belief was irrelevant to their criminal culpability,and defendants were convicted.the court of appeal,however,held that guilty either knowledge of the security nonexempt status or criminal negligence in failing to determine its an element of the crime of selling an unregistered security it concluded that the trial court erred in failing to so instruct the jury,and that the error was harmless as to defendant salas but prejudicial as to defendant patrick.
like the court of appeal,we hold that a seller who believes reasonably and in good faith that a security is exempt is not guilty of the crime of unlawful sale of an unregistered security.as in other similar cases,the severity of the penalties attached to this crime persuade us that the legislature did not mean to impose criminal liability on defendants who lacked guilty knowledge of facts essential to make the conduct criminal.
unlike the court of appeal,however,we hold that in this context guilty knowledge is not an element of the crime.rather,a defendant reasonable good faith belief that a security is exempt from registration is an affirmative defense on which the defense bears the initial burden of proof.this is consistent with the legislature treatment of the status of the securities as exempt or nonexempt.in a prosecution for unlawful sale of an unregistered security,the prosecutor is not required to prove,as an element of the offense,that the security was not exempt from registration.rather,exemption from registration is an affirmative defense on which the defense bears the initial burden of proof.it is reasonable to infer that the legislature intended for the defendant knowledge of the security exemption status to be treated in the same manner,as an affirmative defense rather than an element of the crime.
because good faith belief in a security exempt status is an affirmative defense,the trial court must instruct the jury about it only when the defense has presented evidence sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew,or was criminally negligent in failing to know,that the security was not exempt.here,defendant salas presented such evidence,and therefore the trial court erred in not instructing the jury on the affirmative defense of good faith as to salas.but because there was also overwhelming evidence of his guilty knowledge,we conclude that the error was nonprejudicial.as to defendant patrick,it is unclear whether he presented sufficient evidence of good faith to entitle him to a jury instruction on the affirmative defense.because the court of appeal failed to consider whether patrick showing was sufficient to entitle him to an instruction on the affirmative defense,and because the parties did not address that issue here,we remand the matter to it for further proceedings.
facts and proceedings 
in,defendant salas formed american joint ownership interests,ajoi to acquire properties for development.he was its president,secretary,treasurer,and sole stockholder.acting on behalf of ajoi,salas created a number of partnerships to purchase the properties.defendant rick berry who did not appeal his conviction,and defendant patrick assisted salas in procuring investors for partnership interests.
salas,berry,and patrick telephoned numerous persons to urge them to invest in partnership interests in boylston street associates,an entity formed to acquire the property at that address.in almost all instances,they had no acquaintance with the person called.they knew little or nothing of the investor economic circumstances,but may have taken some of the names from a list of persons furnished by a promoter of another real estate venture.in,however,defendant berry resigned as sales manager and sent investors a letter advising them of improprieties and fraudulent activities in connection with ajoi investments.ajoi went into receivership in.salas,berry,and patrick were charged with selling unregistered securities in violation of section and selling securities by misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in violation of section.
at the onset of trial,the parties stipulated that the ajoi partnership interests were securities under section that had not been registered with the department of corporations.defendants claimed,however,that the securities were exempt from registration under section,which provides that registration is not required if the sales are not made to more than persons,subd.f and all purchasers either had a preexisting business relationship with the issuer or could be reasonably assumed to have the capacity to protect their own interests in connection with the transaction,subd.f 
at trial,department of corporations examiner michelle tse testified that the bank records of boylston street associates showed that people had invested in that partnership.defendant salas testified that he was aware that he had to limit the number of investors to in order to avoid the registration requirement,and claimed that he did so.tse figures,he said,were incorrect,and included people who had invested in other partnerships or rescinded their investments and received refunds.
salas also claimed that he or other corporate officers had preexisting relationships with all investors,because john torosian and others supplied lists of persons who were interested in investing in real estate ventures,and ajoi used those lists in contacting potential investors.torosian,however,was not an officer or otherwise associated with ajoi.
although patrick had the title of,he and salas both testified that patrick was a salesman with no managerial authority.when asked if he knew the investments were securities,patrick replied i had no idea it was a security.i thought these were totally exempt.italics added.there is no other evidence whether patrick believed in good faith that the securities were exempt from registration.
the trial court instructed the jury that a security is exempt from registration if sold to no more than persons,all of whom either have a preexisting personal or business relationship with the offeror or are sophisticated investors by virtue of their business and financial experience or the business and financial experience of their financial advisors.it further instructed that evidence that a defendant acted in good faith is not a defense.it did not instruct that to commit the crime of selling an unregistered security,a defendant must know,or be criminally negligent in not knowing,that the security should have been registered.
the jury found all defendants guilty of selling an unregistered security in violation of section.defendant berry was also convicted of selling securities by means of misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in violation of section.the jury did not reach a verdict as to whether salas or patrick violated section by selling securities by misrepresentation or omission.
the trial court sentenced defendant salas to a prison term of three years,to be served in the department of corrections los angeles restitution center it sentenced defendant patrick to months in state prison,suspending execution of sentence and placing him on probation on condition that he serve one year in county jail.defendants salas and patrick appealed.
on appeal,defendants argued that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury that they could be found guilty of violating section only if they knew that the security should have been registered or were negligent in failing to know it.the court of appeal agreed,reasoning that section describes a general intent crime in which scienter knowledge or criminal negligence is an element of the crime.it held the trial court failure to instruct on scienter was harmless as to defendant salas,who managed the investment scheme and should have verified that the number of investors did not exceed,as required by statute.as to defendant patrick,however,the court of appeal held the error to be prejudicial because patrick was a salesman who had no management authority and did not know how many investors were involved.
the court of appeal holding that a violation of section requires scienter conflicts with an earlier decision of the same district in people corey th,d corey.we granted the attorney general petition for review to resolve the conflict.
ii.guilty knowledge under section 
section states simply it is unlawful for any person to offer or sell in this state any security in an issuer transaction unless such sale has been qualified,registered or unless such security or transaction is exempted or not subject to qualification section,subdivision a provides a ny person who willfully violates any provision of this division including section shall upon conviction be fined not more than one million dollars,or imprisoned in the state prison,or in a county jail or be punished by both that fine and imprisonment.italics added.
in the court of appeal,the attorney general argued that section describes a strict liability offense.in this court,however,all parties agree that a violation of section is a general intent crime.the classification of section as a general intent crime,however,does not answer the question whether,as the court of appeal held,a violation of section requires that a defendant either know that a security is not exempt from registration or be criminally negligent in not knowing.
depending upon the crime,a requirement of guilty knowledge may mean that defendants are innocent unless they know the facts making their conduct criminal.see,people garcia cal th,d.in other cases,it is sufficient that the defendants either know those facts or were criminally negligent in failing to know them.see,in every crime or public offense there must exist a union,or joint operation of act and intent,or criminal negligence people valdez,supra,cal th,d,people linwood th,d.defendants here do not argue that a violation of section requires that the seller actually knew that the security he sold should have been registered however,they contend that criminal liability requires that a seller of securities either knew the security was not exempt from registration or was criminally negligent in failing to know.the attorney general,on the other hand,argues that a seller is guilty if he willfully that is,an unregistered security,without regard to whether the seller knew or should have known that the security should have been registered.
we addressed a similar issue in in people simon cal th,d,simon.the defendant there was convicted of violating section,which prohibits the purchase or sale of securities by means of any written or oral communication which includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made not misleading.simon held that knowledge of the falsity or misleading nature of a statement or of the materiality of an omission,or criminal negligence in failing to investigate and discover them,are elements of the criminal offense described in section.simon,supra,cal th at,d.
simon set out several reasons for that conclusion.first,it reasoned that because section,which states the penalty for a violation of section,requires a willful violation,section is a general intent crime,not one of strict liability.simon,supra,cal th at,d.simon noted that general intent crimes ordinarily require mens rea or guilty knowledge.id.at,d,see,in every crime or public offense there must exist a union,or joint operation of act and intent,or criminal negligence.after observing that criminal liability may be imposed despite a lack of guilty knowledge where the purpose is to protect public health and safety and the penalties are relatively light simon,supra,cal th at,d,citing people vogel cal d,fn,simon pointed out that section does not involve conduct which threatens the public health or safety simon,supra,cal th at,d,and that the punishment for a violation of that statute is not a light one ibid 
next,simon asserted that section was based on section of the federal securities exchange act of et,which contains an express requirement of guilty knowledge,and that section was modeled after section a of that act,which some,but not all,federal courts have construed as requiring guilty knowledge.simon,supra,cal th at,d.simon noted also that section b of the federal securities exchange act of,which prohibits a manipulative or deceptive device in connection with a sale,was construed by the united states supreme court as requiring guilty knowledge.simon,supra,cal th at,d,citing ernst ernst hochfelder,d.and simon observed that former california corporations commissioner robert volk and professor harold marsh,described by simon as having major responsibility for drafting the state corporate securities law of,had asserted s ection was intended to impose criminal liability only for an intentional misstatement.simon,supra,cal th at,d,discussing marsh volk,practice under the cal.securities laws ed.
simon further observed that section,which provides a civil remedy against a defendant who violates section,states that there is no liability if the defendant exercised reasonable care and did not know or if he had exercised reasonable care would not have known of the untruth or omission.simon concluded that it would be incongruous,and possibly unconstitutional,to impose criminal a more serious sanction than civil guilty knowledge when civil liability required guilty knowledge.simon,supra,cal th at,d.
finally,simon invoked the rule of lenity the defendant is entitled to the benefit of every reasonable doubt,whether it arise out of a question of fact,or as to the true interpretation of words or the construction of language used in a statute.simon,supra,cal th at,d,quoting in re tartar cal d.
the court of appeal in corey,supra,th,d,asserted that some of the reasons we put forward in simon,supra,cal th,d,to support a requirement for guilty knowledge in section fraudulent sale of securities do not apply to the sale of unregistered securities in violation of section.the attorney general advances the same arguments here.
first,the attorney general points out that in simon,supra,cal th at pages,d,this court relied on the express requirement of guilty knowledge in section,which permits a civil cause of action against a seller who makes misleading statements in the sale of a security,as one ground for requiring guilty knowledge for criminal liability.in an attempt to distinguish simon,the court of appeal in corey noted that the corporate securities law of does not expressly require guilty knowledge in a civil action against a seller of unregistered securities.corey,supra,th at,d.
second,corey,supra,th at page,d,observed that in simon we stated that marsh and volk,who were involved in drafting the corporate securities law of see ante,d at,at,said that only intentional misstatements in the sale of securities incur criminal liability.see simon,supra,cal th at,d.in contrast,corey notes,marsh and volk assert that the sale of an unregistered security is considered a strict liability offense.corey,supra,th at,d quoting marsh volk,practice under the cal.securities laws,supra.
the court of appeal in corey asserted a third ground for distinguishing simon,supra,cal th,d,but that ground is not valid.it asserted that the magnitude of potential criminal penalties for selling an unregistered security in violation of section,which corey described as carrying a fine of million and a prison term,was much less than the maximum five years imprisonment for making misleading statements in the sale of a security.corey,supra,th at,d.but corey was wrong in its description of the maximum penalty for sale of an unregistered security it is three years imprisonment,not one year.see.moreover,even a felony penalty,let alone a million fine,would argue strongly for a guilty knowledge requirement.see people coria cal th,d.
in short,two of the five reasons we gave in simon,supra,cal th,d,for requiring guilty knowledge for a violation of section sale by misrepresentation or omission are unique to that section and can not be invoked to require guilty knowledge for the sale of an unregistered security in violation of section.but the core reason for simon conclusion to require guilty knowledge is the principle that mens rea generally attaches to criminal offenses except for those that involve public health or safety and impose relatively light penalties.that principle applies here because defendants were charged with crimes that do not relate to public health and safety and impose relatively severe punishment.see staples united states,d in re jorge cal th,d,people vogel,supra,cal d at.we therefore reject the attorney general contention that our decision in simon should be distinguished from this case the same principles should apply whether a defendant is charged with selling an unregistered security,as occurred here,or with making misleading statements or omissions in selling a security,as in simon.
the attorney general also challenges simon analysis of the legislative history of the statutes it construed.he claims simon was mistaken when it said that section,which prescribes the punishment for violations of the corporate securities law of,was modeled on section of the federal securities exchange act of et.the wording of section,he asserts,more closely resembles section,subdivision a,of the american law institute proposed uniform securities act,and the commentary to that section states that,by requiring a willful violation,the statute requires only that the person act intentionally,in the sense that he was aware of what he was doing.
the attorney general also points out that former section,the predecessor to current section,prohibited knowingly selling an unauthorized security.stats,ch.the legislature omission of the term knowingly in section,he argues,suggests that it did not intend to require actual knowledge for a violation.simon,supra,cal th,d,itself noted that the word knowingly does not appear in section,but said that the absence of that word was not in itself sufficient to compel a conclusion that a criminal statute does not require guilty knowledge even though that statute imposes severe penalties.simon,at,d.in simon,we specifically disapproved people johnson d,in which the court of appeal had incorrectly asserted that t he omission of knowingly from a penal statute indicates that guilty knowledge scienter is not an element of the offense.simon,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
the attorney general arguments finding fault with this court discussion of the legislative history of the corporate securities law of in simon,supra,cal th,d,do not offer grounds for distinguishing that case here instead,they suggest that simon analysis was wrong and that we should overrule that case.we are not persuaded.in simon,we invited the legislature to clarify which criminal violations of section,enacted as part of the corporate securities law of includes both sales by misrepresentation or omission the issue in simon and sales of an unregistered security the issue here are strict liability offenses and what mental states are elements of those which require scienter.simon,supra,cal th at,fn,d.but although the legislature has frequently amended the corporate securities law of in the years since we decided simon,it has not abrogated simon or clarified the mens rea of crimes punishable under section.we infer legislative acquiescence in simon conclusion that a conviction for unlawful sale of securities that entails a relatively severe punishment requires guilty knowledge.see colmenares braemar country club cal th,d,fukuda city of angels cal th,d,people bouzas cal d.
moreover,during this period we have frequently relied on simon to require guilty knowledge for violation of a number of criminal statutes even though the statutes did not expressly require that the defendant act knowingly.
for instance,in people hagen cal th,d,we construed the term willfully in revenue and taxation code former section,subdivision a,which made it a felony to willfully make and subscribe a tax return that he or she does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter,former,as amended by stats,ch,repealed by stats,ch.we held that a violation of this statute required more than volitional action it required bad faith or evil intent.people hagen,supra,at,d.
in people coria,supra,cal th,d,we held that a conviction for manufacturing methamphetamine health,subd.a required proof that the defendant knew the substance being manufactured was methamphetamine.people coria,supra,cal th at,d.our decision relied on our holding in simon,supra,cal th at page,d,that mens rea is the rule rather than the exception,particularly for crimes with severe penalties.people coria,supra,cal th at,d.
people rubalcava cal th,d,said that because the crime of carrying a concealed dirk or dagger,subd.a criminalizes traditionally lawful conduct,we construe the statute to contain a knowledge element.citation.thus,to commit the offense,a defendant must still have the requisite guilty mind that is,the defendant must knowingly and intentionally carry concealed upon his or her person an instrument that is capable of ready use as a stabbing weapon.citation.a defendant who does not know that he is carrying the weapon or that the concealed instrument may be used as a stabbing weapon is therefore not guilty of violating section.people rubalcava,supra,cal th at,d.
in re jorge,supra,cal th,d,held that in a prosecution for possession of an assault weapon in violation of penal code section,subdivision b,the people bear the burden of proving the defendant knew or reasonably should have known the firearm possessed the characteristics bringing it within the assault weapons control act.in re jorge,supra,cal th at,d.
people garcia,supra,cal th,d,held that because the crime of willful failure to register as a sex offender under penal code section involved a failure to act,a defendant could not be found guilty unless the defendant actually knew of his duty to register.garcia,at,d.people barker cal th,d,confirmed that a violation of penal code section required guilty knowledge,but held that the defendant,aware of his duty to register,could not defend on the ground that he forgot the critical date of registration.
in view of the repeated judicial affirmation of simon,supra,cal th,d,in this line of precedent,we reject the attorney general suggestion that we overrule simon,and instead,following the reasoning in that decision,hold that a defendant is not guilty of the crime of selling an unregistered security in violation of section if there is a reasonable doubt whether the defendant knew the security was not exempt from regulation or was criminally negligent in failing to know that the security was not exempt 
iii.lack of guilty knowledge as an affirmative defense 
according to the attorney general,including a guilty knowledge requirement in section prohibition on the sale of unregistered securities will seriously hamper enforcement of that provision.he points out that there are many grounds for exempting a security from registration.see listing grounds for exemption,listing five grounds,eight grounds,authorizing commissioner by rule to establish additional grounds for exemption.the attorney general contends that it would be virtually impossible for the prosecution to prove as part of its that a defendant did not believe the security exempt under any of these grounds.
the legislature anticipated the problems caused by the multiplicity of exemptions.section provides in any proceeding under this law,the burden of proving an exemption or an exception from a definition is upon the person claiming it.as this court noted in simon,however,because an exemption defense is not collateral to the defendant guilt of a charge of selling unqualified securities,a defendant burden is only to raise a reasonable doubt that the defendant sold nonexempt secur
