hedge funds are notoriously difficult to define.the term appears nowhere in the federal securities laws,and even industry participants do not agree upon a single definition.see,sec roundtable on hedge funds may,comments of david vaughan,available at http citing fourteen different definitions found in government and industry publications.the term is commonly used as a for any pooled investment vehicle that is privately organized,administered by professional investment managers,and not widely available to the public.president working group on financial markets,hedge funds,leverage,and the lessons of capital management working group report see also implications of the growth of hedge funds staff report to the united states securities and exchange commission staff report defining hedge fund as an entity that holds a pool of securities and perhaps other assets,whose interests are not sold in a registered public offering and which is not registered as an investment company under the investment company act.
hedge funds may be defined more precisely by reference to what they are not.the investment company act of,et,directs the commission to regulate any issuer of securities that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing,reinvesting,or trading in securities.id.a a.although this definition nominally describes hedge funds,most are exempt from the investment company act coverage because they have one hundred or fewer beneficial owners and do not offer their securities to the public,id.c,or because their investors are all qualified high individuals or institutions,id.c investment vehicles that remain private and available only to highly sophisticated investors have historically been understood not to present the same dangers to public markets as more widely available investment companies,like mutual funds see staff report,supra,at.
exemption from regulation under the investment company act allows hedge funds to engage in very different investing behavior than their mutual fund counterparts.while mutual funds,for example,must register with the commission and disclose their investment positions and financial condition,id,hedge funds typically remain secretive about their positions and strategies,even to their own investors.see staff report,supra,at.the investment company act places significant restrictions on the types of transactions registered investment companies may undertake.such companies are,for example,foreclosed from trading on margin or engaging in short sales,a,and must secure shareholder approval to take on significant debt or invest in certain types of assets,such as real estate or commodities,id.a.these transactions are all core elements of most hedge funds trading strategies.see staff report,supra,at.hedging transactions,from which the term hedge fund developed,see willa gibson,is hedge fund regulation necessary,temp,involve taking both long and short positions on debt and equity securities to reduce risk.this is still the most frequently used hedge fund strategy,see staff report,supra,at,though there are many others.hedge funds trade in all sorts of assets,from traditional stocks,bonds,and currencies to more exotic financial derivatives and even assets.see,kate kelly,creative financing defying the odds,hedge funds bet billions on movies,wall,at.hedge funds often use leverage to increase their returns.
another distinctive feature of hedge funds is their management structure.unlike mutual funds,which must comply with detailed requirements for independent boards of directors,and whose shareholders must explicitly approve of certain actions,id,domestic hedge funds are usually structured as limited partnerships to achieve maximum separation of ownership and management.in the typical arrangement,the general partner manages the fund or several funds for a fixed fee and a percentage of the gross profits from the fund.the limited partners are passive investors and generally take no part in management activities.see staff report,supra,at.
hedge fund advisers also had been exempt from regulation under the investment advisers act of,et.advisers act,a companion statute to the investment company act,and the statute which primarily concerns us in this case.enacted by congress to substitute a philosophy of full disclosure for the philosophy of caveat emptor in the investment advisory profession,sec capital gains research bureau,d,the advisers act is mainly a registration and statute.investment advisers must register with the commission,and all advisers are prohibited from engaging in fraudulent or deceptive practices,id.by keeping a census of advisers,the commission can better respond to,initiate,and take remedial action on complaints against fraudulent advisers.see id.authorizing the commission to examine registered advisers records.
hedge fund general partners meet the definition of investment adviser in the advisers act.see defining investment adviser as one who for compensation,engages in the business of advising others,either directly or through publications or writings,as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in,purchasing,or selling securities abrahamson fleschner,cir holding that hedge fund general partners are investment advisers,overruled in part on other grounds by transamerica mortgage advisors,lewis,d.but they usually satisfy the private adviser exemption from registration in b of the act,b.that section exempts any investment adviser who during the course of the preceding twelve months has had fewer than fifteen clients and who neither holds himself out generally to the public as an investment adviser nor acts as an investment adviser to any investment company registered under the investment company act.id.as applied to limited partnerships and other entities,the commission had interpreted this provision to refer to the partnership or entity itself as the adviser client.see b.even the largest hedge fund managers usually ran fewer than fifteen hedge funds and were therefore exempt.
although the commission has a history of interest in hedge funds,see staff report,supra,at,the current push for regulation had its origins in the failure of capital management,a greenwich,fund that had more than billion in assets under management at its peak.in late,the fund nearly collapsed.almost all of the country major financial institutions were put at risk due to their credit exposure to,and the president of the federal reserve bank of new york personally intervened to engineer a bailout of the fund in order to avoid a national financial crisis.see generally roger lowenstein,when genius failed the rise and fall of capital management.
a joint working group of the major federal financial regulators produced a report recommending regulatory changes to the regime governing hedge funds,and the commission staff followed with its own report about the state of hedge fund regulation.drawing on the conclusions in the staff report,the the dissent of two of its the rule under review in december after notice and comment.the commission cited three recent shifts in the hedge fund industry to justify the need for increased regulation.first,despite the failure of capital management,hedge fund assets grew by percent from to.hedge fund rule.at.second,the commission noticed a trend toward retailization of hedge funds that increased the exposure of ordinary investors to such funds.this retailization was driven by hedge funds loosening their investment requirements,the birth of funds of hedge funds that offered shares to the public,and increased investment in hedge funds by pension funds,universities,endowments,foundations,and other charitable organizations.see id.at.third,the commission was concerned about an increase in the number of fraud actions brought against hedge funds.see id.at.concluding that its current regulatory program for hedge fund advisers was inadequate,id.at,the commission moved to require hedge fund advisers to register under the advisers act so that it could gather basic information about hedge fund advisers and the hedge fund industry,oversee hedge fund advisers,and deter or detect fraud by unregistered hedge fund advisers,id.
the hedge fund rule first defines a private fund as an investment company that a is exempt from registration under the investment company act by virtue of having fewer than one hundred investors or only qualified investors,see c,b permits its investors to redeem their interests within two years of investing and c markets itself on the basis of the skills,ability or expertise of the investment adviser.b d.for these private funds,the rule then specifies that f or purposes of section b of the advisers act b,you must count as clients the shareholders,limited partners,members,or beneficiaries of the fund.id.b a.the rule had the effect of requiring most hedge fund advisers to register by february,
the dissenting commissioners disputed the factual predicates for the new rule and its wisdom.goldstein makes some of the same points but the major thrust of his complaint is that the commission action misinterpreted b of the advisers act,a charge the commission dissenters also leveled.this provision exempts from registration any investment adviser who during the course of the preceding twelve months has had fewer than fifteen clients.b emphasis added.the act does not define client.relying on chevron natural resources defense council,d,the commission believes this renders the statute ambiguous as to a method for counting clients.br.for resp.there is no such rule of law.the lack of a statutory definition of a word does not necessarily render the meaning of a word ambiguous,just as the presence of a definition does not necessarily make the meaning clear.a definition only pushes the problem back to the meaning of the defining terms.see alarm indus.commc ns comm.fcc,doris day animal league veneman.
if congress employs a term susceptible of several meanings,as many terms are,it scarcely follows that congress has authorized an agency to choose any one of those meanings.as always,the words of the statute should be read in context,the statute place in the overall statutory scheme should be considered,and the problem congress sought to solve should be taken into account to determine whether congress has foreclosed the agency interpretation.pdk labs.dea,pdk i internal quotation marks omitted.
client may mean different things depending on context.the client of a laundry occupies a very different position than the client of a lawyer.even for professional representation,the specific indicia of a client,fees,duties,and the with the profession and with the particulars of the situation.an relationship,for example,can be formed without any signs of formal employment.see restatement third of the law governing lawyers cmt.c the client need not necessarily pay or agree to pay the lawyer and paying a lawyer does not by itself create a relationship.matters may be very different for the client of,say,an architectural firm.
the commission believes that an amendment to b suggests the possibility that an investor in a hedge fund could be counted as a client of the fund adviser.in,congress added to b the following language for purposes of determining the number of clients of an investment adviser under this paragraph,no shareholder,partner,or beneficial owner of a business development company shall be deemed to be a client of such investment adviser unless such person is a client of such investment adviser separate and apart from his status as a shareholder,partner,or beneficial owner.act of,stat.this language was inserted against a backdrop of uncertainty created by the second circuit decision in abrahamson fleschner.the abrahamson court held that hedge fund general partners were investment advisers under the advisers act,at.in its original opinion,the court specified that the general partners were advisers to the limited partners.see robert hacker ronald rotunda,sec registration of private investment partnerships after abrahamson fleschner,colum.the final published opinion omits those four words,see abrahamson,at,suggesting that the court expressly declined to resolve any ambiguity in the term client.we generally was aware of this judicial confusion,see,llc librarian of congress,the amendment could be seen as congress acknowledgment that client is ambiguous in the context of b.there are statements in the legislative history that suggest as much.see,at w ith respect to persons or firms which do not advise business development companies,the amendment is not intended to suggest that each shareholder,partner,or beneficial owner of a company advised by such person or firm should or should not be regarded as a client emphasis added.although the views of a subsequent congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one,pdk i,at quoting united states price,d,the amendment might be seen as introducing another definitional possibility into the statute.see pdk labs.dea,
on the other hand,a amendment to appears to reflect congress understanding at the time that investment company entities,not their shareholders,were the advisers clients.in the amendment,congress eliminated a separate exemption from registration for advisers who advised only investment companies and explicitly made the exemption unavailable to such advisers.investment company amendments act of,stat.this latter prohibition would have been unnecessary if the shareholders of investment companies could be counted as clients.
another section of the advisers act strongly suggests that congress did not intend shareholders,limited partners,members,or beneficiaries of a hedge fund to be counted as clients.although the statute does not define client,it does define investment adviser as any person who,for compensation,engages in the business of advising others,either directly or through publications or writings,as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in,purchasing,or selling securities.emphasis added.an investor in a private fund may benefit from the adviser advice or he may suffer from it but he does not receive the advice directly.he invests a portion of his assets in the fund.the fund the disposition of the pool of capital in the fund.the adviser does not tell the investor how to spend his money the investor made that decision when he invested in the fund.having bought into the fund,the investor fades into the background his role is completely passive.if the person or entity controlling the fund is not an investment adviser to each individual investor,then a fortiori each investor can not be a client of that person or entity.these are just two sides of the same coin.
this had been the commission view until it issued the new rule.as recently as,it explained that a client of an investment adviser typically is provided with individualized advice that is based on the client financial situation and investment objectives.in contrast,the investment adviser of an investment company need not consider the individual needs of the company shareholders when making investment decisions,and thus has no obligation to ensure that each security purchased for the company portfolio is an appropriate investment for each shareholder.status of investment advisory programs under the investment company act of.the commission said much the same in when it promulgated a rule with respect to investment companies set up as limited partnerships rather than as corporations.the client for purposes of the rule of b is the limited partners
