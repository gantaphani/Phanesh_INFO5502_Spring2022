this appeal follows an investment company act of ica action seeking to impose personal liability on the independent trustees of a mutual fund for the of an investment advisory contract.after a trial,the jury determined that the independent trustees acted within their discretion under the business judgment rule in replacing the investment adviser.
are shareholders and former shareholders of the navellier series fund fund the original investment adviser of the fund,navellier management,nmi and louis navellier,an interested trustee of the fund collectively,appellants.are three former independent trustees of the simon,kenneth sletten,and lawrence bianchi collectively,independent trustees roy adams,counsel for the independent trustees massachusetts financial services mfs,former investment adviser of the fund and arnold scott,former trustee of the mfs series trust collectively,appellees.
appellants challenge the district court proceedings on numerous grounds,complaining about,trial,and rulings.sletten both an imposition of sanctions against him and his counsel,and the dismissal of his counterclaim for breach of contract.we reject all of appellants many claims,uphold the jury verdict exonerating the independent trustees,and affirm the judgment of the district court against appellants.on sletten,we affirm dismissal of his counterclaim but grant limited relief,holding that the district court abused its discretion in affirming the imposition of sanctions against sletten and his counsel.
facts and procedural background 
on may,navellier organized the fund as a delaware business trust that would invest in an investment company or mutual fund.navellier and one of his employees,jack drinkwater served as interested trustees,while simon,sletten,and bianchi served as independent trustees sam kornhauser,navellier attorney,was hired as fund counsel 
on the day the fund was organized,the fund entered into an investment advisory agreement with nmi.under this agreement,nmi provided investment advice and managed the fund assets.the initial term of the investment advisory contract was two years,annually renewable if approved by a majority of the independent trustees.
in january,the independent trustees sought independent counsel.in october,they hired adams,an experienced mutual fund attorney,as independent counsel.adams advised the independent trustees that,to fulfill their fiduciary obligations to the shareholders of the fund,it was necessary to obtain certain financial information about nmi in order to conduct their annual review of the investment advisory agreement.adams also told the independent trustees that he had concern about kornhauser abilities.adams expressed the opinion that kornhauser should not continue as counsel for the fund while he remained counsel for nmi,navellier,and navellier other businesses.
at a board of trustees meeting on april,navellier presented a motion to the trustees of the fund to merge the fund into the navellier performance funds.this merger would have been a reorganization.the assets of the fund would have been transferred to a portfolio of the navellier performance funds in exchange for the shares of the navellier performance funds.the merger would have terminated the independent trustees positions.
the independent trustees deferred consideration of navellier merger proposal because they concluded that further consideration would be premature given that the disinterested trustees did not have any advance notice or information as to the relative merits of the proposal.the next order of business for the meeting was the annual review of the investment advisory agreement.the independent trustees expressed frustration at being asked to review and approve the investment advisory agreement without having received requested information from kornhauser or nmi.the independent trustees then voiced their concern as to whether kornhauser should continue as counsel to the fund.a contentious discussion ensued,after which navellier threatened to terminate his relationship with the fund and left the meeting.the independent trustees then voted to remove kornhauser as counsel to the fund.
the independent trustees conditioned their future consideration of the merger proposal on review of certain information concerning the finances of navellier and his companies.after navellier refused to provide this information,the independent trustees contacted the securities and exchange commission sec in an effort to compel navellier to produce the information.this effort to obtain the sec assistance in compelling this information did not succeed.thereafter,the independent trustees decided to put navellier proposed merger to a shareholder vote by way of a proxy prepared by nmi.
pending resolution of the merger proposal,the independent trustees held a board of trustees meeting on march,and voted not to renew nmi investment advisory contract,which was scheduled to expire by its terms on march.the independent trustees also voted to hire mfs as the fund investment adviser.mfs conditioned its agreement to become investment administrator on assurances that the current trustees would not continue as trustees after the vote of the fund shareholders.
navellier and alpers filed a complaint on april,seeking to enjoin the independent trustees from removing them as interested trustees.navellier also requested injunctive relief to block the investment advisory agreement with mfs so nmi could regain its former position as investment adviser.
on april,the independent trustees voted to remove navellier and alpers from their positions as interested trustees.according to appellants,the independent trustees undertook this allegedly wrongful act to entrench themselves more completely,to neutralize opposition to their upcoming proxy,and to ratify their decision to hire mfs.the independent trustees then eliminated the two positions formerly held by navellier and alpers,reducing the trustees of the fund.
on may,after the reorganization of the board of trustees,a shareholder vote was held to determine whether mfs should continue as investment adviser to the fund.the proposal to retain mfs failed,receiving less than the required vote of shareholders.navellier refused to return to the fund unless the independent trustees released him from liability and agreed to resign as trustees.the independent trustees signed a release,returned management of the fund to nmi,and resigned.
on february,appellants filed a first amended class action complaint.the amended complaint alleged the following claims breach of fiduciary duty under the ica and delaware law against the independent trustees,mfs,and scott breach of fiduciary duty and negligence under california law against adams and waste and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage against all defendants.the independent trustees answered and filed a counterclaim for indemnity.sletten also filed a separate counterclaim for breach of contract and bad faith.the district court made several rulings,which left for trial only appellants claims for breach of fiduciary duty and waste against the independent trustees and the independent trustees counterclaims for indemnification.the district court later dismissed appellees indemnity counterclaims without prejudice on appellees motion.
jury trial commenced on june.after a trial,the jury returned a unanimous verdict for the independent trustees on all claims.the district court entered judgment on august.on september,appellants filed motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial.the district court denied both motions.this appeal and followed.
discussion 
rulingsa.dismissal of claims against adams 
appellants contend that the district court erroneously dismissed the claims against adams for breach of fiduciary duty and negligence pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.we disagree.
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.wyler summit turner broad,cir.a key element of any action for professional malpractice is the establishment of a duty by the professional to the claimant.absent duty there can be no breach and no negligence.goldberg frye,d.see also skarbrevik cohen,england whitfield,d.an attorney generally will not be held liable to a third person not in privity of contract with him since he owes no duty to anyone other than his client.
applying california law,which the parties agree is controlling here,the california supreme court has explained that the determination of whether the duty undertaken by an attorney extends to a third person not in privity involves the balancing of various factors.these factors include the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff,the foreseeability of harm to him,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered,the moral blame attached to the defendant conduct,and the policy of preventing future harm.goodman kennedy,cal d,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
applying these factors here,the district court correctly held that adams,by advising the independent trustees,did not assume a duty of care to the fund shareholders.the district court reasoned that the shareholders were not the intended beneficiaries of adams counsel to the independent trustees the harm alleged by the appellants,capital gains taxes was not a foreseeable result of adams conduct the connection between adams advice to the independent trustees and the alleged injury was remote and tenuous no moral blame could be attached to adams conduct in advising the independent trustees of their obligations under the law and strong public policy reasons militated against finding any duty owed by adams to the shareholders.
we see no sound basis for disagreement with this analysis.adams was representing the independent trustees.nothing in that relationship suggested that he owed a duty to the shareholders of the fund.to imply such a duty would be contrary to the sound policy requiring his undivided loyalty to his clients.we hold that the district court properly dismissed appellants claims against adams for breach of fiduciary duty and negligence.
dismissal of ica claims against mfs and scott 
appellants contend that the district court erroneously dismissed their claims against mfs and scott for breach of fiduciary duty under the ica pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court addressed three theories in dismissing appellants claims against mfs and scott for breach of fiduciary duty under the ica.we address each theory in turn.
fiduciary duty 
the ica expressly provides that decisions regarding the renewal of investment advisory contracts are within the sole discretion of a fund independent trustees.
i t shall be unlawful for any registered investment company having a board of directors to renew any contract or agreement whereby a person undertakes regularly to serve or act as investment adviser for such company,unless the terms of such contract or agreement and any renewal thereof have been approved by the vote of a majority of directors,who are not parties to such contract or agreement or interested persons of any such party 
c emphasis added.
mfs is not alleged to have been,and never was,a trustee of the fund.in fact,mfs did not become the fund investment adviser until march,two days after the independent trustees decided not to renew nmi contract.further,according to the declaration of trust,a trustee must be a natural person.similarly,the independent trustees did not appoint scott as a trustee of the fund until april,nearly one month after the independent trustees voted not to renew nmi contract.additionally,because scott was an officer and director of mfs,he served as an interested trustee of the fund.by the plain terms of the ica,interested persons are prohibited from participating in the vote to retain or replace an investment adviser.see c.
the district court properly concluded that neither mfs nor scott were trustees to the therefore did not owe a fiduciary duty to the the independent trustees decided to change investment advisers.
de facto investment adviser 
appellants argue that mfs and scott owed a fiduciary duty because they were,in substance,acting as trustee and investment adviser prior to march,irrespective of a formal agreement.the contention that mfs and scott were de facto investment advisers has no basis in law and is contrary to the plain language of the ica.
appellants rely on lutz boas.lutz,however,does not support the argument that a party becomes a trustee or investment adviser to fund shareholders simply by advocating its investment advisory services to the trustees.rather,lutz provides that where the agent of an investment advisory company enters into an explicit agreement with and receives compensation from a fund for advisory services,with the knowledge of the investment advisory company,the company can not avoid ica regulation by refusing to enter into a formal investment advisory services agreement.id.at.
here,appellants failed to allege that mfs or scott entered into any informal that they received compensation for any purported advisory services.lutz does not support appellants theory that mfs and scott were de facto trustees or investment advisers under the ica.
appellants also contend that they are helped by the terms advisory board and director under the ica,arguing that mfs became an advisory board and scott a director because they urged the independent trustees to replace nmi.this argument fails under the plain language of the ica.
the ica defines advisory board as an elected or appointed board with advisory functions as to investments.a emphasis added.director is defined as any director of a corporation or any person performing similar functions with respect to any organization.a.appellants have not alleged that mfs was elected or appointed in any capacity prior to the independent trustees of nmi contract.nor have appellants alleged that scott was performing the functions of a director before the of nmi contract.
the district court properly concluded that mfs and scott were not de facto investment advisers owing a fiduciary duty to the shareholders of the fund.
the district court also properly concluded that mfs and scott can not be held liable for breach of fiduciary duty under the ica on the theory that they controlled the independent trustees.
the ica defines control as the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company,unless such power is solely the result of an official position with such company.a.mfs and scott could not have been control persons under the ica,however,because the independent trustees do not fall within the definition of controlled persons under the ica.a natural person shall be presumed not to be a controlled person within the meaning of this subchapter.a.this presumption can only be overcome by a determination to the contrary made by the commission.id.no such determination has been made by the sec here.mfs and scott can not be held liable for breach of fiduciary duty under a theory of control.
we hold that the district court properly dismissed appellants claims against mfs and scott for breach of fiduciary duty under the ica 
dismissal of delaware claims against mfs and scott 
appellants also contend that the district court erroneously dismissed its claims against mfs and scott for breach of fiduciary duty under delaware common law.the district court addressed two theories in dismissing appellants claims against mfs and scott for breach of fiduciary duty under delaware law.
fiduciary duty 
as discussed above,neither mfs nor scott owed a fiduciary duty to the fund when the independent trustees decided not to renew nmi contract to provide investment advisory services.appellants cite no authority for the proposition that a third party with no contractual or legal relationship to the fund can become subject to a fiduciary duty merely because it provided information about its services to the independent trustees.delaware law is to the contrary.see gilbert el paso,state law claims of breach of fiduciary relationship must subsist on the actuality of a specific legal relationship,not in its potential.
the district court properly determined that because neither mfs nor scott owed a fiduciary duty to the shareholders of the fund when the independent trustees decided not to renew nmi contract,neither can be liable for breach of fiduciary duty under delaware law.
the district court also correctly held that neither mfs nor scott controlled the independent trustees under delaware law.see harriman dupont de nemours,i t is only when a person affirmatively undertakes to dictate the destiny of the corporation that he assumes such a fiduciary duty gilbert,at outsiders do not become fiduciaries simply because they have a superior bargaining position with management there must be domination through actual exercise of direction over corporate conduct.
here,appellants failed to do not offer on facts to establish that mfs and scott affirmatively dictated the destiny of the fund or dominated through actual exercise of direction over the independent trustees.
we hold that the district court properly dismissed appellants claims against mfs and scott for breach of fiduciary duty under delaware common law 
dismissal of waste and interference with prospective economic advantage claims against mfs and scott 
appellants contend that the district court erroneously dismissed navellier claims against mfs and scott for waste and for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.appellants arguments are without merit.
the parties agree that delaware law is controlling on this issue.delaware courts have explained that the legal test for waste is severe.glazer zapata.directors are guilty of corporate waste,only when they authorize an exchange that is so one sided that no business person of ordinary,sound judgment could conclude that the corporation has received adequate consideration.id.
we hold that the district court properly dismissed the waste claims asserted against mfs and scott.under delaware law,there is no basis for a waste claim against these parties who were not directors.moreover,appellants first amended complaint itself established that a shareholder proxy vote was legally required pursuant to rule of the ica,which also shows there could have been no waste.
interference with prospective economic advantage 
california recognizes a competition privilege,which protects one from liability for inducing a third person not to enter into a prospective contractual relation with a business competitor.
the privilege applies where a the relation between the competitor and third person concerns a matter involved in the competition between the actor and the competitor,and b the actor does not employ improper means,and c the actor does not intend thereby to create or continue an illegal restraint of competition,and d the actor purpose is at least in part to advance his interest in his competition with the other.
bed,bath beyond of la jolla,la jolla vill.square venture partners,th,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.see also penna toyota motor sales,cal th,d,cal holding that plaintiff who seeks to recover for an alleged interference with prospective economic relations must prove that the defendant engaged in conduct that was wrongful by some legal measure other than the fact of interference itself.the competition privilege clearly applies to mfs and scotts actions as alleged in the amended complaint,and nothing about their competitive conduct was wrongful.
we hold that the district court properly dismissed the claims against mfs and scott for intentional interference with a prospective economic advantage.
dismissal of counterclaims without prejudice 
appellants one paragraph without citation to the record or the district court abused its discretion in dismissing appellees indemnity counterclaims without prejudice.appellants contend that t he jury should have been informed that those claims had not merely vanished but that defendants might refile and seek million in attorneys fees 
appellants argument is frivolous.the decision to grant a voluntary dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure a is addressed to the sound discretion of the district court.sams beech aircraft,cir.a dismissal without prejudice pursuant to rule a leaves the parties where they would have stood had the lawsuit never been brought.in re corey,cir citation omitted.
appellants bare allegation of error does not demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing appellees indemnity counterclaims without prejudice.see hamilton firestone tire rubber,cir possibility of later suit does not rise to the level of legal prejudice that would allow the court to deny a dismissal without prejudice.
summary judgment on intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claim 
appellants allege that the district court erroneously granted summary judgment on nmi claim against the independent trustees for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.the district court correctly held that there were no triable issues of fact as to two essential elements of this claim.
we review de novo the district court order granting summary judgment.covey hollydale mobilehome estates,cir.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to appellants,we must determine whether there are genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court properly applied the law.forsyth humana,cir.
to state a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,a plaintiff must prove the reasonable probability of a business opportunity,the intentional interference by defendant with that opportunity,proximate causation,and damages,all of which must be considered in light of a defendant privilege to compete or protect his business interests in a fair and lawful manner.debonaventura nationwide mut.ins,internal citations omitted.see also crosstalk,jacobson,th,d stating elements of tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage under california law.
first,appellants failed to present evidence demonstrating a reasonable probability that nmi would continue as the investment adviser to the fund.appellants point to no evidence in the record which,when viewed in a light most favorable to their position,demonstrates that nmi had a reasonable expectation of continuing as the fund investment adviser.rather,appellants simply assert that a board that was acting with proper motives would have renewed nmi contract.this is not,however,evidence of a reasonable expectation of a continuing business relationship.the district court properly concluded that nmi did not have a reasonable expectation of continuing as the fund investment adviser 
appellants also failed to point to evidence demonstrating damages.as the district court noted,the claim must still fail because the damages flowing from defendants interference with this prospective business relationship are too speculative.it is law that damages which are speculative,remote,imaginary,contingent or merely possible can not serve as a legal basis for recovery.quoting mozzetti city of brisbane,d.
because appellants failed to present evidence demonstrating that nmi had a reasonable expectation of continuing as the fund investment adviser and did not establish actual damages,we hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment on nmi claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.
summary judgment on sletten counterclaims 
on,sletten contends that the district court erroneously granted summary judgment on the breach of contract counterclaims that he asserted against navellier and nmi.we disagree.
before returning the fund to navellier,sletten and the independent trustees executed the following release 
in consideration of the covenants,promises and agreements contained herein,donald simon,kenneth sletten and lawrence bianchi collectively trustees release and fully discharge louis navellier,navellier management,and their predecessors,successors and related entities from all rights,claims and causes of action of any kind or any nature whatsoever,known or unknown,in law or at equity,which the trustees have or may have against them except for any claim for contribution or indemnity in the event that any third party asserts claims and recovers against the trustees.
sletten concedes that,if valid and enforceable,this release bars his counterclaims.sletten contends,however,that there are genuine issues of fact as to whether the release is unenforceable on grounds of unconscionability or duress.
unconscionability 
under california law a court may refuse to enforce a facially valid contract that is unconscionable.see graham,cal d.unconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive aspect.the procedural aspect is manifested by oppression,which refers to an inequality of bargaining power resulting in no meaningful choice for the weaker party,or surprise,which occurs when the supposedly terms are hidden in a document.a m produce fmc,d.substantive unconscionability,on the other hand,refers to an overly harsh allocation of risks or costs which is not justified by the circumstances under which the contract was made.id.at.see also stirlen supercuts,th,d substantive unconscionability is indicated by contract terms so as to shock the conscience.both procedural and substantive unconscionability must be present before a contract or clause will be held unenforceable.carboni arrospide,th,d.
here,the record indicates that there are no genuine issues of material fact indicating that the challenged release was either procedurally or substantively unconscionable.as the district court noted,sletten freely chose to waive his legal rights in order to preserve the stability of the fund,he was by counsel,and he had adequate time to pursue other alternatives.and,as the district court properly found,the release is also not unconscionable because it was,nor does it shock the conscience.
a release may be invalidated on the ground of economic duress when a party is subject to a wrongful act such as a threat and must succumb to the wrongdoers or face financial ruin.sheehan atlanta int l ins,cir.the wrongful act must be sufficiently coercive to cause a reasonably prudent person faced with no reasonable alternative to succumb to the perpetrator pressure.id.quoting rich whillock,ashton,d.
there are no genuine issues of material fact indicating that the challenged release was procured though economic duress.sletten had more than one alternative to signing the release and accepting nmi return as investment adviser.sletten might have hired a company named neuberger and berman as investment adviser,liquidated the fund,appointed a receiver,or found another investment adviser.while sletten may have found these choices unattractive,the district court properly found that there was no economic duress,as none of these choices would have caused sletten to face economic ruin.
because there were no material issues of fact as to the validity or enforceability of the release,we hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment on sletten counterclaims.
class certification 
appellants contend that the district court abused its discretion by denying class certification pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.we review the denial of class certification for abuse of discretion,zinser accufix research,cir,and must determine whether the district court applied the proper legal criteria.while the trial court has broad discretion to certify a class,its discretion must be exercised within the framework of rule.id.
the district court gave five grounds for denying class certification pursuant to rule b,each of which sustains the denial.the district court held that individual questions predominate over common questions conflicts preclude certification kornhauser,as class counsel,can not adequately represent the class navellier was neither a typical nor adequate class representative and was subject to unique defenses and the remaining class members were not appropriate class representatives.
appellants challenge to the district court denial of class certification is supported by virtually no citations to authority and no citations to the record.for example,as to three of the district court independent grounds justifying denial of certification,appellants simply argue t here are no intra or interclass conflicts,there are no unique defenses as to navellier which would preclude him or any of the other plaintiffs from acting as class representatives.these bald assertions do not establish that the district court abused its discretion in denying class certification.
the district court correctly applied rule and each ground advanced is independently sufficient to support the denial of certification.see,valentino,cir failure to show predominance of individual questions georgine amchem,cir conflicts hatch reliance ins,cir class counsel inadequacy moore hughes helicopters,cir inadequate class representative.
we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying class certification.
ii.trial management 
time limitations 
appellants contend that the district court imposition of a time limit within which to present their case was prejudicial and deprived them of due process.this argument is without merit.
we review such challenges to trial court management for abuse of discretion.amarel connell,cir.trial courts have broad authority to impose reasonable time limits.id.such limits are useful to prevent undue delay,waste of time,or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.while trial courts have discretion to expedite the completion of trials,they must not adhere so rigidly to time limits as to sacrifice justice in the name of efficiency.signal mci telecomm,cir.
the district court exercised a normal role in establishing time limits at trial and did not abuse its discretion.at the pretrial conference,the court informed the parties that they would have eleven days,to be divided between them,for trial.appellants insisted they needed at least ten to twelve days to present their case in response,the district court extended the time allotted for trial to fourteen days,giving appellants eight days and appellees six days.these pretrial limits were adjusted during trial and appellants ultimately received a total of eleven days within which to present their amount entirely consistent with appellants original request.
the time limits imposed here were reasonably based on the parties estimates and were adjusted as appropriate during trial.amarel,at.the district court appears to have been fair and balanced in allocating the reasonably available time to all parties.there was no abuse of the broad discretion that the district court had to manage the trial.
evidentiary rulings 
appellants challenge evidentiary rulings made by the district court throughout the trial.we review the district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion and will not reverse in such a case,unless the ruling is manifestly erroneous.joiner,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
none of these challenges has merit and none requires our detailed discussion.as to each of the challenged rulings,appellants do not demonstrate that the district court action was manifestly erroneous.id.we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in making the challenged evidentiary rulings.
comment on accusations of perjury 
appellants argue that the district court improperly influenced the jury by accusing navellier of perjury.this argument is without merit.
during,navellier claimed that the independent trustees had perjured themselves at trial by testifying to the substance of a conference call between navellier and the independent trustees.in response to this accusation,the court admonished navellier all right.this is enough.that a very,very serious charge that he made under oath,and it could be perjurious.this could be a criminal proceeding.appellants counsel objected,and the court then immediately instructed the jury to disregard his prior comment 
all right.i think his objection is good,ladies and gentlemen of the jury,and the jury will disregard that statement of the court.
and i will,again,admonish you that nothing that the court says or does during the course of this trial should be taken in any way as indicating how your verdict should come out.
you,and you alone,are the sole judges of the facts in this case,and it your judgment that counts on the facts,it not the court.
trial courts have broad discretion to comment upon the evidence,including the credibility of a witness.see quercia united states.noting that in a jury trial in federal court,judge may express his opinion upon the facts,provided he makes it clear to the jury that all matters of fact are submitted to their determination citations omitted.the essential question is whether the court made clear to the jury that all matters of fact are for its determination.see also united states james,cir affirming conviction where court commented that the elements of the offense had been established,but also instructed the jury that it was the final arbiter of questions of fact.
we hold that the court here did not abuse its discretion by commenting on navellier testimony.the court did not distort the evidence and the court comment was not so as to amount to an abuse of discretion.see quercia,at.further,even if the comment could be considered prejudicial,any prejudice was cured by the court contemporaneous curative instruction and the final jury instructions,which stressed that the jurors were the sole judge of the facts.maheu hughes tool,cir.
imposition of sanctions against sletten 
on,sletten argues that the district court abused its discretion in affirming the special master imposition of sanctions against sletten and his counsel for abusive and oppressive discovery requests.sletten contends that the sanctions violated his right to due process because he and his counsel were not given notice or opportunity to be heard before the special master imposed sanctions.we agree.
we review the imposition of sanctions for abuse of discretion.primus auto.fin.servs.batarse,cir.when a court imposes sanctions sua sponte,the general rule is that it must first issue an order to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed to give the lawyer or party an opportunity to explain his or her conduct.see,tom growney,shelley irrigation,cir district court abused its discretion where n o notice was given of the court intention to impose sanctions and no opportunity was offered to explain the allegedly improper filings miranda pac.transp,cir district court abused its discretion where it did not provide the attorneys with an opportunity to show cause to the contrary before imposing the sanctions.
here,sletten and his counsel first received notice of the sanctions when they received a copy of the special master order imposing sanctions.this order was summarily approved by the district court.the special master abused its discretion by failing to give sletten and his counsel notice of his intent to impose sanctions before imposing sanctions.miranda,at.the further review by the district court that affirmed the sanctions provided no procedural relief.we therefore vacate the judgment of sanctions and remand to the district court with instructions that it provide an appropriate procedure to afford sletten and his counsel an opportunity to present a defense and explain why they should not be sanctioned.in so holding,we express no view on the merits whether sanctions may be sustainable after proper notice and opportunity to be heard.
iii.jury instructions 
appellants contend that two of the instructions given to the jury were erroneous.the standard of review on appeal for an alleged error in jury instructions depends on the nature of the claimed error.oglesby pac.transp,cir.if jury instructions are challenged as a misstatement of the law,we review the challenged instructions de novo.mockler multnomah county,cir.otherwise,we afford a district court substantial latitude in tailoring jury instructions,and we review the formulation of those instructions for abuse of discretion.gilbrook city of westminster,cir.
ica instruction 
appellants argue that the district court committed prejudicial error by refusing to instruct the jury that,absent an emergency or unforeseen event,section of the ica requires prior shareholder approval before an investment adviser may be replaced we disagree with appellants construction of the ica and we hold that the district court properly refused to give appellants requested instruction.
section a of the ica makes it unlawful to serve as an investment adviser except under a contract approved by the shareholders.see a.recognizing that an unavoidable lapse of time may occur between the end of one contract and the date on which a new contract is approved by a majority of shareholders,the sec promulgated rule,which provides in pertinent part 
notwithstanding section a of the act,a person may act as investment adviser for a fund pursuant to a written contract which has not been approved by a majority of the outstanding voting securities of such company during the one hundred and twenty day period after the termination of an investment advisory contract by an event other than an assignment by an investment adviser in connection with which such investment adviser,or a controlling person thereof,directly or indirectly receives money or other benefit described in paragraphs or of section a of the act or by the failure to renew such contract 
under the plain language of rule,this exemption is not limited to unforeseeable or terminations.as amicus curiae,the sec explains 
the availability of rule is not conditioned on a finding that either of the first two or termination of an advisory contract by the unforeseeable.rather,under the rule plain language,the only conditions are that the interim contract may not last more than days it must be approved by the directors,including a majority of the independent directors and the compensation under the contract may not exceed what would have been paid under the most recent contract that was approved by the shareholders.
see a and b.
appellants argue that appellees reliance on rule as legal grounds for their actions is legally wrong rule is an sec rule and is not necessarily the law if it does not carry out the intent of the statute a of the act.we disagree with appellants analysis.as we see it,rule is fully consistent with congressional intent,and indeed is reasonably necessary to implement the purposes of the ica.we see no reason here not to defer to the sensible and informed judgment of the sec,the agency charged with administering the statute.
section c of the ica grants the sec broad authority to exempt certain actions from the requirements of the ica.section c of the ica provides 
the commission,by rules and regulations upon its own motion,or by order upon application,may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person or transaction,or any class or classes of persons or transactions,from any provisions of this subchapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder,if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this title.
c.the authorization to exempt any person or transaction from the provisions of the ica when necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors reflects the congressional intent to entrust certain policy decisions to the sec.
in determining the appropriate scope of the exemption embodied by rule,the sec was required to balance two important investor protections in section a.on the one hand,the shareholder approval requirement ensures that fund investors have the authority to decide whether a particular investment adviser is retained by the fund.on the other hand,granting the trustees the authority to terminate or not renew an existing contract gives them critical oversight.deciding how to reconcile these provisions when their policies conflict is precisely the sort of judgment entrusted to the sec by congress.
appellants do not demonstrate that the sec promulgation of rule is inconsistent with the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the ica.s
