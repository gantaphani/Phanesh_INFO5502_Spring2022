plaintiff james robinson filed suit against thomas glynn,glynn scientific,and geophone company,llc,alleging that glynn committed federal securities fraud when he sold robinson a partial interest in geophone company.the district court found that robinson membership interest in geophone was not a security within the meaning of the federal securities laws,and it dismissed robinson securities fraud claim.because robinson was an active and knowledgeable executive at geophone,rather than a mere passive investor in the company,we affirm.to do otherwise would unjustifiably expand the scope of the federal securities laws by treating an ordinary commercial venture as an investment contract.
robinson appeals from a grant of summary judgment to glynn,and accordingly we take the facts in the light most favorable to robinson.see,mclean patten communities,cir.in,glynn organized geophone corporation to develop and commercially market the geophone telecommunications system.the geophone system was designed around a signal processing technology,convolutional ambiguity multiple access cama,that glynn purportedly designed.glynn was geophone corporation majority shareholder and chairman.in september,geophone corporation became a limited liability company,geophone company,llc.llcs are noncorporate business entities that offer their members limited liability,tax benefits,and organizational flexibility.
in march,glynn and his associates contacted james robinson,a businessman with no prior telecommunications experience,in an effort to raise capital for geophone.over the next several months,glynn met and corresponded with robinson,attempting to convince robinson to invest in geophone.glynn described to robinson the cama technology,its centrality to the geophone system,and business plan.in july,robinson agreed to loan glynn million so that glynn could perform a field test of the geophone system and the cama technology.
in addition to robinson loan,in august robinson and glynn executed a letter of intent,in which robinson pledged to invest up to million in geophone,llc if the field test indicated that cama worked in the geophone system.robinson million investment was to be comprised of his initial million loan,an immediate million investment upon successful completion of the field test,and a later million investment.in october,engineers hired by glynn performed the field test,but,apparently with glynn knowledge,they did not use cama in the test.nevertheless,glynn allegedly told robinson that the field test had been a success.
consistent with the letter of intent,in december robinson and glynn executed an agreement to purchase membership interests in geophone apmig.under the apmig,robinson agreed to convert his million loan and his million investment into equity and subsequently to invest the additional million.robinson and glynn also entered into an amended and restated geophone operating agreement argoa,which detailed the capital contribution,share ownership,and management structure of geophone.
pursuant to the argoa,robinson received of geophone shares.on the back of the share certificates that robinson received,the restrictive legend referred to the certificates as shares and securities.it also specified that the certificates were exempt from registration under the securities act of,and stated that the certificates could not be transferred without proper registration under the federal and state securities laws.
in addition,the argoa established a board of managers that was authorized to manage geophone affairs.two of the managers were to be appointed by robinson with the remaining five appointed by glynn and his brother.finally,the argoa vested management of geophone in robinson and glynn based on each member ownership share.robinson was named geophone treasurer,and he was appointed to the board of managers and the company executive committee.glynn served as geophone chairman and was intimately involved in the company operations and technical development.
trouble first surfaced only a few months later in april,when robinson sued glynn in maryland state court.robinson alleged breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,and conversion,all due to glynn purported mismanagement of geophone funds.in october,robinson and glynn settled the state court action,and as part of the settlement in november they entered into a membership interest purchase agreement mipa.under the mipa,robinson purchased all of glynn shares in geophone.
yet in robinson allegedly learned for the first time that the cama technology had never been implemented in the geophone even in the field test that had provided the basis for robinson investment.robinson then filed suit in federal court,claiming violation of the federal securities laws,specifically b of the securities exchange act of and rule.the district court,however,granted summary judgment to glynn,because it found that robinson membership interest in geophone,llc did not constitute a security under the federal securities laws.robinson now challenges the district court dismissal of his federal securities law claim 
in order to establish a claim under rule,robinson must prove fraud in connection with the purchase of securities.see gasner board of supervisors of the county of dinwiddie,cir.the securities act of,a,and the securities exchange act of,a,define a security broadly as any note,stock,treasury stock,security future,bond,debenture,investment contract,or,in general,any interest or instrument commonly known as a security.in this case,robinson claims that his membership interest in geophone,a limited liability company llc,qualifies as either an investment contract or stock under the securities acts.
the district court determined that robinson interest in geophone was not an investment contract,a question of law that we review de novo.the supreme court has defined an investment contract as a contract,transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.howey.the parties agree that robinson invested his money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits.their disagreement concerns whether robinson expected profits solely from the efforts of others,most notably glynn.
since howey,however,the supreme court has endorsed relaxation of the requirement that an investor rely only on others efforts,by omitting the word solely from its restatements of the howey test.see int l of teamsters daniel,d quoting united housing foundation,forman,d.and neither our court nor our sister circuits have required that an investor like robinson expect profits solely from the efforts of others.see rivanna trawlers unlimited thompson trawlers,cir citing cases.requiring investors to rely wholly on the efforts of others would exclude from the protection of the securities laws any agreement that involved even slight efforts from investors themselves.see bailey properties,cir.it would also exclude any agreement that offered investors control in theory,but denied it to them in fact.agreements do not annul the securities laws by retaining nominal powers for investors unable to exercise them.see id.at see also long shultz cattle,cir.
what matters more than the form of an investment scheme is the economic reality that it represents.see rivanna,at.the question is whether an investor,as a result of the investment agreement itself or the factual circumstances that surround it,is left unable to exercise meaningful control over his investment.see id.at see also williamson tucker,cir.elevating substance over form in this way ensures that the term investment contract embodies a flexible rather than a static principle,one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.howey,at.
in looking at the powers accorded robinson under geophone operating agreement,as well as robinson activity as an executive at geophone,it is clear that robinson was no passive investor heavily dependent on the efforts of others like glynn.under the argoa,management authority for geophone resided
