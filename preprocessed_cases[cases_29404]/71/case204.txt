we are asked to determine whether a broker disclosures to its customers regarding margin maintenance requirements for margin accounts complied with section b of the securities exchange act of the exchange act and rule,b,promulgated thereunder.wc capital management,llc wc,willow creek capital partners,wccp,and willow creek short biased fund,wcsb collectively,willow creek started this action against ubs securities,llc and ubs ag together,ubs,claiming a violation of rule.willow creek claimed that ubs violated rule by failing to fully disclose its generally applicable margin rules until after it demanded that willow creek provide additional collateral for its margin account.willow creek also alleged that ubs failed to provide adequate notice before it revised those rules.the united states district court for the southern district of new york hellerstein,granted ubs motion for judgment on the pleadings,concluding that the initial disclosure statement provided by ubs satisfied rule disclosure requirements.
we affirm.under rule a,a broker must disclose conditions under which additional collateral can be required.where,as here,a broker discloses its generally applicable margin policies regarding the circumstances that may lead it to reevaluate the adequacy of the collateral in a customer account and also indicates that more specific information about its margin policies is available to the customer,it need not disclose the precise,complex formulas it uses to calculate its collateral requirements.nor did rule b require ubs to provide advance notice to willow creek before it changed its margin rules.in affirming on these grounds,we need not,and do not,address whether customers have a private right of action under rule.
background 
because willow creek appeals from an order dismissing the complaint on the pleadings,we accept as true the facts alleged in the complaint,graziano pataki,cir,and we may consider documents incorporated into or integral to the complaint,l designs,old navy,llc,cir.
wc is the general partner and manager of wccp and wcsb,two investment partnerships that invest typically in the securities of companies with a market capitalization below billion.in early ubs agreed to act as willow creek prime broker to provide margin loans and prime brokerage services to wccp and wcsb.among other things,ubs maintained custody of wccp and wcsb securities and cash collateral and provided them with loans on margin.willow creek relied on ubs extension of margin credit to leverage its existing capital when acquiring securities.in return,willow creek paid ubs interest on the margin loans and other fees,including trading commissions.
the client account agreements between ubs and willow creek the client account agreements,dated january,and february,provided that ubs could demand additional collateral from willow creek during the course of their relationship.specifically,the agreements stated that 
i f at any time any of the ubs entities has reasonable grounds for insecurity with respect to willow creek performance of any of the contracts or its obligations,any of the ubs entities may demand adequate assurance of due performance by willow creek within hours the adequate assurance of performance may include the delivery by willow creek to ubs of additional property as collateral.
the client account agreements also required that willow creek maintain in and furnish to the accounts such margin as is required by applicable law and such greater amounts as the ubs entities may in their sole discretion require.
when willow creek opened its margin accounts,it received a document entitled disclosure statement in compliance with rule the initial disclosure statement the initial disclosure statement explained that ubs had a security interest in the securities held in willow creek margin accounts and discussed ubs margin policies and the risks associated with margin accounts.in particular,a section entitled general margin policies disclosed that ubs had established certain in house margin policies that exceeded the margin requirements of the federal reserve board and the financial industry regulatory authority,finra the same section also contained the following language 
it is ubs policy to review periodically any account as to which it has credit concerns in light of the value of the assets in the account each account with a debit balance is reviewed on an individual basis with consideration given to factors such as market conditions generally at the time,marketability of the securities in the account,frequency of the activity in the account,duration of the account and concentration of particular securities in the account.different weight may be given these factors by ubs,and on the basis of its review,ubs,in its sole discretion,may require additional collateral,above the amount required by the rules of the self regulatory agencies,as security for your obligations to ubs.
similarly,in a section entitled risks associated with margin accounts,the initial disclosure statement provided 
ubs can increase its house maintenance margin requirements at any time and is not required to provide you with advance written notice.these changes in ubs policy often take effect immediately and may result in the issuance of a maintenance margin call.your failure to satisfy the call may cause the member to liquidate or sell securities in your account s.
the initial disclosure statement also explicitly requested that willow creek consult its account representative for more specific information with respect to ubs general margin policies.
during a period following the execution of the client account agreements,wccp and wcsb are alleged to have performed in a superior fashion,while ubs earned millions of dollars from willow creek.in december,however,ubs notified willow creek that wccp account was in the second day of a margin call for approximately million.two days later,ubs sent willow creek a new document entitled prime broker margin levels margin levels i,which provide d a description of the margin rules currently in use in the prime brokerage unit of ubs.ubs told willow creek that the document explains the margin rules applied to your account.margin levels i consisted of seven pages of detailed information regarding ubs margin rules for various types of securities.the vast majority of the information in margin levels i involved a detailed description of internal margin guidelines in the form of complex formulas and tables that set out various multipliers and margin used by ubs to account for factors such as a portfolio concentration or liquidity ubs had not previously disclosed these more detailed and specific internal margin guidelines and formulas.willow creek met the december margin call.
in february ubs informed willow creek that wccp account again was in a margin call,for roughly million.ubs then sent willow creek a revised version of its prime broker margin levels document margin levels ii,which reflected what appear to be several changes to ubs margin rules,including the adoption of new rules regarding margin adjustments and relating to a portfolio liquidity and volatility.prior to the margin call,willow creek received no notice that any changes would be made to ubs margin rules.instead,an from ubs accompanying the document indicated that the new liquidity and volatility adjustments had affected requirements in the willow creek portfolio in recent weeks and months.the revised margin rules significantly increased the amount of collateral willow creek was required to maintain in its account,forcing it to liquidate holdings and abandon some of its hedging strategies to raise capital to satisfy the february margin call.
willow creek claims that meeting the margin call ultimately caused it to lose over million it later moved its margin accounts from ubs to a different prime broker.
procedural history 
willow creek sued ubs in april,asserting a claim under rule,as well as state law claims for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,fraud,fraudulent concealment,negligent misrepresentation,and unjust enrichment.ubs moved for judgment on the pleadings,arguing that the initial disclosure statement satisfied rule a disclosure requirements,that rule b does not require advance written notice before a broker makes changes to its margin policies,and that there is no private right of action to enforce rule.
the district court granted ubs motion on the ground that ubs had provided sufficient notice of its right to require the deposit of additional collateral at its discretion and had disclosed the factors it would consider in doing so.having dismissed willow creek rule claim on the merits,the district court did not address whether the rule provides a private right of action,and also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.willow creek appealed.
prior to oral argument,to aid our analysis,we solicited the views of the sec regarding whether a private right of action exists under rule,and whether ubs more specific margin rules were required to be disclosed pursuant to rule a.in response,the sec,as amicus curiae,urges us to hold that rule may be enforced in private actions,rule a requires a broker to disclose its general policies with respect to when more collateral may be required,but does not require that a broker disclose detailed descriptions of complex internal guidelines,and rule b does not require a broker to give advance written notice before changing its margin policies.

federal regulation of margin accounts 
margin levels 
the federal reserve board and finra promulgated federal regulations and rules that required willow creek to maintain minimum equity levels of at least percent in its margin accounts.see a setting initial margin requirements for certain equity securities at percent of the current market value of the security or the percentage set by the regulatory authority where the trade occurs,whichever is greater finra rule c requiring maintenance margin of percent of the current market value of all securities,except for security futures contracts,long in the account.brokers registered with finra may impose additional margin requirements when extending a margin loan to a customer.see finra rule d procedures shall be established by members to formulate their own margin requirements and review the need for instituting higher margin requirements than are required by this provision.if the value of the securities and other acceptable property held in a margin account falls below the required margin level,a broker may issue a margin call notifying the account owner that it will need to either post additional collateral or sell some of its securities in the account to satisfy the collateral requirements.
the sec promulgated rule pursuant to its authority under section b of the exchange act in order to require,in connection with margin accounts,disclosures substantially similar to those required by the truth in lending act tila for forms of consumer credit.see adoption of rule,exchange act release,hereinafter release.the rule governs what a broker must disclose regarding its margin policies and requires brokers who extend credit in connection with a securities transaction to tell their clients about key terms applicable to their margin accounts and to notify them in writing before revising the credit terms.specifically,as relevant here,subsection a of the rule requires brokers to provide the following at the time a client opens an account 
a written statement or statements disclosing vii the nature of any interest or lien retained by the broker or dealer in the security or other property held as collateral and the conditions under which additional collateral can be required.
a.subsection b of the rule addresses the notice required before changes can be made to credit terms after an account is opened.it provides 
i t shall be unlawful for any broker or dealer to make any changes in the terms and conditions under which credit charges will be made as described in the initial statement made under paragraph a of this section,unless the customer shall have been given not less than thirty days written notice of such changes 
when rule was promulgated,the sec explained that t he initial disclosure is designed to insure that the investor understands the terms and conditions under which credit charges will be made,and that t his will enable him to compare the various credit terms available to him and to understand the methods used in computing the actual credit charges.release.at.
as an initial matter,ubs argues that willow creek lacks article iii standing to pursue a claim under rule a because it alleges injuries that were not caused by ubs alleged violation of the law that is,by ubs failure to comply with its initial disclosure obligations when willow creek opened its accounts.we disagree.
as relevant here,to have article iii standing willow creek must have suffered an injury in fact that is concrete and particularized,actual or imminent,and fairly traceable to the challenged action.lujan defenders of wildlife,d quotation marks and alterations omitted.injury in fact is a low threshold ross bank of,cir.when we assess a argument on the basis of the pleadings,moreover,we take as true the factual allegations contained in the complaint.ctr.for reprod.law policy bush,cir.
here,the complaint alleged that information regarding ubs specific margin rules was material to willow creek decisions whether to purchase and sell securities in its accounts,and that ubs failure to disclose its specific margin rules to willow creek prior to the margin calls prevented it from using those rules to plan and manage the willow creek accounts accordingly and effectively.the complaint further alleged that h ad ubs disclosed the full,truthful margin terms in a timely fashion,plaintiffs would not have acquired securities on margin from ubs,would not have continued to hold securities they had previously purchased,and would have made other decisions regarding purchasing and selling securities in the willow creek accounts.plaintiffs also assert that they were injured a s a direct and proximate result of the foregoing conduct,and that meeting the margin call caused them to lose over million.taken together,these allegations are plainly enough to permit the inference that willow creek suffered a distinct and palpable financial injury fairly traceable to ubs alleged failure to fully disclose its margin rules when willow creek opened its margin accounts.we conclude that,having indisputably satisfied the other article iii standing requirements,see lujan,at,willow creek has standing to pursue its claim against ubs under rule a.
disclosures required by rule a 
ubs urges that,even if willow creek has standing,its disclosures in the client account agreements and the initial disclosure statement satisfied the requirements of rule a.we agree,mindful that on the merits of willow creek claim,the issue before us is narrow having adopted and invoked more specific margin rules applicable to willow creek to make the margin call,did ubs nevertheless satisfy the requirements of rule a by making more general initial disclosures 
in determining what disclosures ubs was required to make,we look first to the language of rule,recognizing that the rule was promulgated under section b,a provision designed to deal with manipulation and deception.see chiarella united states,d section b is aptly described as a catchall provision,but what it catches must be fraud.sec dorozhko,cir computer hacker actions must be deceptive to fall within scope of section b.the relevant part of the rule requires brokers to provide written disclosure of the conditions under which additional collateral can be required.a vii emphasis added.by contrast,the rule elsewhere refers ex
