under the securities exchange act of,et,the securities and exchange commission sec or commission must approve any changes to the rules of the national association of securities dealers,nasd,the private organization responsible for of the otc securities market.in,the sec issued an order approving a nasd proposal to implement a new computerized quotation and trade execution system,known as supermontage,for the nasdaq stock market,nasdaq.in its petition for review,domestic securities,domestic,an electronic communications network,challenges a feature of the trade execution rules governing supermontage,arguing that it discriminates against ecns and harms competition.domestic also challenges the sec approval of an alternative display facility,which was designed to provide a quotation display mechanism for traders who do not wish to use supermontage.we hold that we lack jurisdiction over domestic challenge to supermontage trade execution rules because the rules were approved in an earlier sec order,and domestic failed to seek timely review of that order.we deny domestic petition for review of the adf approval order because the sec order was supported by substantial evidence and was not arbitrary or capricious.
background 
statutory and factual background 
in,congress enacted amendments to the securities exchange act of,directing the sec to facilitate the establishment of a national market system.a.specifically,congress charged the sec to use modern communication and data processing equipment to link all securities markets nationwide.bradford clearing sec,see also a d.in centralizing the market for securities,congress sought,inter alia,to promote economically efficient execution of securities transactions while maintaining fair competition between securities brokers and dealers.id.a c i ii.
nasd has played an important role in the establishment of the national securities market.nasd is the only national securities association registered with the sec pursuant to.as a registered national securities association,nasd must maintain rules that,inter alia,remove impediments to a free and open market and a national market system,and protect investors and the public interest,while permitting neither unfair discrimination between customers,issuers,brokers,or dealers,id.b,nor the imposition of any burden upon competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act,id.b.see timpinaro sec.in addition,nasd is a selfregulatory organization sro responsible for regulation of the otc securities market.as an sro,nasd must file with the commission any proposed change to its rules.id.b nasd,sec.after notice and comment,the commission may approve the rule change if it finds that the change is consistent with the act and regulations governing the sro.b b.
since,nasd has operated an electronic automated quotation nasd automated quotation system,or nasdaq that affords dealers the means to display and instantaneously update their bid and ask quotations for securities,for which they are registered with nasd as market makers.by,the nasdaq system had evolved from providing only price quotations to providing automatic execution of some trades.
also in the,instinet developed the first electronic communications network ecn or network,which provided a private trade execution network for its subscribers.subscribers,usually dealers or institutional investors,could post limit orders orders to buy or sell a specific number of shares of a security at a specific price the instinet computer system matched those orders with the orders of other subscribers and automatically executed the trades via computer.oftentimes,instinet could provide a better price than nasdaq in a given security because market makers were not required to post on nasdaq customer limit orders that were priced better than the market makers own best bid or offer quotations for the same securities.thus,market makers could display one set of prices for retail customers on nasdaq while offering more favorable prices through instinet.
to address this discrepancy,in the sec adopted the order handling rules ohr or the rules,which require a market maker,or an ecn on its behalf,to publish in the national market the market maker customer limit orders and to provide trading access to those orders.see.the rules brought market makers limit orders into the national market system and put ecns in direct competition with market makers for the business of customer limit orders.id.at.it also gave subscribers access to the limit orders displayed on an ecn.previously,the ecn had charged each side of a trade executed on its of whom were execution fee.recognizing this,the sec allowed the network to continue to impose charges for access to its system,so long as the fee was not structured to discourage access by.id.at.
after the adoption of the ohr,several companies began operating ecns,including the petitioner,domestic.in,the commission adopted regulation ats,which,inter alia,required each network to display all of its limit orders in the national market system and provide trading access to those orders.regulation ats also expressed the commission view that exchanges,such as nasdaq,could be operated as corporations.id.at.nasdaq opted to become a entity.although nasd remains the parent corporation of nasdaq,the sec has promulgated regulations designed to ensure that nasd does not use its regulatory authority to promote its pecuniary interest in nasdaq.
by the late,nasdaq had become a virtual trading floor for the national otc securities market,offering sophisticated computerized trade execution capabilities.ecns limit orders were displayed alongside the quotations and limit orders of nasdaq market makers.nasdaq trade execution system permitted market participants to enter only a single quotation on each side of the market for each security into the system at any one time.the quotations were arranged as a montage according to price and time.two types of execution were available through nasdaq supersoes,which allowed participants to execute small orders automatically against the quotation of a market maker and selectnet,which allowed participants to route orders to a particular market maker or ecn for execution.the automatic execution feature of supersoes created a risk of double liability for an ecn if its displayed quotation or limit order had been executed,on an ecn internal before the supersoes automatic execution occurred.to avoid this risk,the ecns did not participate in supersoes,but participated only in selectnet.under selectnet,ecns received only order delivery,and could decline to execute the order if it had already been executed internally.over time,some ecns began declining to execute orders,not because of prior internal execution,but because the broker submitting the order had failed to pay the ecn access fees.
in,nasdaq proposed to implement supermontage,a new trade execution system,to consolidate supersoes and selectnet and to completely integrate quote and limit order display with order execution.supermontage allows participants to enter multiple quotations and orders.participants may choose either to direct an order to a specified market maker or ecn or to have an order matched generally with the best price available,with price ties broken by a queue based on the time the quotation was entered.ecns that charge access fees are placed last in the queue at each price level.market participants are not required to use supermontage to execute trades,but may choose to continue to use any other method,including ecns private networks.
under supermontage,ecns retain their ability to take order delivery rather than automatic execution.an order delivery ecn is electronically presented with an order and is given up to thirty seconds to indicate whether or not it will accept the order.if the ecn declines the trade,the system automatically the order to the next participant in the supermontage queue.
the feature of supermontage challenged by domestic is known as decrementation.under the decrementation feature,when an order delivery ecn declines a trade for any reason,the system treats the ecn displayed limit order as no longer valid and automatically decrements zeroes it out removing it from the supermontage display.if an ecn still wishes to trade the shares over supermontage at the quoted price,it may immediately the limit order into the supermontage system.the order,however,will go to the end of the queue as the most recently entered quotation at that price.
the commission claims that decrementation is necessary to avoid locked or crossed markets.a locked market occurs when the highest quoted bid price equals the lowest quoted ask price.a crossed market occurs when the highest bid price is greater than the lowest quoted ask price.according to the sec,continued locking and crossing of the market can negatively impact market quality and requires manual,special handling of orders by all market participants until the quotations are unlocked or uncrossed.supermontage avoids locked and crossed markets by decrementing the limit order of an ecn that declines to execute a trade.
proceedings before the commission 
the sec initially published the proposed supermontage rules in december.see.the proposed rules were amended and several times between december and november,and with each publication the sec solicited and received public comments.see.supermontage decrementation feature was described in the initial notice of the proposed rules.at,and remained essentially the same throughout the proposed rules several revisions.at.at.at.nonetheless,neither domestic nor any other ecn raised any concerns about the decrementation feature while the supermontage rules were under consideration.
on january,the sec issued an order approving the supermontage rules,including the decrementation feature,supermontage approval order.the sec found the proposed rule to be in the public interest and in furtherance of the exchange act goals of competition and efficiency.the sec,however,delayed the implementation of supermontage.in response to several commenters concern that supermontage would allow nasdaq to dominate the otc market and compete unfairly for market order flow,the sec conditioned the implementation of supermontage on nasd provision of an alternative display facility adf or facility that i n effect,makes participation in supermontage voluntary for market participants.the sec required that the adf permit nasd members to satisfy their obligation to display their quotes and limit orders without participating in supermontage and provide a market neutral linkage to the nasdaq and other marketplaces,but not an execution service.
in december,nasd submitted proposed rules governing the establishment and operation of an adf.the sec published the proposed rules for the first time on january.thereafter,the proposed rules were amended once and republished for comment.on july,the sec approved the amended rules,which allowed nasd to operate the facility on a pilot basis for nine months,until april.adf pilot order.the adf pilot order addressed the concerns of several commenters regarding connectivity to the adf.
on august,the sec issued an order providing for the implementation of supermontage,implementation order.the commission determined that the adf pilot program satisfied the conditions set in the january,supermontage approval order.consequently,the commission ordered that supermontage be implemented on october.
on october,domestic filed this petition for review of the implementation order.
ii.analysis 
in its petition,domestic raises two issues.first,domestic challenges the decrementation feature of supermontage,claiming that the sec did not provide adequate notice that decrementation would occur when an ecn declines an order because the firm entering the order has not paid the ecn access fees.domestic further contends that this application of decrementation discriminates against ecns by harming ecns ability to compete for order flow and impairing ecns right to charge reasonable access fees for their services.in sum,domestic claims that the sec acted arbitrarily and capriciously and contrary to the securities exchange act mandate when it approved the decrementation aspect of the supermontage rules.second,domestic challenges as unsupported by substantial evidence the sec conclusion that the adf satisfied the conditions laid out in the supermontage approval order,and claims that the adf does not provide an adequate alternative to supermontage.specifically,domestic asserts that the adf is technologically deficient because it lacks a means by which ecns can easily connect to it.we consider in turn domestic claims.
decrementation 
we need not examine the specifics of domestic challenge to supermontage decrementation feature because its challenge is not timely.as explained above,the sec approved the supermontage trade execution rules,including decrementation,in its january,supermontage approval order.section a of the securities exchange act provides that a party aggrieved by a final order of the commission may obtain judicial review by filing a petition for review within sixty days after the entry of the order.a.failure to file a timely petition for review deprives this court of subject matter jurisdiction.see jordan fed.election comm n,newell sec,cir.domestic did not file the instant petition for review until october,far outside the statutory time limit.nonetheless,domestic contends we have jurisdiction over its challenge to supermontage decrementation feature for two reasons.
first,domestic contends that its petition for review of the decrementation feature is timely because the supermontage approval order was not a final order within the meaning of a.because the sec conditioned implementation of supermontage on the approval of an adf,domestic reasons that the supermontage approval order did not become final until the implementation order of august.we disagree.
the supreme court applies a test for determining the finality of agency action.a final action mark s the consummation of the agency decisionmaking must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature and the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined or from which legal consequences will flow.bennett spear,d citations and quotations omitted see also fox television stations,fcc.the supermontage approval order meets both prongs of the bennett test.the order plainly mark ed the consummation of the agency decisionmaking process concerning the supermontage rules.bennett,at.at.after more than one year of considering the rules and three sets of amendments and republications for comment,the supermontage approval order mandated that the supermontage proposal be and hereby is approved.at.nothing in the order suggested that the sec approval of the rules was tentative or interlocutory.bennett,at.at.the sec did not reconsider or revise the supermontage rules in its later orders concerning the adf.moreover,the rules finally determined the rights and obligations of nasdaq and of each market participant who trades on supermontage.id.
domestic contends that the supermontage approval order was because supermontage could not be implemented until the adf was approved.furthermore,domestic argues that the adf approval proceedings reopened the consideration of supermontage rules.by the latter argument,domestic seeks to invoke our reopener doctrine,which allows judicial review where an agency explicitly or to reexamine its former choice.min.ass united states dep t of interior,quotations omitted.to be sure,the sec did condition the implementation of supermontage on the approval of an adequate adf.the existence of this condition to supermontage implementation,however,does not affect the finality of the supermontage approval order because the condition was unrelated to the substance of the supermontage rules.in the adf approval proceedings,the sec considered the adequacy of the adf,an entity wholly distinct from supermontage.it did not explicitly or implicitly reconsider the substance of the supermontage trade execution rules,nor did the sec consideration of the adf adequacy have any bearing on the supermontage rules.thus,contrary to domestic contention,our reopener doctrine is inapplicable here.in short,the only issue
