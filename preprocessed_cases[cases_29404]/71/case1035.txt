the issue we must decide in this appeal is whether there is a private cause of action to enforce the provisions of a of the investment company act of ica or act,a.that section generally requires an investment company to obtain shareholder approval before deviating from the investment policies contained in the company registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission sec.
our circuit has not decided the issue,but the second circuit has held that there is no private right to enforce five other sections of the ica,reasoning in relevant part that the purpose and structure of the entire act is grounded upon enforcement by the sec,not on private enforcement.see bellikoff eaton vance,cir per curiam olmsted pruco life ins.of new jersey,cir.the district court,however,held in a published opinion that congress did intend private enforcement of a,citing language in the sudan accountability and divestment act of sada,stat,that bars suits against investment companies and their advisors for divesting from companies that do business in sudan.northstar fin.advisors,schwab,d.the district court then certified its decision for interlocutory appeal.
we now reverse and hold that nothing in a as originally enacted or as subsequently amended either creates a private cause of action or recognizes one exists with the clarity and specificity required under supreme court precedent.we are unable to agree with the district court that the sada bar to particular litigation on account of the sudanese emergency is sufficient to constitute recognition of a preexisting private right of enforcement that is not otherwise evident in the language or structure of the ica.
we explain our conclusion by first tracing the statutory background of the ica,then discussing the impetus for the legislation,and finally analyzing the issues as required under supreme court law.we conclude that the court has come to require increasingly specific congressional direction for the allowance of private suits to enforce public laws,and no such direction is present in this statute.
statutory background 
i.the original act 
congress enacted the ica in to provide comprehensive regulation of investment companies and the mutual fund industry.see,at,at.the ica was the outgrowth of an extensive study and investigation of investment trusts and investment companies conducted by the sec in the late.see,at.widespread fraud and mismanagement in the mutual fund industry had caused shareholder losses of more than billion that decade.see norman knickle,the investment company act of sec enforcement and private actions,ann.banking fin.accordingly,congress sought to address problems including and breaches of fiduciary duties by fund managers,directors,and affiliates,misappropriation of fund assets,and misrepresentations to investors that had plagued the mutual fund industry.id.at footnotes omitted see also b.
the ica was the counterpart in the area of mutual fund regulation to the securities act of and the securities exchange act of collectively,the and acts,which were designed to regulate corporate securities.like the and acts,the ica requires registration with the sec and imposes specific reporting requirements.see.section of the ica states that once an investment company registers with the sec,it must file a registration statement that contains a recital of certain types of investment policies adopted by the company,including the company policy with respect to concentration of investments in a particular industry or group of industries any policy that is only changeable through a shareholder vote and any policy the company deems fundamental.b.section of the ica states that investment companies must file annual reports with the sec,and that they must transmit financial reports to shareholders on at least a basis.a,e.
the ica,however,created a broader regulatory framework for investment companies than the and acts created for corporate securities.see thomas lee hazen,treatise on the law of securities regulation ed.as one commentator has observed,a significant focus of the ica is corporate governance and other substantive requirements for investment companies and affiliated entities,which is in stark comparison to congress focus on registration and disclosure in the and acts.knickle,supra,ann.banking fin.at.this is reflected in the legislative history,where the senate report stated that the and acts ha d been ineffective to correct abuses and deficiencies in investment companies,at.as one means of correcting these abuses and deficiencies,of the ica prohibits investment companies from changing certain investment policies included in their registration statements without first obtaining shareholder approval.subsection a states 
a no registered investment company shall,unless authorized by the vote of a majority of its outstanding voting securities 
change its subclassification as defined in section a and of this title or its subclassification from a diversified to a company 
borrow money,issue senior securities,underwrite securities issued by other persons,purchase or sell real estate or commodities or make loans to other persons,except in each case in accordance with the recitals of policy contained in its registration statement in respect thereto 
deviate from its policy in respect of concentration of investments in any particular industry or group of industries as recited in its registration statement,deviate from any investment policy which is changeable only if authorized by shareholder vote,or deviate from any policy recited in its registration statement pursuant to section b of this title or 
change the nature of its business so as to cease to be an investment company.
to ensure compliance with the requirements of the ica,congress gave the sec broad authority to police violations of the act.section a of the ica states that the sec 
may make such investigations as it deems necessary to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate any provision of the ica or of any rule,regulation,or order hereunder,or to determine whether any action in any court or any proceeding before the sec shall be instituted under the ica against a particular person or persons,or with respect to a particular transaction or transactions.
a.section d and e authorize the sec to initiate actions in federal court for injunctive relief or civil penalties against any person or entity the commission suspects of violating the ica.see d e.additionally,congress granted the sec discretion to make exemptions consistent with public interest and policy.section c of the ica states that the commission 
may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person,security,or transaction,or any class or classes of persons,securities,or transactions,from any provision or provisions of the ica or of any rule or regulation thereunder,if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the ica.
only one section of the ica as originally enacted authorized anyone other than the sec to sue for violations of the act.section f of the act incorporated a remedy under the act.the section subjected officers,directors,advisory board members,investment advisors,and affiliates of investment companies,as well as all beneficial owners of ten percent or more of the company securities,to the same duties and liabilities as those imposed by section of the securities exchange act of upon certain beneficial owners,directors,and officers in respect of their transactions in certain equity securities,f,stat,now codified at h.section b of the act states that those individuals subject to its requirements may be sued at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction by the issuer,or by the owner of any security of the issuer in the name and in behalf of the issuer to recover profits realized by a regulated individual.p b.the supreme court has said that by incorporating the provisions of b of the act into f of the ica,congress expressly authorized private suits for damages against investment company insiders who make profits.transamerica mortgage advisors,lewis.there was no other authorization for private suits in the original act of.
ii.amendments 
congress did not make any major amendments to the ica until.see investment company amendments act of,stat.those amendments included relatively minor changes to and.see id.b,c,d,stat.at.the original b of the ica required an investment company registration statement to contain a recital of all investment policies which the registrant deems matters of fundamental policy,b,stat.at now codified as amended at b.the amendments added the requirement that a company registration statement also contain a recital of all investment polices which are changeable only if authorized by shareholder vote,c,stat.at codified at b.in a corresponding amendment,congress supplemented the language in a,which originally said an investment company could not,without shareholder approval,deviate from its policy in respect of concentration of investments in any particular industry or group of industries as recited in its registration statement,or deviate from any fundamental policy recited in its registration statement,a,stat.at.the amendment added a limitation barring an investment company from deviating,without shareholder approval,from any investment policy which is changeable only if authorized by shareholder vote,d,stat.at codified at a.
congress made these changes to and to clarify that an investment company violates a whenever it deviates,without shareholder approval,from an investment policy that its registration statement says is changeable only by shareholder vote,even if the registration statement does not also identify the policy as fundamental.see,at.both congress and the sec agreed this amendment was necessary in light of a federal district court ruling that an investment company must label an investment policy as fundamental in its registration statement before the company could be held liable under a for deviating from the policy,even if the company registration statement said that the policy could not be changed without shareholder approval.id.citing green brown,rev,cir.congress wanted to prevent any further confusion.id.
the amendments to the ica also included changes to,which deals with actions for breach of fiduciary duty.because mutual funds are usually managed by separately owned and operated investment advisors rather than by the investment companies themselves,congress added b,which imposed an explicit fiduciary duty on a fund investment advisor with respect to the management fees it receives,stat.at codified at b,at,at.section b also authorized the security holders of a registered investment company to bring a derivative suit against the company investment advisor and its affiliates for breach of that duty.b.
iii.sudan accountability and divestment act of 
the amendments to the ica with which we are principally concerned in this appeal came in in response to the crisis in darfur,sudan.that year,congress imposed economic sanctions on two sudanese government officials and sudanese companies as a result of their involvement with the genocide in darfur,at.those sanctions barred the subject companies from doing business within the united states financial system or with united states companies,and prohibited united states citizens from doing business with the sudanese companies.id.in addition to the sanctions imposed by the federal government,several states enacted measures restricting their agencies economic transactions with firms that do business with,or in,sudan.id.they were joined in their efforts by many colleges and universities,large cities,organizations,and numerous pension and mutual funds.id.at.
to facilitate the efforts of state and local governments and private asset fund managers to divest from companies involved in four specific business sectors in sudan,congress enacted the sada in.id.at.congress sought to allow such divestment to reduce the financial or reputational risk associated with investments in a country subject to international sanctions.id.at see also id.at.with respect to private divestment,of the sada,entitled safe harbor for changes of investment policies by asset managers,amended of the ica by adding a new subsection c,a,stat codified as amended at c.subsection c expressly barred any kind of civil,criminal,or administrative action against an investment company to challenge the company divestment from the securities of companies conducting the affected business operations in sudan.id.it stated 
c limitation on actions 
in general 
notwithstanding any other provision of federal or state law,no person may bring any civil,criminal,or administrative action against any registered investment company,or any employee,officer,director,or investment adviser thereof,based solely upon the investment company divesting from,or avoiding investing in,securities issued by persons that the investment company determines,using credible information that is available to the public,conduct or have direct investments in business operations in sudan described in section d of the sudan accountability and divestment act of.
applicability 
a actions for breaches of fiduciary duties 
paragraph does not prevent a person from bringing an action based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed to that person with respect to a divestment or decision,other than as described in paragraph.
b disclosures 
paragraph shall not apply to a registered investment company,or any employee,officer,director,or investment adviser thereof,unless the investment company makes disclosures in accordance with regulations prescribed by the commission.
person defined 
for purposes of this subsection the term person includes the federal government and any state or political subdivision of a state.
id.emphasis added.the report from the senate committee on banking,housing,and urban affairs explained that the purpose of c was to provide a safe harbor for those divestment decisions made in accordance with the sada,at.
in july,months after this appeal was argued and more than two years after the investments that led to the filing of the complaint,congress enacted the comprehensive iran sanctions,accountability,and divestment act of iran act,stat.as relevant to this appeal,the iran act amended ica c to add a safe harbor for investment companies divesting from certain investments in iran,and rewrote c a to say 
nothing in c shall be construed to create,imply,diminish,change,or affect in any way whether or not a private right of action exists under a or any other provision of the ica.
id.a,b,stat.at.congress specified that the amendment to c a shall apply as if included in the sada.id.b,stat.at.the conference report for the iran act stated that this amendment was designed to clarify that congress did not intend,in the sada,to imply the creation of a new private right of action under the ica,at.
background of this litigation 
this litigation has nothing to do with divestment from the securities of companies doing business in sudan.rather,it involves claims by investors that a large american investment trust operating a series of mutual funds unlawfully deviated from the investment policies set forth in its registration statement,to the detriment of the fund shareholders and in violation of a of the ica.
schwab investments is an investment trust organized under massachusetts law that consists of a series of mutual funds.in,schwab investments initiated the schwab government bond fund.by vote of that fund shareholders in,schwab investments converted the fund into the schwab total bond market fund fund,a mutual fund that seeks to track the lehman brothers aggregate bond index lehman index.the fund hired charles schwab investment management,charles schwab as its investment advisor.
the fund stated investment objective is to attempt to provide a high level of current income consistent with preservation of capital by seeking to track the investment results of the lehman index through the use of an indexing strategy.the fund disclosed in its registration statement that this investment policy was fundamental,which means that it may be changed only by vote of a majority of the fund shareholders.the fund concentration policy says that the fund may not invest percent or more of the fund total assets in any one industry or group of industries,unless necessary to track the lehman index.
northstar financial advisors,northstar is a registered investment advisory and financial planning firm that manages discretionary and accounts on behalf of investors and had over shares of the fund under its management.in august,northstar filed this shareholder class action in district court against schwab investments and charles schwab collectively,schwab for violations of ica a.northstar seeks to represent a class of investors who owned shares of the fund from august,to the present.
northstar primary claim is that schwab violated a when it allegedly deviated from the fund fundamental investment policies.northstar,d at.northstar alleges the deviations exposed the fund and its shareholders to tens of millions of dollars in losses stemming from a sustained decline in the value of securities.id.northstar complaint also includes state law claims for breach of fiduciary duty,breach of contract,and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing that are not at issue in this appeal.id.at.
schwab moved to dismiss the action for lack of standing on the part of northstar,asserting that northstar could not raise claims on behalf of its clients,who are the actual shareholders of the fund.id.at.the district court granted this motion,but permitted northstar to amend its complaint to reflect its standing as the assignee of a,and standing is not an issue in this appeal.id.at.
schwab also moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim under ica a,asserting there is no private right of action to enforce that section terms.id.at.the district court denied this motion,holding that there is an implied private right of action under a.id.at.the court first rejected northstar assertion that this court had already conclusively decided the issue in lapidus hecht,cir,correctly observing that this court merely assumed without deciding in that case that an implied private right of action exists under a.northstar,d at citing lapidus,at.the court then declined to adopt the second circuit reasoning in olmsted to deny a private right to enforce a,because olmsted predated the amendment of by the sada.id.at.relying on the language of subsection c added to by the sada,the court held that congress recognized a private right to enforce a when it enacted c.id.at.the court reasoned that there was no basis for congress to bar actions based on sudanese divestments if the statute did not authorize other private causes of action.the district court said 
the court finds it significant that section c expressly limited the types of actions that a person could file under section.if there were no private right of action under section a,there would be no need to restrict the actions that could be filed under section.schwab argue s section c can not be read as referring to section a or any other specific statutory provision,and they note that there is nothing in the legislative history suggesting that section c was meant to imply a private right of action under section a.however,if congress intended for section c to operate as a stand alone safe harbor provision,congress easily could have added section c as an entirely new provision of the ica rather than amending section,or could have stated that there was no private enforcement of section whatsoever.the fact that congress only limited certain types of actions suggests that congress intended that there be a private right of action under section a.
recognizing,however,that the issue of whether there is an implied private right of action to enforce a is not free from doubt,the district court certified its decision for interlocutory appeal,which this court accepted.see b.
we must now decide whether there is a private right to enforce a of the ica.this is a question of statutory construction that we review de novo.in re digimarc.derivative,f d,cir.t he fact that a federal statute has been violated and some person harmed does not automatically give rise to a private cause of action in favor of that person.touche ross redington,quoting cannon of chicago,internal quotation marks omitted.instead,the statute must either explicitly create a private right of action or implicitly contain one.in re digimarc,at.both parties in this appeal agree that a does not expressly create a private right of action.
accordingly,if there is any private right to enforce a,it must be implied from the statute language,structure,context,and legislative history.opera plaza residential parcel homeowners ass hoang,cir.as the party seeking to establish a private right to enforce a,the burden rests with northstar to demonstrate that such a private right of action exists.opera plaza,at.for the reasons explained below,northstar has not met this burden.
language and structure of the act 
our analysis of whether a contains an implied private right of action begins with the language and structure of the statute itself.alexander sandoval,in re digimarc,at.this is because congressional intent to create a private right of action is the key inquiry in determining whether an implied private right to enforce the statute exists.opera plaza,at see also orkin taylor,cir.in analyzing the language of a,we look for the presence of any language that might imply congress intended to confer upon shareholders the right to sue an investment company for violating the statute requirements.see sandoval,at in re digimarc,at.we then look to the structure of the ica itself.we have observed that analogous provisions of the statute expressly providing for private causes of action can imply congressional intent not to create an implied cause of action.opera plaza,at citing touche ross,at.we also look to see whether congress designated a method of enforcement other than through private lawsuits,because t he express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that congress intended to preclude others.sandoval,at.
we turn first to whether the statute contains any language that would imply congress intended to allow private enforcement of the statute requirements,what in sandoval is termed language.id.at.section a contains none.instead,a is focused on limiting the types of actions an investment company can take without first obtaining shareholder approval.statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than the individuals protected create no implication of an intent to confer rights on a particular class of persons.id.at quoting california sierra club.this is because there is far less reason to infer a private remedy in favor of individual persons if congress,instead of drafting the statute with an unmistakable focus on the benefitted class,writes it simply as a ban on or as a prohibition against undesirable conduct by a regulated entity.cannon,at.
here,as in the district court,northstar contends that in lapidus we already construed the statute as creating a private right.the district court correctly said we did not.northstar,d at.as the district court explained,we found it unnecessary in lapidus to reach the question of whether a creates an implied private right of action.id.this was because the district court in lapidus had dismissed the plaintiffs a claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and not for failure to state a claim.lapidus,at.we said in a footnote in lapidus that the existence of a private right to enforce a could be assumed without being decided to resolve the jurisdictional question before us,because the question whether a cause of action exists is not a question of jurisdiction.id.at quoting burks lasker,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we resolved the jurisdictional question in the plaintiffs favor,and remanded to the district court for consideration in the first instance of the defendants other asserted grounds for dismissal.id.at.on remand,the district court dismissed the plaintiffs claims for failure to state a claim without addressing whether a creates an implied private right of action.lapidus hecht,wl.may.the language of the statute does not imply a private remedy,and we have never held that it did.
we next turn to the structure of the ica to determine whether it suggests any congressional intent to allow private enforcement.our circuit has not done this analysis,but the second circuit,twice in the past decade,has analyzed the ica statutory scheme for evidence of congressional intent to create a private right of action to enforce other sections of the act,and has concluded that no such evidence exists.see bellikoff,at holding there is no private right of action to enforce ica b,a,and a olmsted,at holding there is no private right of action to enforce ica f and i.in both bellikoff and olmsted,the second circuit focused on the fact that of the ica,authorizes sec enforcement of the ica,and that congress actually created an express private right of action against investment advisors for breach of certain fiduciary duties in b.this led the second circuit to conclude that congress did not intend to imply a private right to enforce other sections of the ica.see bellikoff,f d at olmsted,at.
we now agree with the second circuit that the structure of the ica does not indicate that congress intended to create an implied private right to enforce the individual provisions of the act.in and of the ica,congress expressly authorized the sec to enforce all of the provisions of the act by granting the commission broad authority to investigate suspected violations initiate actions in federal court for injunctive relief or civil penalties and create exemptions from compliance with any ica provision,consistent with the statutory purpose and the public interest.u.c.this thorough delegation of authority to the sec to enforce the ica strongly suggests congress intended to preclude other methods of enforcement.sandoval,at.the supreme court has also cautioned that where a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies,a court must be chary of reading others into it.transamerica,at.because the statutory scheme of the ica provides for thorough sec enforcement of the act provisions,including a,it is highly improbable that congress absentmindedly forgot to mention an intended private action.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
moreover,it is evident from the text of the ica that congress knew how to create a private right of action to enforce a particular section of the act when it wished to do so.in f of the original act now codified at h,congress expressly authorized private suits for damages against insiders of investment companies who make profits.transamerica,at.congress created a second express private right of action in when it added b to the ica,which allows shareholders to sue an investment company advisor and its affiliates for breach of certain fiduciary duties relating to management fees.b bellikoff,at olmsted,at.congress enactment of these two express private rights of action elsewhere in the ica,without the enactment of a corresponding express private right of action to enforce a,indicates that congress did not,by its silence,intend a private right of action to enforce a.see in re digimarc,at.
despite this strong evidence from the language of a and the ica statutory scheme that congress did not intend to create a private right of action to enforce a,northstar argues that such a right can be implied from,and of the act.we disagree,as none of these sections demonstrate that congress intended private enforcement of each of the provisions of the ica.
section,the congressional findings and declaration of policy,contains general language indicating that one of the purposes of the act is to protect investors.that is a key function of the sec.this general language does not demonstrate that congress intended the ica to be enforced by any entity other than the sec.see sandoval,at transamerica,at t he mere fact that a statute was designed to protect one class of individuals does not require the implication of a private cause of action for damages on their behalf.touche ross,at g eneralized references to the remedial purposes of an act will not justify reading a provision more broadly than its language and the statutory scheme reasonably permit.quoting sec sloan.
section does nothing more than require investment companies and their affiliates to file certain litigation documents with the sec whenever an investment company or one of its affiliates is a party to a suit against an officer,director,investment advisor,trustee,or depositor of the investment company.this filing requirement does not imply that congress anticipated private suits against investment companies for violations of the ica the requirement applies to any action or claim and is not solely directed to suits for violations of the ica.id.
section is the ica jurisdictional provision it grants concurrent federal and state jurisdiction over all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce the provisions of the entire ica.it does not create a private right of action to enforce a.the entity entitled to sue for violations must be identified in the substantive provision of the act.see touche ross,at the source of plaintiffs rights must be found,if at all,in the substantive provisions of the act which they seek to enforce,not in the jurisdictional provision.
ii.legislative history of amendments to the act 
northstar goes on to argue that even if the act language does not imply a private right to sue,the statute legislative history,specifically the amendments to and enacted in and,demonstrates that congress intended there to be an implied private right of action to enforce a.we must disagree,because nothing in the language or context of those amendments demonstrates a clear congressional intent to allow private lawsuits to enforce the statute provisions.
a.the amendments 
congress amended and in to make it clear that an investment company registration statement must recite all policies that can be changed only by shareholder vote and that deviation from any policy so designated violates a.northstar contends that when congress amended these two sections,it meant to affirm its original intent to create a private right of action under a.no such meaning or intent is apparent.the amendments deal with the need for shareholder votes to change investment policy.the language and legislative history reflect that purpose and that purpose only.
the report of the house committee on interstate and foreign commerce states that the purpose of the amendments was to make clear that deviation from an investment policy which is changeable only by shareholder vote constitutes a violation of section,regardless of whether the investment company registration statement explicitly identifies the policy as fundamental,at.by clarifying when a change of policy violates a,congress did not thereby indicate an intent to recognize a private remedy for such a violation.
northstar further contends that the amendments affirmed a contemporary federal court interpretation of a as privately enforceable.northstar tries to invoke the principle that when an implied cause of action is part of the contemporary legal context in which congress amends a statute,and a significant amendment of the statute leaves intact the provisions the courts relied on for implying a cause of action,congress intends the cause of action to remain.in this situation,the lack of change is itself evidence that congress affirmatively intended to preserve that remedy.merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,curran.it is only evidence,however.the supreme court has cautioned that dispositive weight should not be given to the expectations congress has with respect to the contemporary legal context.sandoval,at.
here,we can give the expectations no weight,because there was no contemporary legal context in,when congress amended and recognizing a private right of action under a.northstar cites to only two from federal district support its theory that there was such a context green brown,and leighton v.the one william street fund,dist.lexis july.
even assuming two district court,and hence,cases could provide a legal context,neither green nor le
