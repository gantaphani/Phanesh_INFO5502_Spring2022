this case requires us to decide whether a purported securities loan with a fixed term of at least days and possibly as long as days,entered into not for the purpose of providing the borrower with access to the lent securities,but instead for the purpose of avoiding taxable income for the lender,qualifies for nonrecognition treatment as a securities loan pursuant to of the internal revenue code the code,we hold that it does not.
background 
statutory background 
as a general rule,any sale or other disposition of property is a taxable event.c.prior to,there was some uncertainty regarding the application of this general rule to securities lending transactions.these transactions were developed in response to the needs of securities brokers,who frequently faced delays in obtaining securities to deliver to purchasers and therefore were forced to borrow the required securities from organizations and individuals who held such securities in their investment portfolios.see senate report,at,reprinted in.in,the supreme court had held that the passage of securities from lender to borrower pursuant to a securities lending agreement,and then back again from borrower to lender at the end of the loan term,were taxable events.provost united states.subsequent rulings by the internal revenue service the irs,however,had taken the opposite position and declared that these transactions were not taxable events,rul,wl.
in,congress sought to clear up this confusion by enacting,which provides that securities lending transactions will not be treated as taxable dispositions.the senate finance committee recognized that such transactions are desirable because they reduce the chances that brokers will fail to deliver securities to purchasers within the time required by the relevant market rules.senate report at,at.under,when a taxpayer transfers securities under an agreement that meets certain enumerated requirements,no gain or loss shall be recognized on the exchange of such securities by the taxpayer for an obligation under such agreement,or on the exchange of rights under such agreement by that taxpayer for securities identical to the securities transferred by that taxpayer.a.
in order to qualify for nonrecognition under a,an agreement must 
provide for the return to the transferor of securities identical to the securities transferred 
require that payments shall be made to the transferor of amounts equivalent to all interest,dividends,and other distributions which the owner of the securities is entitled to receive during the period beginning with the transfer of the securities by the transferor and ending with the transfer of identical securities back to the transferor and 
not reduce the risk of loss or opportunity for gain of the transferor of the securities in the securities transferred.
petitioners in this case are henry and susan samueli and thomas and patricia ricks collectively,taxpayers.both the samuelis and the rickses are married couples who filed joint income tax returns for and.henry samueli is the billionaire of broadcom corporation,and thomas ricks is an investment advisor to the samuelis 
in and,the samuelis accountant and tax consultant,arthur andersen llp,and twenty first securities,a brokerage and financial firm,jointly designed and marketed to the samuelis a transaction that was predicated on the expectation that interest rates were going to fall from their levels.after evaluating memoranda prepared by twenty first securities,thomas ricks recommended to the samuelis that they invest in the proposed transaction,and they elected to do so.thomas ricks later became a participant in the transaction as well when he acquired a stake in it from another entity affiliated with the samuelis.
in its economic essence,the transaction consisted of taxpayers purchasing a security with a fixed rate of return determined by interest rates at the time of purchase,and paying for that purchase at a price derived from a variable interest rate.however,the transaction as executed was considerably more complex than that description and is best understood as a series of discrete steps.
step one purchase of the securities margin loan 
on october,taxpayers purchased a billion principal strip the securities issued by the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac from refco securities llc refco,a securities broker.by purchasing a strip,taxpayers were purchasing the right to receive the principal on a freddie mac bond at the date of maturity but not the right to receive interest payments on that bond prior to maturity.the securities had a maturity date of february,on which date their holder had the right to receive billion.taxpayers purchased the securities for billion,which meant that cashing in the securities for their par value on the maturity date would provide them with an annual yield of on the purchase price.
taxpayers funded the purchase of the securities with a margin loan the margin loan from refco.the interest rate of the margin loan was set at the variable london interbank offering rate libor plus basis points the margin loan was secured by the securities,and taxpayers also deposited with refco as a condition of obtaining the margin loan.
step two loan of the securities 
the plan all along had been for taxpayers to lend the securities back to refco after purchasing them.on or about october,six days before taxpayers purchase of the securities,taxpayers and refco had entered into a master securities loan agreement and an amendment to the master securities loan agreement together,the loan agreement.the loan agreement was on a standard form for securities loan agreements.taxpayers and refco then entered into an addendum to the loan agreement the addendum on october,the same day that taxpayers purchased the securities.
the loan agreement required taxpayers,as lender,to transfer the securities to refco,as borrower.in return,refco would transfer to taxpayers collateral with a market value at least equal to that of the securities.taxpayers were required to pay refco a fee the cash collateral fee equal to an percentage of the amount of any such collateral in cash.refco also was required to mark to market the collateral on a daily basis,meaning that if the market value of the securities went up on any given day,refco was required to transfer additional collateral to taxpayers no later than the close of the next business day,so that the market value of the collateral remained equal to the market value of the securities.the loan agreement also provided that taxpayers could terminate the loan of the securities at any time,in which event refco would be required to return the securities no later than the third business day following notice of termination.all of these terms are standard features of securities lending agreements.see senate report at,at.
the addendum,however,was a customized document and overrode several of the terms in the loan agreement.the provision in the loan agreement permitting taxpayers to terminate the loan and demand return of the securities on three business days notice was superseded by a section of the addendum entitled term of specified loan.this section provided that the loan would terminate on january,approximately one month before the maturity date of the securities,unless taxpayers elected to terminate it on either july,or december.the addendum also specified that,beginning on november,the cash collateral fee would be set at libor plus ten basis points the same rate as the interest rate under the margin loan and would be on the first monday of each month.the cash collateral fee would be deemed to be added to the collateral held by taxpayers and would be paid by taxpayers to refco when they returned the collateral to refco at the end of the loan term,unless taxpayers elected to pay the cash collateral fee,in whole or in part,prior to termination of the loan.finally,the addendum provided that taxpayers would retain a deposit of the same amount required to secure the margin loan in an account with refco and would grant refco a security interest in those funds to secure the performance of taxpayers obligations under the loan agreement.
on october,two days after they purchased the securities,taxpayers transferred the securities to refco as required by the loan agreement.at the same time,refco provided taxpayers with cash collateral of billion the value of the securities,which taxpayers then used to pay off the margin loan.
step three fee payment 
on december,taxpayers determined that the accrued cash collateral fee at that time was million,and they wired that amount the fee payment to refco.approximately two weeks later,refco returned an identical amount to taxpayers.this amount was recorded as an increase in the amount of the cash collateral held by taxpayers.
in december,a representative of twenty first securities discussed with thomas ricks the possibility of taxpayers paying refco approximately million in accrued cash collateral fee.the representative stated that two weeks from the date the wire is initiated,the money can be returned to the shiloh trust.but taxpayers did not end up making such a payment in.
step four termination of the loan 
taxpayers did not exercise their option to terminate the loan in july or december.accordingly,the transaction terminated on january,as provided for in the addendum.what happened upon termination,according to taxpayers,was that refco purchased the securities from taxpayer for the market price of billion.taxpayers owed refco billion the amount of the cash collateral plus accrued cash collateral fee.the amounts owed were settled via offset,so the only cash that changed hands at this point was million transferred from refco to taxpayers on january.this amount was the sum of million in actual economic gain for taxpayers the excess of the price refco paid taxpayers for the securities over the amount taxpayers had to return to refco for the collateral,the return of the taxpayers million deposit,and accrued interest on that deposit of just over million dollars.
dispute over tax characterization procedural 
background 
on their tax returns for and,taxpayers treated the transaction as a securities loan under.accordingly,they assumed that their transfer of the securities to refco pursuant to the loan agreement,and refco return of the securities when the loan agreement expired,were not taxable events.instead,they treated the securities as an asset that they acquired in october for the purchase price and disposed of in january for the value and treated the cash collateral fee as interest paid by them to refco 
accordingly,on their returns,taxpayers claimed an interest deduction for the fee payment in the amount of million.the samuelis claimed,or percent of the total,while the rickses claimed the remaining percent,or.on their return,the samuelis reported in capital gain from the sale of the securities to refco.this amount represented the proceeds of the sale billion less the purchase price of the securities billion,and less transaction costs of million,further adjusted to deduct the rickses ownership interest in the securities.the samuelis also claimed an interest deduction for,which was the amount of cash collateral fee that had accrued on the termination date and was paid to refco along with the original amount of the cash collateral the fee payment.the rickses did not claim any interest deduction in connection with the termination of the transaction.
the commissioner of internal revenue the commissioner rejected this characterization of the transaction.the commissioner determined that the transaction did not in fact qualify as a securities lending arrangement under and instead adopted his own interpretation of the transaction,as follows in october,taxpayers purchased the securities from refco for the purchase price billion and immediately sold them back to refco for the amount of the cash collateral also billion.then,in january,taxpayers purchased the securities from refco a second time pursuant to a forward contract.the price for this second purchase was the amount of the cash collateral plus accrued cash collateral fee billion.immediately after this second purchase of the securities,taxpayers again sold them back to refco,this time for their then market value billion.accordingly,the commissioner determined that taxpayers had no capital gain or loss in because they sold the securities for the same price at which they had purchased them had million in capital gain in and could not deduct the cash collateral fee payments as interest expense in either year,because no indebtedness ever existed.
accordingly,in april,the commissioner issued a notice of deficiency for tax years in the amount of and in the amount of to the samuelis,and a notice of deficiency for tax year in the amount of to the rickses.both the samuelis and the rickses filed petitions with the tax court seeking redetermination of the deficiencies each of taxpayers and the commissioner moved for summary judgment the tax court granted the commissioner motion.see samueli comm r.taxpayers timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
the tax court had jurisdiction over taxpayers petitions for redetermination of deficiency pursuant to a and.we have jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of the tax court under a.
standard of review 
we review the tax court interpretation of the code and its legal conclusions de novo.teruya,comm r,cir.the application of the law to a stipulated factual record,as is presented here,is also reviewed de novo.sennett comm r,cir.
the tax court found that the transaction did not qualify for nonrecognition under because the loan agreement and addendum failed to meet the requirement of b that a transaction not reduce the opportunity for gain of the transferor of the securities in the securities transferred.according to the tax court and the commissioner,the transaction failed to meet this requirement because the addendum permitted taxpayers to terminate the loan only on one of three dates july,december,or january,which limited their ability to profit from any increase in the value of the securities by reclaiming and selling the securities that occurred on any date during the term of the loan,other than the two dates specified in the addendum.taxpayers challenge this conclusion although,as discussed further below,they also contend that is not determinative of or even necessarily relevant to the outcome in this case.we agree with the tax court conclusion that the transaction did not meet the requirements of.
the plain language of b,with the gloss provided by elementary economic analysis,supports the tax court conclusion on this point.taxpayers relinquished all control over the securities to refco for all but two days in a term of approximately days.during this period,taxpayers could not have taken advantage of a spike in the market value of the securities,because they had no right to call the securities back from refco and sell them at that increased price until several months later.common sense compels the conclusion that this reduced the opportunity for gain that a normal owner of the securities would have enjoyed.
the terms of the addendum reduced taxpayers upside exposure to the market value of the securities in another way as well,which was not highlighted by the tax court in its decision.per the addendum,if taxpayers had elected to terminate the loan on either of the two optional early termination dates,refco would have had the right to purchase the securities at a price.on both such dates,the formula ended up yielding a price that was higher than the trading price for the securities.this means that in all likelihood refco would not have exercised its right to purchase the securities if taxpayers had terminated the transaction on either such date,assuming the same securities were readily available from other sellers.however,had interest rates moved in a different direction,the formula could have yielded a price that was lower than the trading price.if this had been the case,taxpayers could only have terminated the transaction on one of those dates at the risk of being forced to sell the securities to refco for less than their market price.in effect,this further reduced taxpayers ability to exit the transaction at will.
taxpayers argue that their inability to secure the return of the securities on demand did not affect their ability to recognize gain because the securities were bonds whose value did not widely fluctuate with windfall profits at some momentary period.this argument is superficially convincing.but it is not a sufficient basis for finding that this transaction did comply with b.first,the value of the securities would not need to fluctuate widely during the term of the loan to provide opportunities to sell at a profit when one owns billion of a particular security,even a small fluctuation in value can produce a significant opportunity,in absolute terms,for profit.second,as noted above,even if one could assume that there was zero risk of any fluctuation in the market value of the securities,refco option to purchase the securities at the prices still affected taxpayers ability to realize the market price of the securities on the dates when they had the option of getting them back from refco.finally,the assumption that the market price of the securities freddie mac bonds will never fluctuate widely or unexpectedly seems less valid today than it may have when taxpayers invested in the securities.see,suffering a seizure america government takes control of freddie mac and fannie mae,the economist,available at describing the federal government takeover of freddie mac as being motivated in part by the imperative to maintain the value of its debt securities.
taxpayers point to another section of the code to support their interpretation of b as accommodating the transaction at issue here.simultaneously with the enactment of,congress amended b to provide that payments with respect to securities loans received by organizations would not be treated as unrelated business taxable income.section a a clarifies that the phrase payments with respect to securities loans means all amounts received in respect of a security transferred by the owner to another person in a transaction to which section applies,while a b further clarifies that such transactions must also be pursuant to an agreement which provides for 
i reasonable procedures to implement the obligation of the transferee to furnish to the transferor,for each business day during such period,collateral with a fair market value not less than the fair market value of the security at the close of business on the preceding business day,
ii termination of the loan by the transferor upon notice of not more than business days,and 
iii return to the transferor of securities identical to the transferred securities upon termination of the loan.
the requirements of a b are in addition to the requirement in a a that a transaction comply with the terms of.taxpayers argue that interpreting b as requiring that agreements give lenders the right to a return of their securities on demand renders superfluous the requirement of a b ii that a securities lending agreement must provide for termination of the loan by the transferor upon notice of not more than business days.it is true that courts generally should be hesitant to adopt an interpretation of a congressional enactment which renders superfluous another portion of that same law.mackey lanier collection agency.but taxpayers argument is unconvincing for several reasons.
first,it is apparent that avoiding redundancy was not a major goal of congress when it drafted and a the requirements of,incorporated by reference into a,include the requirement that the securities lending agreement provide for the return to the transferor of securities identical to the securities transferred.b.but,redundantly,that requirement is then repeated in a b iii the agreement must provide for the return to the transferor of securities identical to the transferred securities upon termination of the loan.
second,taxpayers argument ignores the distinction between the requirement that a transaction be terminable upon demand,and a definition of what terminable upon demand means.section a b ii provides the latter it requires that securities be subject to return within five business days of the lender request.the specification that the notice period be five business days was derived from securities and exchange commission sec rules governing the lending of securities by regulated investment companies.those rules had required that the lender be able to terminate the loan with five business days notice.see senate report at,at.these rules in turn derived their required notice period from sec rules establishing five business days as the standard settlement time frame for most trades in securities.see securities transactions settlement,wl describing implementation schedule for the conversion to a t settlement environment from the t settlement time frame previously in effect.
there is a good reason why the notice period for termination of a securities loan should be the same as the settlement period for sales of securities if a lender entered into a contract to sell a security that he had loaned to another party,the settlement period would mean that he would need to deliver the security to the purchaser within five business days of the contract,so the requirement that the borrower return the security within five business days of notice ensured that the lender would have the security available to deliver to the purchaser on time.in,the sec amended its regulations to provide that brokers or dealers needed to deliver most securities within three business days of the purchase or sale contract.see a.accordingly,the standard notice period for termination of securities lending transactions shifted to three business days,as is apparent from the standard form loan agreement used in taxpayers transaction.because the standard notification period for termination of a securities loan can vary,a b ii would not be superfluous even if b implied a requirement that a securities loan be terminable on demand,because b still could be read as permitting a notice period of longer than five days.
third,and most importantly,our conclusion that the transaction at issue in this case reduced taxpayers opportunity for gain does not necessarily imply a conclusion that a securities loan must be terminable upon demand to satisfy the requirements of b.in,the department of the treasury considered adopting implementing regulations for that would have incorporated the notice requirement.the proposed regulations were never adopted,but the debate surrounding them is illuminating.specifically,proposed b would have provided that a qualifying agreement must n ot reduce the lender risk of loss or opportunity for gain.accordingly,the agreement must provide that the lender may terminate the loan upon notice of not more than business days.transfers of securities under certain agreements,proposed july.in response to the proposed regulation,the american bar association committee on financial transactions the aba committee issued a report objecting to the requirement,in part because it would prevent parties from lending securities for fixed terms longer than five days.the aba committee advocated instead a facts and circumstances test to address b rather than a rule and suggested that such a facts and circumstances test should take into account both the length of time until the debt investment security matures and the length of the time the security is borrowed.aba committee reports on securities lending transactions aba report,tax notes today may,section iv.
the aba committee concern that not be construed in such a way as to exclude all loans for fixed terms was echoed in a report that the tax section of the new york state bar association the nysba committee issued in response to several recent decisions of the tax court,including its decision now on appeal in this case.report of the tax section of the new york state bar association on certain aspects of the taxation of securities loans and the operation of section june,nysba report,at.we are cognizant that a holding that no securities loan for a fixed term can qualify for nonrecognition could affect commonplace market transactions in a manner that arguably violates the overarching policy of section.id.at.but we do not so hold today because the resolution of this case does not require us to do so.first,as will be discussed more thoroughly in the next section of this opinion,we believe this transaction falls outside the overarching policy of section.second,the transaction at issue here would fail the facts and circumstances test that the aba committee proposed as an alternative to a rule that would exclude all loans from the scope of.taxpayers inability to terminate the loan except on one of three dates is clearly not consistent with the continued evolution of commercial practices,aba report,section iv,because the current standard practice for loans of bonds like the securities is to allow termination by the lender on three days notice as is evidenced by the terms of the standard form loan agreement in this transaction,which were overriden by the addendum.
the length of the loan term under the addendum approximately days,the fact that the loan term extended almost to the maturity date of the securities,and taxpayers inability to terminate the loan on any but two dates during that term all severely hampered taxpayers ability to take advantage of market fluctuations in the price of the securities.moreover,refco option to purchase the securities at the libor formula price meant that taxpayers ability to liquidate the securities at the actual market price was limited even further.
as the nysba noted,the question of whether securities loans for shorter fixed terms,made for the purposes animating,qualify for nonrecognition treatment is more appropriately settled by further guidance from the department of the treasury and the irs.nysba report,at.the present case does not require us to settle this question thus,we decline to address it.
proper characterization and tax treatment of the transaction 
taxpayers also argue that,even if the transaction does not qualify for nonrecognition under,their tax treatment of the transaction was still correct.they make this argument in several ways.first,they argue that their transaction was factually a securities loan that qualified for nonrecognition treatment even if it did not meet the requirements of b.relatedly,they argue that the tax court characterization of the transaction as two sets of purchases and sales is not supported by the facts of the transaction.second,they argue that,even if the tax court characterization of the transaction were correct,taxpayers still reported its tax consequences correctly.
whether the transaction was factually a securities loan 
as an initial matter,the parties dispute the baseline question of whether a transaction may qualify as a securities loan eligible for nonrecognition if it does not fulfill the requirements of b.taxpayers argue that the requirements of b merely create a safe harbor and do not delineate the limits of what is considered a securities loan for tax purposes.however,we need not decide today whether b is a safe harbor or the only route to nonrecognition,because the facts of this case clearly indicate that this particular transaction does not fall within the category of transactions that congress sought to cover with.
the tax court,in characterizing the transaction as in substance two separate sales of the securities,cited the principle that f or federal tax purposes,the characterization of a transaction depends on economic reality and not just on the form employed by the parties to the transaction.samueli,at.see,teruya,at t ax classifications turn on the objective economic realities of a transaction rather than the particular form the parties employed.internal quotation marks and punctuation omitted.we are cognizant of the reality that the tax laws affect the shape of nearly every business transaction and therefore will not recharacterize a transaction merely because tax considerations were one motivation for its particular structure.frank lyon united states.however,we may recharacterize a transaction that had no business or corporate purpose when what was done,apart from the tax motive,was not the thing which the relevant tax statute intended.gregory helvering.
taxpayers purchase of the securities,and the funding of that purchase by the margin loan,did have a business or corporate purchase.that step of the transaction was motivated by taxpayers belief that interest rates would fall.if interest rates were to fall and they did,holding a security that produced a return based on the interest rate at the time of purchase,and financing that purchase with a loan charging a variable rate,would result in a profit based on the difference between the fixed rate and the variable rate.
if this were taxpayers only goal,however,there would have been no need for them to lend the securities to refco.had they not transferred the securities to refco,taxpayers clearly would have been able to secure the tax treatment for the transaction that they are arguing for here they would have held the securities for more than one year and been able to claim capital gains upon their sale,and the interest under the margin loan would have been deductible.
the sole motivation for adding the purported securities loan to the transaction was tax avoidance.as is explained in marketing materials for the transaction produced by twenty first securities if taxpayers had simply bought and sold the securities,they would have been forced to report the yield on the securities as interest income taxed at the highest rate even though they did not actually receive any payment until the securities matured.see a providing that the original issue discount on debt instruments like the securities shall be included in the gross income of the holder.as the marketing materials explain,however,when a taxpayer loans a security to a borrower such as a bond dealer and certain criteria are met,then the taxpayer lending the security will no longer be treated as the owner of the security for federal tax purposes and will not be required to report such interest income.the loan was thus conceived as a way for taxpayers to avoid interest income and generate,as the marketing materials put it,income taxed at favorable rates and expenses deductible at the highest rate.
unlike a typical securities lending arrangement,this transaction was designed around minimizing taxpayers tax bill rather than around refco need to have the securities available to deliver to its customers.taxpayers received no compensation from refco for the loan of the securities.they did receive the cash collateral,but that was economically meaningless,because the cash collateral was used to repay the margin loan,so that taxpayers never held it for their own account or earned interest on it.the cash collateral fee was identical to the interest rate under the margin loan,the deposit required under the addendum was the same as that required for the margin loan,and taxpayers used the cash collateral to pay off the margin loan.because of this,their economic position refco was identical to what it would have been absent the loan agreement and addendum except in one key respect as discussed above,their ability to profit from the sale of the securities during the term of the loan was severely compromised.
congress explicit goal in enacting was to encourage loans for the benefit of brokers who needed large supplies of securities on hand to deliver to purchasers,because such loans can have a favorable impact on the liquidity of securities markets.senate report at,at.it may be possible that nonrecognition treatment should be given to a transaction that fails to meet all of the specific requirements of b,but that nonetheless is motivated by the goals that congress had in mind when it enacted.but this loan,a tax shelter marketed as such for which the borrowing broker refco did not pay the lender any consideration,clearly was not the thing which the statute intended.gregory,at.indeed,even the aba report favored the position that a loan transaction must share the motivations indicated by congress to receive nonrecognition treatment the aba committee suggested that treasury issue a regulation requir ing that a section securities loan be entered by the borrower for the purposes which congress intended.aba report,s
