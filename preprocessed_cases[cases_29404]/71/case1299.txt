espeed,cantor fitzgerald,cfph,and espeed government securities,collectively cantor appeal from the district court final judgment declaring claims of united states patent the patent invalid,declaring the patent unenforceable,and entering final judgment in favor of defendants.because we affirm the district court conclusion that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct,we need not decide the other issues raised by cantor.
background 
technological.methods involving open outcry and trade capture 
the patent pertains to automated methods and systems for trading financial instruments,particularly fixed income securities.prior to the development of the invention described in the patent,financial instruments were sold using an method whereby voice brokers would express various bid and offer prices for a given instrument.patent.according to the patent,t his expression would involve the loud oral cry of a bid or offer and the coordination with the fellow representatives regarding the extraction of complementary a transaction match is made and a deal is done.id.at.open outcry auction bond brokering served its customers well because it was efficient and permitted trading at near perfect market pricing.id.at.
while voice brokers were participating in open outcry trading,a process known as trade capture was performed by designated clerks.id.at.these clerks would attempt to record the outcry of many individual brokers simultaneously using electronic input devices,such as a computer or workstation.id.at.as might be apparent from its description,the quality of the information inputted into the electronic devices by a clerk was a function of the interpretative skill of the input clerk,and the volume and the volatility of customer orders.id.at.
the inventors of the patent recognized that there was a need for greater efficiency and accuracy in the trading of instruments such as fixed income securities.id.at.therefore,they sought to create a system to automate the trading process and avoid the use of open outcry and trade capture processes.
new old rules of workup 
traders in the secondary market for fixed income securities,such as united states treasuries,notes,and bonds,do not want to reveal the full volume that they are willing to trade at a given price because this information might be used against the trader by other market participants.however,in order to foster liquidity in the market,customers who initiate the trade at a given price are provided with the exclusive option to incrementally increase their purchase volume.this exclusivity is known as workup rights.when given exclusivity,a customer can gradually increase the volume of his purchase while determining how the market is reacting to the purchase before trading further.
in what the parties have referred to as the old rules of workup,when the first buyer or seller has completed his transaction,new buyers or sellers are sequentially given,in the order in which they expressed interest,exclusive workup rights.one problem with the old rules of workup was that a few participants could tie up the market for long periods of time.as a result,brokers would,on occasion,engage in side deals to avoid losing business.cantor presented evidence at trial showing that the old rules led to chaos and pandemonium when trading volume was heavy.
because of the problems associated with the old rules of workup,cantor employees began to develop new rules of workup.in,the new rules of workup were designed to provide exclusivity to an initial pair of market participants,in a manner similar to the old rules of workup.after the initial pair of traders was finished,orders that were placed while the initial pair had exclusivity would then be rapidly executed in time priority order.thus,by limiting exclusivity to the first pair of traders,the new rules of workup still provided an incentive for the first pair of traders to create liquidity while at the same time avoiding a long queue of traders waiting for their chance to trade.
in the late cantor began looking to replace its trade capture system with a new system.between and,programmers and software developers at cantor wrote software code that would later become known internally as the super system or the cantor fitzgerald trading system cfts.the district court found that the super system would provide a platform to support both automated trading and traditional outcry trading using trade capture.espeed,brokertec usa,unenforceability ruling,d.the super system included software code for various trading states including a workup state the super system also included code that allowed brokers to use either the old rules or the new rules 
as early as,the super system was used in cantor trading rooms to conduct trades.id.at.after using the super system in,cantor determined that the system was too slow to be commercially used as an automated trading system and used it solely as an order entry system,to support open outcry trading.id.the super system was used as a trade capture system in cantor trading rooms between and to transact billions of dollars worth of trades.
subsequent versions of cfts 
cantor continued to improve the super system in an attempt to create a more efficient automated trading system and first used super system successor,cfts,in cantor long bond room in during the week between christmas and new year day.unenforceability ruling,d at.cfts was able to implement trades efficiently enough that cantor deemed it to be commercially viable.
b.the prosecution history 
the patent was filed as united states patent application the application.the application claimed priority under to united states patent application the application.the application was filed on december.this patent application matured into united states patent the patent on may.neither the super system nor any other version of cfts was disclosed to the united states patent and trademark office pto during the course of prosecution of the parent application.unenforceability ruling,d at.
shortly after the patent issued,cantor asserted the patent against liberty brokerage.in preparing for that lawsuit,cantor outside counsel learned about the super system and realized that it had not been disclosed to the pto.cantor dismissed its suit against liberty brokerage after this discovery.
in an effort to purge the possible inequitable conduct with regard to the patent and avoid a similar problem with any patent that might issue based on the application,cantor submitted three declarations and numerous exhibits purporting to describe the super system to the patent examiner in connection with the application.declarations were submitted by stuart fraser,vice chairman of cantor fitzgerald securities cfs,howard lutnick,chairman of cfs,and bijoy paul,a cantor employee responsible for the development of super system successors.each of these individuals averred that he was an inventor of the application and that they did not realize that they were under a duty to disclose the super system during the prosecution of the application.one declaration,submitted by paul,stated that t he super system did not include new rules and that t he super system code was based on old rules in which each successive broker had a period of exclusive control over the trade.decl.of bijoy paul,application,emphasis added the declarations submitted by cantor referenced various exhibits that were submitted to the pto along with the declarations.the exhibits amassed to pages,and included portions of the super system source code.
the patent examiner considered the materials submitted by cantor and concluded that the cited papers presumably referring to the exhibits which were internal cantor documents did not constitute prior art,but were given due consideration.
c.the district court proceedings 
cantor filed suit against brokertec usa,garban,om technology us,and om technology ab collectively brokertec in the united states district court for the district of delaware on june.cantor asserted that brokertec infringed claims of the patent.during the course of the litigation,the district court ruled,on motion by brokertec,that the submission of the inventor declarations during the prosecution of the application waived the privilege with respect to discussions between cantor attorneys and the inventors regarding the super system.accordingly,the district court ordered the production of certain documents related to those discussions.see,espeed,brokertec usa,wl.
the district court construed the claims on september,espeed,brokertec usa,wl,at,and granted brokertec motion for partial summary judgment of under the doctrine of equivalents,concluding that an amendment to the claims created prosecution history estoppel with respect to the alleged equivalents.see espeed,brokertec usa,d.
a jury trial commenced on february,with inequitable conduct tried simultaneously to the district court.the jury returned a verdict of infringement in favor of cantor,but held that the patent was invalid due to lack of written description under.
shortly after denying cantor jmol motion,the district court held that the patent was unenforceable because of inequitable conduct.see unenforceability ruling,d.the district court determined that there were two separate grounds for unenforceability and that either,standing alone,rendered the patent unenforceable.id.at.with respect to the first ground of inequitable conduct,the district court determined that the use of the super system more than one year prior to the filing date of the application was material prior art that should have been disclosed during prosecution of the application.id.at.the district court concluded that the inventors intended to deceive the pto because each of the inventors had a significant role in creating the super system and because of the super system high materiality.id.at.moreover,the district court found further evidence of intent when,prior to filing the application,lutnick stated that he had wanted to patent cantor super system its rules in general for over a year.id.the district court found that inequitable conduct during the prosecution of the patent infected the prosecution of the patent because the patents were closely related and cantor failed to cure the inequitable conduct by filing the inventor declarations in the application.see id.at.
as the second basis for rendering the patent unenforceable,the district court concluded that the three inventor declarations submitted to the pto to disclose the super system included material misrepresentations.id.at.specifically,the district court concluded that the declarations included statements that the super system did not contain any code for the new rules of trading.unenforceability ruling,d at.this,the district court found,was not true.id.the district court concluded that although there might have been different new rules at different times,all new rules had something in common they limited exclusivity.id.this was perhaps the primary object of the invention claimed in the patent.id.thus,the district court found the misrepresentations in the declarations to be material.id.at.the district court found sufficient facts to infer an intent to deceive,based in part on the fact that the declarations were worded in such a way to make the examiner believe that there were no new rules in the super system.id.weighing the materiality with intent to deceive,the district court held the patent unenforceable.id.
d.the present appeal 
on appeal,cantor challenges the district court claim construction,the district court decision regarding the applicability of the doctrine of equivalents,the district court denial of jmol on the issue of lack of written description,the district court determination that the patent is unenforceable,and that the district court decisions regarding the existence and scope of waiver of the privilege based on the submission of the inventor declarations warrants a new trial.we have jurisdiction under a.
we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that the declarations included material false statements and were submitted with an intent to deceive.because the district court did not abuse its discretion in rendering the patent unenforceable,we need not reach the remaining issues raised by cantor.
ii.discussion 
i nequitable conduct includes affirmative misrepresentation of a material fact,failure to disclose material information,or submission of false material information,coupled with an intent to deceive.pharmacia par,quoting molins plc textron.in cases where the omission or misrepresentation is highly material,less evidence of intent will be required in order to find that inequitable conduct has occurred.perseptive biosystems,pharmacia biotech.once a district court has found a threshold level of both materiality and intent to deceive,the district court must balance the evidence to determine if equity should render the patent unenforceable.see labounty,int l trade comm n.
the ultimate conclusion that a patent is unenforceable is an equitable decision committed to the discretion of the district court that we review for an abuse of discretion.see,steelcase.to overturn a discretionary ruling of a district court,the appellant must establish that the ruling is based upon clearly erroneous findings of fact or a misapplication or misinterpretation of applicable law or that the ruling evidences a clear error of judgment on the part of the district court.kingsdown med.consultants,hollister,en banc in relevant part.
we review the underlying facts of materiality and intent for clear error.agfa creo.under this standard,we will not disturb factual findings unless we have a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,at quoting critikon becton dickinson vascular access.
materiality 
cantor contends that the declarations submitted during the prosecution of the patent were not material.cantor first argues that the inventors statements are immaterial because the record does not reflect that any brokers ever used the code for the new rules of trading when the super system was deployed in cantor trading rooms.second,cantor argues that the exhibits submitted with the declarations and totaling pages provided the examiner with the facts that were allegedly misrepresented and thus,the declarant statements are immaterial when taken in this context.
brokertec points to paul declaration that it contends includes demonstrably false statements that are inherently material.brokertec also points to fraser declaration as providing a broad definition of new rules encompassing conditional prompting.brokertec further contends that it does not matter whether the new rules portion of the super system was within the prior art because declarations are,by their very nature,highly material.responding to cantor assertion that the statements made in the declaration were not material in light of the exhibits submitted with the declarations,brokertec contends that by submitting portions of the source code and misrepresenting what portions of the code included,cantor left the examiner with the impression that no further investigation was necessary.see semiconductor energy lab.samsung elecs.
under the reasonable examiner standard,information is material when a reasonable examiner would consider it important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent.dick burroughs,see also digital control charles mach.works,suggesting that the reasonable examiner standard remains the starting point for assessing materiality.
false statements are more likely material when embodied in declarations or affidavits submitted to the pto.see refac int l,lotus dev,rohm haas crystal chem.this court has previously found that the submission of a false affidavit may be determined to be inherently material.digital control,at.in ferring barr laboratories,we concluded that the failure to disclose possible bias of the declarants constituted a material omission where the declarations were submitted to overcome a prior art rejection,see also refac,at finding declarations submitted to establish enablement but failing to disclose possible bias of declarants were material.similarly,in digital control,we concluded that false statements made in a declaration to antedate prior art were material.at.
