a judgment debtor is entitled to supersede the judgment while pursuing an appeal this defers payment until the matter is resolved but does not halt the accumulation of interest on the judgment.if the debtor rejects the supersedeas option and does not otherwise suspend enforcement,the creditor may execute on the judgment by seizing bank accounts or other property.to avoid seizure,the debtor may pay the judgment outright,which stops the accumulation of interest.but these alternatives to suspending enforcement put at risk the judgment debtor ability to recoup the seized assets or payment when the appeal is successful.the judgment debtor in this case,under an agreement with the judgment creditor,made a payment toward satisfying the judgment and subsequently won the appeal.the question is whether the creditor may nevertheless keep the money because equitable principles of restitution do not apply.because we reject the creditor approach,we affirm the court of appeals judgment.
background 
this case stems from ronald jensen breach of an option agreement with dennis miga,under which miga would have been entitled to buy stock in a privately held corporation.the facts and the parties are well known to us.see miga jensen miga i.in the initial round of litigation,a jury found for miga on all issues,and the trial court rendered judgment in his favor for almost million,plus more than million in prejudgment interest.to suspend execution during his appeal,jensen posted a supersedeas bond in the amount of,which subsequent riders increased to.id.at.the court of appeals largely affirmed the trial court judgment.id.
despite the bond,postjudgment interest continued to mount.shortly after the court of appeals decision,the parties entered into an agreed order under which jensen made an unconditional tender to miga of the sum of toward satisfaction of the judgment in order to terminate the accrual of interest on that sum.id.jensen then filed a petition for review with this court.miga moved to dismiss jensen petition,arguing that jensen tender mooted the appeal.we rejected that argument.id.at.we noted that,while explicitly reserving the right to appeal when the judgment is paid would be the safe practice in these circumstances,payment on a judgment will not moot an appeal of that judgment if the judgment debtor clearly expresses an intent that he intends to exercise his right of appeal and appellate relief is not futile.id.at.we observed that,in negotiating the order,jensen discussed its anticipated jurisdictional effect with miga and that jensen informed miga that he believed the agreed order would not moot his complaint,and that he would continue to pursue appellate review.id.at.although miga complain ed that his refusal to accede to an express reservation of appeal in the agreed judgment and jensen removal of that language from an earlier draft ma de the payment of the judgment misleading,we disagreed 
while miga may have believed that jensen payment mooted the appeal,he could not have had any reasonable doubt that jensen believed it did not,or that jensen intended to pursue the appeal if legally allowed to do so.consequently,because jensen payment was coupled with an expressed intent to pursue his appeal,he did not waive his right to continue to contest the judgment.
on the merits,we held that miga contract damages should have been measured by the value of the option at the time of breach,rather than at the time of trial.we reversed the court of appeals judgment on that issue and rendered judgment for miga for.id.at.miga moved for rehearing,arguing,among other things,that i f the court somehow implicitly held that miga has any potential repayment obligation,the court should grant rehearing and correct that error.the court denied the motion without comment.on remand,the trial court rendered a modified judgment of in miga favor.the judgment stated that it addressed the issues specifically directed in the mandate of the texas supreme court and none other.accordingly,jensen motion seeking to recover the lion share of the money he had previously paid miga remained unresolved.
jensen then sought restitution of,the difference between the amount paid to miga the amount owed under the modified judgment.when miga refused to tender that amount,jensen filed this suit.the trial court granted jensen and denied miga motion for summary judgment a divided court of appeals affirmed.we granted the petition for review.
restitution after reversal 
restitution after reversal has long been the rule in texas and elsewhere.see,bank of bank of,pet.on the reversal of the judgment,the law raises an obligation in the party to the record,who has received the benefit of the erroneous judgment,to make restitution to the other party for what he has lost.cleveland tufts,it is settled that money paid upon a judgment afterward reversed may be recovered by the party making the payment.see also restatement of the law of restitution restatement restatement of the law third restitution and unjust enrichmentt restatement third tentative draft,charles tainter,restitution of property transferred under void or reversed judgments,miss,the right of the successful party is conditional at least upon his having a good cause of action,and if his judgment is reversed he must,usually,make restitution in some form to the successful appellant.peticolas carpenter,noting that w here a judgment for debt is reversed after it has been enforced by execution,and the case is finally decided in favor of defendant,he is certainly entitled to restitution.the question here is whether this case presents an exception to that rule.miga contends that it does,for three reasons.
does the parties contract preclude restitution 
miga first argues that because the parties agreement made jensen tender unconditional,the restitution remedy is unavailable.see restatement requiring restitution upon reversal unless it would be inequitable or the parties contract that payment is to be final.while it is true that when a valid,express contract covers the subject matter of the parties dispute,there can be no recovery under a theory,fortune prod.conoco,here both sides agree that the agreed order is silent on restitution.the order provides that defendant ronald jensen jensen desires to make an unconditional tender to plaintiff dennis miga miga of the sum of the tender amount toward satisfaction of the judgment in order to terminate the accrual of interest on that sum.
many of the parties arguments here repeat those made last time the case was before us,and our prior opinion answers most of them.miga contends that he and jensen contracted for the payment to be final,but if that were so,we would not have held that jensen the viable.miga i,at.we concluded,instead,that the parties agreed to disagree w hile miga may have believed that jensen payment mooted the appeal,he could not have had any reasonable doubt that jensen believed it did not,or that jensen intended to pursue the appeal if legally allowed to do so.id.we agree with the court of appeals that implicit in reserving a right to appeal is the right to a refund of the money in the event that the judgment is later modified or reversed.at.miga recognized as much in miga i,arguing that i t is fundamentally inconsistent for jensen to say that his unconditional payment was conditioned on his right to appeal and seek restitution.emphasis added.in this case,he asserts that there is no language requiring miga to refund any of the million payment in the event the judgment were later reversed or rendered,and jensen agrees.they are parties no more agreed that jensen could not seek reimbursement than they agreed that he could.the situation would be no different had miga executed on a judgment.in that instance,there would be no agreement that jensen could seek restitution and no agreement that he could not,but the right to recover the funds upon reversal of the judgment would nevertheless be established as a matter of law.because the parties agreement is silent on this point,it does not displace the rule.
