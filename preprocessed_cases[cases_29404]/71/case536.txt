opinion of the court 
this matter comes on before this court on defendant douglas colkitt appeal from the district court order for summary judgment in favor of plaintiff gfl advantage fund,against colkitt entered on april,and on appeal from an order entered on july,denying reconsideration of the april order.for the reasons stated herein,we will affirm the orders of the district court.
background 
factual history 
douglas colkitt,who earned both his medical degree and mba from the university of pennsylvania in,is the founder and majority shareholder of two small capitalization medical services,equimed and national medical financial services corporation national medical.as of february,colkitt held of equimed outstanding shares of common stock,and as of may,he owned million of national medical outstanding shares of common stock.see gfl advantage fund,colkitt,memorandum and order at.july.
beginning in,colkitt sought financing to pursue various business ventures unrelated to equimed and national medical.after unsuccessfully attempting to secure financing from traditional commercial lending institutions,colkitt contacted alternative lenders that might be willing to structure convertible or exchange transactions,whereby colkitt would be able immediately to convert his vast stockholdings into cash.in particular,colkitt endeavored to borrow money by pledging his common stock as collateral and providing the lender with the right to convert or exchange the debt for the shares pledged by colkitt.
in the spring of,colkitt broker identified gfl advantage fund,gfl as a possible lender,and on may,colkitt obtained a loan of from gfl.under the terms of the note national medical note,gfl had the right after days of the date of the note to exchange up to million of its outstanding principal for shares of national medical stock held by colkitt at an exchange rate of of the average market price.gfl could exchange the remainder of the unpaid balance for shares of national medical days after the date of the note.the average market price was computed by taking the average of the stock closing prices for the five days immediately prior to the exchange request.in essence,the note gave gfl the right to require colkitt to repay the loan with national medical stock valued at a discount of of the average closing price,thus giving gfl an immediate paper profit as it would receive stock with a premium value to repay a debt of a lesser amount.
several months later on august,colkitt entered into a similar transaction with gfl for a loan.the structure of the second note equimed note was akin to that of the national medical note,except the parties agreed that gfl could convert the debt into shares of colkitt other business,equimed,at an exchange rate of of the average market price.in addition,gfl could convert up to million of the outstanding principal after days of the date of the note and could convert the balance of the principal days thereafter.
nearly four months after issuing the initial loan to colkitt,gfl made its first of six exchange demands for national medical stock.on september,gfl exchanged of debt for shares of national medical stock at the average market price of and an exchange or conversion price of.on september,gfl exchanged of loan principal for shares at an average market price of and a conversion price of.on october,gfl converted of debt into shares at an average closing price of and a conversion price of.on december,gfl exchanged of unpaid principal for shares at an average market price of and an exchange price of.on december,gfl converted of debt into shares at an average market price of and a conversion price of.finally,on january,gfl demanded an exchange of of loan principal for shares,but the request was withdrawn after colkitt dishonored gfl earlier exchange demand for equimed stock.
gfl waited until november,more than months after the date of the equimed note,before making its first exchange demand for equimed shares.on november,gfl demanded that colkitt convert in outstanding principal into equimed stock.with a average closing price of,gfl received shares of equimed at an exchange rate price of.gfl next exchange demand for equimed stock occurred on january,when gfl sought to convert in unpaid principal,but colkitt dishonored the request.
unknown to colkitt at the time,and on the same day in september as gfl first exchange demand for national medical stock,gfl began short selling national medical stock.as we have explained 
short selling is accomplished by selling stock which the investor does not yet own normally this is done by borrowing shares from a broker at an agreed upon fee or rate of interest the short seller is obligated,however,to buy an equivalent number of shares in order to return the borrowed shares herein lies the short seller potential for profit if the price of stock declines after the short sale,he does not need all the funds to make this covering purchase the short seller then pockets the difference.on the other hand,there is no limit to the short seller potential loss if the price of the stock rises,so too does the short seller loss,and since there is no cap to a stock price,there is no limitation on the short seller risk.
zlotnick tie communications,cir.see also defining short sale as any sale of a security which the seller does not own or any sale which is consummated by the delivery of a security borrowed by,or for the account of,the seller black law dictionary ed defining short sale as the sale of a security that the seller does not own or has not contracted for at the time of sale,and that the seller must borrow to make delivery.in other words,short sellers are betting that the stock price will decline between the time they sell the borrowed stock and the time they must cover,purchase replacement shares to repay the borrowed stock.short selling,which is closely regulated,see,is a legitimate trading strategy for stocks that traders believe are overvalued.
gfl first short sale of national medical stock occurred on september,when it sold shares at a price of per share.on september,gfl sold short shares of national medical at per share.on september,gfl sold short shares at per share.on october,gfl sold short shares at per share.finally,on october,gfl sold short shares of national medical at per share.gfl sold short a total of shares of national medical stock over a period.
gfl also sold equimed shares short.on november,gfl sold short a total of shares of shares at per share and shares at per share.on november,gfl sold short shares at per share.on november,gfl sold short shares at per share.on november,gfl sold short shares at per share.finally,on november,gfl sold short shares of equimed stock at per share.over this period in november,gfl sold short a total of shares of equimed stock.
gfl explains that it engaged in short sales of national medical and equimed stock as a hedging strategy against delivery risk.under the terms of the notes,the exchange price was based on the average closing price during the five trading days preceding the exchange request.consequently,the exchange price was locked in on the date of the exchange request,thus shifting onto gfl the risk that the stock price would drop more than the or discount.in other words,if the stock price dropped more than the discount before gfl was able to sell the exchanged shares,gfl would be in a loss position.br.of appellee at.gfl claims it sold short to protect itself in the event that the price of the stock declined further after gfl made the exchange request but before gfl was able to sell the shares.
the theory of colkitt case,however,is that gfl sold national medical and equimed shares short in an effort to depress the prices of the stocks.indeed,colkitt contends that the market price of national medical dropped between gfl first and last short sales of national medical stock,and that the market price of equimed declined by between gfl first short sale of equimed stock and gfl first exchange demand colkitt argues that gfl purposely depressed the stock prices so that colkitt would be forced to exchange more shares to retire the same amount of debt.he asserts that gfl was able to obtain an additional shares of equimed and an additional shares of national medical due to the respective declines in the stocks prices.
as noted above,colkitt refused to honor gfl exchange request for equimed shares on january.instead,colkitt notified gfl in december and early january that he intended to prepay all unpaid principal and interest in cash.colkitt contends that gfl improperly rejected his request to prepay the unpaid balance,even though the notes contemplated such prepayment.gfl responds that it did not reject outright colkitt offer to prepay,but rather refused to allow colkitt to dictate the terms of any prepayment and disagreed with colkitt about the amounts due.gfl admits that it does not believe that colkitt had a right to prepay,but insists that it accepted colkitt offer to prepay whatever amount colkitt believed was then due,reserving for itself the right to contest the disputed balance.br.of appellee at.gfl claims that colkitt neither responded to its overtures nor attempted to prepay or pay any amounts to gfl.
procedural history 
on april,gfl filed a complaint against colkitt alleging breach of his obligations on the national medical and equimed notes.on june,colkitt filed an answer,affirmative defenses,and six counterclaims.the affirmative defenses and counterclaims alleged,inter alia,that gfl engaged in securities fraud and market manipulation in violation of various federal and state securities laws by temporarily depressing the prices of national medical and equimed stock through its concentrated short sales.colkitt claimed that gfl engaged in the scheme so that it could exchange debt for shares at an artificially low price and earn enormous windfall profits when prices returned to their normal levels.on march,the district court adopted a magistrate judge recommendations that colkitt counterclaims be dismissed.the district court dismissed one counterclaim with prejudice and the balance without prejudice on april,colkitt filed amended counterclaims in an effort to cure the deficiencies of the original counterclaims,but on february,the district court again dismissed colkitt inadequately pled counterclaims without prejudice for lack of specificity.
on april,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of gfl based largely on the reasoning of in re olympia brewing.securities litigation.the court concluded that,because short selling is not an unlawful trading practice,it would not draw the inference that gfl manipulated the market price of equimed and national medical stocks simply because gfl engaged in substantial short selling of the stocks.the court also determined that colkitt failed to present evidence that gfl short sales had an appreciable effect on the prices of the stocks.finally,the court concluded that even if the short sales did depress prices,colkitt failed to show that the declines in price are attributable to false information injected into the market by the short sales and not to information otherwise available to the market.gfl advantage fund,colkitt,memorandum and order at.
on july,the district court denied colkitt motion for reconsideration and entered final judgment in favor of gfl.the court clarified its earlier ruling on gfl motion for summary judgment,explaining that the evidence of gfl short sales alone was insufficient to establish colkitt claims of securities fraud and market manipulation because selling stocks short is lawful.the court declared that t here must be some circumstances beyond the mere occurrence of short sales to suggest that the short sales were part of a scheme to manipulate the market,which colkitt failed to proffer.gfl advantage fund,colkitt,memorandum and order at.july.the court then proceeded to reject colkitt argument that numerous inferences that he believed should be drawn from the factual record created genuine issues of material fact that precluded summary judgment.the court refused to accept any of colkitt proffered of which colkitt has raised on reaffirmed its decision that gfl was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
jurisdiction 
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over gfl breach of contract action pursuant to based upon diversity of the parties and the amount in controversy.the district court entered final judgment in this case on july,and appellant filed a timely notice of appeal on august.therefore,we have jurisdiction pursuant to 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo and apply the same standard as the district court applied in the first instance.see lucent info,lucent,cir.we may affirm summary judgment in favor of gfl only if,after drawing all reasonable inferences from the record in the light most favorable to colkitt,there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and gfl is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.as the nonmoving party,colkitt must create a genuine issue of material fact by presenting sufficient evidence to permit a jury to find in his favor.see anderson liberty lobby,d.to defeat summary judgment,he can not rest simply on the allegations in the pleadings,but must rely on affidavits,depositions,answers to interrogatories,or admissions on file.bhatla capital,cir.therefore,it will be appropriate to affirm summary judgment for gfl if we conclude that there is insufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for colkitt.
iii.discussion 
rescission of the notes pursuant to section 
colkitt contends that the national medical and equimed notes are unenforceable by reason of section of the securities exchange act of exchange act because gfl violated the provisions under section b of the exchange act and rule promulgated thereunder.section b provides in relevant part that 
every contract made in violation of any provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder,or the performance of which involves the violation of,or the continuance of any relationship or practice in violation of,any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation thereunder,shall be void.
b emphasis added.colkitt argues that gfl violated section b and rule when it engaged in market manipulation by short selling national medical and equimed stock in an effort to depress the share prices,and when it engaged in fraudulent deception by concealing its plan to short sell national medical and equimed stock.see br.of appellant at.colkitt asserts that the notes are void and unenforceable under section b because the notes were made in violation of section b and rule insofar as they were part of gfl scheme to manipulate the market prices of national medical and equimed stock and they contain omissions of material fact about gfl short selling strategy.see reply br.of appellant at.
gfl argues that colkitt section b affirmative defense fails for two reasons.first,section b is a remedial provision that is triggered only when another section of the exchange act has been violated.as addressed below,gfl maintains that it did not engage in either market manipulation or securities fraud in violation of section b,and therefore,there is no underlying offense to trigger section b.see infra.second,gfl contends that colkitt fails to state a proper section b defense inasmuch as colkitt alleges that it is gfl short selling,not the national medical and equimed notes,that is unlawful.gfl argues that only unlawful contracts,not unlawful transactions executed pursuant to lawful contracts,may be rescinded under section b.
we deal with gfl second contention first,which is supported by the limited body of case law on the point.for instance,in slomiak bear stearns,plaintiff opened a margin account and a repurchase account with defendant bear stearns.he purchased millions of dollars of government bonds in his margin than with cash and the remainder with loans by bear stearns.see id.when plaintiff was notified of a margin call on his account and failed to muster the in additional margin demanded,bear stearns liquidated the government bonds in plaintiff account.see id.plaintiff alleged that bear stearns violated section b and rule by failing to provide him at the time he opened his accounts with a written statement explaining the terms under which bear stearns would extend him credit.see id.based on these alleged violations,plaintiff sought to rescind all of his bond transactions pursuant to section b.see id.at.the court concluded that plaintiff could not rescind the transactions,explaining 
the complaint alleges that bear stearns failed to send plaintiff a written credit disclosure statement in violation of rule at the time he opened his accounts it does not allege that the customer agreements establishing his margin and repurchase accounts at bear stearns were themselves unlawful u nder of the exchange act,only unlawful contracts may be rescinded,not unlawful transactions made pursuant to lawful contracts.
id.at quoting zerman jacobs,aff,cir table.because bear stearns alleged violation of rule was clearly collateral to the contract agreement governing the account,the court determined that the firm failure to provide the written statement to plaintiff did not justify rescission of the account agreement itself or the transactions undertaken pursuant to that agreement.id.at.
in drasner thomson mckinnon securities,plaintiffs maintained margin accounts with defendant thomson mckinnon securities between and.plaintiffs began selling naked options in and profited handsomely off the transactions until,when the market began spiking upward.see id.between january and may,plaintiffs incurred substantial losses on their options until thomson mckinnon finally closed their accounts and liquidated their collateral.see id.at.plaintiffs sought to rescind the options contracts pursuant to section b because thomson mckinnon allegedly violated regulation t by failing to direct plaintiffs to deposit the required amount of initial margin in their accounts.see id.the court rejected plaintiffs claim,stating that section b only renders void those contracts which by their terms violate the act or the rules and regulations thereunder for it is only such contracts which are made in violation of,or the performance of which involves the violation of the statute and the rules and regulations thereunder.id.at.the court explained that even if thomson mckinnon had violated regulation t,section b was inapplicable because the options contracts that plaintiffs sought to rescind were governed by a valid,lawful contract whose terms did not violate the exchange act or any regulations promulgated thereunder.see id.at.
colkitt responds to gfl argument by citing regional properties,financial and real estate consulting,cir,which challenges drasner narrow construction of section b.in regional properties,two real estate entrepreneurs brought suit against their broker and his firm,financial and real estate consulting financial,alleging that the broker had violated section a of the exchange act by selling limited partnership interests for them without having registered with the sec as a.see id.at.the entrepreneurs and their affiliated corporations sought to rescind their agreements with financial pursuant to section b in light of the broker violations of section a.see id.the court rejected drasner conclusion that section b renders void only those contracts that by their terms violate the exchange act and instead interpreted section b as render ing voidable those contracts that are either illegal when made or as in fact performed.id.at.the court concluded that rescission was proper because,although plaintiffs sought to avoid contracts that were perfectly lawful on their face,the performance of the contracts by financial nevertheless resulted in a violation of the act.id.at.the court added that these contracts,under different circumstances,could have been performed without violating the act is immaterial.id.
although the court of appeals in regional properties rescinded the contracts therein and explicitly rejected drasner narrow reading of section b,its opinion is nevertheless consistent with the outcomes in drasner,slomiak,and zerman.in particular,the violations of the exchange act alleged in drasner,slomiak,and zerman were collateral or tangential to the contract between the parties,whereas the violation alleged in regional properties was inseparable from the performance of the contract that plaintiffs were attempting to void.slomiak.at.the parties the contracts at issue in drasner,slomiak,and zerman without committing any violations of the exchange act,but the broker in regional properties could not carry out his obligations under the agreements without violating the exchange act,for performance of the agreements entailed selling partnership interests,which the broker lawfully could not do due to his failure to register as a.
the other two cases cited by colkitt are also consistent with this analysis.in both cases,the courts voided loan agreements because the banks violated regulation u,which governs the amount of money that a bank can lend for the purchase of registered securities.in grove first national bank of herminie,cir per curiam,bank employees failed to explain to plaintiff that under federal law,the bank could lend only a certain percentage of the market value of stock to purchase registered securities.concluding that the bank had violated regulation u,we held that section b precluded the bank from recovering a deficiency,even if the borrower knowingly and intentionally deceives the bank as to the actual purposes of the loans.id.at.
in stonehill security national bank,a bank sought to recover the outstanding balance on a loan,but the borrower claimed that the loan was void and unenforceable because the bank issued the loan in violation of regulation u.the bank argued that even if the borrower obligations were void due to the bank alleged violation of regulation u,it still could recover from the guarantor.see id.at.the court disagreed,holding that if the principal obligation violates regulation u,a guarantee of that obligation is void under b of the exchange act.id.the court explained that allow ing a bank to recover on a guarantee even though the underlying loan violated regulation u would encourage banks to extend credit in violation of the margin requirements.id.at.
as with the violation of section a in regional properties,the violations of regulation u in grove and stonehill were inseparable from the underlying agreements between the parties the banks could not perform their obligations under the loan agreements,lend money to the borrowers so that they could purchase securities without violating regulation u.in fact,the loans were made in violation of the exchange act because a greater percentage of the loans was used to purchase securities than is allowed under regulation 
the same can not be said for gfl obligations under the national medical and equimed notes in this case.gfl allegedly unlawful short sales of national medical and equimed stock were nothing more than collateral or tangential to the notes.colkitt insists that performance of the contracts involves a violation of securities laws because performance itself exchange of shares and repayment of the loan plus interest supports gfl illegal short selling by giving gfl shares with which to cover the short sales.br.of appellant at.despite the theory of colkitt case,however,gfl short sales are completely independent of the parties respective obligations under the terms of the,gfl obligation to lend colkitt a total of,and colkitt obligation to repay the loans at gfl option with shares of national medical and equimed stock.in the end,gfl alleged unlawful activity,its short sales is too attenuated from the parties valid,lawful contracts,the national medical and equimed notes or gfl performance thereunder.therefore,we conclude that the notes were neither made nor performed in violation of any federal securities laws as is required for rescission under section b 
market manipulation 
colkitt argues that the district court erred in rejecting his affirmative defense that the notes are void pursuant to section b due to gfl alleged market manipulation,as there exist genuine issues of material fact regarding whether gfl short sales constituted market manipulation in violation of section b and rule.gfl argues,however,that colkitt has not presented enough evidence to create triable issues on any of the elements of market manipulation 
elements of market manipulation under section b and rule 
as an initial matter,the parties disagree about the specific elements of market manipulation under section b and rule.to complicate matters further,we seem not to have addressed squarely what elements are required to establish a claim of market manipulation,particularly in the context of a section b affirmative defense,and the case law from other courts of appeals and district courts on this issue provides limited guidance.section b states in relevant part that i t shall be unlawful for any person t o use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations promulgated by the.rule provides in relevant part that i t shall be unlawful for any person t o employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud.
noting that section b outlaws but does not define a manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance,colkitt turns to section a of the exchange act to determine the elements of the offense of market manipulation.section a prohibits individuals from effecting a series of transactions in any security registered on a national securities exchange creating actual or apparent active trading in such security,or raising or depressing the price of such security,for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.a.based on this passage and the supreme court decision in aaron sec,d,in which the court recognized scienter as an element of a section b claim,colkitt maintains that summary judgment was improper because he created genuine issues with respect to each of the following elements of market manipulation gfl engaged in a series of transactions in the registered securities the purpose of gfl short sales was to induce others to sell the securities gfl short sales created actual or apparent active trading in the securities or depressed the prices of the securities and gfl acted with scienter.
gfl responds that colkitt has mischaracterized the elements of market manipulation by applying an overly broad description of prohibited activities set forth under section a and by ignoring the specific requirements of market manipulation that have evolved over time.gfl points out that market manipulation is virtually a term of art when used in connection with the securities market.it connotes intentional and willful conduct designed to deceive or defraud investors by controlling or artificially affecting the price of securities.ernst ernst hochfelder,d.gfl asserts that colkitt disregards two necessary elements of a market manipulation gfl injected inaccurate information into the marketplace and that gfl conduct affected the price of national medical and equimed stock.br.of appellee at.
the first disputed element is whether colkitt must demonstrate that gfl injected inaccurate information into the marketplace or created a false impression of market activity.like the district court,gfl relies on olympia brewing.at,in which the district court emphasized that the essential element of a market manipulation claim is the injection of inaccurate information into the market.gfl observes that even the cases cited by colkitt recognize that market manipulation requires an additional element,something beyond otherwise legal trading,which specifically injects false information into the market creates an artificial demand for the underlying security.br.of appellee at emphasis added.colkitt responds,however,that he is not required to present evidence that gfl injected affirmative misinformation into the market,but only needs to demonstrate that gfl short trades were made for the undisclosed purpose of artificially depressing share prices.reply br.of appellant at emphasis added.
notwithstanding colkitt assertion to the contrary,the parties appear to be in accord on this point.indeed,the difference between their positions seems to be one without distinction.both gfl and colkitt focus on the need to demonstrate that some action was taken to artificially depress or inflate prices,whether by purposely making false statements or by employing illegitimate,deceptive trading techniques that mislead investors about the price or demand for a stock.
to the extent that the parties respective positions are at odds,however,gfl advances a sounder construction of a section b market manipulation claim,for it is less vague than colkitt.the supreme court has indicated that market manipulation generally refers to practices,such as wash sales,matched orders,or rigged prices,that are intended to mislead investors by artificially affecting market activity.santa fe indus.green,d.the gravamen of manipulation is deception of investors into believing that prices at which they purchase and sell securities are determined by the natural interplay of supply and demand,not rigged by manipulators.gurary winehouse,cir.in that vein,courts must distinguish between legitimate trading strategies intended to anticipate and respond to prevailing market forces and those designed to manipulate prices and deceive purchasers and sellers.although colkitt construction properly reflects the aspiration of section b of preventing market activities that artificially depress prices,it provides little guidance on which activities artificially affect prices and which activities legitimately impact prices.
requiring a section b plaintiff to establish that the alleged manipulator injected inaccurate information into the market or created a false impression of market activity cures this problem.such a construction permits courts to differentiate between legitimate trading activities that permissibly may influence prices,such as short sales,and ingenious devices that might be used to manipulate securities prices,santa fe,at.at,such as wash sales and matched orders.as the court in olympia brewing.at,stated,r egardless of whether market manipulation is achieved through deceptive trading activities or deceptive statements as to the issuing corporation value,it is clear that the essential element of the claim is that inaccurate information is being injected into the marketplace.
the second disputed element is whether colkitt must establish that gfl allegedly manipulative conduct actually depressed the prices of national medical and equimed stock.gfl argues that market manipulation in violation of section b and rule requires that the allegedly unlawful conduct impact a security price.gfl cites three cases to support its position,but all three are unhelpful.first,although we stated in rosenberg hano,cir footnote omitted,that the party claiming injury must plead and prove some change in price,because of the prohibited acts,the case involved an alleged violation of section,not section b and rule.second,the opinion in united states russo,cir,is not significant here because it only addressed the propriety of the portion of the district court jury instruction on the scienter element that defined artificial price as the price level above the stock actual value as determined by market forces.third,the decision in in re blech securities litigation,citation omitted,directly contradicts gfl position by stating that t he absence of allegations of market dominance and price movement are not fatal to a claim of market manipulation,for although these may be classic attributes of market manipulation,they are not requisites.
colkitt position is somewhat inconsistent on this point.on the one hand,he takes great pains to argue that gfl short sales depressed the price of national medical by and the price of equimed by.on the other hand,when confronted with evidence that the prices of the stocks were on a sharp downward trend before and after gfl short sales,thus raising serious doubts about the true reason for the declining prices,colkitt reverses course and argues that he need not prove that gfl alleged scheme was successful in depressing prices.colkitt insists that he only must establish that gfl attempted to depress prices by selling shares short.to muddy the waters even more,colkitt appears to make a concession that an impact on price must be established when he states in his reply brief a jury must also decide whether gfl short trades had an affect sic on share prices.reply br.of appellant at.
despite his on the issue,colkitt appears to be correct that he need not prove that gfl manipulative conduct actually depressed prices.the court of appeals for the fifth circuit concluded in chemetron business funds,cir,that section b,unlike section a,does not require that a plaintiff prove the allegedly unlawful activities had an effect on the price of the stock.although any damages that colkitt would be entitled to recover under his section b and rule counterclaim would be contingent on proving that gfl conduct actually depressed prices,proof of price movement is not necessary to establish a violation of section b and rule and therefore is not necessary to support his assertion of an affirmative defense under section b 
we are satisfied that,at bottom,neither party properly articulates the elements of market manipulation under section b in the context of a section b affirmative defense.because we have not squarely addressed this issue,we must set forth the necessary elements for such a claim.in this regard,we conclude that to establish a section b affirmative defense of market manipulation in violation of section b and rule,colkitt must present evidence that in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,gfl engaged in deceptive or manipulative conduct by injecting inaccurate information into the marketplace or creating a false impression of supply and demand for the security for the purpose of artificially depressing or inflating the price of the security.
evidence supporting colkitt claim of market manipulation 
colkitt affirmative defense based upon gfl alleged market manipulation fails because he can not demonstrate that gfl engaged in any deceptive or manipulative conduct by injecting false inaccurate information into the marketplace or creating a false impression of supply and demand for the stock.as the district court explained repeatedly in its two rulings,colkitt has not presented any evidence that gfl did anything but lawfully engage in short sales of national medical and equimed stock.the fact that these short sales may have contributed to a decline in the stocks prices is not evidence of deceptive or manipulative conduct,for there is no reason to believe these prices were depressed artificially.see sullivan long,scattered,cir concluding that defendant unprecedented massive short selling did not create a false impression of supply and demand because on the other side of defendant transactions were real buyers,betting against defendant,however foolishly,that the price of the stock would rise olympia brewing.at stating that short selling is simply not unlawful,even in large numbers and even if the trading does negatively affect the purchase price.indeed,the district court stated it well when it wrote that it is unreasonable to infer unlawful intent from lawful activity alone.gfl advantage fund,colkitt,memorandum and order at.july.
in the cases colkitt cites in which courts concluded that a party short selling was part of a scheme to manipulate stock prices,the short selling was in conjunction with some other deceptive practice that either injected inaccurate information into the market or otherwise artificially affected the price of the stock.see russo,at,defendants used short sales in concert with unauthorized placements and parking of stock in customers accounts to generate false credits that funded their scheme designed to artificially inflate stock prices united states regan,cir defendants sought to depress temporarily the price of stock by arranging to have shares sold short secretly to a without disclosing to the dealer the identity of the seller or the moving party behind the deal united states charnay,cir to facilitate a bid,defendants artificially depressed stock prices by getting others to sell shares short and guaranteeing these sellers by secret understanding a recovery of per share irrespective of the price obtained on the exchange advanced magnetics,bayfront partners,civ.csh,wl,defendant attempted to depress stock prices through short sales that contravened section a of the exchange act and rule thereunder,which prohibits a short sale below the price at which the last sale of the security was reported,vacated in part on other grounds,cir.
the remaining cases of market manipulation colkitt cites likewise involved either injection of inaccurate information into the market or creation of a false impression of supply and demand for a stock.see santa fe,at.at defendant obtained fraudulent appraisal of stock that severely undervalued its worth in order to lull the minority stockholders into erroneously believing that its offer was generous crane westinghouse air brake,cir in an effort to inflate prices and thwart a corporate,defendant painted the tape by purchasing large blocks of stock in the open market at inflated prices while simultaneously making large secret and unreported sales at lower prices to partially finance the purchases blech.at,defendant arranged sham transactions to inflate prices by improperly directing trades into and out of brokerage accounts at the firm without the authorization of the owners of the accounts sec kimmes,defendant maintained artificially high stock prices by buying and selling stock through undisclosed nominee accounts,distributing false and misleading registration statements,and filing false and materially misleading period reports with the sec,aff.sub,sec quinn,cir sec malenfant,defendant arranged matched buy and sell orders to create a misleading appearance of active trading in the texscan common stock and thus drive up the price of the stock.once again,colkitt fails to proffer any evidence that gfl engaged in any such inappropriate conduct.
colkitt attempts to overcome this dearth of evidence of deceptive or manipulative conduct on the part of gfl by claiming that short sales,by their very nature,convey to market participants negative information about the prospects of the firm.br.of appellant at.colkitt argument misses the mark,however,because conveying negative information about a firm does not constitute market manipulation unless the information is untruthful.indeed,legitimate short sales often convey negative information about a company insofar as short sales suggest that a stock price is overvalued,but that does not mean that such sales distort the market.to the contrary,short selling can help move an overvalued stock market price toward its true value,thus creating a more efficient marketplace in which stock prices reflect all available relevant information about the stock economic value.see sullivan long,at.
colkitt maintains that national medical and equimed were not overvalued.he insists that,because gfl did not argue before the district court that it sold short because it believed the stocks were overvalued,colkitt is entitled to the inference that the short sales were made at least in part to convey to the market the false impression that the stocks were overvalued so as to result in a decline in share prices.br.of appellant at emphasis in original.it would not be reasonable to draw such an inference,however,for to do so would fly in the face of uncontradicted evidence that the prices of national medical and equimed were on a dramatic slide before and after gfl short sales.if we were to draw any inference from the record evidence about the value of national medical and equimed,it would be that the market considered the stocks to be overvalued and that gfl simply was responding to market forces,rather than distorting them,by engaging in short sales.
an examination of colkitt other requested inferences see br.of appellant at,exposes colkitt claims for what they more than a general attack on the lawful practice of short selling.for instance,colkitt first two gfl had a unique financial incentive to depress the prices of national medical and equimed because its profits increased as the market prices decreased and that short selling conveys negative information about the company being short sold and contributes to a drop in share general criticisms of short selling.these inferences,even if granted,are of no help to colkitt in trying to prove market manipulation,inasmuch as short selling is a lawful investment strategy.colkitt next three requested gfl short sales constituted a large percentage of shares sold on a daily basis,that gfl short sales caused a decline in national medical and an decline in equimed and that these price slumps allowed gfl to obtain an additional shares of national medical and an additional shares of equimed from equally unavailing.once again,short selling,even in large volumes,is not in and of itself unlawful and therefore can not be regarded as evidence of market manipulation.that short selling may depress share prices,which in turn may enable traders to acquire more shares for less cash or in this case,for less debt,is not evidence of unlawful market manipulation,for they simply are natural consequences of a lawful and carefully regulated trading practice 
colkitt remaining inferences are equally groundless.because a court is required to indulge only reasonable inferences,we reject colkitt last three requested inferences.for instance,colkitt insists that gfl use of four different brokers to execute the short trades is evidence that gfl tried to conceal its short sales from market participants,including colkitt.this inference is unreasonable as gfl needed to use four brokers because none of them had enough shares necessary for gfl to borrow to carry out all of its short sales,which is not unusual when dealing with small cap stocks.see br.of appellee at citing cason aff.app.
colkitt next requested inference relates to gfl assertion that it sold national medical and equimed short to hedge against the stocks declining prices and to lock in the notes and profit spreads.colkitt offers expert testimony that gfl short sales could not have been part of a legitimate hedging strategy because too much time elapsed between the short sales and the exchange demands.the expert avers that if gfl were only trying to protect itself against declining prices after it made its exchange demand,it could have eliminated that delivery risk by selling short during the period before the exchange demand,thus locking in the sale price during the same period the average closing price would be determined.because gfl waited so long after the short sales to make its exchange demands,the expert contends gfl was not simply hedging against slumping prices,but was increas ing the likelihood of increasing profits through artificially and temporarily lowering the price of equimed.br.of appellant at quoting expert report of professor steven grenadier.
accepting as true grenadier position that gfl could have hedged against all risk by selling short during the prior to the exchange demands,a court reasonably could infer that gfl not only sought to protect itself,but also endeavored to reap further profit from the stocks declining prices by selling short.to infer that these premature short sales were executed to manipulate prices,however,would be an unreasonable leap.indeed,grenadier admits in his deposition that he does not have an opinion about whether gfl short sales artificially depressed the prices of equimed stock.see grenadier dep.at app.therefore,although it may be reasonable to infer from grenadier report that gfl short sales were intended not only to hedge against declining prices but to profit from them,it would be unreasonable to infer that gfl short sales were deceptive or manipulative,especially considering that the expert concedes that he does know whether the trades had the effect of manipulating the prices 
finally,in the words of the district court,colkitt last requested inference amounts to baseless and desperate mudslinging.colkitt asserts that gfl was sued twice for engaging in manipulative short selling thus evidencing that it engaged in that type of conduct with regard national medical and equimed stock.br.of appellant at.gfl responds that it was not even involved in global intellicom,thomson kernaghan,civ,wl july.instead,the case involved a former employee whose allegedly unlawful conduct occurred after he left gfl.gfl also asserts that the action in jts gfl advantage fund,was dismissed in the early stages of the litigation after it filed for rule sanctions against the plaintiff.based on gfl averments,it would be entirely inappropriate to grant colkitt requested inference that these two lawsuits are evidence of gfl alleged market manipulation in this case.
at bottom,the core of colkitt argument is premised on his belief that short selling artificially depresses prices and presumably should be banned as a market manipulation.unfortunately for colkitt,however,short selling is lawful,and courts have held that short selling,even in massive volume,is neither deceptive nor manipulative when carried out in accordance with sec rules and regulations.see sullivan long,at.therefore,to make out a claim of market manipulation,colkitt must present evidence that gfl engaged in some other type of deceptive behavior in conjunction with its short selling that either injected inaccurate information into the marketplace or created artificial demand for the securities.colkitt has offered nothing but evidence that gfl engaged in lawful short sales of national medical and equimed,which alone is insufficient to prevail on a claim of market manipulation in violation of section b and rule.
another reason why colkitt market manipulation claim fails is because he has not met the scienter requirement by offering evidence that gfl engaged in short sales for the purpose of artificially depressing the prices of national medical and equimed stock.citing our opinion in in re advanta.securities litigation,cir,colkitt argues that he has met the recklessness standard for liability under section b.he contends that gfl conduct constitutes an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care and presents a danger of misleading buyers and sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it.id.internal quotation marks omitted.according to colkitt,evidence of gfl alleged recklessness includes gfl powerful economic incentive to depress the stocks prices voluminous scholarly evidence that gfl short sales would convey a negative impression of the companies the dramatic drop in the stocks prices during the period of gfl short selling the additional shares that gfl extracted from colkitt because of the declining prices gfl use of four brokers to conceal his short sales the conclusion of colkitt expert that gfl short sales were not part of a legitimate hedging strategy and gfl having been sued twice for similar conduct.
in essence,colkitt recycles his arguments that he advanced in support of his contention that gfl short trades were manipulative and deceptive.some of this evidence and the requested inferences to be taken therefrom already have been use of multiple brokers,whether gfl short sales were a legitimate hedge strategy,and the alleged lawsuits against gfl for engaging in short the rest of the evidence and inferences are,once again,general attacks on the practice of selling powerful incentive to depress prices,the negative impression of the company conveyed by short sales,the actual drop in national medical and equimed prices,and the additional shares gfl obtained because of the declining prices.all that this information proves is that gfl engaged in the lawful practice of selling stock short and that these short sales may or may not have affected the price of national medical and equimed stock.this evidence neither establishes that gfl short sales were manipulative nor demonstrates that gfl executed the trades for the purpose of depressing the stocks prices.perhaps,if colkitt had offered evidence that gfl short sales violated sec rules for instance,if gfl failed to cover properly the short sales in violation of rule,or if gfl made short sales below the last sales price in violation of rule,colkitt might have been able to establish that gfl conduct was intentionally or recklessly manipulative or deceptive.in the absence of evidence that gfl engaged in any wrongful conduct,however,colkitt claim of market manipulation must fail.therefore,we will affirm summary judgment in favor of gfl with respect to the market manipulation claim.
securities fraud 
colkitt also claims that the notes should be voided pursuant to section b on the grounds that gfl committed securities fraud in violation of section b and rule when it failed to disclose its intent to manipulate the prices of national medical and equimed stock through short sales.gfl responds that it had no duty to disclose its intent to engage in short sales and that colkitt has not established that he either relied on this alleged omission of fact or suffered a cognizable injury as a result of the reliance.
elements of securities fraud under section b and rule 
it is well settled that a claim of securities fraud under section b requires proof that the defendant made misstatements or omissions of material fact with scienter in connection with the purchase or sale of securities upon which plaintiffs relied and that plaintiffs reliance was the proximate cause of their injury.weiner quaker oats,cir citation and internal quotations omitted.the parties apparently agree that the third element has been established,as there is no dispute that the alleged fraud was related to the purchase or sale of national medical and equimed securities.therefore,colkitt must establish genuine issues with respect to the following elements omissions of material fact,reliance,cognizable injury,and scienter 
evidence supporting colkitt claim of securities fraud 
colkitt asserts that gfl concealed from him two critical pieces of information that constitute omissions of material fact gfl intention to sell short national medical and equimed stock and gfl actual short sales of the stock.colkitt maintains that gfl had an affirmative duty to disclose this information because it was material and he would not have entered into the contracts with gfl if he had known it planned to sell the stocks short.
analysis of a securities fraud claim under section b and rule includes two steps first,was the defendant under a duty to disclose at the time at issue second,was the alleged omission or misstatement material if,under the facts of this case,no duty to disclose exists,or if the undisclosed facts are not material,there is no liability under rule.staffin greenberg,cir.a duty to disclose arises only when one party to a transaction has material information that the other party is entitled to have because of some relationship of trust and confidence between the parties,such as when one party is a fiduciary,corporate insider,or tippee.see chiarella united states,d.the supreme court has determined that a n omission of fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding whether to invest.basic,levinson,d quoting tsc,northway,d.materiality is a mixed question of law and fact and should be decided as a matter of law o nly when the disclosures or omissions are so clearly unimportant that reasonable minds could not differ.in re craftmatic sec,cir.
colkitt securities fraud claim falters for at least one and possibly two reasons.to start with,he failed to present any evidence that gfl intended to engage in short sales at the time it loaned the money to colkitt.see in re phillips petroleum secs,cir stating that a statement of intent need only be true when made a subsequent change of intention will not,by itself,give rise to a cause of action under section b or rule.more significantly,even if we can draw an inference that gfl had such a plan,it did not have a duty to disclose its intentions.
colkitt argues that gfl had a duty to disclose its intentions because such a disclosure was necessary to clarify gfl implicit representations that the exchange price would be based upon the accurate,unbiased and untainted market price quoted by the stock market.br.of appellant at.colkitt explains that section b and rule impose a duty to disclose any material facts that are necessary to make disclosed material statements,whether mandatory or volunteered,not misleading.craftmatic,at.he asserts that gfl implicit guarantee that the exchange price would be based upon prevailing market forces was rendered grossly misleading by gfl failure to disclose that it intended to short sell equimed and national medical.br.of appellant at.
we must reject colkitt argument for it is premised on the misguided notion that short sales distort markets and thus produce inaccurate,biased,and tainted market prices.as already explained,short sales executed in accordance with sec rules and regulations not only are lawful,but also do not distort markets or create a false impression of supply and demand because they are legitimate transactions with real buyers on the other side of the sale who are betting that the stock price will rise.see sullivan long,at.contrary to colkitt assertion,gfl short sales did not render its guarantee misleading,and gfl consequently did not have a duty to disclose to colkitt its intention to engage in short selling.therefore,because colkitt failed to create a genuine issue with respect to gfl making an omission of material fact,we will affirm summary judgment in favor of gfl with respect to the securities fraud claim.
reinstatement of federal securities law counterclaims 
colkitt argues that the district court erred when it dismissed his amended counterclaims for lack of specificity on february.he simply states that he pled his amended counterclaims,which span pages,with sufficient specificity pursuant to.we need not consider these contentions,however,because,as we have explained,colkitt failed to create genuine issues of material fact as to certain elements of his corresponding affirmative defenses,and thus,his counterclaims must fail on the merits as well.
violations of pennsylvania laws 
securities claims 
section of the pennsylvania securities act bars the basing of certain suits on contracts that violate state securities laws.see.stat.ann.tit.section of the pennsylvania securities act prohibits the use of any device,scheme or artifice to defraud and the omission of any material fact necessary in order to make statements made,in light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.id.a,b.finally,pennsylvania common law permits t he recipient of a misrepresentation to avoid the contract by showing that the misrepresentation was either fraudulent or material.germantown rawlinson.as gfl asserts,these provisions are functionally identical to section b and section b of the exchange act.see rosen communication serv.group,d,section of the pennsylvania securities act is modeled after rule of the federal securities laws,and requires virtually the same elements of proof.therefore,colkitt state securities and common law fraud claims fail for the same reasons his federal securities claims fail.
breach of contract claim 
colkitt argues that gfl is barred under pennsylvania law from enforcing the notes because gfl committed a material breach of the contracts by refusing to accept colkitt prepayment,even though the notes contain no language prohibiting prepayment.colkitt claims that he notified gfl in late december and early january that he would prepay all outstanding principal and interest on the notes,but gfl improperly rejected colkitt request for prepayment in hopes of declaring the notes in default and collecting millions of dollars in penalties.
gfl responds that it did not outright reject colkitt request for prepayment,but conditionally accepted the prepayment offer while reserving its rights to dispute the balance due.gfl not only disagreed with colkitt about the amounts due,but refused to allow colkitt to dictate the terms of any prepayment.because of its conditional acceptance of colkitt offer,gfl maintains that whether or not the notes permitted prepayment is not at issue gfl also argues that colkitt failure to tender any any payments,for th
