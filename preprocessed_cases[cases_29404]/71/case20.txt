today dispute is part of the fallout from the financial system near meltdown in the late.on one side of this dispute is tutor perini corporation tutor perini.on the other side is banc of america securities llc and bank of america,bas and bana,respectively.to hear tutor perini tell it,bas acting as its,and with bana knowledge and acquiescence sold it securities ars without disclosing that the ars market was heading for a spectacular crash but to hear bas and bana tell it,bas actually disclosed the risks that later materialized.an obviously unconvinced tutor perini sued bas and bana in federal district court,alleging securities fraud under state and federal law,as well as a medley of other claims.on for summary judgment,the district judge sided with bas and bana.concluding that triable claims exist worthy of a jury time and attention,we for reasons recorded below affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand.
how the case got here 
the players 
tutor perini is a giant construction company.and like most corporate colossi,tutor perini is extremely it focuses daily on ensuring that it has enough cash on hand to fund its operations,and it traditionally pours any spare cash into,investments like certificates of deposit and funds,investments that will let tutor perini get cash back as quickly as possible whenever the need arises.
which is where bas came in.a subsidiary of bana,bas now known as merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,incorporated is a banking company registered as a with the securities and exchange commission.bas was a moving force behind tutor perini financial approach.and their relationship went back a ways.
having gotten into financial trouble in the,tutor perini found itself in what is called a workout period,generally defined as a time when the debtor and the creditor try to hammer out an agreement to reduce or discharge a debt.during that stretch,bas served as tutor perini banking advisor under a revolving credit agreement.to help tutor perini regain its financial footing,later credit agreements between them put limits on the kinds of cash investments tutor perini could make as a,tutor perini could not invest in ars.
an ars primer 
backed by a variety of assets or revenue sources student loans or municipal assets,for instance ars are investments,often with maturity dates of years or more.in the ars market,student loans originated under the federal family education loan program ffelp were considered because they were largely guaranteed by the federal government.the credit quality of ars and municipal ars was often enhanced by guarantees a wrap from monoline insurance companies like ambac assurance corporation,which agree to make interest and principal payments if an issuer defaults,ambac wraps its own credit rating around the debt obligation and guarantees timely interest and principal payments in a default situation 
parties buy or sell ars at periodic auctions held,say,every,or days,depending on the particular ars,with the ars interest rate set there too.these are nonpublic auctions.placing bids via authorized,investors say how many ars they want and what interest rate they will accept ars are always bought and sold at par value,so buyers bid by specifying an interest rate rather than a price.the lowest interest rate needed to sell off all available ars becomes the clearing rate.and the clearing rate becomes the ars interest rate until the next auction.ars have caps on the highest possible clearing rate,known in the biz as the max rate,which for our purposes is calculated using a byzantine formula based partly on indices like the london interbank offered rate or the treasury rate two indices in the financial markets measuring interest rates.if there are enough buy bids below the max rate so as to allow for the sale of all available ars,then the auction is deemed a success but if not,then not in which case ars sellers must keep their ars until the next successful auction,all the while earning interest at the max rate 
like some other,bas played several roles in the ars market structuring and underwriting ars on behalf of issuers soliciting and placing ars orders for and preventing auction failures by committing its own capital to buy ars for its inventory accounts,from which it sold ars to its customers.ultimately,though,the ars market was not terribly transparent.among other unknowables,investors usually did not know if an auction only succeeded because of a support bid.they could only learn that from an authorized.obviously,this lack of transparency made ars buyers heavily dependent on their for key data to make sound investment decisions 
bas ars pitch 
in,tutor perini opened a account with bas,an account that required bas to get tutor perini authorization before making account transactions according to tutor perini treasurer susan mellace,bas would give her investment options,and she would choose from a recommended list.a certified public accountant with a master degree in finance,mellace reported to tutor perini chief financial officer,who in turn reported to tutor perini president.and she discussed what vehicles stocks,bonds,she wanted to invest in with these gentlemen,though i n terms of the purchases and sales,those were her calls to make.
keenly aware of tutor perini investment strategy,avoiding risks and illiquidity,bas pitched ars to tutor perini at an meeting in may even though as we noted its own credit agreement with tutor perini banned the company from investing in ars.during the confab,bas salesperson lois mcgrath gave mellace a powerpoint presentation on ars.mellace knew nothing about ars she had never even heard of ars before that presentation,she later explained.and up to that point,tutor perini had never invested in them.
one of mcgrath powerpoint slides explained how bas offered the full spectrum of fixed income securities underwritten by bas,traditional money market funds,and customized portfolios a ll of which can be tailored to meet your specific investment guidelines and promised bas s trict focus on thoroughly identifying your portfolio objectives and understanding your ongoing investment needs,rather than on executing transactions,by providing i nvestment solutions that meet your needs by clearly defining the of particular securities and maintaining the highest level of client servicing.another slide stressed how bas pledged that it would work with tutor perini to evaluate market conditions and determine which investment would meet tutor perini investment objectives.still another slide noted that ars belonged in a portfolio as part of tutor perini c ore cash strategy,along with other investments like treasury bills.yet another slide played up ars l iquidity opportunities,stressing that l iquidity is enhanced by frequent auctions and declaring that the ars auction process has developed into an established and mature market.touting ars low risk and high liquidity,another slide emphasized what a valuable investment tool ars are for c orporate cash managers who typically forecast their cash needs on a monthly basis.the presentation,though,warned of p otential risks,stating among other things that ars auctions could fail with s uch instances typically caused by the deterioration of issuer credit quality.if an auction failed,the slide added,ars sellers would be unable to sell their securities.mellace understood that auctions could to quote her deposition fail,which could potentially leave tutor perini holding the security.
tutor perini did not buy ars in may.a few months later,in december,mcgrath again recommended that tutor perini buy ars at auction or from bas inventory.but after reviewing the credit agreement between tutor perini and bas which,to repeat,barred tutor perini from investing in ars mcgrath told mellace to stick with funds.ever persistent,bas,through mcgrath,amended the credit agreement in january to allow for ars as investments.
bas contagion fears 
late in the summer of,the ars market which bas had called a safe investment for tutor perini core cash took quite a hit,with at least auctions failing presumably because of a crunch.although these ars chiefly involved lenders and their insurers,bas knew immediately that such failures could spread to the entire ars market.indeed,bas head ars trader sort of likened the situation to a contagion that could infect the rest of the ars market.actually,bas public finance executive did call it a contagion,saying bas had to keep an eye on it.
to stop the contagion from advancing,a bas senior manager stressed three things to bas personnel during an august call one,r educe balance sheet two,d o be a hero,rein in traders,capture customer flow and three,w e come first this is a tough environment and we need to make decisions based on our own interests.others spoke up about the issue too,including a bas trader who told her supervisor that bas ars portfolio faced the same risk of auction failure that had hit the market.and she warned that bas had to support an upcoming auction in which lehman brothers was the lead,or else the auction would fail and investors would panic at that time lehman brothers was still a major investment bank.still in mode,and thinking that increased sales could do the trick,bas held an at the end of august to give its financial advisors a more comprehensive understanding of student loan ars.and bas stepped up its support bidding at auctions too.
a good time to buy ars 
it was then in september that bas mcgrath emailed tutor perini mellace to see if mellace could buy ars,saying it was a good time to dive into that market.mellace said that she could do some buying and asked mcgrath if ars were any better than tutor perini other investments.yes they are,mcgrath wrote back.and mcgrath recommended that mellace buy ars.
mcgrath also told mellace that an ars auction had failed in august a failure,mcgrath said,that related to ars,a corner of the ars market in which tutor perini would not be investing.mcgrath assured mellace that bas would support the auctions of ars.mellace ran the possibility by her bosses tutor perini chief financial officer and its president,telling them that auctions could possibly fail,in which case tutor perini would have liquidity until the next auction a daily auction sheet that mcgrath sent mellace actually mentioned that risk.but because bas interests aligned with tutor perini mellace words,not ours the two had a relationship,and bas was the lead bank in the credit agreement the idea that the ars would remain illiquid was too remote a possibility to discuss,though again mellace knew that such a possibility existed.
mellace overseers signed off on her investing in ars,but their okay depended on her investing in,securities,ars with aa and aaa credit ratings.mcgrath knew mellace was only interested in ars.and she knew about tutor perini need for quick liquidity.anyhow,tutor perini finally bought the ars.and after this sale and the other relevant sales too bas sent out trade confirmations directing tutor perini to bas website,which contained bas ars disclosures saying that it routinely bid in auctions,including to prevent failures,but had no obligation to do so 
these ars had formulaic as opposed to fixed max rates keyed in part to indices like the london interbank offered rate or the treasury rate.at this time,however,both indices were trending downward thanks to a weakening economy,while investors were demanding higher interest rates for ars because of concerns over the creditworthiness of certain companies that insured various ars,evidently.the net result is that the space between the ars max rate and the rates demanded by ars buyers referred to by the parties as the headroom shrunk significantly,a phenomenon that suggested that ars auctions would likely fail if the trend continued.faced with this grim prospect,many issuers implemented waivers that temporarily raised the max rate for some ars temporarily,because most were set to expire in january.
lack of investor demand 
concerned about the contagion and the possibility of failure triggered by low caps,bas started tracking ars max rates in early october.noticing a lack of investor demand,bas also ordered a review of its ars inventory.no one from bas discussed this or the risks with mellace.but an october wall street journal article titled bond tumult is jostling securities did note that about auctions worth billion did find enough buyers in august.still,mcgrath kept recommending ars to tutor perini.that same month,october,mcgrath,for example,emailed mellace,encouraging her to buy ars in bas own inventory.relying on mcgrath advice,tutor perini agreed to take several of these ars off bas hands,while knowing to quote from an internal tutor perini memo that there is no guarantee that an ars holder will be able to liquidate its holdings when desired.
one step away from illiquidity 
as october turned to november,a senior bas executive emailed colleagues that quite a few issues in the student loan ars market have come precariously close to failing.bas did not clue mellace in on any of this.and mcgrath kept touting ars as sound investments.
continuing what looks like an effort to reduce its exposure,mcgrath emailed mellace in that bas was offering a lot of its ars inventory for sale at a discount.tutor perini bought one of those recommended ars that same day.a little later,bas senior risk manager forwarded his boss a colleague email warning that t he ars market is one step away from illiquidity.so bas continued making support bids to avert auction failure.
because of bas support bids,its ars inventory swelled to record levels in december.that did not sit well with bas risk manager.he felt that the liquidity problems with ars were so profound that bas had to get rid of them,telling bas staffers that he was very concerned about our ability to keep the ars programs floating.he had talked with a lot of salespersons,he added,and through tears from one of them had learned that they were afraid that their clients are at risk.ars are ripe to be the next problem,he ominously declared.and he recommended that bas hold no ars on its balance sheet.another week went by,and the risk manager told colleagues that t he ars really bother me,emphasizing that the ars book could get ugly,and warning that o nce we have one failed auction,others will most likely follow.so bas ordered a thorough review of max rates on existing book and told the banking team to focus on getting max rates adjusted as quickly as possible where needed.
around december,fitch ratings a major agency issued a press release carried by reuters,dow jones,and business wire saying that some ars issuers had gotten temporary waiver s of their ars max rates.mellace did not recall seeing the report.but bas personnel did see it.and in response a bas senior executive asked his colleagues,d o you think we should be doing more active education around this subject with our corporate investors who buy student loans this might help them have a better understanding of the cash dynamic.bas launched no education effort,however.days after the report,bas risk manager stressed to a coworker how much he really did like the ars product because of the liquidity problem.when you want out,he observed,you are at the highest risk of not being able to get out 
with its ars inventory at levels,some of bas top brass kicked around ways to protect bas.bas senior executives,for instance,toyed with the idea of letting all ars auctions founder,laying out a process to do this so as to hopefully avoid legal liability.they then discussed selectively failing certain auctions instead.they also urged salespersons to leave no stone unturned in getting investors like tutor perini to buy up bas ars.and they continued encouraging issuers to waive max rates.
despite knowing that the calculus for ars had changed dramatically,bas disclosed none of these facts to tutor perini.mcgrath,for example,did not tell mellace about 
the issues with max rates that max rates could cause auction failure,that issuers were executing more and more waivers in the hope of preventing auction failure,
the extent of support bids,though mellace did know that bas made support bids 
the level of ars in bas inventory,plus the swelling of ars inventories at other 
the unprecedented number of waivers being sought 
the dwindling level of investor demand for ars or 
the internal bas discussions to let certain ars auctions fail.instead,mcgrath urged mellace to buy more.by december,tutor perini had become one of bas biggest buyers of ars,with about million invested though it sold off most of its ars at year end it wanted to convert its ars to cash for purposes.
moving paper 
on january,mcgrath emailed mellace a list of featured ars offerings.that same day,tutor perini bought about million worth of ars.bas trading director updated bas executives that afternoon on the ongoing efforts to reduce bas ars inventory and highlighted tutor perini purchase.perini,he noted,who was an end of year seller,came back in and bought about.and he added that the main focus will be to continue moving paper out of bas inventory and onto its customers.the pattern became a script,with bas moving more of its ars inventory onto tutor perini throughout that month.on january,for example,mcgrath emailed another ars recommendation to mellace,saying that these are available for cash settle today,though i nventory seems to be thinning.mellace bought some that very day.two days later,on january,mcgrath again recommended that mellace buy featured ars offerings.and again mellace did just that.
importantly,at least to bas,the prospectuses for some of these ars stated things like 
b are not obligated to make a market in ars,and may discontinue trading in ars without notice for any reason at any time.
are not obligated to continue to place auction bids or encourage other bidders to do so investors should not assume that will do so or that auction failure events and unfavorable auction rates will not occur.
auction failures were especially likely if,for any reason,the were unable or unwilling to bid.also,t he relative buying and selling interest of market participants in your ars and in the ars market as a whole will vary over time,and such variations may be affected by,among other things,news relating to the issuer,the attractiveness of alternative investments,and the perceived risk of owning the security whether related to credit,liquidity or any other risk 
and ars may be unsuitable investments if you require a regular or predictable schedule of payments or payment on any specific date.
unfortunately for all concerned,market conditions went from bad to worse.among other problems,inventory increased the headroom between interest rates and max rates continued narrowing ars auction failures including auction failures for ars occurred and no new ars investors appeared.mcgrath did not tell mellace about this,however.and on the very day a competing let an auction for ars fail,bas sold almost million worth of ars to tutor perini.also,when a at a bas affiliate suggested that portfolio managers protect their clients by begin ning to eliminat e client exposure to ars and refrain ing from additional purchases,a bas ars liaison wrote,whoever sent this out should be shot are they trying to put us out of business and bas geared up to implement a plan conceived in december to selectively fail auctions.
on february,with the rate of auction failures crescendoing that is how bas risk manager described this crisis situation senior bas executives sent a memo to bas chief financial officer seeking permission to up ars inventory levels so bas could relieve some of its pressure.among other things,the memo mentioned the existing state of the market,spotlighting increasing concerns about the ars market,its liquidity,and the drastic rise in inventories.the memo also stressed that the key structural issue the need to increase max rates had still not been resolved.bas management an increase,bumping the limit on inventory levels for ars and securities from billion to billion.but it was too late.
the market crackup 
over the next two days,february and,goldman sachs and jp morgan chase let large numbers of ars auctions fail goldman,for instance,failed several ars auctions.bas personnel called the goldman failures unprecedented and market changing.bas head ars trader jotted a note to himself that mgmt.not comfortable std.loan product a jotting,he later explained,that referred to bas concerns about the product following the morgan failures.yet even though bas officials knew these failures made the ars market nonviable,mcgrath sold tutor perini more ars on february and mcgrath knew about the goldman failures because she had emailed her boss about them on february.also on february,the wall street journal reported on goldman auction failures goldman,the article said,had held auctions of hundreds of millions of dollars in securities backed by student loans,all of which failed to drum up enough demand at their asking prices.the next day,mcgrath told mellace about the february and failures.even though bas disclosures stated that bas could stop supporting auctions at any point and that bas offers no assurances about the outcome of any auction,mcgrath told mellace that bas still intended to support the auctions.
but then this happened all other prominent stopped making their own bids.and faced with that reality,bas did the same thing on february.auctions for ars failed en masse even bas withdrew its support from the ars market.auctions for ars with formulaic max rates failed big time too.but the majority of auctions involving ars with high,fixed max rates generally did not fail.so bas risk manager recommended supporting ars with max rates greater than and failing all others.because the ars were of the formulaic variety,tutor perini was left holding illiquid investments its nightmare scenario.
off to federal court 
invoking jurisdiction,see,tutor perini sued bas and bana in massachusetts federal district court.pertinently,tutor perini complaint contained counts for federal securities fraud alleging what are called b fraud and b unsuitability claims state securities fraud state deceptive business practices as well as state misrepresentation both negligent and intentional after some preliminary skirmishing not relevant here,bas and bana moved for summary judgment on all claims,and tutor perini for partial summary judgment on the claim and the state claim.the judge granted bas and bana motion and denied tutor perini more on the judge ruling later.a dissatisfied tutor perini appeals.
standard of review 
we approach the judge ruling de novo,viewing as we intimated earlier all facts and drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most agreeable to tutor perini the loser.see collazo rosado of,cir.and we will affirm only if the record so viewed discloses no genuine dispute over a material fact and reveals bana and bas entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.see id.at.an issue is genuine if a sensible jury could decide the point in tutor perini favor.see tropigas de,certain underwriters at lloyd of london,cir.and a fact is material if it has the potential to alter the case outcome under the applicable law.see id.that each side for summary judgment does not warp this line of inquiry b arring special circumstances,the judge must consider each motion separately,drawing inferences against each movant in turn.eeoc steamship clerks union,local,cir.and ultimately,we may affirm the holding on any grounds supported by the record,even if not relied on by the district judge.see,collazo rosado,at.
our take on the case 
now on to the core issues in play,which after dealing with the easiest one first we discuss in the order tutor perini chose to present them.
bana stays out 
stressing that tutor perini failed to identify any misconduct on its part,bana asked the judge to jettison all claims against it.not so fast,said tutor perini federal and state securities laws extend liability to control persons,and,the argument continued,bana is on the hook as a controlling person,given the actions of two bana employees and two dual employees who had analyzed maximum rate waivers and liquidity risks for deciding which auctions to fail.unfazed,bana shot back that tutor perini never pled federal and state claims in four years of litigation and could not début those new claims in its submissions.the judge thought bana had the better of the argument.and so do we,because tutor perini alleged zero facts indicating that bana actually exercised control over bas.see aldridge cross,cir.emphasizing that the alleged controlling person must not only have the general power to control the company,but must also actually exercise control over the company.seeking a way around that problem,tutor perini now says that bas needed bana blessing to expand its ars inventory in february surely that shows control,tutor perini insists.but tutor perini waived that point by not bringing it to the district judge attention,and tutor perini makes no argument that any exception to the rule applies.see,ouch fed.mortg.ass n,cir.
with bana out of the way,we turn to the judge handling of the claims against bas.
state claim 
like most states,massachusetts regulates securities sales and offers through blue sky laws,so named because they initially targeted swindlers so brazen and so shameless they would peddle shares of anything,including allegedly shares of the sky.see bennett durham,cir.citing jonathan macey geoffrey miller,origin of the blue sky laws.designed to create a strong incentive for securities sellers to disclose fully all material facts about the security,marram kobrick offshore fund,massachusetts law says that any person who offers or sells a security by means of any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact is liable to the person buying the security from him.laws ch.a.
simplifying slightly but without affecting our analysis,we see that to prevail under this statute,a plaintiff must show that the defendant offered or sold securities in the bay state by a making an untrue statement of material fact or b omitting a material fact that the plaintiff a did not know was false or b did not know was omitted and the defendant knew or should have known was untrue or misleading.marram,at discussing.laws ch.a.significantly,the plaintiff need not show either reasonable reliance on its part or a bad mind on the seller part.see id.at.the plaintiff sophistication is irrelevant as well.id.at.and the plaintiff has no duty to check the accuracy of the defendant statements a ll that is required is that the plaintiff show its ignorance of the untruth or omission.id.quoting sanders john nuveen,cir.
zeroing in on element,the district judge concluded that tutor perini failed to offer evidence that bas made any untrue statement of material fact or omitted a material fact that is necessary to make a prior statement not misleading.the parties fight like mad over element too,though they do not clash over the materiality facet of element.and each side makes good points.but tutor perini is more right than bas,as we now explain.
bas thinks that tutor perini waived its misrepresentation arguments by not calling them to the judge attention.for its part,tutor perini basically concedes that its memo opposing bana and bas motion did not cite the many instances of material misstatements,though it sees no problem because all the relevant facts were fully set forth in its statement of undisputed facts in support of its for summary judgment.that does not cut it.judges,after all,are not like pigs,hunting for truffles buried in the record.united states dunkel,cir.per curiam accord rodríguez machado shinseki,cir.per curiam.so bas is right about the misrepresentation argument being waived.see ouch,at discussing the rule.
the omissions issue is a different matter altogether,however.tutor perini papers sounded a consistent theme that bas failed to disclose material facts concerning the current state of the ars market when it was peddling ars to tutor perini.having recommended the ars,tutor perini wrote,having provided boilerplate disclosures,having presented ars as a good investment vehicle in person and in writing,having provided information about the state and liquidity of the ars market,and having discussed specific ars with tutor perini on a daily basis,bas was duty bound not to omit key facts.and it is to that preserved argument that we now turn.
presence of trialworthy issues 
omissions are failures to speak,at least in the context of this case.see omission,black law dictionary ed.examples of omissions include a speaker not speaking when she has a duty to speak,or speaking misleading,offering truthful comments but omitting unfavorable info.see,nei burley,kannavos annino.tutor perini briefs to us talk a lot about the different sources of disclosure duties that it has in mind but we limit our review to what it argued below,and basically repeats here this case,tutor perini told the district judge,
is about whether bas omitted to state material facts it knew about the ars market at the time bas was specifically recommending and selling ars to tutor perini and was talking to and writing to tutor perini every day to provide it with information about the ars.
given that bas spoke,it had a duty to be complete and accurate or so tutor perini insisted,and still insists 
the parties basically agree that bas made specific investment recommendations to tutor perini.below,mellace said in her affidavit that she followed lois mcgrath recommendations when purchasing ars on behalf of tutor perini.all of this recommendation stuff is significant because even though tutor perini had a account,bas could only suggest a security after studying it sufficiently to become informed as to its nature,price,and financial prognosis.see patsos first albany.also,bas had to inform tutor perini of the risks involved in purchasing or selling that security.see id.and bas affirmative assurance that it would clearly defin e the of particular securities discredits any notion that it could point tutor perini toward additional ars purchases even as the risks dramatically changed without alerting tutor perini to those dramatic changes 
viewed against this legal backdrop,we think that the record considered afresh,and in the light most flattering to tutor perini reveals trialworthy issues on tutor perini state claim,making summary judgment on that claim inappropriate.without expressing our own views on the issues,we believe a reasonable jury could find the following 
in convincing tutor perini to buy ars,bas mcgrath expressly told tutor perini mellace that bas would provide investment solutions that meet your needs by clearly defining the of particular securities 
tutor perini bought the ars at issue here in january and february because bas had recommended that tutor perini buy them 
but the ars had materially and dramatically changed such that by january or,alternatively,by february,bas description to tutor perini no longer thanks to bas omissions accurately and clearly defined the actual as mcgrath pushed the ars on mellace.
on this record seen from a perspective a sensible jury could conclude that some or all of tutor perini ars buys were the product of prior assessments that remained alive yet over time became inaccurate because bas failed to reveal new,highly material developments that it knew of as mcgrath steered mellace to the ars.compare generally patsos,at emphasizing that a broker handling nondiscretionary accounts has a duty to inform the customer of the risks involved in purchasing or selling a particular security,with backman polaroid,cir.en banc noting that a voluntary disclosure of information that a reasonable investor would consider material must be complete and accurate a concept that means that one must reveal such other information that is needed so that what was revealed will not be so incomplete as to mislead quoting sec.gulf sulphur,cir.
further strengthening our conviction on this score,we believe that a rational jury could view the evidence as indicating that tutor perini ars purchases were simply replacing ars that it had sold just before the end of after all,tutor perini did not want the ars on its balance sheet at year end,and bas knew of this plan.these facts could give a rational jury all the more reason to infer that bas representations that ars were better than tutor perini other investment options and that it was a good time to invest in ars,for example carried over to its early ars purchases.given that the circumstances had changed,arguably materially so,a rational jury could find that bas was required to supplement its previous recommendations lest they be inaccurate by way of being incomplete.
absence of any winning bas counterarguments 
undaunted,bas raises a host of arguments for why we should affirm the summary judgment on the state claim.though skillfully presented by talented counsel,none of bas contentions persuades.
on the duty question,bas notes that while a voluntary disclosure of information that a reasonable investor would consider material must be complete and accurate,that does not mean that by revealing one fact,one must reveal all others that,too,would be interesting.backman,at quoting roeder alpha,cir.true,but what bas overlooks is that the law as we noted in an earlier case parenthetical requires one to disclose such other facts that are needed so that what was revealed would not be so incomplete as to mislead.id.quoting.gulf sulphur,at.and here,a jury could find that bas acquired info that caused it to be desperate to sell all of its own ars,yet it kept that info to itself when recommending that tutor perini buy ars.
moving on,bas implies that the february collapse occurred suddenly,so suddenly that it had no idea the market would crumble something that is inferable from its decision to raise the limit from billion to billion on the amount of ars it could hold on its balance sheet.if bas thought the market was about to go,the argument goes,it would have authorized the increase an action that showed to quote its brief that bas was simply trying to keep the auctions going in the hope of weathering the storm.but the problem for bas is that other evidence cuts against any suddenness inference bas,do forget,saw danger signs aplenty well before the collapse,as shown by its 
talking internally about a contagion in summer knowing including itself had massive,unsustainable ars inventories as events dragged into,inventories that were causing them to lose the ability to make support bids and 
realizing the ars market was one step away from illiquidity near the end of.
we could go on and on,but you get the idea.as for bas metaphor,a levelheaded jury could conclude that bas knew perfectly well that it and other were in the midst of a financial storm,with disaster looming yet bas concealed the storm existence from tutor perini.and because this suddenness matter is open to reasonable dispute,it is not the stuff of summary judgment.see mason telefunken semiconductors,llc,cir.
bas also faults tutor perini for not divining the problems with the ars market on its own.to that we say this a rational jury could find that mellace did not have a clear picture of the market actual state,which is why she relied so much on mcgrath.and whether she should have ignored what mcgrath said and done her own research matters not one bit because massachusetts blue sky law imposes no such obligation on investors.see marram,at noting that a buyer has no duty to investigate,emphasizing instead that t he buyer needs only to show lack of knowledge of a misleading statement or omission to carry the day quoting mid am.fed.sav.loan ass.express,cir.
wait a minute,says bas mellace knew of auction failures before it chose to buy ars back in september,courtesy of a chat with mcgrath at that time.but mellace swore in an affidavit that mcgrath only mentioned one auction failure then a failure,mcgrath added,that involved ars,an area of the market in which tutor perini would not be investing its money.bas tries to downplay this fact by talking up an august email sent to tutor perini president discussing several fizzled auctions.but this is not a winning strategy.the president said he did not read the email he gets bombarded with and ignores unsolicited missives like this one all the time,he added.and bas points to no evidence indicating that any tutor perini personnel ever read that email.at best for bas,the email raises a question of fact about tutor perini knowledge,and so summary judgment can not be used to resolve it.see,corporación insular de seguros,cir.
staying with auction failures,bas writes that different news outlets reported on some between august and february.repeating that massachusetts imposes no duty on an investor to investigate or verify the accuracy of a seller statements,see marram,at,we note that mellace said that she did not know about auction failures other than the one auction failure in august,of course until mcgrath fessed up to them in february after tutor perini had bought the ars at issue.yes,mcgrath did send mellace articles discussing the credit problems of some monoline insurers.but other evidence indicates that mcgrath never told mellace whether or how the monoline insurers credit woes might impact tutor perini ars investments.on top of this,still other evidence suggests that the february collapse had nothing to do with insurance rather,it had to do with the fact that bidding rates for variable ars whether insured or not were going up while max rates were going down.and additional evidence reveals that mellace never knew about this structural problem.bas also talks about the december press release that fitch ratings put out you know,the one that discussed how some ars issuers had obtained temporary waivers.well,mellace had no memory of seeing that report.so what we have,again,are controversies of fact that can not be resolved through summary judgment.see,at.more importantly,to the extent bas still thinks the august auction breakdown gives it a defense,we stress that the issue here is not tutor perini knowledge in august it is tutor perini knowledge in january and february,when the significant events occurred.
also missing the mark is bas argument that tutor perini had access to two key things info regarding the max rates for the ars all it had to do,bas writes,was review prospectuses and excel spreadsheets,or ask bas for the max rates plus info concerning bas levels all it had to do,bas insists,was take emailed excel files reflecting the par amount of ars held in bas inventory and then use excel feature to calculate bas level for any particular day.as for part of bas argument,other evidence shows bas personnel knew that max rates were hard to figure out and understand even for financial advisors,and that one could not calculate the max rate simply by reading prospectuses.additionally,the prospectuses said zip about what was actually happening in the market,that issuers continuously needed to waive max rates to prevent auction failures.and other evidence indicates the spreadsheets were out of date,having been created in december months before tutor perini bought any ars.as for part of bas argument,other evidence also suggests bas sometimes sent outdated,inaccurate,and incomplete inventory indicators.the net result is these issues are for a jury to sort out,not a judge on summary judgment.see,at.
and contrary to what bas argues,its powerpoint presentation which noted that ars auctions could fail and its disclosures on its public website which say that bas routinely bids in ars auctions,including to keep auctions from failing,but is obliged to do not change our decision here is why.
tutor perini essentially concedes it knew that bas could theoretically stop supporting ars auctions and that ars auctions could theoretically fail.and bas essentially concedes it would have to reveal facts in what is called the classic grand canyon situation,a situation where the makes risk disclosures that,given the market state,are akin to a hiker warn ing his companion to walk slowly because there might be a ditch ahead when he knows with near certainty that the grand canyon lies one foot away.see in re prudential sec,supp,quotation marks omitted.basically,the fight is over whether a jury could rationally find that this is that situation.
our caselaw as bas is quick to note says that when a defendant specifically disclose s a risk,t o the extent that the plaintiff complaint is that the precise degree of risk was not stated,that failure is not sufficient to have rendered the statements misleading.see hill gozani,cir.emphasis omitted.bas flashes hill around like a trump card,insisting that because it disclosed the possible risks of auction failure and withdrawal,it did not have to identify the degree of risk.but try as it might,bas can take no comfort from hill.
hill made several points directly applicable here.it noted that a statement of risk does not insulate the speaker from liability,particularly where it is generic and formulaic.id.quoting lormand unwired,cir.it noted that a statement that discloses a level of risk may be so understated as to be misleading.id.and it noted that a defendant could be on the hook for downplaying a risk,id.at a concept that calls to mind the scenario,where a defendant sees disaster looming on the horizon but opts to whitewash reality,see id.at.
applying those principles,we after considering the aggregate record facts in the light most sympathetic to tutor perini believe a rational jury could conclude bas knew but elected not to disclose that the ars market teetered on the brink of collapse when it encouraged tutor perini to snatch up more ars.that bas specifically pushed ars on tutor perini in winter despite a fearing the market was one step away from illiquidity,b knowing an auction for the same type of ars had recently flopped,and c realizing the market was nonviable surely suggest as much those are but a few of the many danger signs discussed above put slightly differently viewing the facts from the required perspective,a reasonable jury could find that while bas was taking steps to protect itself,it urged an unsuspecting tutor perini to walk right off the cliff.certainly the question of whether these facts put the parties in the situation should go to the jury.and that kiboshes bas arguments.see generally dow corning merrill lynch in re merrill lynch auction rate sec.litig,md lap,wl,at collecting caselaw recognizing that a defendant can not rely on a generic disclaimer in order to avoid liability when it is aware of an actual danger or cause for concern quotation marks and emphasis omitted dow corning,fsh ps,wl,at,rejecting defendants bid to rely on among other things news articles and prospectuses that publicized the risk that auctions might fail and the practice of brokers to submit support bids to prevent auction failures the very facts supposedly concealed by defendants,an outcome reached because the documents did not inform plaintiffs of existing market facts 
bas reliance on backman is equally misplaced.there,the polaroid corporation had disclosed a current market fact that it was selling its polavision cameras below cost.at.and,we said,having done so,polaroid disclosure was not misleading by reason of not saying how much below.id.still,we added,if management knew that polavision was a commercial failure,to say simply that its earnings were negative might well be found to be a material misrepresentation by and incompleteness.see also carpri optics profit sharing dig.equip,cir.noting how polaroid could have come out differently if defendant apprehension was of a disaster.today case involves precisely that bas knew about an impending disaster or so a logical jury could deduce and,hoping to escape liability,now plays up boilerplate disclosures that did not jibe with market facts.
noting that we can affirm on an alternative ground supported by the record,bas tries to save its victory here by arguing that massachusetts blue sky law applies only to initial public offerings not to private,secondary sales,like those that happened here.its argument works in four steps.
quoting marram,bas emphasizes how section a of the state blue sky law is almost identical with section of the federal securities act of,see at refined to their essentials,the former act creates a remedy against a ny person who offers or sells a security by means of any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact,see.laws ch.a,while the latter act creates a remedy against any person who offers or sells a security by means of a prospectus or oral communication,which includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact,see a.
a prospectus is a term of art referring to a document that describes a public offering of securities by an issuer or controlling shareholder a fact,bas reminds us,that led the supreme court to conclude that the federal statute is limited to public offerings.see gustafson alloyd,emphasis added.
again quoting marram,bas points out that courts must interpret the massachusetts statute in coordination with the federal statute.see at.
and interpreting the acts in the same manner requires us to hold that,like the federal act,the state act does not apply to sales at least that is what bas thinks.
we think not.bas is right that courts should look to caselaw in interpreting the state act.see id.but courts must look to the state act plain language too.see id.and unlike the federal act,the state act has no limiting prospectus language and so is not likewise limited marram proves the point at least implicitly by characterizing the sale of shares at issue there as a private offering,yet holding that the plaintiff had a cause of action under the commonwealth blue sky law.see id.at,see also marram kobrick offshore fund,wl,at.super,reading marram that way too.all of that makes us comfortable with rejecting this aspect of bas affirmance argument as does this the uniform blue sky act on which the massachusetts act is modeled applies regardless of whether the sale is public or private,primary or secondary.joseph long et,blue sky law see generally marram,at looking to that treatise for guidance.
summing up 
because the state claim turns on fact questions the matter is not so that one party must prevail as a matter of law,see anderson liberty lobby,tutor perini is entitled to a jury decision on that claim.
federal claim 
that takes us to tutor perini claim premised in part on allegations that bas made material misrepresentations or omissions concerning the risks of ars investing and in part on allegations that bas knowingly recommended unsuitable investments,unsuitable because ars did not fit tutor perini investment needs.sparring with bas,tutor perini contends that the judge stumbled in kicking each claim out on summary judgment.tutor perini is only half right,we rightly hold.
to succeed on its claim tutor perini must prove the following elments a material omission scienter,or a wrongful state of mind a connection with the purchase or sale of a security reliance economic loss and loss causation.see.firefighters pension ret.smith wesson holding in re smith wesson holding.sec.litig,cir.after ticking off the list of omissions the judge homed in on elements and.on element,the judge concluded that the omissions were either disclosed in bas documents or in publicly available material.see generally cellular,morgan,in re jp morgan auction rate sec.ars mktg.litig,md pgg,civ.pgg,wl,at,emphasizing there can be no omission where the allegedly omitted facts are disclosed quotations omitted.on element,the judge held that because bas had accurately disclosed the risk of auction failure,it had no duty to say anything more than it did.and so the judge ruled that tutor perini could not invoke any presumption of reliance because i t is hard to conceive of relying on omitted information,which is why the supreme court devised a rebuttable presumption of reliance,see eckstein balcor film inv rs,cir,a presumption that applies if there is an omission of a material fact by one with a duty to disclose,see stoneridge inv.partners,llc sci.atlanta,emphasis added.
the parties battle hard over elements and,with tutor perini rejecting and bas defending the judge analysis.following their lead,we train our sights exclusively on those elements.and we again side with tutor perini.
regarding bas principal argument that it accurately disclosed the info tutor perini says was omitted,and thus had zero duty to say anything else we find the contention no more persuasive now than it was a few pages ago simply flash back to our earlier discussion of how evidence in the record suggests,one,that the prospectuses,excel spreadsheets and files,and news articles that bas talks about were out of date,inaccurate,or not particularly helpful in understanding the state of the ars market and,two,that the case fits the scenario.so the presumption applies.see id.reliance is usually a jury issue,unless the evidence tips the scale only in one direction.kennedy josephthal,cir.emphasis added and the usual rule,not the exception,applies here 
enough said on that.
unsuitability 
broadly speaking,an unsuitability claim requires that a plaintiff show that the defendant is responsible for some misrepresentation or material omission,see lefkowitz smith barney,harris upham,cir.per curiam,and that the quality of the securities bought was inappropriate to its investment objectives,see tiernan blyth,eastman,dillon,cir.emphasis omitted.in rejecting tutor perini unsuitability claim,the district judge reached three conclusions.one,the judge said that the prospectuses mentioning as they do how ars may be unsuitable if you require a regular or predictable schedule of payments wrecked tutor perini unsuitability claim.two,the judge taking a approach added that because he had already concluded,as a matter of law,that bas did not make material misrepresentations or breach a duty to disclose material facts,tutor perini unsuitability claim had no oomph.and three,citing and quoting a seventh circuit case associated randall bank griffin,kubik,stephens thompson,cir.the judge stressed that tutor perini suitability claim may be barred because it held a brokerage account whereby it directed all the investments made.
tutor perini says that this aspect of the judge ruling is wrong from beginning to end.bas begs to differ.for our part,we see an obstacle that tutor perini can not surmount.
even granting without deciding that the judge missed the boat with conclusions one and two,we see that tutor perini must still deal with conclusion three,that securities transactions can not support an unsuitability claim,a conclusion bas fights tooth and nail to defend in its appellee brief.but the difficulty for tutor perini is as bas argues tutor perini cites no authority to support its view contrary to the judge and bas that nondiscretionary account holders can bring unsuitability claims.tutor perini reply brief never challenges bas cites no authority point,incidentally.nor do tutor perini appellate papers offer any convincing explanation of what the law should be,assuming it found no authority.what we have from tutor perini,then,is hardly a serious treatment of a complex issue,see tayag lahey clinic,cir.certainly not when its brief presents a passel of other protests,see rodríguez,at quoting dunkel,at.it is not our job to do tutor perini work for it.see united states,cir.the bottom line is that tutor perini waived any objection to the alternative ground,conclusion three for upholding the judge edict.see,medina rivera mvm,cir.muñiz rovira,cir.town of norwood fed.energy regulatory comm n,cir.
state misrepresentation claims negligent and intentional 
granting bas summary judgment on tutor perini claims for negligent and intentional misrepresentation,the judge ruled that tutor perini neither respond ed to bas arguments refuting the allegations of misrepresentation nor identif ied any false statements made by bas.as for the parties dispute about the judge ruling,we need only say this much tutor perini correctly cites a case holding that a claim under massachusetts law can be based on omissions.see first marblehead house,cir.and as we have been at pains to stress,the evidence shows triable issues of fact exist over bas omissions omissions that the judge did not consider in reviewing tutor perini claim.so the entry of summary judgment on that claim can not stand.
but the same can not be said about tutor perini claim.for though a heading in tutor perini opening brief suggests the judge erred in dismissing the claim,its appellate papers never explain how this is so.and thus tutor perini waived any argument it might have on that claim.see united states zannino,cir.stressing that i t is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way,leaving the court to do counsel work see also rodríguez,at emphasizing that claims not made and claims confusingly constructed and lacking in coherence are deemed waived too quoting united states eirby,cir.
one last issue,and we can call it quits.
state claim 
a massachusetts statute creates a cause of action commonly called a chapter claim for any business entity injured by an unfair or deceptive act or practice by another business entity.see.laws ch.because he had tossed out tutor perini claims,the judge believed he had to toss out tutor perini chapter claim too in other words,because he found bas had made no material omissions and thus had not acted unfairly or deceptively,the judge at least implicitly reasoned that tutor perini chapter claim could not survive summary judgment either.the parties bicker a bit about the judge handling of this claim.but having rejected the reasoning underpinning the judge ruling here we see trialworthy issues on the claims,after all his stated basis for the entry of summary judgment on the chapter claim evaporates.
final words 
with that and at long last,we vacate the summary judgment for bas on the state claim dealing with material omissions,the federal claim ditto,the state claim ditto,and the state claim ditto.we affirm in all other respects.in so ruling,we intimate no view on the outcome of any trial we have construed the record as favorably to tutor perini as we could,and we know that a trial might cast the facts in a different light.to this we must add,though,that bas did move for summary judgment on alternative grounds,scienter,loss causation that the judge never ruled on.and of course the parties and the judge are free to take up those yet unexplored grounds on remand.
affirmed in part,vacated in part,and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion,with no costs to either side.
we apologize for all the acronyms they seem to go with the territory in cases like this,however.
as required,we take the facts as favorably to tutor perini case as the record permits.see,lang storeseast,cir.
monoline insurance companies provide guarantees to issuers,often in the form of credit wraps,that enhance the credit of the issuer.these insurance companies first began providing wraps for municipal bond issues,but now provide credit enhancement for other types of bonds,such as securities and collateralized debt obligations.see monoline insurance company,investopedia,last visited.
an illustration may be helpful suppose the market demand required that certain ars pay interest if the ars max rate was,then the auction would fail because bids above could not be accepted by the auction agent so there would be no sales.
tutor perini expert did a good job of highlighting the ars market opaqueness and explaining what that meant to investors the ars market in lacked fundamental transparency for investors.investors simply could not obtain independently much of the material information regarding those investments and markets.they could only know critically important information if their broker s told them.that meant that all investors were essentially for material information necessary to exercise independent judgment regarding their investments.auction agents,the expert added,were generally authorized under the terms of many ars to release the information concerning the maximum rate,bidding amounts,and other auction data only to the issuer and authorized d isclosures to investors were not authorized.
bas is permitted,but is not obligated,to submit orders for its own account and routinely does so in its sole discretion,the disclosures read.also,s uch bids submitted by bas may be designed to prevent a failed auction however,bas is not obligated to place such a bid in any auction,or to continue to place such bids.investors should not assume that bas will place a bid or that failed auctions or unfavorable auction rates will not occur.bas is not obligated to make a market in the securities,the disclosures added,and may discontinue trading in the securities without notice for any reason at any time.noting that bas provides no assurance as to
