after trial in the district of connecticut janet hall,chief judge,a jury convicted defendant appellant jesse litvak of various charges of securities fraud,fraud against the united states,and making false statements.on appeal,litvak challenges these convictions on several grounds.
first,litvak contends that,for the purposes of the fraud against the united states and making false statements counts,the evidence adduced at trial provided an insufficient basis for a rational jury to conclude that his misstatements were material to the department of the treasury,the pertinent government entity.we agree,and accordingly reverse the district court judgment of conviction as to those charges.
second,litvak argues that his misstatements were,as a matter of law,immaterial to a reasonable investor,which would require reversal of the securities fraud counts as well.however,because a rational jury could conclude that litvak misstatements were material,the materiality inquiry a mixed question of fact and law was properly reserved for the jury determination.
third,litvak claims that,in respect of the scienter element of the securities fraud counts,the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict and that the district court failed adequately to instruct the jury.because litvak is incorrect that contemplated harm is a requisite component of the scienter element of securities fraud,we reject this challenge.
fourth,litvak asserts a number of evidentiary errors at trial.we agree that the exclusion of certain proffered expert testimony exceeded the district court allowable discretion,and that such error was not harmless.accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment of conviction as to the securities fraud charges and remand for a new trial.because the other evidentiary rulings that litvak challenges on appeal are likely to be at issue on remand,we also address those claims and conclude that the district court exceeded its allowable discretion in certain of those rulings as well.
background 
the charges in this case arise from litvak conduct as a securities broker and trader at jefferies company jefferies,a global securities and investment banking firm 
in january,the government filed an indictment charging litvak with eleven counts of securities fraud,see b,counts,one count of fraud against the united states,see count,and four counts of making false statements,see counts.the indictment alleged that litvak made three kinds of fraudulent misrepresentations to several of jefferies counterparties,some of which were public private investment funds ppifs in order to covertly reap excess profit for jefferies in the course of transacting residential securities rmbs first,the indictment alleged that litvak fraudulently misrepresented to purchasing counterparties the costs to jefferies of acquiring certain rmbs.second,the indictment alleged that litvak fraudulently misrepresented to selling counterparties the price at which jefferies had negotiated to resell certain rmbs.third,the indictment alleged that litvak fraudulently misrepresented to purchasing counterparties that jefferies was functioning as an intermediary between the purchasing counterparty and an unnamed seller,where in fact jefferies owned the rmbs and no seller was extant.
in february and march,a trial by jury was held on the charges described above,except for count seven a securities fraud charge,which was dismissed on the government motion the day before trial commenced.viewing the evidence,as we must,in the light most favorable to the government,united states mcginn,cir,we find that the jury could have reasonably concluded the following from the evidence adduced at trial.
as a bond trader at jefferies during the relevant time period,litvak bought and sold rmbs on jefferies behalf,sometimes as a middleman holding the rmbs only briefly when facilitating a transaction between two other parties and sometimes holding the rmbs for a longer period of time in jefferies inventory.joint app x at.between and,litvak made three types of misrepresentations to representatives of the counterparties with whom he transacted on jefferies behalf in order to increase jefferies profit margin on the transactions in which he engaged.first,he misrepresented to purchasing counterparties jefferies acquisition costs of certain rmbs.for example,in the course of the transaction at issue in counts one,twelve and thirteen,litvak falsely represented to michael canter,a representative of the alliancebernstein legacy securities fund alliancebernstein fund,a ppif,that jefferies had purchased certain rmbs at a price of based on face value,when in fact litvak knew that jefferies had purchased those securities at jefferies subsequently sold the securities to the alliancebernstein fund at a price of.canter testified that this difference would have mattered and been important to him id.at.if jefferies and the alliancebernstein fund had instead transacted at a price of,the fund would have paid approximately less for the securities the total cost was approximately million.
second,litvak misrepresented to selling counterparties the price at which jefferies had negotiated to resell certain rmbs.in the course of the transaction at issue in count eight,for example,litvak falsely stated to a representative of york capital management york,a hedge fund that owned certain rmbs,that litvak had arranged for jefferies to resell those securities to a third party at a price of based on face value.litvak and york representative,kathleen corso,agreed that jefferies would purchase the securities from york at a price of,in order to allow jefferies to reap a profit when resold to the third party at.however,litvak had actually arranged for jefferies to resell the securities to the third party at a price of.indeed,york sold the securities to jefferies at a price of and jefferies then resold the securities to the third party at a price of for a profit of.corso testified that this difference would have been important to her id.at.if jefferies and york had instead transacted at a price of,providing jefferies with a profit of,as litvak had represented to corso,jefferies would have paid york approximately more for the securities the total cost was approximately million.
third,litvak misrepresented to purchasing counterparties that jefferies was functioning as an intermediary between the purchasing counterparty and an unnamed seller,where in fact jefferies owned the rmbs and no seller existed.in the course of the transaction at issue in count eleven,for example,litvak falsely represented to a representative of magnetar capital magnetar,a hedge fund,that litvak was actively negotiating with a seller of certain rmbs,acting as a middleman when,in fact,litvak knew that jefferies held the securities in its inventory.litvak negotiations with vladimir lemin,magnetar representative,began with lemin offer to purchase the securities at a price of.litvak then described to lemin a fictional between himself and an unnamed,seller,which concluded with litvak false representation to lemin that he had contemporaneously purchased the securities on jefferies behalf at a price of.lemin then agreed for magnetar to purchase from jefferies the securities at a price of,in order to allow jefferies to reap a profit or commission when resold.id.at.however,the securities purchased from jefferies by magnetar were actually held in jefferies inventory and had been acquired by jefferies several days prior at a price of.lemin testified that this distinction reflected a very different situation from that which he understood at the time of the transaction id.at.if jefferies and magnetar had instead transacted at a price of,the transaction price of less the understood commission for jefferies,magnetar would have paid jefferies approximately less for the securities the total cost was approximately million.
at the conclusion of the trial,the jury convicted litvak of securities fraud counts,fraud against the united states count,and making false statements counts.litvak moved for judgment of acquittal or,in the alternative,a new trial on several grounds,including those raised on appeal.the district court denied litvak motion in a published opinion,see united states litvak,d,and sentenced him to months imprisonment,three years supervised release,and a million fine.
this timely appeal followed.a prior panel of this court granted litvak motion for release pending appeal because he raised a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in reversal.order,united states litvak,cr cir,ecf alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.
discussion 
litvak challenges his convictions on several grounds,four of which we reach in this opinion.first,litvak contends that,for purposes of the fraud against the united states and making false statements counts,the evidence adduced at trial provided an insufficient basis for a rational jury to conclude that his misstatements were material to the department of the treasury,the pertinent government entity.we agree,and accordingly reverse the district court judgment of conviction as to those charges.
second,litvak urges us to hold that his misstatements were,as a matter of law,immaterial to a reasonable investor,which would require reversal of the securities fraud counts as well.however,because a rational jury could conclude that litvak misstatements were material,the materiality inquiry a mixed question of fact and law was properly reserved for the jury determination.
third,litvak claims that,in respect of the scienter element of the securities fraud counts,the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict and the district court failed adequately to instruct the jury.because litvak is incorrect that contemplated harm is a requisite component of the scienter element of securities fraud,we reject this challenge.
fourth,litvak asserts a number of evidentiary errors at trial.we agree that the exclusion of certain proffered expert testimony exceeded the district court allowable discretion,and that such error was not harmless.accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment of conviction as to the securities fraud charges and remand for a new trial on those charges.because the other evidentiary rulings that litvak challenges on appeal are likely to be at issue on remand,we also address those claims and conclude that the district court exceeded its allowable discretion in certain of those rulings as well.
fraud against the united states and making false statements 
litvak contends that,in respect of the fraud against the united states and making false statements counts,the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to establish the materiality of his misstatements to the department of the treasury the relevant government entity.because we conclude that the evidence was insufficient to permit a rational jury to find that litvak misstatements were material to the treasury,we reverse his convictions on those charges counts.
standard of review 
as a general matter,a defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence bears a heavy burden,as the standard of review is exceedingly deferential.united states brock,cir internal quotation marks omitted.specifically,we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,crediting every inference that could have been drawn in the government favor,and deferring to the jury assessment of witness credibility and its assessment of the weight of the evidence.id.internal quotation marks omitted.although sufficiency review is de novo,we will uphold the judgments of conviction if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
materiality for purposes of,
litvak was convicted under for making false statements counts and for fraud against the united states count.section proscribes one from,inter alia,knowingly and willfully mak ing any materially false,fictitious,or fraudulent statement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive,legislative,or judicial branch of the government of the united states.a see also united states shanks,cir per curiam explaining that section was designed to protect the authorized functions of governmental departments and agencies from the perversion which might result from deceptive practices internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.section prohibits one from,inter alia,knowingly execut ing any scheme or artifice with the intent to obtain money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises,including through the troubled asset relief program,an economic stimulus,recovery or rescue plan provided by the government,or the government purchase of any troubled asset as defined in the emergency economic stabilization act of a.
i n order to secure a conviction under a,the government must prove that a defendant knowingly and willfully,made a materially false,fictitious,or fraudulent statement,in relation to a matter within the jurisdiction of a department or agency of the united states,with knowledge that it was false or fictitious or fraudulent.united states coplan,cir,cert.denied,d.for purposes of the second element,which is at issue here,a statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence,or be capable of influencing,the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed id.at emphasis added.
we have not previously addressed the contours of materiality for purposes of.because the parties agree that materiality is an element of section,and that such requirement is coextensive with section materiality element,we assume as much and therefore have no occasion to address the issue here the parties also agree that the decisionmaking body in this case is the department of the treasury.
c.the government evidence 
the government relies primarily upon the testimony of david miller,formerly chief investment officer for the treasury office of financial stability in its attempt to identify sufficient evidence from which a rational jury could have concluded that litvak misstatements were material to the treasury.
as relevant to this case,miller role at the treasury was to oversee the investment program that was created as a result of the financial crisis,joint app x at,which formed and invested in the ppifs.ppifs were partnership s between the treasury and private investors established to purchase troubled assets,including certain rmbs that had rapidly deteriorat ed in value during the financial crisis.id.at see also supra notes.
miller explained that the treasury was responsible for overseeing the ppifs.the treasury selected the ppif asset managers and prescribed rules governing how they would invest the capital.joint app x at.to enable the treasury to perform its oversight duties,the ppifs were required to provide the treasury access to detailed trade level data upon request.id.at.such data might be used to explore concerns about the internal conflicts of interest that the treasury wanted to be able to check upon,such as assuring that firms with multiple funds that invested in these type of securities erected certain separations and walls.id.in addition,miller testified that the treasury received formal monthly report s of each ppif top positions and market color,and that it participated in periodic update calls with ppif managers.id.at.
miller also explained,however,that because the treasury did not have the expertise to purchase and manage the assets at issue,the investment decisions were managed by the fund managers it had selected expert asset managers that were well established in the field.id.at.the fund managers were given complete discretion over which eligible assets to buy and sell.id.at.
the government also elicited testimony regarding miller prior duty to report fraud.while employed by the treasury,if miller received reports of fraud from ppif managers,he would refer that information to the special inspector general that had been established to provide essentially independent audit and oversight to prevent fraud,waste and abuse of the ppifs.id.at.
d.the evidence was insufficient to establish capability to influence a decision of the treasury 
even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,there was insufficient evidence for a rational jury to conclude that litvak misstatements were reasonably capable of influencing a decision of the treasury.despite adducing evidence that litvak misstatements may have negatively impacted the treasury investments,that this impact would have been reflected in aggregate monthly reports submitted by ppif managers to the treasury,and that the misstatements were the impetus for an investigation by the treasury that eventually led to litvak prosecution,the government submitted no evidence that litvak misstatements were capable of influencing a decision of the treasury.to the contrary,on,miller testimony was unequivocal that the ppifs were deliberately structured in a manner that kept the treasury away from making buy and sell decisions.id.at.to that end,miller explained,the treasury cast itself as a limited partner in the ppifs,and retained no authority to tell the investment managers which rmbs to purchase or at what price to transact id.at.
in defending litvak convictions for fraud against the united states and making false statements,the government advances three grounds for affirmance,each of which we find unpersuasive.first,the government suggests that a jury could reasonably conclude that litvak misstatements stymied certain ppifs from transacting rmbs at the best possible prices,thereby impeding the treasury ability to reap optimal returns on their investments in those funds.gov t br.at quoting joint app x at.nevertheless,even if a rational jury could accept the underlying assertion that litvak misstatements ultimately,though indirectly,frustrated the treasury achievement of its investment goals it may not then infer solely therefrom that those misstatements were capable of influencing a decision of the treasury.such speculation is not permitted rather,for a jury to so conclude,the government must have adduced evidence of an actual decision of the treasury that was reasonably capable of being influenced by litvak misstatements.see united states gaudin,d deciding whether a statement is material requires the determination of the question what decision was the agency trying to make internal quotation marks omitted.to form the basis of a jury conclusion,evidence of such a decision can not be purely theoretical and evidence of such a capability to influence must exceed mere metaphysical possibility 
second,the government suggests that we may affirm because the information the ppifs reported to the treasury was affected by litvak conduct.gov t br.at.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,we accept that litvak misstatements resulted in the ppifs with which he transacted buying or selling rmbs at slightly lower or higher prices than they would have absent the misstatements.it may follow that the government underlying contention that information reported to the treasury was affected by litvak misstatements is accurate insofar as the monthly reports submitted by the ppifs to the treasury reflected marginally higher or lower aggregate balances in light of the prices at which rmbs were bought or sold in the transactions at issue.see id.at.however,even if the ppifs monthly reports to the treasury accurately reflected slightly higher or lower balances than would have been reported but for litvak misstatements,such evidence is insufficient to permit a rational jury to find materiality.indeed,the government has failed to identify any evidence tending to show that these minor variations in the reports aggregate balances had the capability to influence a decision of the treasury 
third,the government suggests that t he fact that the treasury actually referred the matter to the special inspector general for investigation demonstrates that the treasury regarded litvak conduct as significant.id.at internal citation omitted.but,of course,every prosecution for making a false statement undoubtedly involves decisions by the government to refer for investigation,investigate,and prosecute the defendant for making the false statement at issue.these decisions are necessarily influenced by the false statement,but the materiality element would be rendered meaningless if it were sufficient for the government merely to establish the capability of the false statement to influence an agency staffer,investigator,or prosecutor decision to refer for investigation,investigate,or prosecute the defendant for the very statement at issue.therefore,neither the fact that the treasury decided to refer litvak statements for investigation,nor that the government subsequently decided to conduct an investigation and prosecute litvak for those statements,has any bearing on the materiality of those statements as required by the statute in the instant context.
our decision in united states rigas,cir,supports our conclusion in this case.in rigas,we evaluated the sufficiency of the evidence in the context of a criminal prosecution for bank fraud,which implicates the same materiality standard applicable here.see supra note.we explained that relevance and materiality are not synonymous.at.like the limitations placed on the treasury discretion here,see joint app x at q t he general partner,the institutional manager of the fund and the investment managers had all the authority miller.correct,in rigas,the banks discretion was also limited,at.in that case,we found certain misstatements material where there was evidence that the banks would have decided to charge a different interest rate had the statements been accurate.see id.at.however,we found other misstatements,like those here,immaterial even where the government adduced evidence that the banks had received the misstatements and that its staffs had reviewed them,but there was no evidence that the statements were capable of influencing one of the banks decisions.see id.at.we therefore held that although d efendants misrepresentations certainly concerned a variable that mattered to the banks,the government must offer sufficient evidence that the misstatements were capable of influencing a decision that the bank was able to make.id.at.
here,the government has established that litvak misstatements may have been relevant to the treasury,and even contrary to its interest in maximizing the ppifs returns.but the evidence also shows that the treasury discretion in the matters at issue was greatly constrained by its status as a limited partner in the ppifs.see supra note miller testimony that the treasury retained no authority to tell the investment managers which rmbs to purchase or the prices at which to transact quoting joint app x at.similarly to rigas,the exacting circumscription of the treasury role as a decisionmaker highlights the difficulty the government faced in adducing evidence sufficient to identify a decision capable of being influenced.
therefore,because the government adduced insufficient evidence for a rational jury to conclude that litvak misstatements were reasonably capable of influencing a decision of the treasury,we reverse the district court judgment of conviction as to the fraud against the united states and making false statements charges counts.
ii.securities fraud 
litvak raises three primary arguments in respect of the securities fraud counts.first,litvak contends that the district court erred in concluding that the evidence was sufficient to support a rational jury conclusion that the misrepresentations on which his securities fraud convictions were premised are material.second,litvak claims that,in respect of the scienter element of these counts,the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict,and the district court failed adequately to instruct the jury.third,litvak challenges the district court exclusion of nearly all of the expert testimony he proffered at trial we reject the first and second arguments,but agree with litvak that the district court exceeded its allowable discretion in excluding certain portions of his experts proffered testimony,and that the exclusion of at least one portion was not harmless.accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment of conviction as to the securities fraud counts counts,and remand for a new trial.
materiality or immateriality as a matter of law 
litvak argues that the misrepresentations he made to counterparties during negotiations for the sale of bonds are immaterial as a matter of law because they did not relate to the bonds value as opposed to their price.although the district court did not squarely address this argument,it held that the trial evidence sufficiently supported a finding of materiality see litvak,d at.we reject litvak argument because,on the trial record before us,a rational jury could have concluded that litvak misrepresentations were material.
standard of review 
as explained above,see part,a defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence bears a heavy burden,as the standard of review is exceedingly deferential.brock,at internal quotation marks omitted.
governing law 
determination of materiality under the securities laws is a mixed question of law and fact that the supreme court has identified as especially well suited for jury determination.united states bilzerian,cir.citing tsc,northway,d,cert.denied.a misrepresentation is material under section b of the securities exchange act and rule where there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would find the misrepresentation important in making an investment decision.united states vilar,cir,cert.denied,d.where the misstatements are so obviously unimportant to a reasonable investor that reasonable minds could not differ on the question of their importance,we may find the misstatements immaterial as a matter of law.wilson merrill lynch,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
materiality was properly reserved for the jury determination 
we conclude that,on the trial record before us,a rational jury could have found that litvak misrepresentations were material.the trial record includes testimony from several representatives of litvak counterparties that his misrepresentations were important to them in the course of the transactions on which the securities fraud charges were predicated,see,supra notes,and that they or their employers were injured by those misrepresentations,see,supra notes.this testimony precludes a finding that no reasonable mind could find litvak statements material.see wilson,at.
in trying to persuade us otherwise,litvak relies principally upon feinman dean witter reynolds,cir,in which purchasers of securities brought suit against stock brokers with whom they dealt.the purchasers alleged that the brokers charged transaction fees that far exceeded the cost to the firms of the items or services for which the purchasers were ostensibly charged,as described on the trade confirmations,handling,postage and insurance if any,handling,service,or processing.at.the purchasers asserted that these fees were hidden,fixed commissions disguised to circumvent rules prohibiting fixed rates and to prevent customers from negotiating fees.id.
in affirming the district court grant of summary judgment for defendants,we held that no reasonable investor would have considered it important,in deciding whether or not to buy or sell stock,that a transaction fee of a few dollars might exceed the broker actual handling charges.id.at see also id.r easonable minds could not find that an individual would be affected by knowledge that the broker was pocketing a dollar or two of the fee charged for the transaction.we noted that e ach of the defendants confirmation slips itemized the amount of the fee the appellants were never charged more than the amounts reported on these slips.id.thus,i f brokerage firms are slightly inflating the cost of their transaction fees,the remedy is competition among the firms in the labeling and pricing of their services,not resort to the securities fraud provisions.id.
feinman is readily distinguishable from the case presented.first,the brokers in feinman did not mislead their customers as to what portion of the total transaction cost was going toward purchasing securities versus the cost of the broker involvement.there,the brokers were truthful in stating that a certain portion of the total transaction cost a specific amount for each broker,up to per trade was charged on behalf of the broker,and that the rest of the transaction total cost was used to purchase securities.see id.at.t he fees were correctly stated,and the market was not otherwise alleged to have been distorted as a result.litvak,d at citing feinman,at.unlike the stock transactions in feinman,the transaction costs for litvak bid list and order trades as markups or commissions were embedded in the price,and the evidence showed that price was a heavily negotiated term and that the markups litvak represented himself to be taking were false.id.therefore,unlike in feinman,litvak was untruthful about the portion of each transaction total cost that would be used to purchase securities and the portion that would be retained by jefferies,and in each transaction at issue he falsely understated the latter portion.
second,the amounts pocket ed by litvak on behalf of jefferies in the transactions at issue were substantially larger than a dollar or two per transaction,feinman,at the difference between the profit his counterparties were led to believe jefferies yielded and the amount that it actually yielded averaged more than per transaction in the twelve transactions at issue ranging from to.see joint app x at.
third,the remedy for the behavior described in feinman competition among the firms in the labeling and pricing of their services,at is not applicable to litvak behavior.those he dealt with were unaware that he was taking a larger cut on behalf of jefferies than he had represented to them.without knowledge of litvak actions,the financial consequences of negotiations colored by false representations were virtually undiscoverable in the opaque rmbs market.see litvak,d at as litvak stresses,and as is undisputed by the government,unlike the stock market,the rmbs market is not transparent.until litvak misrepresentations were brought to light by his colleague inadvertent email to a counterparty representative his counterparties were not aware of the unusually high cost of doing business with litvak and jefferies,and were not able to properly compare his services with jefferies competitors 
setting aside feinman,acceptance of litvak argument is also inconsistent with the longstanding principle enunciated by the supreme court that b should be construed not technically and restrictively,but flexibly to effectuate its remedial purposes,and to protect against fraudulent practices,which constantly vary.parkcentral global hub porsche auto.holdings se,cir per curiam internal citations and quotation marks omitted.finding section b inapplicable here,as a matter of law,would require an impermissibly technical and restrictive construction.there is no dispute that litvak misrepresented facts related to the securities transactions at issue,and that several of his counterparties representatives testified at trial that they considered the misrepresentations meaningful in the course of those transactions and that they or their employers were harmed by litvak misleading course of conduct.in addition,the public interest is implicated by the involvement of the treasury as a major investor in several of litvak counterparties in the transactions at issue.thus,enforcement of section b here is consistent with the supreme court instruction to apply the statute flexibly,see,and with the statute purpose of remedy ing deceptive and manipulative conduct with the potential to harm the public interest or the interests of investors,id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
for these reasons,we do not find litvak misrepresentations immaterial as a matter of law,and we therefore conclude that the district court appropriately left this issue,a mixed question of law and fact,see bilzerian,at,for the jury to determine 
litvak contends that the scienter element of section b requires proof of contemplated harm or intent to harm,that the district court erred in failing to so instruct the jury,and that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to permit a rational jury to find that litvak had such intent.in ruling on litvak motions,the district court reaffirmed its view that intent to harm is not an element of securities fraud see litvak,d at.we agree.
liability for securities fraud requires proof that the defendant acted with scienter,which is defined as a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate or defraud.united states newman,cir quoting ernst ernst hochfelder,d,cert.denied.litvak urges us to read intent to deceive,manipulate or defraud,hochfedler,at,in the same manner in which we have interpreted intent to defraud in the mail and wire fraud contexts,as requiring proof of contemplated harm,see,united states novak,cir explaining that,in the context of mail and wire fraud,o nly a showing of intended harm will satisfy the element of fraudulent intent internal quotation marks omitted.litvak view,however,is contrary to our precedent 
in united states vilar,cir,the defendant similarly argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for securities fraud because the government failed to prove that he intended to steal from the victim.at.we rejected that argument,holding that it misse d the mark because the government was under no obligation to prove that the defendant wanted to steal the victim money,only that he intended to defraud her in connection with his sale of the securities.id.at vilar holding is consistent with our earlier observation that the government burden with respect to criminal intent on securities exchange act counts is less than under mail fraud counts,united states dixon,cir,and forecloses litvak argument here 
in sum,because intent to harm is not a component of the scienter element of securities fraud under section b,the district court did not err in refusing to provide such an instruction to the jury and we need not inquire into whether the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that such intent was proven.
evidentiary rulings 
litvak argues that the district court erred in excluding certain portions of his experts proposed testimony.we largely agree.we principally conclude that the district court exceeded its allowable discretion in excluding ram willner testimony concerning the selection and valuation process undertaken by investment managers,and his expert opinion that a bond trader statements,such as litvak,would be widely considered within the industry as biased and often misleading,and that excluding such testimony was not harmless.on this basis alone,we vacate litvak convictions for securities fraud and remand for a new trial.
in order to assist the district court and the parties on remand,we also address litvak other claims of evidentiary error,and find some of his claims meritorious and others without merit.
standard of review 
we review a district court evidentiary rulings under a deferential abuse of discretion standard,and we will disturb an evidentiary ruling only where the decision to admit or exclude evidence was manifestly erroneous.mcginn,at internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,even if a ruling was manifestly erroneous,we will still affirm if the error was harmless.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
evidentiary standard 
evidence is relevant if a it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence and b the fact is of consequence in determining the action.to be relevant,evidence need not be sufficient by itself to prove a fact in issue,much less to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.united states abu jihaad,cir,cert denied,d see also united states certified envtl,cir t he definition of relevance under.is very broad.united states white,cir explaining that rule prescribes a very low standard internal quotation marks omitted.u nless an exception applies,all relevant evidence is admissible.white,at alteration omitted quoting.
exclusion of expert testimony 
litvak proffered two experts to testify at trial ram willner,a business school professor and former portfolio manager,and marc menchel,a regulatory and compliance attorney.the district court excluded all of willner proposed testimony and most of menchel proposed testimony.litvak argues that the district court erred in excluding certain portions of willner and menchel testimony.because we agree that the district court exceeded its allowable discretion and conclude that at least one error was not harmless,we vacate litvak convictions on the securities fraud charges and remand for a new trial.
ram willner 
the first expert witness litvak proffered was ram willner.according to litvak expert disclosure to the government,willner holds advanced degrees in business administration with a focus on finance,served as a professor at leading business schools,and gained extensive experience in portfolio management in the fixed income asset class,including extensive experience in the analysis and purchase of residential mortgage backed securities during his employment by,at various times,bank of america,morgan stanley,pimco,and a hedge fund.joint app x at.the government has not suggested willner lack of qualification as a ground to affirm,and its motion to exclude willner testimony before the district court included only a perfunctory request,in the a lternative,for a hearing pursuant to daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d.gov t mot.to preclude def.experts at,united states litvak,cr,ecf.on the government motion,the district court excluded the entirety of willner testimony on appeal,litvak contends that the district court exceeded its allowable discretion in excluding key portions of willner testimony.we largely agree.
exclusion of willner materiality testimony exceeded the district court allowable discretion 
litvak contends that the district court erred in barring willner from testifying about the process investment managers use to evaluate a security,and the irrelevance of the acquisition price to that process,which was directly probative of whether litvak misstatements would have been material to a reasonable investor.litvak br.at.
before the district court,litvak proposed that willner opine,in pertinent part,as follows 
t hat where a manager follows rigorous valuation procedures,as was the case here,consideration of,or reliance on,statements by salesmen or traders concerning the value of a rmbs or the price at which the acquired it or could acquire it,are not relevant to that fund determination with respect to how much to pay for a bond.in willner opinion,such statements from sales representatives or traders are generally biased,often misleading,and unworthy of consideration in trading decisions.accordingly,such statements from sales representatives or traders are not material to a professional investment manager.
joint app x at emphasis added.litvak also offered willner to testify in respect of the process of selecting and valuing rmbs for inclusion in an investment portfolio,including analytical tools and methods available to an investment manager,and the development of an investment thesis for a particular rmbs.id.at.the district court excluded the entirety of willner proffered testimony.
the government defends the district court ruling on the ground that t he materiality of litvak lies was for the jury to decide.gov t br.at citing bilzerian,at t estimony encompassing an ultimate legal conclusion based upon the facts of the case is not admissible,and may not be made so simply because it is presented in terms of industry practice.but that is true in respect of only the underlined portion of the excerpted proposed opinion testimony,and in any event,the district court did not exclude willner testimony on ultimate issue grounds.rather,the district court appears to have excluded all of willner proffered testimony on relevance grounds relying on rule,rule,or possibly both,without ruling specifically on this part of willner proposed testimony.see tr.at judge straub as i understand it,willner testimony was excluded on the basis of relevance francis correct.
we conclude that the district court exceeded its allowable discretion in excluding willner testimony in respect of the process by which investment managers value rmbs and the likely impact on the final purchase price of a broker statements made to a counterparty during the course of negotiating a rmbs transaction.these portions of willner testimony would have been highly probative of materiality,the central issue in the case.this is particularly true because of the meaningful distinction between the complex securities at issue in this case and the common equities and bonds traded in traditional,efficient markets,shares of corporate entities traded on the new york stock exchange.the pricing of rmbs is more complicated because it tend s to be more subjective,is available mainly or only from dealers,and is often based on models as opposed to prices from prior transactions.thomas lemke,gerald lins marie picard,mortgage backed securities westlaw see also id.explaining that complicated nature of rmbs makes placing value on them more subjective.
consistent with this understanding,willner proffered testimony could have educated the jury which was likely only familiar,if at all,with securities traded on public exchanges about the field of rmbs trading.because rmbs lack an efficient,transparent secondary market through which value can be determined objectively,traders set the value of the security,and hence the price each is willing to accept as a seller or buyer,by engaging in rigorous valuation procedures involving the use of certain analytical tools and methods.joint app x at.thus,firms trading rmbs rely upon sophisticated models,often developed by professionals with backgrounds to determine the subjective value of the securities certain testimony at trial supported a conclusion that this process,and a determination of the amount an investment manager is willing to pay for a security,nearly always takes place prior to the manager approaching a dealer such as jefferies,here represented by litvak,to negotiate the price of that security.
with such testimony before it,a jury could reasonably have found that misrepresentations by a dealer as to the price paid for certain rmbs would be immaterial to a counterparty that relies not on a market price or the price at which prior trades took place,but instead on its own sophisticated valuation methods and computer model.the full context and circumstances in which rmbs are traded were undoubtedly relevant to the jury determination of materiality.
aside from willner testimony in respect of the nature of the rmbs market,there are few ways in which litvak could put forth evidence to rebut the alleged victims testimony that litvak misstatements were important to them,or otherwise counter the government argument that a reasonable investor would have found litvak statements material.the district court relevance concerns were unfounded,united states avasso,app x,cir summary order affirming admission of expert testimony that certain information is a material fact in a purchaser decision which must be disclosed under nasd rules,and there was minimal risk of confusion because willner testimony in respect of an ultimate question before the jury could have been properly limited by the district court.
if we were to conclude otherwise,litvak would be put in an untenable position whereby he could not introduce testimony that either the specific statements at issue in the case would not be important to a reasonable investor due to ultimate issue concerns or the types of statements at issue are generally not important to a reasonable investor.litvak would be left only with the victims of his conduct as sources of potential testimony on this issue,an odd limitation where the jury is to evaluate materiality in an objective manner.see amgen.ret.plans trust funds,d m ateriality is judged according to an objective standard.
we conclude that this error was not harmless.see united states vayner,cir an erroneous evidentiary decision that has no constitutional dimension is reviewed for harmless error.u nder harmless error review,we ask whether we can conclude with fair assurance that the errors did not substantially influence the jury.united states gupta,cir internal quotation marks omitted.specifically,if defense evidence has been improperly excluded by the trial court,we normally consider the following factors 
the importance of unrebutted assertions to the government case whether the excluded material was cumulative the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the government case on the factual questions at issue the extent to which the defendant was otherwise permitted to advance the defense and the overall strength of the prosecution case.
id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court exclusion of this portion of willner testimony was not harmless,and the government does not suggest otherwise.materiality was an issue central to litvak case and was hotly contested at trial.the government called to testify several purported victims portfolio managers and traders,each of whom testified that litvak misstatements were important to them in the course of the trades charged in the indictment.litvak primary defense was that,despite the victims testimony,litvak statements were not material to a reasonable investor.see tsc,at the question of materiality is an objective one,involving the significance of an omitted or misrepresented fact to a reasonable investor.emphasis added.
without willner testimony on this point,litvak was left with little opportunity to present his defense though the government adduced substantial evidence of materiality,we can not conclude with fair assurance that the jury would not have found differently if it were presented with information about the functioning of the specialized rmbs market and the valuation process employed by those who participate therein.see united states blum,cir explaining that,where defense went to the core of the prosecution case,we can not view the exclusion of the testimony as harmless.therefore,we vacate the district court judgment of conviction as to the securities fraud charges and remand for a new trial.
though our conclusion that vacatur is warranted on this ground alone relieves us of an obligation to address litvak additional claims of error in respect of the district court evidentiary rulings as to the securities fraud claims,we proceed to address them for purposes of judicial economy,as the same issues are likely to arise on remand.see,chavis chappius,cir addressing an additional matter in the interest of judicial economy,since it appears likely to arise upon remand.
in respect of materiality,litvak also claims that the district court erred in excluding another portion of willner proposed testimony that minor price variances would not have mattered to sophisticated investors,which also tended to show that litvak statements about his acquisition price would not have been material.litvak br.at.we have recognized that a misstatement may not be material where it resulted in a mere slight inflat ion of transaction costs,feinman,at,and district courts in this circuit have held repeatedly in the analogous civil context that the sophistication of the investor is relevant both to the adequacy of the defendant disclosure,and to the extent of the investor reliance on any alleged misrepresentations,quintel.citibank,internal citations omitted see also,steed fin.ldc nomura sec.int l,cv,wl,at,in re aes.sec,davidson pipe laventhol horwath,republic of iraq abb ag,cir droney,concurring in part and dissenting in part noting that,in certain circumstances,sophisticated buyer s may not necessarily need the protection of the securities act internal quotation marks omitted.because this testimony would have been relevant to the element of materiality,we conclude that the district court exceeded its allowable discretion in excluding this portion as well.since a error has already been identified,and therefore vacatur found necessary,we need not determine whether this error was harmless.
ii.exclusion of willner fair market value and profitability testimony did not exceed the district court allowable discretion 
litvak also claims that the district court exceeded its allowable discretion in excluding testimony concerning the fair market value and profitability of the trades at issue.we disagree.
first,litvak contends that the district court erred in excluding willner testimony that the trades at issue were executed at a fair market value,which litvak views as highly probative of the absence of materiality and fraudulent intent,because it would have demonstrated that a reasonable investor would have transacted at those prices regardless of litvak explanation of how the price was derived.litvak br.at.before the district court,litvak proposed that willner be permitted to testify that prices paid for rmbs in the trades at issue were in the context of the market and within the range of fair value and that they did not take place at inflated prices.joint app x at.
the district court did not exceed its allowable discretion in excluding this portion of willner testimony.whether the prices were fair was not an element of any of the crimes with which litvak was charged and the potential confusion from such testimony might have outweighed any probative value.the principal issues at trial were whether a reasonable investor might have found the misstatements important and whether litvak intended to deceive the purported victims.this testimony would not have addressed either the district court did not exceed its allowable discretion in concluding that whether the price the alleged victims paid was within a range of fairness was not relevant to determining if the misstatements themselves were important to a reasonable investor or whether litvak intentionally deceived the counterparties representatives.
second,litvak claims that the district court erred in excluding willner testimony that the bonds were profitable,which bore on the issue of litvak intent,even if it was not determinative.litvak br.at.the district court did not exceed its allowable discretion in finding this portion of willner testimony of minimal relevance,and that any probative value would likely have been outweighed by its potential for confusion.whether a victim later made a profit or loss on the bonds it purchased from litvak has no bearing on whether litvak misrepresentations were material or whether litvak intended to deceive the purported victims.thus,the district court did not exceed its allowable discretion in excluding this portion of willner testimony.
marc menchel 
the second expert witness litvak proffered was marc menchel.as established at trial,menchel is an attorney who served in various legal and compliance positions for and regulators,most significantly as general counsel of the financial industry regulatory authority finra the government has not suggested menchel lack of qualification as a ground to affirm,and its motion to exclude menchel testimony before the district court did not suggest exclusion on that ground.
litvak sought to elicit menchel testimony on several topics at trial.on the government motion,the district court excluded the entirety of menchel testimony except in respect of the definition of certain terminology used during trial.on appeal,litvak contends that the district court exceeded its allowable discretion in precluding menchel from testifying about the arm length nature of the relationship between a and counterparty which was relevant to prove that litvak was not acting as an agent for the counterparties.id.at citing joint app x at.we agree.
while the issue of whether litvak was acting as agent or principal is not an element of any offense charged,litvak posits that this proposed testimony bore on both materiality and fraudulent intent.id.in support of this argument,litvak highlights the testimony of one of the counterparties representatives,joel wollman,who,despite the government subsequent concession that what litvak was doing was acting as a principal,tr.at,testified for the government as follows 
direct examination 
q.in effect,did you understand what did you understand,litvak was acting as a principal or as an agent 
a.an agent.
joint app x at.
cross examination 
and jefferies own s the bond as principal and they hold it in their own account,right 
i do not believe that they are acting as principal in their relationship to me.i feel that in the transaction they are acting as agent to me even though they have to principally acquire the bond.
in light of this and other testimony elicited at trial,litvak is correct that menchel testimony regarding the distinction would have been relevant to materiality.in determining whether a reasonable investor would have found litvak misstatements important in the course of a transaction,a jury might construe such statements as having great import to a reasonable investor if coming from the investor agent.knudsen torrington,cir t he agency relationship is normally grounded on the trust and confidence the principal places in his agent.if,on the other hand,litvak was acting on his own behalf,as a principal,and not as the purported victims agent,a jury may well construe that relationship as providing a distance between litvak and a reasonable investor,which may tend to show that his statements could not have been reasonably viewed as important in the course of a transaction in re mid island,cir.w hen parties deal at arms length in a commercial transaction,no relation of confidence or trust sufficient to find the existence of a fiduciary relationship will arise absent extraordinary circumstances.internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.
menchel was similarly prepared to testify in respect of the significance of the distinction in the rmbs context.litvak offered menchel to testify that t he term commission applies when a is acting in the capacity of agent and are virtually unheard of in the market which includes rmbs.joint app x at.menchel also would have testified,for example,that all trades with a acting as principal are because when an agreement is reached,the deal is always memorialized as one price to the customer for a quantity of a bond.there are no other separate fees or charges for the transaction.id.thus,menchel was prepared to testify that,contrary to the government characterization in summation that jefferies profits on the trades at issue were commission s,id.at,jefferies role was that of a principal not an agent or broker earning a profit as would any other buyer or seller.
without the aid of menchel testimony,the jury might easily have misconstrued the nature of the transactions at issue,believing mistakenly,according to menchel that jefferies profits were commission paid for litvak facilitation of the transactions,rather than ordinary profits earned in a standard context.the nature of litvak relationship with the alleged victims formed the context in which the jury had to consider whether the portfolio managers and traders who testified reflected the views of a reasonable investor this portion of menchel proposed testimony would have supported litvak materiality defense and could have rebutted wollman testimony 
therefore,the district court exceeded its allowable discretion in excluding this portion of menchel testimony.because we have already determined that the securities fraud convictions must be vacated on the basis of a different evidentiary error,see supra part,we address this claim of error solely to assist the district court on remand,see,chavis,at,and we need not determine whether this error was harmless 
exclusion of good faith evidence 
litvak challenges the district court exclusion of testimony and documents about the widespread use of similar negotiation tactics at jefferies which would have shown that others at jefferies engaged in the same conduct and that it was approved by supervisors and by jefferies compliance department.litvak br.at.the good faith evidence litvak proffered at trial may be separated into two categories evidence of litvak supervisors knowledge or approval of litvak price misrepresentation s and inventory misrepresentation s and evidence of jefferies managers,including litvak supervisors,knowledge or approval of other employees similar conduct.joint app x at.the district court permitted the first category of evidence,allowing litvak to adduce evidence that his supervisors approved or encouraged him to misrepresent price,cost,or a seller identity because such evidence tend s to prove the absence of intent and could provide a basis for the jury to make a reasonable inference that they should find no intent to defraud given the nature of what happened at jefferies.id.at.
the second category of evidence was the subject of a lengthy colloquy between litvak counsel and the district court.after the district court called the relevance of this evidence into question,litvak counsel responded as follows 
this is an ongoing alleged scheme with the same supervisors in place for the entire time with repeated examples of the two types of alleged misrepresentations we have been talking about here.so,your honor,i think that evidence that supervisors approve this conduct and participate in the conduct on a repeated basis is a fair basis upon which to infer that when litvak did the very same thing,that the supervisors saw and approved of as standard operating procedure,that litvak lacked the intent to defraud.that a fair inference from that evidence.it is a circumstantial basis to infer that litvak had a belief,as we have contended,that he was not committing fraud 
id.at see also id.litvak counsel explaining that the supervisors understood what litvak had done not to be fraudulent because it was approved and because they were sales tactics that were widely employed that the environment in which litvak is operating.it all goes back to state of mind.the district court rejected this argument and prohibited litvak from adducing evidence of other people at jefferies engaging in the same type of conduct or any supervisor approving others engaging in the conduct because such evidence is irrelevant when it does not involve litvak.id.at emphasis added see also id.at district court explaining that i do think it matters what the culture at jefferies is.
unfortunately,the precise basis for the district court oral ruling excluding the second category lack of relevance under federal rule of evidence,probative value substantially outweighed by other considerations under federal rule of evidence,or both is not clear from the record in our view,the soundest reading of the district court ruling is that it rested solely on relevance grounds.therefore,our inquiry is whether the district court exceeded its allowable discretion in concluding that the excluded evidence would not have any tendency to make a fact of consequence in determining the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.
on appeal,litvak argues that the excluded evidence would have been relevant to demonstrate his lack of fraudulent intent and good faith,because it would have tended to show that he was unaware that his actions were unlawful.litvak br.at.in relevant part,the district court instructed the jury that the government must prove as to each securities fraud count that litvak participated in the scheme to defraud knowingly,willfully,and with intent to defraud.joint app x at emphasis added.the district court instructed the jury in respect of the intent to defraud prong as follows 
i f you find that litvak acted in good faith,or held an honest belief that his actions as charged in a given count were proper and not in furtherance of any unlawful activity,you can not convict him of that count.litvak,however,has no burden to prove a defense of good faith.the burden is on the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt litvak fraudulent intent.under the statutes,false representations or statements or omissions of material facts do not amount to a fraud unless done with fraudulent intent.however misleading or deceptive a plan may be,it is not fraudulent if it was devised or carried out in good faith.
id.at see also id.at district court instructing the jury that,in order to establish the willfully prong of the second element,t he government must prove that litvak was aware of the generally unlawful nature of his acts.
litvak sought to introduce evidence that,during the relevant time period,supervisors at jefferies including his supervisors regularly approved of conduct identical to that with which litvak was charged.the district court characterized the proffered evidence as improperly suggest ing that everybody did it and therefore it is illegal.id.at.but litvak counsel did not proffer the evidence for that purpose and such an argument in summation could have been properly proscribed by the district court.as litvak counsel stated at trial,this evidence would provide a fair basis upon which to infer that when litvak did the very same thing,the supervisors saw and approved of it as standard operating procedure.id.at.such an inference would support litvak attempt to introduce a reasonable doubt as to his intent to defraud,that he held an honest belief that his conduct was not improper or unlawful,a belief the jury may have found more plausible in light of his supervisors approval of his colleagues substantially similar behavior.while the district court was correct that this evidence is less probative of litvak intent as the evidence regarding transactions in which he was directly involved the first category,the district court exceeded its allowable discretion in concluding that this testimony was not relevant under the low threshold set forth by federal rule of evidence,see white,at,in determining whether litvak held an honest belief that his actions were proper and not in furtherance of any unlawful activity,joint app x at see united states brandt,cir since good faith may be only inferentially proven,no events or actions which bear even remotely on its probability should be withdrawn from the jury unless the tangential and confusing elements interjected by such evidence clearly outweigh its relevance internal citation omitted see also united states collorafi,cir same.
because we have already determined that vacatur is warranted due to the district court erroneous exclusion of certain portions of litvak proffered expert testimony,see supra part,we address this claim of error solely to assist the district court on remand,see,chavis,at,and we need not separately address whether this error was harmless.
conclusion 
we reverse the district court judgment of conviction as to the fraud against the united states and making false statements charges counts,vacate the district court judgment of conviction as to the securities fraud charges counts,and remand for a new trial on the securities fraud charges.
the three principal capacities in which firms act in the securities business are as broker,dealer,and investment adviser.the securities exchange act defines a broker as a person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others,while a dealer is a person engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for such person own account.an investment adviser is defined in section a of the investment advisers act of as a person who,for compensation,engages in the business of advising others as to the advisability of investing in,purchasing or selling securities,but who render such advice as part of their brokerage activities are exempt from the definition.thomas lee hazen,treatise on the law of securities regulation b westlaw footnotes omitted.

on appeal,the government conceded that the treasury has never made a decision in respect of the transactions at issue in litvak prosecution.see transcript of oral argument tr.at judge straub so you concede that the treasury never made a decision in respect of the individual purchases.francis yes.
on appeal,the government conceded that there is no indication in the record that the treasury made a decision after receiving data in respect of a ppif which was a victim of litvak misrepresentation s.tr.at.
even assuming,arguendo,that the government evidence established that the treasury regarded litvak conduct as significant,such a metric of materiality is inapposite in the fraud against the united states and making false statements contexts.while materiality in the securities fraud context may be found where the information is considered significant by reasonable investors,united states contorinis,cir emphasis added,in the government fraud and false statements contexts,we apply a different standard,see coplan,at explaining that for purposes of a,a statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence,or be capable of influencing,the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed.
this section part ii addresses,inter alia,litvak argument that his misrepresentations were immaterial as a matter of law and his claims of error in the district court evidentiary rulings at trial.though he challenges all of the counts on which he was convicted on these grounds,because we reverse litvak convictions for fraud against the united states and making false statements on other grounds,see supra part,we analyze these arguments in the context of only the securities fraud charges counts.
the government contention that litvak failed to raise this particular argument below is unfounded because litvak,in his rule c motion,did argue that the evidence at trial of materiality was insufficient as a matter of law.even if we accept the government narrow view of litvak argument below,litvak is not limited to the precise arguments he made before the district court,see yee city of escondido,d,and may submit additional support for a proposition presented below,eastman kodak stwb,cir.
on november,canter received an email from a colleague of litvak at jefferies which inadvertently attached a spreadsheet containing trade information to which canter would not typically be privy.though canter understood that the spreadsheet was not meant for his eyes,joint app x at,he reviewed the data it contained and learned that jefferies had reaped larger profits on a rmbs trade than litvak had represented.canter subsequently reported his concerns to the treasury.
litvak also relies upon barnett kirshner,cir,in which we held that the identity of the true purchaser of securities was immaterial as a matter of law where the sole reason for concealing the true purchaser identity was the seller dislike for him.at.here,litvak is not faulted with merely misrepresenting the identity of a purchaser.rather,litvak falsely stated that purchasers and sellers were involved in transactions where there were no third parties involved,see,supra note and accompanying text,and he misled jefferies counterparties,for whom he was serving as a middleman,as to their respective positions in order to reap larger profits for jefferies.
though we side with the government on this issue,we do not adopt its apparent reliance upon the supreme court statement that neither the sec nor this court has ever held that there must be a misrepresentation about the value of a particular security in order to run afoul of the securities exchange act.sec zandford,d see gov t br.at.zandford addressed the in connection with language of section b,see at,not the standard for materiality,and is properly read as deciding whether a misrepresentation has to be tied to the value of a particular security,id.at emphasis added,as opposed to the overall management of an investor securities account.it appears that neither this court nor our sister circuits have applied this language in the context of the materiality element,and we decline to do so here.
the district court noted,without deciding,that t he trial evidence may also be sufficient to support a finding of i
