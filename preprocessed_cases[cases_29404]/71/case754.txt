private lawsuits impliedly authorized under b of the securities exchange act,the supreme court held in lampf,pleva,lipkind,prupis petigrow gilbertson,d,are subject to the statutory limitations provision established in e of the act.private securities fraud actions must thus be brought within one year after discovery of the facts constituting the violation and within three years after such violation.see e.
the present action,a b securities fraud case brought by an investor against an accounting firm,is barred by the statute of limitations if the word discovery,as used in the statute,extends to constructive discovery as well as actual discovery.the plaintiff investor having been put on inquiry notice of the alleged fraud more than one year before the filing of the complaint,in other words,the question is whether such notice suffices to bar the action.
like a number of our sister circuits,we believe that inquiry notice is sufficient to trigger the running of the limitations period.the district court dismissed this case on grounds that involved the statutory period,among other things,but we shall affirm the dismissal under the provision without reaching the grounds found persuasive by the district court.
this case has its origins in financial difficulties experienced by clothing manufacturer fruit of the loom,fruit in the.according to the plaintiff,fruit stock collapse d in november of as a result of market changes and poor management.fruit took steps to improve performance in,but it became clear by the fourth quarter that fruit would not meet its financial goals for the year.therefore,the plaintiff has alleged,fruit management instituted a program of early shipments,which was designed to accelerate recognition of revenues into the fourth quarter of.fruit ended up reporting financial results for that were much higher than expected,and fruit stock rebounded.
fruit financial statements were audited by ernst young,llp ernst,the defendant herein.according to the plaintiff,the statements violated generally accepted accounting principles gaap by failing to write down overvalued inventory and fixed assets and failing to accrue certain liabilities,as well as by improperly recognizing revenue in.in a report dated february,however,ernst certified that fruit financial statements present fairly,in all material respects,the consolidated financial position of fruit and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.the report stated further that ernst had conducted its audit of fruit statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards gaas.
in march of,fruit filed its form included the financial statements and ernst february audit the securities and exchange commission sec.the next month,fruit distributed the financial statements and ernst certification to its shareholders as part of an annual report.also in april,fruit reported its results for the first quarter of that were down from the first quarter of and that fueled a decline in the value of fruit stock.fruit reported its results,which were again below levels,in july.the plaintiff contends that fruit first and second quarter financial statements,which were reviewed by ernst,departed from gaap.
on july,fruit filed a registration statement with the sec in connection with a public offering of securities.the registration statement included fruit financial statements for and the first two quarters of,incorporated ernst february audit report by reference,and included a letter in which ernst consented to the use of its report.on august,fruit filed an amendment to the july registration statement.the amendment,like the original registration statement,incorporated ernst audit report and included ernst consent to the use of that report.
for the third and fourth quarters of,fruit reported large losses.in january of,the value of fruit stock dropped to slightly more than half of what it had been in march of.
on july,new england health care employees pension fund new england,undertaking to act on behalf of itself and other purchasers of fruit stock,sued fruit and several of its directors and officers for securities fraud.new england alleged that the defendants intentionally overstated earnings on fruit financial statements for and the first two quarters of,and that the defendants made additional public statements about fruit performance and prospects that were intentionally false including representations that the financial statements adhered to gaap.ernst was not named as a defendant.
while that case was pending,fruit entered bankruptcy.then,on june,two years after the filing of the suit against england brought the present action against ernst.new england complaint,which substantially repeated the earlier allegations of fraud by fruit and its directors and officers,alleged that ernst participated in the fraud by certifying the financial statements as consistent with gaap,stating that it audited the statements in accordance with gaas,and consenting to the use of its audit report in fruit offering documents.according to new england,ernst statements and letters of consent were fraudulent because ernst was aware of evidence contradicting fruit reported results for and the first two quarters of.
ernst moved for dismissal under rule b,arguing that the action was and that new england had failed to allege particular facts supporting an inference of scienter,an inference that ernst either knew its statements to be false or was reckless in assessing their truth.the district court granted the motion.the court noted that ernst audit report of february,was made more than three years before the filing of suit,and it held that ernst consent letters of july and august,did not the repose period prescribed by e.the court further held that new england had not pleaded with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that ernst acted with the required state of mind in accordance with the private securities litigation reform act of,b.the district court rejected ernst argument that the action was barred by the statute of limitations,see e,holding that it was not necessarily true that new england knew or should have known of ernst alleged fraud before june.
the dismissal being without prejudice,new england filed an amended complaint against ernst in march of.ernst again moved to dismiss the complaint,and the district court again granted the motion.the court rejected new england argument that ernst consent letters constituted new misrepresentations made within the period of were materially different from the misrepresentations allegedly contained in the february audit report.the court also held that new england still had not pleaded sufficient facts showing scienter.the complaint was dismissed with prejudice,and this timely appeal followed.
we review the dismissal of new england complaint de novo.see,in re comshare.securities litigation,cir.in doing so,we may affirm the judgment of the district court on any ground supported by the record.see id.at.
securities fraud litigation under b of the securities exchange act of,b,and securities and exchange commission rule,must be commenced,as we have seen,within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation e see lampf,at,where the supreme court borrowed the limitations provisions of e of the act,e,for actions brought under b and rule.
reading the language of e,narrowly,new england argues that only actual discovery of fraud can start the limitations period.ernst counters that the period begins to run upon inquiry notice of,under one interpretation,the point at which the plaintiff should have discovered the fraud through reasonably diligent inquiry.
new england is correct,of course,that e refers only to discovery as the trigger of the limitations period.unlike some other federal statutes of,of the securities act of,which allows actions based on false offering documents to be brought within one year after the discovery of the false statement or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence,emphasis added e does not expressly provide for inqui
