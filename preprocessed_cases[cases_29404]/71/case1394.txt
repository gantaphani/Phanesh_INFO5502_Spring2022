coopers audit report for wiz 
the accounting firm of corbin wertz corbin audited wiz in the fiscal year.when corbin resigned as wiz auditor after a disagreement over some accounting practices,coopers agreed to perform wiz audit.in an engagement letter,described as a letter of arrangement,coopers agreed to audit the financial statements of wiz as of and for the fiscal year ending july,in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards,and to issue an audit report thereon.
coopers also agreed to inform wiz if any matters came to its attention representing significant deficiencies in the design or operations of wiz internal control structure.the engagement letter did not commit to any future audits,but acknowledged that additional unforeseen consultation or audit work could require negotiation or an additional fee.
coopers audit report was completed and was included in wiz form filed with the securities and exchange commission sec.the form related solely to the existing approximately million shares of wiz common stock then registered for trading on public securities markets.
discussions and conditions regarding a possible audit report for wiz 
approximately four months later,in march of,coopers partner hal hurwitz met for several hours with arthur and tendler,husband and wife and respectively wiz president and chief executive officer.they discussed the conditions under which coopers might continue its auditor relationship with wiz and might audit wiz financial statements for the fiscal year ending july,the audit.as indicated in a declaration by hurwitz,he advised the tendlers of the following three conditions to continue as auditor wiz had to replace its chief financial officer,billie jolson wiz had to pay coopers outstanding invoices consistent with sec auditor independence rules and wiz had to replace its existing securities attorney,jehu hand,with competent legal counsel because hurwitz had concerns about hand understanding of various securities laws and regulations.
on behalf of wiz,the tendlers agreed to coopers three conditions.regarding the attorney condition,hurwitz also declared that he learned later that month that wiz hired david krinsky of myers as wiz securities counsel.and hurwitz understood that hand would no longer be involved in wiz securities matters or financial reporting.wiz also satisfied the other two conditions by replacing jolson with a new acting chief financial officer,melanie mccaffery,and it paid down its debt to coopers.
hurwitz documented wiz initial compliance with the three conditions in a contemporaneous report to coopers internal file on wiz.in a statement to the sec,the tendlers also corroborated the existence of the three conditions,describing them as three basic points,and the tendlers admitted that wiz put in place the changes that coopers requested.in verified discovery responses,wiz again acknowledged that hurwitz had informed the tendlers of the three conditions,and that these conditions were required.wiz asserted in response to interrogatories that hand could remain as counsel because of his relationship with and knowledge of the company,but that wiz would also have to retain a large law firm.for several months,according to wiz,it used the legal services of both hand and myers.
meanwhile,wiz planned to register additional securities for trading on public markets.but in april of,the sec commenced an investigation of wiz before those plans could be implemented.upon discovering the sec investigation,coopers advised wiz that until the investigation was resolved,coopers did not consent to wiz using coopers audit report in connection with any further sec filings.wiz did not complete the securities offering planned for the spring of,and was sued for,among other things,its failure to complete the offering.ultimately,an sec investigation resulted in a consent judgment against the tendlers,prohibiting them from engaging in securities fraud in the future and from acting as directors or officers of any public company,and requiring disgorgement of some financial gains.
regarding the possibility of a audit by coopers,wiz and coopers never signed any explicit agreement that coopers perform a audit.as explained by arthur tendler,hurwitz repeatedly promised to send a engagement letter and coopers estimated the fee for the engagement at.but no engagement letter was ever prepared.and wiz points to nothing in the record suggesting that it at any time agreed to pay the amount coopers proposed.hurwitz testified,there were a lot of steps that would have had to be undertaken before an engagement letter could have been prepared.hurwitz emphasized that there could not have been an agreement to perform the audit without a signed engagement letter detailing all the terms of the engagement,just as there had been for the audit.
in august of,wiz employees counted wiz inventory.coopers observed the inventory count.coopers later was paid separately for this observation and for providing its paperwork to wiz successor auditor.
coopers discovery that wiz breached the attorney condition by using hand as counsel for securities matters 
as hurwitz declared in support of coopers subsequent motion for summary judgment,hurwitz learned in august of that wiz had resumed using hand for securities matters because hand was less expensive than krinsky at myers.as hurwitz testified during his deposition in response to questioning by wiz counsel,hurwitz learned that hand was again involved in securities matters during a telephone conversation with either hand or mccaffery wiz acting chief financial officer.coopers filed and served this deposition evidence with its summary judgment moving papers.wiz use again of hand instead of krinsky for securities law was also specifically cited in coopers separate statement of facts.
in opposition to coopers motion for summary judgment,wiz offered no declaration from hand or mccaffery or any other evidence contradicting hurwitz account of how he learned of hand reinvolvement as counsel for securities matters.in wiz responding separate statement,it addressed the issue of counsel for securities matters.but wiz primarily raised evidentiary objections to evidence of hurwitz discovery of the breach of the attorney condition,vague,irrelevant,hearsay,lacks foundation,and it did not dispute the essential facts asserted.coopers emphasized in its reply brief wiz lack of any evidence disputing hand return as securities counsel,but wiz still did not provide any counter evidence or request a continuance.
alleged damages and causation 
because of hand reinvolvement as counsel for securities matters,on august,coopers resigned as wiz independent public accountants.wiz then hired the accounting firm of grant thornton llp grant thornton to perform its audit.
the tendlers asserted in declarations various damages from coopers refusal to perform the audit.they declared that wiz was forced to pay coopers for work that had to be repeated,to pay for additional work by wiz consultant melanie mccaffery,who had been hired to liaison with coopers,and to pay attorneys for work related to coopers resignation.the tendlers did not specify the exact nature of this additional or repeated work.the tendlers also alleged in declarations with no details or documentary support that as a result of coopers resignation and wiz late audit,wiz market value declined from a negative stock market reaction,vendors stopped issuing credit,customers stopped purchasing,wiz could not obtain accounts receivable funding,an investment newsletter red chip review downgraded wiz,and wiz could not fund internet and intranet markets it was entering.
after coopers resignation,the successor auditor,grant thornton,obtained coopers work papers regarding wiz inventory count that coopers had observed in early august of.regarding other aspects of wiz audit,jeffrey hiltbrand,the grant thornton partner who oversaw the wiz audit,explained in his declaration the following when grant thornton accepted the engagement to conduct the audit,i anticipated that we would be able to complete all necessary work in order for wiz to file its annual report on form within the sec prescribed deadlines grant thornton was unable to complete its work on a timely basis as initially anticipated because of the delays and difficulties encountered during the audit these delays and difficulties were caused solely by wiz the delays and difficulties grant thornton encountered during the audit had nothing to do with wiz predecessor independent public accountants,coopers.italics added.
as hiltbrand had also indicated in a letter to arthur tendler on october,the anticipated delay in filing the requisite form with the sec was because of the delay in the audit,which was due to incorrect accounting applications and errors in wiz records and failure of the wiz staff to provide information on a timely basis.hiltbrand never identified coopers resignation as having caused any delay.after receiving the letter from hiltbrand,tendler specifically accepted and acknowledged in writing hiltbrand description of events causing the delay.
on december,grant thornton resigned as wiz independent public accountants.several days later,in a form filed with the sec,arthur tendler explained that grant thornton had given the following reasons for its resignation wiz lack of preparation for the audit wiz issuance of an inaccurate press release about financial matters wiz lack of understanding of the significance of certain financial matters wiz failure to meet deadlines for providing information to grant thornton and wiz failure to have the appropriate level of management or board oversight over accounting matters.none of these reasons were in any way related to coopers resignation.
on december,wiz hired the accounting firm of cacciamatta accountancy corporation cacciamatta as its new independent public accountants.cacciamatta was wiz fourth auditor in less than three years.wiz presented no evidence from cacciamatta to suggest that wiz financial difficulties were in any way related to coopers resignation.
on january,approximately months after coopers resigned,wiz filed for bankruptcy protection.approximately six months later,wiz filed its complaint in the present case against coopers,alleging,inter alia,causes of action for breach of written,oral and implied contracts,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,negligence,and negligent misrepresentation 
the summary judgment ruling in favor of coopers,and wiz motion for reconsideration 
the trial court granted coopers motion for summary judgment,in large part on the grounds that it had good cause to resign as wiz auditor because it violated the condition to replace hand as wiz securities counsel.it also found that there was no written,oral or implied contract for coopers to perform the audit.and the court concluded there was no triable issue of fact regarding proximate cause and damages.
thereafter,wiz moved for reconsideration and filed supporting declarations from hand and wiz counsel.hand did not deny that he told hurwitz that wiz him for securities matters.rather,hand declared only that he never told hurwitz that myers was no longer going to be used by wiz as its securities counsel.moreover,the exhibits in support of hand declaration confirm that hand did in fact perform securities work approximately hours for wiz in july and august of,in violation of the attorney condition at issue.
wiz second declaration in support of its motion for reconsideration was from john wallace,one of wiz trial counsel and one of its counsel on appeal.wallace asserted that he was surprised at the summary judgment hearing to discover that the paramount issue was the narrow question of whether hurwitz had received information about hand and myers,rather than the accuracy of that information.wallace further declared that if he had realized the issue,he would have deposed mccaffery.wallace also annexed to his declaration a page of mccaffery testimony before the sec and asserted that it supported the inference that she did not make the statement which hurwitz claims was made by her.original emphasis.
however,in the page of mccaffery testimony in the sec securities fraud case against the tendlers,she did not contradict hurwitz testimony that either she or hand told hurwitz that wiz had begun using hand again for securities matters.rather,mccaffery testimony was simply that she did not recall speaking with hurwitz about what coopers was doing in general terms.mccaffery did not deny speaking to hurwitz about hand in fact,she was not questioned about the subject.
the trial court denied wiz motion for reconsideration.it found that wiz had failed to give a satisfactory reason for failing to present this evidence earlier,and that even if it considered the evidence,it did not raise a triable issue of fact such as to undermine the basis for the summary judgment.
discussion 
i.the trial court properly granted summary.the standard of review.
summary judgment is granted when a moving party establishes the right to the entry of judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.in reviewing an order granting summary judgment,we must assume the role of the trial court and redetermine the merits of the motion.in doing so,we strictly scrutinize the moving party papers.chevron,superior court th,d.the declarations of the party opposing summary judgment,however,are liberally construed to determine the existence of triable issues of fact.sosinsky grant th,d.all doubts as to whether any material,triable issues of fact exist are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.ibid.
a defendant moving for summary judgment meets its burden of proof of showing that a cause of action has no merit by establishing that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to the action.code civ,subd.o.this may be done,inter alia,by the defendant showing that the plaintiff does not possess,and can not reasonably obtain,needed evidence.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.once the defendant has done so,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show,not merely by allegations or denials,but by competent evidence,that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or defense in question.code civ,subd.o.
the party opposing the summary judgment must make an independent showing by a proper declaration or by reference to a deposition or another discovery product that there is sufficient proof of the matters alleged to raise a triable question of fact if the moving party evidence,standing alone,is sufficient to entitle the party to judgment.sebastian international,peck d.hoffman sports car club of america d.to avoid summary judgment,admissible evidence presented to the trial court,not merely claims or theories,must reveal a triable,material factual issue.torres reardon th,d.moreover,the opposition to summary judgment will be deemed insufficient when it is essentially conclusionary,argumentative or based on conjecture and speculation.joseph di loreto,th,d baron mare d.
exercising our independent judgment to determine as a matter of law the construction and effect of the facts presented spitler children institute international th,d saldana systems d,and acknowledging the obligation to affirm on any ground supported by the record becerra county of santa cruz th,d,we find summary judgment was properly granted.
coopers resignation was justified by wiz failure to satisfy the condition that it forgo using hand as counsel for securities matters,which was a prerequisite to any audit by coopers.
wiz urges that the engagement agreement for the audit,coupled with the tendlers understanding that hurwitz verbal agreement to perform a audit and a projected cost estimate,reveals an agreement to perform a audit.however,even assuming arguendo there was a triable issue of fact as to the existence of a written,oral or implied contract with coopers for a audit of wiz,coopers resignation as wiz auditor was warranted and thus not a breach of any agreement to conduct a audit.consistent with the intent of the parties,see city of stockton stockton plaza d,any contract as urged by wiz necessarily was conditioned upon the three requirements communicated to wiz in march of.
the requirement at issue here was that wiz forgo using attorney hand for securities matters.specifically,hurwitz insisted that wiz replace hand with competent legal counsel because hurwitz was concerned about hand understanding of securities laws and regulations.this condition was so important that hurwitz explained to the tendlers that coopers would not be associated with any sec filings of wiz with which hand was associated.in verified discovery responses,wiz acknowledged that hurwitz had informed the tendlers of the three conditions,and that these conditions were required.indeed,wiz briefly did retain the legal services of myers for securities law matters,but reverted to using hand for securities matters because he was less expensive.
the attorney condition was a critical requirement.wiz itself recognized the importance of the condition,admitting in its interrogatory responses that coopers told wiz in march of that coopers required that wiz obtain replacement counsel for securities matters.the tendlers also told the sec that coopers made a specific request of wiz to obtain replacement counsel.wiz use of krinsky,counsel at a major law firm,further establishes that wiz at the time considered the condition material.
moreover,coopers presented undisputed evidence that professional standards required an auditor to evaluate the reliability of the audited client specialists,such as a securities lawyer,whose work involves i nterpretation of technical requirements,regulations,or agreements.under certain circumstances,if an auditor is not satisfied that such a specialist is reliable,the auditor is precluded by the professional standards of accountancy from rendering an unqualified opinion as to the client financial statements.the attorney condition in the present case,requiring the removal of hand as counsel in securities matters,was therefore important to ensure the quality and preserve the integrity of wiz financial reporting process,serving the public trust even above the client stated objectives.national medical transportation network deloitte touche th,fn,d,citing the american institute of certified public accountants,professional standards.
it is well settled that the breach of an important condition may excuse the other party from performance.a party complaining of the breach of a contract is not entitled to recover therefor unless he has fulfilled his obligations.pry of america leach d.to the extent admissible evidence at the summary judgment stage established that coopers learned that wiz breached the attorney condition,coopers was therefore relieved of any obligation to perform the audit.
the parties thus focus in this appeal on whether wiz breach of the attorney condition was supported by admissible,nonhearsay evidence.we review de novo the trial court overruling of wiz hearsay objection see williams saga enterprises,d,fn.and find it properly admitted hurwitz evidence regarding wiz breach of the attorney condition.
contrary to wiz contention,hurwitz uncontradicted evidence that he learned of wiz breach of the attorney condition from either hand or mccaffery did not constitute inadmissible hearsay.as coopers aptly urges,it offered the evidence of what hurwitz learned from hand or mccaff er y for a good faith of coopers decision to resign.the point of hurwitz testimony was not the truth of the matter asserted,subd.a.in other words,the purpose of the testimony was not to establish whether the breach of the attorney condition was revealed to hurwitz by hand or mccaffery.
rather,hurwitz nonhearsay testimony was used to establish that coopers resignation was in good faith and thus reasonable and under the circumstances for good cause.indeed,wiz assertion that the reason for coopers resignation was the sec investigation of wiz,not breach of the attorney condition,is indicative of the importance of the good faith and reasonableness of coopers resignation.
it is reasonable and permissible for an auditor to resign for good cause.national medical transportation network deloitte touche,supra,th at,d discussing instructional error regarding resignation with good cause because it was consistent with accountancy professional standards.where the reasonableness of a person conduct is at issue,statements of others on which he acted are admissible.silva lucky stores,th,d see also witkin,cal.evidence ed.hearsay.
coopers thus established through hurwitz that its resignation could not have been in breach of any contract because it was reasonable and with good cause,that hurwitz in good faith believed that wiz had breached the agreement.and a resignation with good cause and based on a good faith belief in certain facts was also relevant to negate wiz allegations in its negligence causes of action.wiz complaint alleged that coopers purportedly lulled wiz into believing it would perform the audit and purportedly made certain unspecified false,misleading and deceptive representations.hurwitz good faith belief that wiz had breached the agreement would establish purposeful conduct based on good cause and thus negate such negligence claims.
accordingly,since the evidence complained of was not hearsay and was properly relied upon by the court,it is unnecessary to address coopers alternative argument that what hurwitz heard constituted a hearsay exception because it was an admission,by wiz through an agent,through hand as wiz attorney,or mccaffery as wiz chief financial officer.because wiz hearsay contention is without merit and it offered no countervailing evidence to refute the good cause for coopers resignation,the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of coopers.
coopers refusal to allow the use of its audit report for a new securities filing was not actionable.
coopers refused to consent to the use of its audit report in connection with wiz secondary stock offerings because the sec was investigating wiz.coopers presented evidence that professional standards supported its decision,and wiz offered no expert opinion or other evidence to the contrary.indeed,coopers position was in retrospect arguably well taken,as an sec investigation against the tendlers resulted in a stipulated judgment against them for securities law violations.
wiz complaint alleged that coopers denial of consent to use its audit report to support secondary stock offerings was wrongful and unjustified and it briefly addressed the matter in its opening brief on the issue of damages.however,wiz has failed to link coopers denial of consent to any particular cause of action.
to the extent coopers denial of consent to use its audit report for a secondary stock offering relates to a cause of action for breach of oral or implied contract or any professional negligence,such a claim is barred by the statute of limitations.regardless of what legal theory is urged,any claim would be governed by a statute of limitations.code civ,subd.see curtis kellogg andelson th,d barton new united motor manufacturing,th,d.
wiz knew that coopers had refused consent to use the audit report in the spring of.and wiz acknowledged in its second amended complaint that at le
