after respondents renewed a judgment in their favor,the trial court denied a motion by appellant cibc world markets cibc to vacate the renewed judgment.we affirm.
relevant factual and procedural background 
this is the second time that this case has come before us on appeal.in april,ocm principal opportunities fund,ocm,together with pacholder value opportunity fund,and pacholder heron limited partnership collectively,pacholder,initiated an action against cibc,asserting claims that cibc had engaged in fraud,misrepresentation,and violations of federal and state securities laws.tcw opportunities fund ii,tcw shared opportunities fund iib,tcw shared opportunity fund iii,tcw leveraged income trust,and tcw leveraged income trust ii,collectively,tcw initiated a similar action in may.these actions were later consolidated.
on october,following a jury trial,the trial court entered a judgment that awarded ocm,pacholder,and tcw,respectively,and in damages.cibc appealed from the judgment,and ocm and pacholder from the denial of their request for prejudgment interest under corporations code section.

discussion 
cibc contends that the trial court erred in denying its motion to vacate the renewed judgment,which argued that the renewal improperly accorded respondents compound postjudgment interest on the judgment.we disagree.
renewal of money judgments 
under the enforcement of judgments law,a money judgment is enforceable for a period following the date of entry.the judgment creditor may renew the judgment by filing an application for renewal with the clerk of the court prior to the end of the period.the renewal does not create a new judgment or modify the present judgment,but merely extends the enforceability of the effect,it resets the enforcement clock.jonathan neil associates,jones th,d.once a judgment has been renewed,a new application for renewal may not be submitted within five years of the previous renewal,subd.b.although entry of the renewed judgment is a ministerial act accomplished by the clerk of the court goldman simpson th,d,the judgment creditor may challenge the renewal by filing a motion to vacate or modify the renewed judgment,subd.b.
cibc contentions target the provisions in the enforcement of judgments law governing the accrual of interest on a renewed judgment.under section,i nterest accrues at the rate of percent per annum on the principal amount of a money judgment remaining unsatisfied,subd.a.in turn,the term p rincipal amount of the judgment is defined as the total amount of the judgment as entered or last renewed,together with costs added to the judgment,with adjustments for partial satisfaction of the sums in question.upon an application for renewal of the judgment,the clerk of the court is directed to enter the renewal show ing the amount of the judgment as renewed.when,as here,the judgment does not require installment payments,this amount is the amount required to satisfy the judgment on the date of the filing of the application for renewal.the amount ultimately required to satisfy a money judgment is characterized as the total amount of the judgment as entered or renewed with the addition of interest added to the judgment as it accrues pursuant to section.
cibc contentions 
cibc contends that the trial court improperly construed the renewal provisions to allow the compounding of postjudgment interest upon renewal of the judgment permitted respondents to renew the judgment without establishing a risk to its enforceability and contravened article xv,section of the california constitution,which limits the interest rate on judgments to percent per annum.for the reasons explained below,we reject these contentions.
cibc contentions present questions of first impression regarding the interpretation of the renewal statutes and the california constitution.generally,i n construing constitutional and statutory provisions,the intent of the enacting body is the paramount consideration.in re lance cal d.to determine this intent,we look first to the plain language of the law,read in context.people ex rel.lungren superior court cal th,d.both the legislative history of a statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may also be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent,fair employment housing com.cal d.because the legislature enacted the enforcement of judgments law in upon the law revision commission recommendation witkin,cal.procedure ed.enforcement of judgment,we may also consult the commission comments on the relevant statutory provisions conservatorship of wendland cal th,d.whenever possible,statutes are to be interpreted as consistent with applicable constitutional provisions so as to harmonize both.mendez kurten d.
compounding of postjudgment interest upon renewal 
cibc contends that the renewal provisions do not require that postjudgment interest be incorporated into the total amount of the renewed judgment so as to permit the accrual of interest upon interest.this contention fails in light of the plain language of the pertinent provisions,as well as the extrinsic evidence of legislative intent.under the provisions,interest accrues on the principal amount of a money judgment remaining unsatisfied,which is the total amount of the judgment as last renewed,subd.a,italics added.as the court observed in westbrook fairchild th,d westbrook,the renewal provisions effectuate a compounding of postjudgment interest when a judgment is renewed accrued postjudgment interest on the judgment is incorporated into the principal of the renewed judgment,which then bears interest at the legal rate.the law revision commission expressly noted this feature of the renewal procedure renewal has the effect of compounding the interest on the judgment,since interest accrues on the total amount of the judgment as renewed citations and the judgment as renewed includes accrued interest on the date of filing the application for renewal citations.cal.law revision com.com,west civ.proc.ed.foll.
no requirement for risk to enforceability 
cibc contends that the trial court erred in permitting the renewal when there was no danger that the judgment would not be paid.cibc argues that the judgment was properly bonded pending the outcome of the appeal,and was enforceable until.as explained below,this contention also fails in light of the language of the renewal provisions,and the available extrinsic evidence of legislative intent.
prior to the enactment of the enforcement of judgments law,california law provided two methods by which a judgment creditor could extend the enforcement period of a money judgment.under former section,after entry of the judgment,the judgment creditor was entitled to a writ of execution regarding the judgment for a period.witkin,supra,enforcement of judgment.once the period ended,former section permitted the trial court to enforce the judgment upon a showing by the judgment creditor that there had been an excusable failure to seek satisfaction of the judgment.alonso inv.doff cal d,italics deleted witkin,supra,enforcement of judgment,at.this d iscretionary enforcement had no time limit.ibid.
in addition,the judgment creditor was entitled to commence an independent action on the judgment within the limitation period defined in section.alonso inv.doff,supra,cal d at,united states capital nickelberry d.if the judgment creditor began an action within this period,the creditor right to recover remain ed alive,even though the period subsequently expire d.alonso inv.doff,supra,cal d at.
in enacting the enforcement of judgments law,the legislature abrogated the first method of extending the period for the enforcement of a judgment,and replaced the method with the renewal procedure described above see pt,ante.the law revision commission explained renewal under this article permits enforcement of a judgment beyond the period prescribed by section.this procedure supersedes the procedure under former section pursuant to which a judgment could be enforced upon noticed motion after the expiration of years in the discretion of the court upon a showing of the reasons for failure to enforce the judgment during the first years.this article does not require the judgment creditor to demonstrate diligence in enforcing the judgment,but if renewal is not accomplished within years after entry of the judgment,the judgment becomes unenforceable.cal.law revision com.com,supra,foll,italics added.
the legislature otherwise retained the second method of extending the period for enforcing a judgment,and linked the method to the provision governing the vacation of a renewed judgment.subdivision a of section states in pertinent part the renewal of a judgment pursuant to this article may be vacated on any ground that would be a defense to an action on the judgment,including the ground that the amount of the renewed judgment as entered pursuant to this article is incorrect 
in our view,respondents were not obliged,upon renewing the judgment,to establish that its enforceability was at risk.nothing in the renewal provisions suggests such a requirement on the contrary,section provides that an application for the renewal of a money judgment may be filed at any time before the expiration of the period of enforceability,subd.a.as the law revision commission noted,the renewal provisions eliminated the judgment creditor obligation under the abrogated procedure to explain the need for an extended enforcement period.moreover,with exceptions not relevant here,challenges to a renewed judgment are limited to ground s that would be a defense to an action on the judgment.as an action on a judgment may be brought at any time within the provided in section united states capital nickelberry,supra,d at,we conclude that judgments may be renewed at any time within the provided in section 
no violation of constitutional limits on interest 
cibc contends that the renewal procedure,as applied to the judgment,contravened article xv,section,subdivision of the california constitution,which limits interest on judgments to percent per annum because the renewal provisions incorporate accrued interest within the principal amount of the renewed judgment and authorize interest at the rate of percent per annum on the principal amount of the renewed judgment,cibc argues that the provisions accorded respondents interest that exceeds the constitutional limit.we disagree.
no court has addressed the precise issue cibc has presented.because the legislature intent in enacting the enforcement of judgments law was to allow the compounding of interest upon a judgment renewal see pts,ante,the focus of our inquiry is on whether the constitution permits a reasonable construction consistent with the renewal provision.as our supreme court has explained unlike the federal constitution,which is a grant of power to congress,the california constitution is a limitation or restriction on the powers of the legislature.citations.two important consequences flow from this fact.first,the entire authority of the state,except the people right of initiative and referendum,is vested in the legislature,and that body may exercise any and all legislative powers which are not expressly or by necessary implication denied to it by the constitution.citation.in other words,we do not look to the constitution to determine whether the legislature is authorized to do an act,but only to see if it is prohibited.citations.secondly,all intendments favor the exercise of the legislature plenary authority if there is any doubt as to the legislature power to act in any given case,the doubt should be resolved in favor of the legislature action.such restrictions and limitations imposed by the constitution are to be construed strictly,and are not to be extended to include matters not covered by the language used.citations.methodist hosp.of sacramento saylor cal d.
in view of these principles,where a constitutional provision may well have either of two meanings,it is a fundamental rule of constitutional construction that,if the legislature has by statute adopted one,its action in this respect is,if not completely,controlling.when the legislature has once construed the constitution,for the courts then to place a different construction upon it means that they must declare void the action of the legislature.it is no small matter for one branch of the government to annul the formal exercise by another and coordinate branch of power committed to the latter,and the courts should not and must not annul,as contrary to the constitution,a statute passed by the legislature,unless it can be said of the statute that it positively and certainly is opposed to the constitution.methodist hosp.of sacramento saylor,supra,cal d at,quoting san francisco industrial acc.com.cal.
in enacting the enforcement of judgments law,the legislature implemented provisions to avoid excessive compounding of interest.section,subdivision b,provides that a judgment shall not be renewed under this article if the application for renewal is filed within five years from the time the judgment was previously renewed under this article.the law revision commission stated by preventing the renewal of a judgment more often than once every five years,subdivision b of section prevents the judgment creditor from renewing a judgment more frequently merely to compound the interest on the judgment.cal.law revision com,west civ.proc.ed.foll.
the question before us,therefore,is whether article xv,section,of the california constitution positively and certainly prohibits the compounding of postjudgment interest on renewed judgments at intervals of five or more years methodist hosp.of sacramento saylor,supra,cal d at.california law has long regulated interest on loans and judgments,first by statute,then by initiative measure,and finally by constitutional amendment.see penziner west american finance cal d,penziner.in,an initiative measure expressly repealed the early statutes and set forth an uncodified statute the usury law.stats,lxxxiii,deering uncod.initiative measures ed.penziner,supra,cal d at.sections and of the usury law set the interest rate on loans,forbearances,and judgments at seven percent per annum,but permitted parties to a written contract to agree to a rate not exceeding per cent per annum in addition,section barred parties to a contract from indirectly exceeding the rate of per cent per annum through an exchange of money,goods or things in action,or in any manner whatsoever.section also provided i n the computation of interest upon any bond,note,or other instrument or agreement,interest shall not be compounded,nor shall the interest thereon be construed to bear interest unless an agreement to that effect is clearly expressed in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith.section accorded a party who paid interest exceeding the limits in sections and the right to recover treble the amount of the money so paid or value delivered in violation of said sections.
in november,the california constitution was amended to include former section of article xx,which expressly superseded the usury law insofar as it was inconsistent with the amendment.ghirardo antonioli cal th,fn,d,penziner,supra,cal d at.former section of article xx provided in pertinent part the rate of interest upon the loan or forbearance of any money,goods or things in action,or on accounts after demand or judgment rendered in any court of the state,shall be per cent per annum but it shall be competent for the parties to any loan or forbearance of any money,goods or things in action to contract in writing for a rate of interest not exceeding per cent per annum.no person,association,copartnership or corporation shall by charging any fee,bonus,commission,discount or other compensation receive from a borrower more than per cent per annum upon any loan or forbearance of any money,goods or things in action.
in june,former section of article xx was amended and reenacted in its current form as section of article xv.california fed.savings loan city of los angeles cal th,d.section of article xv sets an annual interest rate of seven percent on loans and forbearances,but allows parties to a written contract to set the interest rate at up to percent,or at the level of the federal reserve discount rate plus percent,on loans or forbearances involving real property in addition,section of article its a separate provision regarding interest rates on judgments,which states in pertinent part the rate of interest upon a judgment rendered in any court of this state shall be set by the legislature at not more than percent per annum.
we find guidance on the issue before us from our supreme court decision in heald cal d,heald,which addressed the limitations on interest regarding loans found in former section of article xx.there,the borrowers executed promissory notes that required annual interest payments at a rate of percent or percent per notes were ambiguous on this provided that interest,if not paid when due,was to be incorporated into the principal and thereafter bear interest.heald,supra,cal d at.when the borrowers defaulted on the notes,the creditors demanded the balance due,plus interest on the balance calculated at a rate of percent per annum,compounded annually.id.at.the trial court determined that the notes imposed a percent interest rate,and thus were facially usurious in addition,it awarded the borrowers treble interest pursuant to section of the usury law.heald,supra,cal d at.
our supreme court affirmed the trial court determination regarding the interest rate imposed by the notes,as executed,but reversed the award of treble damages,which was authorized only where the actual payments of interest are in excess of the maximum permissible rate.heald,supra,cal d at,italics added.in so ruling,the court concluded that former section of article xx did not prohibit loan agreements requiring that interest be compounded annually at the maximum legal rate on the balance due the borrowers contend that,since the constitution and the usury law limit the compensation of a lender to per cent per annum,a payment of interest at that rate if compounded annually after default is usurious.we do not agree.the constitutional limitation is that the lender shall not receive from a borrower more than per cent per annum upon any loan or forbearance of any money,and,where the interest is to be compounded annually at the maximum rate after default,the sum charged as interest in any one year will not exceed per cent of the amount owed at the commencement of the year.heald,supra,cal d at.the court further explained w here interest is compounded annually at the maximum rate after default,the sum charged as interest for any one year will not exceed the maximum rate upon the amount of money owed at the commencement of the year,but the sum charged will exceed that rate if the interest is compounded at shorter intervals.id.at.
in our view,heald is dispositive of the issue before us.section of article xv,like former section of article xx,contains no express prohibition regarding compound interest on loans or judgments moreover,section of article xv authorizes the legislature to set the interest rate on judgments up to a maximum of percent per annum,just as its predecessor permitted parties to set the interest rate on loans up to a maximum of percent per annum the renewal provisions reset the enforcement clock while incorporating accrued interest within the principal of the renewed judgment in this respect,they resemble the promissory notes at issue in heald,which incorporated unpaid interest into the principal due on an annual basis.in view of heald,the statutory renewal allow the compounding of interest at intervals of five years or more,far less frequently than the notes in not positively and certainly offend section of article xv.methodist hosp.of sacramento saylor,supra,cal d at.
cibc contends that the court of appeal decision in westbrook,supra,th,d,establishes that the constitution prohibits the compounding of interest on judgments authorized by the renewal statutes.we disagree.there,the plaintiff prevailed on fraud claims,and the trial court issued a judgment that accorded the plaintiff an award of compound interest on the judgment at the rate of ten percent per annum.id.at,d,italics deleted.in reversing the award of postjudgment interest,the court determined that t he only exception to the rule that postjudgment interest on interest compound interest may not be recovered is found in the renewal provisions,which permit the compounding of interest on renewed judgments at intervals.id.at,d.the court reasoned that b y allowing compounding over some unspecified lesser period,the trial court had effectively contravened the legislature intent to allow the compounding of interest on judgments only at intervals of five years.id.at,d.the court in westbrook thus relied on the renewal provisions in order to resolve the issue before it.
in so concluding,the court in westbrook stated that the constitution limit s postjudgment interest to percent simple interest.westbrook,supra,th at,d.in a footnote,it added since the constitution do es not specify simple interest or compound interest,we think that it limits all interest to a maximum of percent.thus,any rate,simple or compound,that exceeds percent is prohibited.id.at,fn,d,italics deleted.the court advanced these opinions without discussing heald or examining article xv,section,of the constitution in its historical context moreover,the court did not attempt to reconcile these statements with its reliance on the renewal provisions in resolving the issue before it.because westbrook does not address the question before us,it is not authority on the issue.santa clara county local transportation authority guardino cal th,d.to the extent westbrook may suggest that the renewal provisions offend article xv,section,it is unpersuasive in view of heald.
pointing to the usury statutes in effect prior to the usury law,cibc contends that the usury law and section of article xx must be construed as barring any form of compound interest on judgments.former sections and of the civil code provided for a maximum interest rate of percent per annum on loans in the absence of a written agreement to the contrary,but permitted parties to agree in writing to any rate of interest italics added in addition,former civil code section permitted parties to agree that interest,if not punctually paid,was to be incorporated into the principal of the loan former section of the civil code provided interest is payable on judgments recovered in the courts of this state,at the rate of seven per cent sic per annum,and no greater rate,but such interest must not be compounded in any manner or form.
cibc contends that the broad prohibition against compound interest on judgments in former civil code section remains in force,arguing that the prohibition was incorporated in the usury law and not abrogated by the constitutional amendments regarding usury.again,we disagree.section of the usury law expressly repealed former civil code section see fn,ante.generally,the deletion of an express statutory provision,whether by the legislature or popular initiative,implies an intent to change the substantive law.dix superior court cal d,legislature people griffin cal d,initiative.this doctrine ultimately relies upon the principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius fay district court of appeal cal,the expression of certain things in a statute necessarily involves exclusion of other things not expressed citation,fair employment housing,supra,cal d at,fn.under this principle,the usury law discloses an intent to eliminate the prohibition against compound interest on judgments in former civil code section.
the language of the usury law itself supports this conclusion.the new law set intere
