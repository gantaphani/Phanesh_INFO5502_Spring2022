ordinarily,an individual debts may be discharged in chapter bankruptcy under.however,a debt may not be discharged if it results from a violation of state or federal securities laws.a a i.the question in this case is whether the exception to discharge in a applies when the debtor himself is not culpable for the securities violation that caused the debt.the bankruptcy court held that the debt was subject to discharge the district court disagreed and held that the debt was excepted from discharge in bankruptcy.we agree with the bankruptcy court that the exception to discharge applies only to those who have themselves violated the securities laws.we thus reverse the judgment of the district court.
we have previously described the facts in this case,which we will relate briefly.see in re sherman sherman i,cir.in,the sec instituted an enforcement action against several companies,which,among other things,led to the court appointment of a receiver see id.at citing sec whitworth energy res,cir unpublished table decision.debtor appellant richard sherman is an attorney who represented some of the defendants in this enforcement action.id.at.
as part of the enforcement action,the receiver ordered sherman to disgorge two separate sums of money.id.first,he was ordered to disgorge that he withdrew from his clients litigation trust account in violation of a freeze order issued by the district court.id.this debt is not at issue in this case.second,the receiver ordered sherman to return money he had received and retained,but had not earned,in a separate contingency case.id.at.the district court calculated that he was responsible for disgorging plus interest.the court held that sherman lacked any interest in the money because he was obligated by the california rules of professional conduct to return the amount by which his advances exceeded his ultimate fee.importantly for our purposes,the sec conceded that sherman had not been found to have committed any securities violations on his own.see id.at t he present case involves a debtor who was not found to have himself violated the securities laws and has not been alleged to have committed other acts of fraud by the sec.
four days before the hearing on the disgorgement motion,sherman and his wife filed a petition for chapter bankruptcy.id.at.the sec and the receiver responded by filing a motion to dismiss the petition.id.at.the receiver independently filed a motion seeking a determination by the court that sherman debts arising from the disgorgement order should be held nondischargeable under a and of the bankruptcy code.id.the bankruptcy court denied the motion,and the sec appealed to the district court,which reversed.id.at.while the appeal was pending,the bankruptcy court granted sherman a discharge under.id.at.in sherman i,we addressed a number of and held that sherman conduct did not constitute cause sufficient to warrant dismissal under a of the code,which allows a bankruptcy court to dismiss petitions filed in bad faith.id.at.we then mentioned that the sec could have filed and still could file a complaint under a or,though we did not explicitly conclude whether the sec would prevail under either provision id.at.
in a subsequent adversary proceeding,the shermans sought declaratory relief to establish that their debt to the sec had been discharged under notwithstanding a discharge exception.the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment for the shermans.it concluded,as a matter of law,that the sec disgorgement order did not arise from a violation of securities laws.it further ruled that s ection a was intended to apply to wrongdoers and not to persons who are simply found to owe a debt which the sec is authorized to enforce.
the sec appealed to the district court,which reversed the bankruptcy court.the district court adopted a broad interpretation of a,treating as paramount the sarbanes oxley act goal of protect ing investors by improving accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures made pursuant to the securities laws.it expressed particular concern that r eading a limitation into the sec ability to enforce its powers to obtain disgorgement of funds in an appropriate case would frustrate the ability of the sec to enforce the federal securities laws.sherman appeals 
we begin by making it clear that,in this case,the validity of the disgorgement order against sherman is not at issue.we have previously held that a nominal defendant may be ordered to disgorge funds that are traceable to fraud.see sec colello,cir a mple authority supports the proposition that the broad equitable powers of the federal courts can be employed to recover ill gotten gains for the benefit of the victims of wrongdoing,whether held by the original wrongdoer or by one who has received the proceeds after the wrong.the courts can order the disgorgement of proceeds of fraud held by nominal defendants because they hold the subject matter of the litigation in a subordinate or possessory capacity as to which there is no dispute.id.at quoting sec cherif,cir.a nominal defendant is not a real party in interest because he has no legitimate claim to the disputed property.sec ross,cir quoting colello,at we found that sherman was effectively acting as a depository for those funds,as he legitimately obtained them in the first place but no longer had a valid claim to retain them,and thus could be ordered to disgorge money retained in excess of his fee for the services rendered in the contingency suits.sherman i,at.
the only question at issue here is whether sherman debt resulting from the disgorgement order can be discharged under of the bankruptcy code code,or whether it falls under the exception to discharge created by a.the code provides,in relevant part,that a discharge under does not discharge an individual from any debt,a,that is for 
i the violation of any of the federal securities laws as that term is defined in section a of the securities exchange act of,any of the state securities laws,or any regulation or order issued under such federal or state securities laws or 
ii common law fraud,deceit,or manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of any security 
a a.the bankruptcy court,siding with sherman,held that a debt can not be for a securities violation when the debtor has not committed such a violation.the district court,siding with the government,held that a is not limited to persons who have been accused or found guilty of violations of the securities laws.although the question is a close one,we agree with the bankruptcy court and hold that a only prevents the discharge of a debt for a securities violation when the debtor is responsible for that violation.
we begin with the statute.the question is whether a debt can be for one of the violations listed in a a when the debtor has not committed any of those violations.the dictionary definition of the word for does not give us a clear answer.the word for is capacious,meaning,among other things,a s the price of,or the penalty on account of i n requital of or i n order to obtain and i n consequence of,by reason of,as the effect of.vi oxford english dictionary ed,available at http.on the one hand,in some sense,sherman debt was the penalty on account of the securities violations committed by his clients.on the other hand,we can not say that sherman owes the debt in requital of fraudulent conduct sherman debt results from the fact that he never earned the money he owes,and not because he committed any wrongdoing.
the plain language of the statute alone does not clearly resolve the interpretive question before us.but it does bring into focus the interpretive dilemma in reading a a should that section be read as if it said that a debt shall not be discharged if it is for the violation by the debtor of any of the federal securities laws or,should the section be read as if it said that a debt shall not be discharged if it is for the violation by the debtor or anyone else of the federal securities laws 
the government encourages us to focus on the absence of any explicit textual indication that the underlying violation must be committed by the debtor.essentially,the government supports a interpretive rule if the text of a discharge exception does not contain the limiting words by the debtor or equivalent language,then the exception must be given its broadest natural reading.
there is some merit to the government argument.indeed,the text of a number of other discharge exceptions specifically targets debts resulting from the conduct of the debtor.see,u.a b exception for fraudulent written statements that the debtor caused to be made or published with intent to deceive emphasis added id.a exception for debts for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity emphasis added id.a b exception for educational loans incurred by a debtor who is an individual emphasis added id.a exception for death or personal injury caused by the debtor operation of a motor vehicle,vessel,or aircraft while intoxicated emphasis added id.a exception for spousal and child support payments incurred by the debtor in the course of divorce or separation proceedings emphasis added.the government argument is corollary to the familiar doctrine of inclusio unius est exclusius alterius the inclusion of one is the exclusion of another.when congress included the phrase by the debtor in these discharge exceptions,it excluded application of the discharge exception to all others.conversely,it is a reasonable inference that,when congress omitted the phrase by the debtor in a a i,it intended to cover debtors and others to whom the exception might reasonably apply.we might therefore conclude that congress knew how to make it clear that a discharge exception should apply only to,astrue ratliff,d concluding that the social security act express authorization of payments to prevailing claimants attorneys shows that congress knows how to make fees awards payable directly to attorneys where it desires to do so,and rejecting the claim that d should therefore be interpreted to authorize fee compensation to a prevailing litigant,and not her attorney hardt reliance standard life ins,d the contrast between g and makes clear that congress knows how to impose express limits on the availability of attorney fees in erisa cases.
we do not think this point,although based on sound principles of statutory interpretation,is the end of the analysis.a number of other discharge exceptions in do not explicitly refer to the debtor conduct,even though at first glance,they seem to be best interpreted as targeting only debtors who are also wrongdoers.see,a a exception for debts for money,property,services,or an extension,renewal,or refinancing of credit,to the extent obtained by false pretenses,a false representation,or actual fraud,other than a statement respecting the debtor or an insider financial condition id.a exception for debts for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity,embezzlement,or larceny id.a exception for debts for a domestic support obligation.
for example,a a creates an exception to discharge for debts for money,property,services,or an extension,renewal,or refinancing of credit,to the extent obtained by actual fraud.even though the text of the statute does not state that the fraudulent conduct must have been the debtor,we have nonetheless incorporated that assumption into our understanding of the provision.see,ghomeshi sabban in re sabban,cir m aking out a claim of under a a requires the creditor to demonstrate that the debtor made representations that at the time he knew they were false and that he made them with the intention and purpose of deceiving the creditor.emphasis added citibank eashai in re eashai,cir t o prove actual fraud,a creditor must establish that the debtor made the representations emphasis added.in fact,we have recently suggested that the debtor involvement in the fraudulent activity might be the only relevant consideration in determining whether the exception applies.see sabban,at holding that a debtor need not have received a benefit from the fraudulent activity in order for a a to prevent a discharge.
we have read a in a similar fashion.although the statute only prohibits the discharge of debts for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity,embezzlement,or larceny again,without any mention that the misconduct must have been by the debtor we have strongly suggested that it applies only in cases where the debtor is responsible for the misconduct.see,cal micro,cantrell in re cantrell,cir rejecting a claim under a because the defendant was not a fiduciary.
a contrary reading of these provisions would extend the discharge exceptions to the honest but unfortunate debtor,local loan hunt,in cases where the debtor was unwittingly involved with,and unknowingly received benefits from,a wrongdoer.for example,suppose we had not construed a a to apply only in those cases where the debtor committed the fraud.suppose,further,that a bank loaned money to an innocent person under the express condition that the loan be guaranteed by a third party who had greater assets.if the third party lies about his assets in order to qualify to be the guarantor,then the borrower will have,in effect,obtained money by false pretenses,a false representation,or actual fraud,even if she did not know or have reason to know about the guarantor misconduct.if she is subsequently unable to repay her loan and is driven to bankruptcy,we think it would contravene the fresh start purposes of the system to deny her a discharge on the basis of a third party misconduct 
admittedly,nothing in the text of any of these provisions makes it clear that the exceptions should apply only to debtors who are responsible for the wrongdoing that caused the debt.however,the government rule would require us to adopt the opposite presumption that exceptions should be applied broadly unless expressly confined to guilty debtors.we do not think the structure of,taken alone,enables us to resolve this question.we must therefore examine a in light of the purposes of the bankruptcy code.
although a text and structure do not resolve the dispute before us,we believe that guidance from supreme court,as well as our previous opinions,strongly favor the bankruptcy court interpretation of the statute.at the core of the bankruptcy code are the twin goals of ensuring an equitable distribution of the debtor assets to his creditors and giving the debtor a fresh start.see bfp resolution trust,d.put simply,the bankruptcy code accomplishes this goal by including the bulk of the debtor property in the bankruptcy estate,see a,distributing that property to creditors in accordance with various provisions of the code,and finally discharging the debtor remaining debts unless those debts either fall into an exception or there is reason to deny a discharge altogether,see id.a.accordingly,the exceptions to discharge enumerated in necessarily prevent a debtor from receiving a completely fresh start,as the debt remains a burden even after all other debts are legally satisfied.
with this in mind,the supreme court has adopted a rule of construction interpreting exceptions to discharge narrowly.see kawaauhau geiger,d e xceptions to discharge should be confined to those plainly expressed internal quotation marks omitted jett sicroff in re sicroff,cir see also collier on bankruptcy in determining whether a particular debt falls within one of the exceptions of,the statute should be strictly construed against the objecting creditor and liberally in favor of the debtor.any other construction would be inconsistent with the liberal spirit that has always pervaded the entire bankruptcy system.we also recognize that the bankruptcy code limits the opportunity for a completely unencumbered new beginning to the honest but unfortunate debtor.grogan garner,d.taken together,these two basic principles suggest that exceptions to discharge should be limited to dishonest debtors seeking to abuse the bankruptcy system in order to evade the consequences of their misconduct.
likewise,if we adopt the government interpretation of a,an recipient of funds obtained by another party participation in a securities violation can not only be ordered to disgorge,but must also continue paying off that debt even if he becomes insolvent and is forced to file for bankruptcy.although we do not dispute colello conclusion that a court may order recipients of these funds to disgorge any funds that remain in their possession,we do not think congress wanted to immunize these debts from discharge in bankruptcy,when the debtor has not been found guilty of any wrongdoing.
the legislative history of a offers modest additional support for our interpretation.we begin by observing that it is unlikely that congress actually considered the specific question of whether innocent third parties subject to disgorgement orders should be subject to a discharge exception.see albernaz united states,d congress can not be expected to specifically address each issue of statutory construction which may arise.the a exception,enacted as part of the sarbanes oxley act,responded to concerns that the bankruptcy code permit ted wrongdoers to discharge their obligations under court judgments or settlements based on securities fraud and other securities violations,at.specifically,congress sought to address the obstacles posed by the fact that the elements of various securities violations do not perfectly overlap with the elements of fraudulent conduct within the meaning of a a,frequently forcing the sec to relitigate otherwise resolved cases before a bankruptcy judge because the violator was not collaterally estopped from challenging the claim of fraud.cong.rec.in other words,one reason congress enacted the exception was to target those parties who are guilty of securities violations,in order to ensure that judgments for securities violations are treated,in bankruptcy,like judgments for fraud.this provides further support for our reading as we note above,we have previously held that a debt falls into the discharge exception for fraud only when the debtor engaged in the fraudulent conduct.see sabban,at.
the government offers a contrary reading of the legislative history,citing senator leahy explanation that a was intended to prevent wrongdoers from using the bankruptcy laws as a shield and to allow defrauded investors to recover as much as possible.cong.rec.the government interprets this statement to mean that congress implemented the exception to further the independently important goals of punishment and compensation.we disagree with this interpretation.it is unlikely that congress sought to divorce the two goals from each other.a better understanding of senator leahy comments is that congress wanted to compensate defrauded investors by recapturing the gains of those who were responsible for the fraud in the first place.hence,senator leahy,like the senate report on sarbanes oxley,referred to wrongdoers who might discharge their obligations under court judgments or settlements based on securities fraud and other securities violations.id.emphasis added.the emphasis on preventing wrongdoers from using the bankruptcy laws can only refer to debtors who are also wrongdoers neither statement supports denying discharge to debtors who have been drawn into a securities fraud but are not themselves wrongdoers.
the government encourages us to adopt the district court reasoning,which characterized sherman as a constructive trustee of the funds he received,and concluded that a trustee can not avoid his obligation to return funds he held in trust for a third party by filing for bankruptcy.at first glance,this reasoning appears to follow naturally from the disgorgement order against sherman.we think,however,that this argument confuses disgorgement of funds with discharge in bankruptcy.in colello which was not a bankruptcy case we described nominal defendants as parties who hold the subject matter of the litigation in a subordinate or possessory capacity as to which there is no dispute.at internal quotation marks omitted.since sherman was in possession of funds that he had received from his clients but had not yet earned,the district court properly relied on a colello theory when issuing its disgorgement order.but requiring sherman to disgorge whatever he has retained is very different from deciding that he is prevented from discharging those debts in bankruptcy.the theories and the reasons behind disgorgement and discharge are quite distinct.
even if sherman nominally held the funds in some kind of fiduciary capacity as the dissent suggests,dissenting op.at,the applicable exception would be a,not a.that section prohibits the discharge of debts for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity,embezzlement,or larceny.for instance,if the government position were that sherman was not entitled to the funds and had improperly appropriated that money,then it could have sought a determination that sherman was guilty of embezzlement.see littleton transamerica commercial fin.in re littleton,cir listing,as the elements of embezzlement,property rightfully in the possession of a nonowner nonowner appropriation of the property to a use other than which it was entrusted and circumstances indicating fraud internal quotation marks omitted.if,as the dissent suggests,sherman was essentially a trustee of whitworth money and improperly spent advance funds instead of placing them in a trust,see dissenting op.at,the government could have urged that sherman be found responsible for defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity.see blyler hemmeter in re hemmeter,cir the definition of defalcation includes both the misappropriation of trust funds or money held in any fiduciary capacity and the failure to properly account for such funds.internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,e ven innocent acts of failure to fully account for money received in trust will be held as defalcations no intent to defraud is required.id.had the government sought to except sherman debt from discharge on a grounds,it might well have prevailed.indeed,it would be far more accurate to say that sherman debt is for his own breach of his fiduciary duties than it is to say that it is owed for whitworth securities violation.as we noted in sherman i,however,the sec is from seeking a determination that a exception prohibits the discharge of sherman debt.at.
the district court also expressed concern that,under the interpretation we adopt today,persons who would otherwise be liable to make disgorgement of funds derived from a securities law violation would be able to avoid their debts by filing for protection under the bankruptcy laws.in particular,the court sought to avoid the possibility that one party could violate the securities laws and transfer the proceeds derived from the violation to a third party who could insulate those funds from disgorgement by filing for bankruptcy.
this concern is flawed in at least two respects.first,as sherman notes,if the third party in question has actually aided or abetted a securities violation,that party may be prosecuted for a violation of securities laws in addition to the primary violator.although sherman retention and subsequent loss of unearned fees from a contingency case in which his client securities violation may appear suspect,the sec concession that sherman had not violated any securities laws undermines its subsequent attempts to leverage this appearance of culpability into any legal consequence.
second,it is not clear how a third party could insulate a securities violator gains by taking those gains and filing for bankruptcy.if a creditor can show that a debtor has concealed property or funds from the bankruptcy court,a discharge can be denied in its entirety,a,or revoked after it is granted,d.otherwise,any funds possessed by the debtor at the time the discharge has been granted will presumably have been included in the bankruptcy estate and distributed to creditors see.on the other hand,if sherman is not granted a discharge,he will not simply have to hand over funds in his possession rather,the sec will be entitled to money that sherman does not yet have in order to satisfy the debt,preventing sherman from receiving the fresh start promised by bankruptcy.
in short,the bankruptcy code already includes protections against attempting to conceal assets or defraud creditors,or otherwise f
