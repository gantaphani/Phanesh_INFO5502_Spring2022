john rezner filed this action against bayerische vereinsbank ag hvb group and hvb structured finance,collectively hvb for violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act of rico,codified at et,and the unfair business practices act of california ucl,codified at cal.bus.et.rezner alleges that hvb engaged in a scheme to defraud the united states of tax revenue through fraudulent tax shelters that caused injury to purchasers of such shelters.
we must decide whether rezner has shown under rico proximate causation requirement that hvb fraud against the united states caused injury to his business or property.hvb contends that rezner rico claim was barred by the private securities litigation reform act pslra,codified in relevant part at c.hvb also argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on its ucl claim because the circumstantial evidence it presented demonstrates that a reasonable jury could find that rezner was a in the tax shelter scheme.
we reject hvb argument that rezner rico claim is barred by the pslra.we reverse the district court order granting summary judgment as to rezner rico and ucl claims,however,because we are persuaded that the district court erred in concluding that rezner had satisfied the proximate causation requirement for a civil rico claim.
it is undisputed that john rezner participated in a financial transaction called custom adjustable rate debt structure cards,designed to avoid the payment of federal income taxes.cards was introduced to him by marc harper,a financial advisor with mycfo.cards loan transactions are designed to generate the appearance of large capital losses for high net worth investors to reduce their tax income liability.
in,to carry out this cards scheme,hvb incorporated pinner financial trading,llc pinner,in the state of delaware.hvb entered into a credit agreement with pinner pursuant to which it loaned pinner euros the pinner loan.pinner converted the proceeds of the loan into an certificate of deposit for of the loan,and a promissory note in the amount of euros or approximately for the remaining.these were placed in an account with hvb to serve as collateral for the pinner loan.
rezner assumed pinner obligation to pay hvb for the loan of euros in exchange for rezner taking ownership of the promissory note that was part of the collateral for the pinner loan.to gain the right to use pinner promissory note,rezner pledged,as collateral for the pinner loan,a security interest in a solomonsmithbarney account that held approximately in municipal bonds.rezner then sold his interest in pinner promissory note to a third party at its fair market value.
the legality of the tax consequences of this cards facility was supported by a legal opinion letter from sidley austin brown wood llp sidley austin.both sidley austin and leboeuf lamb greene macrae llp leboeuf advised rezner that the loan on which he was with pinner was a for a term,but had to be renewed or terminated upon each anniversary by the parties.upon each renewal,hvb had the sole discretion to increase the interest rate and fees associated with the loan.
another investment firm called chenery associates,who engineered cards facilities,was involved in negotiating rezner participation in the transactions.rezner paid a total of over in fees to participate in the cards transactions to hvb to mycfo to sidley austin to leboeuf and to chenery.
on march,the irs published a notice announcing that they would not allow taxpayers to claim a loss based on transactions structured similarly to cards.rezner subsequently claimed a capital loss of on his tax return based upon the fact that he received only for the sale of the promissory note,while assuming joint and several liability for the full euros pinner loan.rezner carried most of the loss to the year,when he sold over in stock.he claimed no tax liability for that year in part because of the alleged loss resulting from assuming liability for the pinner loan.
in august,one year after rezner entered into his agreement to assume liability for the pinner loan,hvb raised the fees and interest rate on the loan.it was entitled to do so under its agreement with pinner.rezner accepted the increase.on august,hvb unilaterally terminated the loan and demanded immediate repayment of the entire outstanding balance.
in,rezner was audited by the irs.the audit resulted in the denial of rezner claimed capital loss made in connection with the pinner loan.he was also ordered to pay approximately in back taxes and interest.

on december,hvb filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that rezner action was preempted by section of the pslra.hvb argued that because rezner pledged municipal bonds as part of the substitute collateral for the pinner loan,rezner claim against hvb must be brought as a securities fraud claim under section b of the securities exchange act,not under rico.in its august,order,the district court denied hvb motion.it held that 
p aintiff voluntary and discretionary decision to include bonds in the substitute accounts was not in connection with the alleged fraud.therefore,defendants alleged conduct is not actionable as securities fraud.since the alleged conduct is not actionable as securities fraud,it is not barred by the pslra and may form the basis of plaintiff rico claim.
rezner filed a motion for partial summary judgment on february.he argued that hvb admission that it defrauded the united states in the dpa was sufficient to establish that hvb violated rico and the ucl.in his motion,rezner also contended that as to five of hvb affirmative defenses,the pleadings,admissions,and discovery in this case establish that there is no evidence to support these defenses and that these defenses are unavailable as a matter of law.in opposition to rezner motion,hvb argued that rezner had failed to satisfy rico proximate causation requirement because rezner own actions caused his alleged injury.hvb asserted that this was a dispute regarding a genuine issue of material fact that precluded summary judgment.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of rezner on his rico and ucl claims.it held that the undisputed evidence demonstrated that hvb had violated rico and the ucl.the court also concluded that hvb affirmative defenses were unsupported by evidence.rezner bayerische vereinsbank ag,no.c,dist.lexis,at.may.the district court rejected hvb primary reliance on the report of its expert,alan dlugash the dlugash report,to show that rezner was aware that the cards transactions lacked economic substance.the district court stated that there was nothing in the dlugash report that suggest ed,based on admissible evidence,that rezner was aware that the cards facility was an unlawful tax shelter.id.at.accordingly,the district court held that hvb had failed to demonstrat
