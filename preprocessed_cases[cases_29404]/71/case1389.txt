jack jevne and avalon investments,collectively jevne filed a petition for writ of mandate directing respondent superior court to vacate its order denying jevne motion to set aside the court prior order compelling binding arbitration of jevne claim against real parties,a brokerage and financial services firm and to restore the matter to the active civil trial calendar.below jevne argued the agreement to arbitrate was unenforceable because the designated dispute resolution provider,nasd dispute resolution,hereinafter known as nasd had refused to appoint a replacement arbitrator during the arbitration unless jevne agreed to waive application of the recently enacted california ethics standards for neutral arbitrators the california standards.jevne claimed that notwithstanding his agreement to arbitrate in accord with the nasd rules and procedures,which include provisions for arbitrator appointments,disqualifications and disclosure of conflicts of interest,he was entitled to the benefit of the california standards.the trial court disagreed concluding,in view of his agreement to arbitrate under the nasd rules,the california standards did not apply and were,in essence,preempted by federal law.
this writ petition raises several issues of first impression for the california state courts,including,whether the judicial council of california acted within its authority in drafting the california standards and whether they are preempted by the federal arbitration act faa the securities exchange act of.as we discuss more fully below,the judicial council decision to make the california standards applicable to arbitrators appointed by dispute resolution providers was not inconsistent with the intent of the legislature.in addition,the california standards are not hostile to arbitration and thus,in the abstract,the faa does not preempt them.notwithstanding these conclusions,we find under the circumstances presented here,the california standards are preempted by the securities exchange act of,in that they conflict with nasd arbitration procedures authorized by the securities and exchange commission.consequently,we conclude the trial court did not err in denying jevne motion and accordingly,we deny the writ of mandate.
factual and procedural history 
in the summer of,jevne filed an action against real parties,a brokerage and financial services firm and a member of the nasd,asserting causes of action for negligence,breach of fiduciary duties and conversion in connection with funds which jevne alleged had been improperly withdrawn from an account real parties maintained on his behalf.
real parties moved to compel arbitration of the matter based on an arbitration provision in an agreement relating to one of jevne accounts.the provision required all disputes arising out of the relationship between the parties to be settled through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures of the nasd,a organization sro,registered with the securities and exchange commission sec to,among other functions,administer securities arbitrations jevne did not oppose the motion to compel,and in february,the court granted it.
thereafter in may,the parties signed a uniform submission agreement memorializing their agreement to have the arbitration conducted in accordance with nasd rules and overseen by nasd director of arbitration.during the summer of,the parties selected a three arbitrator panel pursuant to the nasd procedures for appointing arbitrators.
the arbitration commenced and real parties filed a demurrer to jevne claims.in july,the arbitration panel sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.jevne amended his claim.real parties filed a second demurrer and the matter was set for hearing in october.prior to the hearing,one of the arbitrators voluntarily recused himself.
in late september,nasd stopped appointing arbitrators in nasd arbitrations in california in light of the california standards which imposed new ethical obligations including requirements for disclosure of potential conflicts of interests and procedures for disqualification of arbitrators upon all persons appointed to serve as arbitrators in california after july.the nasd informed jevne it would not appoint a replacement arbitrator and would not proceed with the arbitration unless he agreed to waive the california standards or he agreed to have his arbitration conducted in another state.
jevne would not agree to the waiver and instead filed a motion in the trial court for an order to set aside the court prior order compelling binding arbitration and to restore the matter to the active civil trial calendar.jevne argued the california standards governed his arbitration and therefore the agreement to arbitrate was no longer enforceable because of nasd refusal to proceed with the arbitration without a waiver of the california standards.
the court denied the motion concluding,in essence,federal law preempted the california standards.specifically,the court found jevne had agreed to arbitrate under the nasd rules,the arbitration was governed by the faa and the california standards could not supplant the nasd rules.
jevne filed a petition for a writ of mandate and this court issued an order to show cause.
discussion 
the parties addressed the issue of whether the california standards were preempted by the securities and exchange act of the faa.because no california state court has directly addressed this issue and because of its far reaching implications for the general public,various governmental entities and national institutions,this court invited amici curiae briefing from the nasd and the nyse hereinafter nasd and nyse are collectively referred to as the sros the sec,the california attorney general,and the judicial council of california on the issue of federal preemption.
we also requested the parties and the amici curiae to address another issue considered in the federal litigation and implicated here,specifically whether the california standards may be applied to sros as a matter of california law in light of the definition of neutral arbitrator contained in code of civil procedure section,subdivision d which does not expressly include arbitrators selected or appointed by a dispute resolution provider organization.it is to these matters which we now turn our attention.
application of the california standards to dispute resolution provider organizations.
the real parties and the sros argue the judicial council exceeded its legislative mandate in drafting the california standards to apply to arbitrators appointed by dispute resolution provider organizations drpos the real parties and the sros assert the legislature directed the judicial council to promulgate ethical rules for neutral arbitrators and they point out the definition of neutral arbitrator in code of civil procedure section does not include arbitrators appointed by drpos.thus,they contend the california standards can not apply to arbitrators appointed by the sros.as we shall explain,we disagree.
the judicial council is empowered to adopt rules for court administration,practice and procedure not inconsistent with statute.cal,art.vi.to comply with this requirement,a rule drafted by the judicial council must not conflict with statutory intent.people hall cal th,d.nonetheless a rule promulgated by the judicial council may go beyond the specific provisions of a related statute so long as the rule reasonably furthers the statutory purpose.commercial investors,firmater,th,d.consequently whether the judicial council exceeded its authority here turns on whether including drpos within the california standards furthers the statutory purpose,which is determined by examining the legislative intent.
to ascertain the intent of the legislature the court first looks to the language of the statute.elden superior court th,d.if the meaning is without ambiguity,doubt,uncertainty and would not otherwise result in absurd consequences which the legislature could not have intended,then the language of the statute controls.horwich superior court cal th,d.if,however,the meaning is not clear,then the court looks to the legislative history to determine the intent.elden superior court,supra,th at,d.
pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,the legislature directed the judicial council to establish ethical standards for neutral arbitrators.the legislature did not define neutral arbitrator in connection with its directive to the judicial council to adopt the new ethical standards.the phrase,neutral arbitrator is defined,however,elsewhere in the code of civil procedure at section which provides the general definitions for the civil procedure title governing arbitration.section,subdivision d defines a neutral arbitrator as an arbitrator who is selected jointly by the parties or by the arbitrators selected by the parties or appointed by the court,subd.d.
the real parties and the sros assert the language of definition is clear and its exclusion of drpos is dispositive.they point out that judicial council staff has elsewhere conceded that drpos are not included within the definition of neutral arbitrator.
before this court,jevne and the judicial council,assert that the language selected jointly by the parties or by the arbitrators selected by the parties is unclear because it can encompass arbitrators both directly and indirectly selected by the parties.they further argue that because the parties using an sro as a dispute resolution provider have input into the selection of the arbitrators,then the arbitrators appointed by the sros are indirectly selected by the parties and therefore they fall within the definition of neutral arbitrator in section.
in our view,the selected by the parties language is ambiguous.it could reasonably be said to include both a direct selection of the arbitrators and an indirect selection,where,for example,the parties review a list of potential arbitrators,rank them according to preference and the drpo makes the final appointment from the preferred list of arbitrators.because the term selected is susceptible to both meanings,we turn to the legislative history of section for guidance.
section was enacted in as part of a body of legislation governing arbitration proposed by the california law revision commission clrc.in a report issued to the legislature,the clrc discussed the definition of neutral arbitrator.the clrc indicated arbitrators fell into two basic categories party arbitrators and neutral arbitrators.according to the report,arbitrators were distinguished based on whether the arbitrator was intended to serve in an impartial and unbiased manner in which case the arbitrator should be classified as neutral or whether the arbitrator was intended to advocate on behalf of a party.the report further explained the meaning of the definition of neutral as used in the proposed legislation the arbitrator appointed by both parties,or by the two arbitrators chosen by the parties,or appointed by the court,or any other disinterested agency should be designated the neutral arbitrator.see recommendation relating to arbitration cal.law revision com.
the legislative history shows clrc expected the arbitration provisions would apply to all arbitrators who held themselves out to be neutral,unbiased and impartial,irrespective of whether they were directly selected by the parties,the court or appointed by a drpo chosen by the parties.thus,clrc explanation supports the view the phrase selected by the parties in section should be broadly interpreted to include neutral arbitrators indirectly selected by the parties through a drpo.because the legislature adopted the exact language of section as proposed by the clrc the explanation provided by the clrc is strong evidence of the legislature intent.see people martinez cal th,d.
given our interpretation of section,subdivision d,sro arbitrators fall within the definition of neutral arbitrator in the california standards.the sros characterize their arbitrators as impartial and unbiased.in addition,there is no question the parties play an important,albeit indirect,role in the selection process of the sro arbitrators.the director sends a list of potential arbitrators to the parties.the parties may strike arbitrators from the list for any reason and thereafter the parties rank the remaining arbitrators numerically according to their individual choices.the director of arbitration then consolidates the parties lists and appoints arbitrators to serve on the panel based on the rankings on the consolidated list,subject to availability and disqualification.given the input the parties have in selecting the sro arbitrators and the common sense interpretation of selected by the parties indicated by the legislative history,we conclude sro arbitrators fall within the definition of selected by the parties and thus constitute neutral arbitrators under section,subdivision d.
we observe this conclusion is also consistent with the legislation that empowered the judicial council to adopt the standards.nothing in the recent legislative history indicates the legislature intended to exclude certain classes of neutral arbitrators or manifests an intent the california standards should have a narrow or limited application.on the contrary,the california standards were intended to have a broad application to all persons who serve as private judges 
the legislature must take a serious look at the growing use of private judges and how that growing use raises questions of fairness and the creation of a dual system of justice that favors the wealthy litigant over the poor litigant.in theory,the publicly financed court system is supposed to provide all civil disputants,rich or poor,with an impartial forum within which to litigate and resolve their differences.in reality,however,a fair number of cases end up before a private judge or arbitrator pursuant to contractual agreements this law is intended to address some of the concerns raised that increased use of private dispute resolvers creates a dual system of justice.the bill seeks to address concerns of fairness by requiring private arbitrators to comply with ethical guidelines to be established by the judicial council.judiciary com.on bill reg.sess.
in view of the foregoing,we conclude the judicial council definition of neutral arbitrator in the california standards furthers the statutory purpose of section and is fully consistent with the directives of the legislature.
ii.federal preemption 
federal arbitration act 
real parties,the sec and the sros assert the faa preempts the california standards in general because the california standards impose requirements applicable only to arbitration contracts,rather than all contracts,and specifically because the california standards impose terms which differ from those in the parties arbitration agreement.
the faa governs all agreements to arbitrate where the transactions at issue in the dispute involve interstate commerce.see.section of the faa provides agreements to arbitration are valid,irrevocable and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.the faa is a manifestation of congressional intent to favor arbitration agreements.it was enacted to overcome a perceived hostility in the common law courts towards arbitration.however,there is no federal policy favoring arbitration under a certain set of procedural rules nor does the faa reflect congressional intent to occupy the entire field of arbitration.volt information sciences,board of trustees,d.thus,states are free to establish their own arbitration rules and procedures even where the controversy is governed by federal substantive law.felder casey,d.state laws concerning arbitration are only preempted to the extent that they conflict with congressional intent to favor the enforcement of arbitration agreements.volt information sciences,board of trustees,supra,at.
consequently,state laws that single out arbitration agreements for special scrutiny or suspect status are viewed as inhospitable to arbitration as well as those that seek to limit the use of the arbitral process,have been routinely found preempted by the faa.see,doctor associates casarotto,d,preempting montana law which invalidated arbitration agreements unless they contained special notice placed on first page of the agreement see also securities industry association connolly cir,citing cases.as the supreme court has explained,the faa preempts state law where it is necessary to overcome the historic refusal of some state courts to enforce arbitration agreements faa preempts state law because congress wanted to protect arbitration.terminix cas.dobson,d.faa preempted alabama law which invalidated predispute arbitration agreements.
thus state laws that are not or antagonistic to the process are not automatically preempted by the faa even though the state law relates only to arbitration agreements.the supreme court has specifically recognized california procedures and rules governing arbitration are manifestly designed to encourage resort to the arbitral process,do not conflict with any policy embodied in the faa and generally foster the federal policy favoring arbitration.volt information sciences,board of trustees,supra,at.
in our view,the california standards are consistent with the other california arbitration procedures the volt court endorsed.on their face,the california standards are not.in fact,they comport with the spirit of section of the faa which has been interpreted to require arbitrators to disclose to the parties any dealings that might create the impression of possible bias.see commonwealth coatings continental casualty,d.unlike other preempted state laws which automatically invalidate arbitration agreements or which singled out such agreements and condition their validity upon special procedural or notice requirements,the california standards do not invalidate arbitration agreements or impose special requirements on the agreements themselves.arbitration agreements do not fail by operation of law,nor are they automatically invalid if the parties fail to comply with the standards.failure to comply with the standards presents,at most,only the potential the agreement may be invalidated or an award vacated.consequently,we conclude the california standards are not preempted by the faa as a matter of law 
securities exchange act of 
real parties,the sec and the sros assert the securities exchange act of the exchange act preempts the california standards because the standards conflict with the exchange act stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the exchange act purposes.
preliminarily we observe certain general principles which inform these issues and place the concept of conflict preemption in the proper context.
preemption principles 
in general the federal government and the states have the power to pass legislation regulating the same subjects.california and the federal government both regulate securities industry and arbitration agreements and proceedings.matsushita industrial epstein,d congress plainly contemplated the possibility of dual litigation in state and federal courts relating to securities transaction moncharsh heily blasé cal th,d,california has a strong public policy in favor of regulating private arbitration graham,cal d.
in addition,the courts employ a presumption against finding federal preemption.ting v.at t cir.where,as here,however,a state regulates in an area,such as securities arbitration,with a history of significant federal presence,the presumption against preemption does not apply.mayo dean witter reynolds,supra,d at.
the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,nonetheless,requires courts to find federal preemption of state law as long as it is clear that congress intended to eclipse the historic police powers of the state,art.vi,cl.gibbons ogden wheat.california arc america,d crosby national foreign trade council,d a fundamental principle of the constitution is that congress has the power to preempt state law.mckey charles schwab th,d.
there are three generally recognized types of preemption.first,where congress expressly defines the extent to which a federal provision preempts state law this has been characterized as express preemption.see crosby national foreign trade council,supra,at.second,courts find preemption when federal regulation of an area is so broad and pervasive that it appears congress intended federal law to occupy the field.united states locke,d.
finally,state law is preempted to the extent it conflicts with federal law.hines davidowitz.crosby national foreign trade council,supra,at.courts have found conflict preemption in two types of circumstances where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal law and where under the circumstance of a particular case,the challenged state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishments and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.crosby national foreign trade council,supra,at,quoting hines davidowitz,supra,at.internal citations omitted and emphasis added.
determining a sufficient obstacle requires an examination of the federal statute as a whole and identifying its purposes and intended effects.crosby national foreign trade council,supra,at.if the purpose of the act can not otherwise be its operation within its chosen field else must be frustrated and its provisions be refused their natural state law must yield to the regulation of congress.ibid.quoting savage jones.cf hines davidowitz,supra,at,fn.
conflict preemption 
the exchange act contains a state saving clause and and because congress has provided for concurrent state regulation of securities,there is no express or field preemption under the federal securities laws of the california standards.roskind morgan stanley dean witter th,d state law remedies and regulations available under cal.bus.and supplement federal securities law diamond multimedia systems,superior court cal th,d,see also green fund asset management,cir,fn.accordingly,only conflict preemption is implicated in this case.
more specifically,the questions here are whether california standards on disqualification of arbitrators standard and on arbitrator disclosure of potential conflicts of interest standard create a physical impossibility such that private parties can not comply with both the california standards and the nasd regulations on disqualification nasd rules and disclosure nasd rule a,whether standard and standard stand as obstacles to the exchange act.hines davidowitz,supra,at.for the reasons discussed below,we concluded nasd rules preempt the california standards based on the direct conflict between arbitrator disqualification provisions in the nasd rules and the disqualification provisions in the california standards.
a.the disqualification rules of standard and nasd rules.
real parties,the sec and the sros argue standard conflicts with nasd rules for arbitrator disqualification.we agree.despite the laudable goals of the legislature in promulgating the california standards to protect consumers and maintain judicial scrutiny of securities arbitrations,the disqualification rules of standard present a clear physical conflict with the nasd rules.specifically,the issue of who,the director of arbitration under the nasd rules or the parties under the california standards,makes the ultimate decision to disqualify an arbitrator presents a conflict.
preliminarily,however,we note some similarities exist between the state and nasd arbitrator disqualification rules.as the attorney general points out the parties play some role in the disqualification of arbitrators under nasd rules and may also initiate the disqualification process under standard and disqualification is not automatic under either set of rules.nonetheless,the fact remains each set of rules has a different decision maker determining when an arbitrator should be disqualified.under standard,an arbitrator is disqualified when a party files notice with the court,and assuming the arbitrator fails to disqualify him or herself upon learning of the challenge,the superior court judge will make the ultimate decision on disqualification under the california rules 
in contrast,under the nasd rules,the director of arbitration has the final say on any challenge for cause or any determination that a conflict of interest warranting disqualification exists.there is no reconciling the conflict between the california standards and the nasd rules it is simply impossible to comply with both of them.moreover,there is no support for the assumption implicit in the attorney general argument that these two vastly different decision makers would reach the same conclusion regarding whether disqualification is warranted in any given case.reasonable people differ.because standard effectively eliminates the role of the director of arbitration,we find that it conflicts with nasd rules,and accordingly is preempted.this conflict is direct and insurmountable,and is sufficient,standing alone,to support a finding the california standards are preempted by the nasd rules.
disclosure rules of standard and nasd rule a.
in any event,the california standards relating to disclosure of conflicts of interest also appear to stand as an obstacle to the nasd rules.in addition to their preemption arguments concerning california standard,real parties,the sec and the sros argue standard physically conflicts and stands as an obstacle to nasd rule a.they are correct,in part.
in his amicus brief,the attorney general argues that there is no material difference between the disclosure requirements of the standard and nasd rule a.we agree.
standard d requires disclosure of a ll matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed arbitrator would be able to be impartial.of standard d contain a enumeration of matters which an arbitrator is required to disclose for its part,nasd rule a requires disclosure of a ny existing or past financial,business,professional,family,social,or other relationships or circumstances that are likely to affect impartiality or might reasonably create an appearance of bias.
arguably parties in nasd arbitrations have the ability to request the same information as enumerated by standard d pursuant to nasd rule b thus,if a party is dissatisfied with the initial disclosure by a nasd arbitrator,the party may seek supplemental information.this is a regular practice among some lawyers.perino,report to the securities and exchange commission regarding arbitrator conflict disclosure requirements in nasd and nyse securities arbitrations hereinafter perino report at.at bottom,both sets of rules are consistent iterations of the principle that arbitrators must disclose any dealings that might create an impression of bias.commonwealth coatings continental casualty,supra,at.
in our view,the california standards are simply more detailed than the nasd disclosure rules,which in itself does not make it impossible for parties,and in particular arbitrators,to comply with both sets of rules.even the independent reviewer the sec commissioned to examine this issue,professor perino,indicated the conflict between the disclosure rules lacked real substance,observing t he key difference between these two disclosure obligations is one of drafting sros have adopted a broad disclosure standard while california has chosen to articulate numerous precise rules that describe the required disclosures.perino report at.a difference in drafting philosophy does not present a physical conflict requiring preemption 
notwithstanding our view standard and nasd rule a do not actually conflict,we nevertheless must find standard stands as an obstacle to the exchange act 
the exchange act,amended in,requires the sec to approve all nasd rules,upon finding the rule complies with the exchange act.b.the sec also has the power,on its own initiative,to a brogate,add to,and delete from any sro rule if it finds changes necessary or appropriate to further the objectives of the exchange act.c.moreover,prior to approving rules,the sec must find the rule at issue is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices to promote equitable principles of trade to safeguard against unreasonable profits and charges and to protect investors and be in the public interest.sec approval of a nasd regulation constitutes a determination by the sec the rule comports with congressional directives and the exchange act.express,mcmahon,d no proposed rule change may take effect unless the sec finds that the proposed rule is consistent with the requirements of the exchange act.thus,because the sec approved nasd rule a and the other nasd rules governing arbitration,the nasd arbitration rules must be deemed consistent with the exchange act.id.at.the issue then becomes whether standard undermines or frustrates the purpose of nasd rule a.the sec has answered this question in the affirmative.
when california adopted standard,the sec requested an exemption for nasd and nyse from standard based on the sec belief standard would have an adverse effect on both investors and the sros,by inter alia,increasing administrative costs and reducing the number of available arbitrators.nasd amicus brief at.in addition,the sec commissioned professor perino to assess whether nasd should modify its rules to incorporate standard.professor perino concluded nasd should not amend its rules to correspond to the california standards thus,the sec contends standard is an obstacle to nasd rule a because it would increase costs,complexity and uncertainty of the arbitration process which in turn frustrates the exchange act purpose of protecting investors and the public.in its view,current nasd disclosure rules represent the appropriate balance between efficiency and fairness while disclosure requirements under standard would interfere with the purpose of the exchange act.see perino report at.moreover,the sec has concluded that allowing california arbitrations to be administered under a different set of rules will introduce inconsistency into the process and thus undermine the national system of sro arbitrations.see perino report at,fn.in light of the sec intense oversight in the area of sro arbitrations,we are reluctant to second guess the sec determination on these matters.see express,mcmahon,supra,at.when congress delegates an agency,such as the sec,authority to implement a statute here the exchange act the agency is in the better position to decide if a rule,such as standard,would provide an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of its objectives.grier american honda motor,d see cohen wedbush,noble,cooke,cir,overruled on other grounds because congress has committed to the sec the task of ensuring that the federal rights established by the securities acts are not compromised by inadequate arbitration procedures,we are bound by the commission determination s concerning the adequacy of the arbitration procedures.thus,where,as here,the sec determines that a state law conflicts with a federal regulation,we feel compelled to defer to the agency judgment.geier american honda motor,supra,at.see cohen wedbush,noble,cooke,supra,at.
in sum,in view of the sec involvement in the approval of the sro arbitration rules,and in particular,given the direct conflict between the california standards for arbitrator disqualification and nasd disqualification provisions,we conclude the sro arbitration rules and procedures to the extent they have been approved by sec preempt the california standards 
disposition 
the writ is denied.real parties are entitled to recover costs on this proceeding.
the securities exchange act of created the sec.the sec is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the federal securities laws,regulations,and oversight of sros like the nasd and the new york stock exchange.
federal preemption of the california standards was raised in alan superior court ubs painewebber,th,d.the court of appeal,division one of this district declined to resolve the issue,however.noting the nasd was not a party in the case nor had filed an amicus curiae brief,the court deferred the matter to other civil actions in which the nasd was an active issue of federal preemption of the california standards has also arisen in the federal courts.nasd and the nyse filed an action in federal court to have the california standards declared inapplicable to sro arbitrations.see nasd dispute resolution,new york stock exchange,judicial council of california d.the district court dismissed the action without reaching the merits of the preemption issue based on the conclusion the judicial council and its members sued in their official capacities enjoyed eleventh amendment immunity from suit in federal court.id.at.an appeal of the decision is currently pending before the ninth federal district courts that have considered the issue have found the california standards inapplicable to sros for various reasons.in mayo dean witter reynolds,d,the court found the california standards conflicted with the nyse arbitration rules and procedures and thus were preempted by the securities and exchange act of and the faa.in accord wilmot mcnabb d.in contrast,in credit suisse first boston grunwald,no.c sba,the court noted in passing the california standards were not preempted by the faa.nonetheless,the court found the california standards could not apply to arbitrators because such arbitrators did not fall within the definition of neutral arbitrators in the code of civil procedure.consequently,the court concluded the judicial council had exceeded its authority in drafting the california standards and thus declared them void.
the nyse,like the nasd,is registered with the sec to administer securities arbitrations.though not at issue in this case,we note the nyse arbitration rules and procedures are substantially similar to those of nasd in all matters relevant here.
standard defines the term arbitrator as used in the california standards.specifically it provides,in pertinent part,that an a arbitrator and neutral arbitrator mean any arbitrator who is to serve impartially,whether selected or appointed by c by a dispute resolution provider organization,under an agreement of the parties.standard,further defines dispute resolution provider organization in subdivision g as any nongovernmental entity that,or individual who,coordinates,administers,or provides the services of two or more dispute resolution neutrals.
the power to adopt rules is not limited to court administration,practice and procedure.the legislature may also direct the judicial council to adopt rules and procedures governing substantive matters.people wright cal d.
all statutory references are to the code of civil procedure unless indicated otherwise.all statutory references are to the code of civil procedure unless indicated otherwise.
in april of the judicial council staff recognized it had expanded upon the definition of neutral arbitrator in section,subdivision d by including drpo in the definition of neutral arbitrator in the california standards.this acknowledgement,however,does not undermine the judicial council long held position that the california standards are fully consistent with the intent of the legislature in directing them to adopt the ethical rules.
notwithstanding our conclusion,we recognize some question remains as to whether the california standards are preempted as a matter of fact.as the real parties,sec and sros argue and as we explain elsewhere in this opinion,the california standards differ from the nasd arbitration procedures agreed to by the parties in their arbitration agreement.thus,real parties assert faa preemption based on the contention that under the faa,they are entitled to have the arbitration agreement enforced according to its terms.they maintain jevne effort to avoid arbitration altogether based on california standards fails because an arbitration agreement subject to the faa may be invalidated only on legal or equitable grounds for the revocation of any contract.see southland corporation keating,d.in other words,faa preference for arbitration is outweighed only where a party seeks to invalidate the arbitration provision pursuant to a contract law defense rather than a defense which would only arise in connection with an effort to avoid,however,raises several contract law defenses,including the contention the arbitration agreement is void as against public policy.specifically,the nasd has conditioned the appointment of a replacement arbitrator on jevne waiving application of the california standards.in so doing,the nasd requests jevne not only to forgo his rights and remedies under the california standards but also the obligations of the arbitrators under them.in light of the strong public policy expressed in the california standards,we wonder whether jevne can waive the arbitrators statutory duties,especially in view of the fact the ethical obligations were imposed for the parties benefit and for the benefit of the general public the standards are intended to guide the conduct of arbitrators,to inform and protect the participants in arbitration,and to promote public confidence in the arbitration process.cal.rules of court,ethics std.a emphasis added.in any event,we need not decide whether the california standards are preempted by the faa as applied in this case,in view of our conclusion elsewhere the california standards are preempted by the securities exchange act of
