we must decide whether the commodities futures trading commission has jurisdiction over certain activities involving foreign currency.
in,richard matthews,formed white pine trust corporation white pine as a holding company for investment funds,including the pinnacle capital fund pinnacle investors in pinnacle were told that they had accounts representing investments in the trading of the fund.investors were not to place orders for specific products instead,white pine claimed in its prospectus that it would manage the accounts in the fund according to one of two trading strategies.these strategies combined trading in the spot and options markets for foreign currency.white pine also told customers it would keep the money customers invested in pinnacle segregated into individual accounts.
in,matthews hired stephen baere as the director of business development for white pine.part of baere job was to solicit money from the public to invest in pinnacle.he solicited in person at trade shows and elsewhere and through white pine website.
as it turned out,pinnacle,and white pine in general,did not do much trading.instead,the parties agree,matthews stole the money of investors for himself.indeed,the accounts to which investors contributed were commingled with general funds,over which matthews had control.though he claims not to have known that matthews was pocketing pinnacle funds,baere concedes that he solicited money from investors by,in part,lying to them at matthews direction.
after some preliminary investigation,the commodity futures trading commission cftc filed a civil proceeding against white pine and matthews in october of,adding baere as a defendant one month later.the cftc sought and obtained a preliminary injunction against baere to freeze his assets,to make his assets and records available to the cftc for discovery,and to prohibit baere from destroying records.
the government had also initiated criminal prosecutions against all three defendants.soon after the cftc added baere as a defendant,he accepted a plea agreement.while admitting that he actively solicited investments in pinnacle by misrepresenting facts,baere did not concede that white pine offered foreign currency options.
the cftc first amended complaint the operative complaint rested the agency jurisdiction on several provisions of the commodity exchange act the act,the statute governing the reach of the cftc and commodities regulation.whether this provision actually supports the cftc jurisdiction over this case is the central issue on appeal.the cftc sought injunctive relief pursuant to,which authorizes such relief against persons who have violated,are violating,or are about to violate any provision of the act or the regulations thereunder.the agency also sought disgorgement and restitution.
the complaint charged baere,matthews,and white pine with one count of fraud by misappropriation and solicitation in violation of b and,a and c,and one count of offer and sale of illegal options contracts in violation of b and a.the cases against white pine and matthews soon resolved themselves without much litigation.
as the litigation in baere case proceeded to discovery,the cftc refused to respond to some of his interrogatories and requests for admission.baere successfully moved to compel responses to all of the discovery requests pertaining to the jurisdictional he traded in or offered transactions to others in foreign currency options.the cftc responded as directed,but baere remained unsatisfied.he argued that the cftc had to provide an expert analysis of pages of documents pertaining to white pine trading activity to determine whether options trading actually occurred.the magistrate refused to compel the cftc to perform the analysis and baere objected.
the district court overruled this objection.it concluded that the cftc jurisdiction does not turn on whether white pine actually traded options,because the cftc only alleges that baere offered options transactions to clients.in any event,the district court ruled that even if the cftc did have to prove actual trading,it had met its discovery obligations by producing over pages of trading documents identified by bates stamp number.
in the meantime,the cftc had moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted.baere timely appeals from such judgment along with the district court denial of his motion to compel.significantly for our purposes,baere only contests the district court determination that the cftc has jurisdiction to bring this case he does not challenge the district court ruling that,as a matter of law,he engaged in actionable fraud under the relevant statutes.we therefore assume that he has.
the cftc claims it has jurisdiction to bring this case under three sections of the act c b,b,and.for reasons that will appear,we address the statutory provisions in reverse order.
in its complaint,the cftc sought injunctive relief,civil fines,and disgorgement and restitution under.that section provides that 
w henever it shall appear to the commission that any person has engaged,is engaging,or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of this chapter or any regulation thereunder,the commission may bring an action in the proper district court of the united states to enjoin such act or practice,or to enforce compliance and said courts shall have jurisdiction to entertain such actions.
a.the statute also allows the cftc to seek,and allows the court to impose,civil penalties i n any action brought under the same section.d standing alone,these subsections grant no jurisdiction the cftc must allege and,on summary judgment,show a violation of the act or of its regulations.
indeed,the cftc alleges baere violated b and,a c,and a,all of which prohibit fraud and misrepresentation in the solicitation or offering of options.these substantive provisions,however,do not confer jurisdiction on the cftc by themselves.section b of the act merely prohibits anyone from offer ing to enter into,enter ing into or confirm ing the execution of,any transaction involving any commodity regulated under this chapter which is of the character of,or is commonly known to the trade as,an option contrary to any regulation of the commission prohibiting any such transaction.b emphases added.
section b,then,only prohibits those transactions in options contrary to cftc regulations if they are regulated under the act,that is,if congress has granted jurisdiction to the cftc to regulate them and to bring civil actions pertaining to them.such regulations,of course,can not go beyond the jurisdictional limits of the statute.even if they could,the regulations incorporate by reference the same limits that subsection b does.see a the provisions of this part shall apply to all commodity option transactions pursuant to b and the regulations promulgated thereunder.a the provisions of this section shall be applicable to accounts,agreements,contracts,or transactions described in section c of the act,to the extent that the commission exercises jurisdiction over such accounts,agreements,contracts and transactions as provided in section c b of the act.
thus,all roads lead back to section of the act,which is captioned jurisdiction of commission.section c exempts from the statute coverage agreement s,contract s,and transaction s in certain financial instruments,including foreign currency.c a subsection c b,on which the cftc bases its jurisdictional claims,restores coverage over a specific subset of transactions in foreign currency.in particular,it grants the cftc jurisdiction over an agreement,contract,or transaction in foreign currency that is a contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery or an option and is offered to,or entered into with,a person that is not an eligible contract participant,unless the counterparty is certain types of entities.c b i i ii.the parties do not dispute that baere never solicited money from any eligible contract participants within the meaning of the statute and that white pine was not one of the exempted counterparties.therefore,it seems the cftc can bring its action only if it can show an agreement,contract
