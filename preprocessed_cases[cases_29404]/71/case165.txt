defendant rajat gupta gupta appeals from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on november,following a jury trial before jed rakoff,judge,convicting him on three counts of securities fraud,in violation of b and,and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud,in violation of.gupta was sentenced principally to months imprisonment,to be followed by a term of supervised release,and was ordered to pay a fine of.in an amended judgment entered in february,gupta was also ordered to pay restitution in the amount of,an order that is the subject of a separate appeal that has been held in abeyance pending decision of the present appeal.in the present appeal,gupta challenges his conviction,contending principally that he is entitled to a new trial on the grounds that the trial court erred by admitting statements of a coconspirator,recorded in wiretapped telephone conversations to which gupta was not a party,and by excluding relevant evidence offered by gupta.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that gupta contentions lack merit,and we affirm the judgment.
background 
at the times pertinent to this prosecution,gupta was a member of the board of directors of the goldman sachs group,goldman sachs or goldman,the global financial services firm headquartered in new york.gupta was also involved in several financial ventures with raj rajaratnam or raj,founder of the galleon group galleon,a family of hedge funds that invested billions of dollars for its principals and clients.the present prosecution arose out of a multiyear government investigation of insider trading at galleon which included wiretaps of rajaratnam cell phone,see united states rajaratnam,cir.
during its investigation,the government discovered evidence indicating,inter alia,that rajaratnam was receiving inside information about goldman sachs from gupta and trading on that information.eventually,gupta was charged with six counts of securities law violations.count one of the superseding indictment on which gupta was tried the indictment alleged,inter alia,that gupta,rajaratnam,and others conspire d to commit securities fraud indictment that gupta disclosed inside information about goldman sachs to rajaratnam,with the understanding that rajaratnam would use the inside information to purchase and sell securities id.b and that rajaratnam,knowing the information he received from gupta was confidential,shared the inside information with other coconspirators at galleon and caused the execution of transactions in the securities of goldman sachs id.c.the object of the conspiracy was the purchase and sale of securities in order to receive illegal profits illegally avoid losses id.and b based on gupta disclos ure of inside information obtained from goldman sachs to rajaratnam,which information rajaratnam shared with other coconspirators at galleon id.a and d.gupta was convicted on the conspiracy count and on three substantive counts of securities fraud counts three,four,and five,all relating to trades of goldman sachs stock by rajaratnam based on confidential inside information rajaratnam received from gupta in the fall of.
evidence supporting the counts of conviction 
all of the government evidence that gupta passed confidential information about goldman sachs to rajaratnam,on the basis of which rajaratnam made purchases or sales of goldman stock,was circumstantial.most of the evidence described below was presented through testimony from employees of galleon or goldman,wiretapped telephone calls between rajaratnam and other galleon employees,records of calls made to or from telephones used by gupta or rajaratnam,and records as to the timing of trades by galleon in goldman sachs stock.
galleon trades of goldman sachs stock on september,
at on september,goldman sachs held a special meeting of its board of directors.the purpose of the meeting was to approve an investment of billion in goldman by warren buffett.the imminent investment was highly confidential,as it was likely to have a meaningful impact on goldman stock price.trial transcript tr.it was to be announced to the public after the close of trading on the new york stock exchange.
gupta,a former managing director of the consulting firm mckinsey company mckinsey,participated in the goldman sachs board meeting via telephone from a conference room at mckinsey new york office.telephone records indicated that gupta was on the goldman sachs conference call from until 
at approximately,gupta assistant,renee gomes,dialed rajaratnam direct line the mckinsey conference room telephone from which gupta had participated in the goldman sachs board meeting was then connected to the call to rajaratnam line.the connection between rajaratnam line and the telephone gupta used lasted approximately to seconds.
caryn eisenberg,rajaratnam assistant in,testified that on september,she answered a call on his direct line at about minutes before the market close.as a general rule eisenberg was not to put calls through to rajaratnam near the end of the trading day,but she put the caller on hold,located rajaratnam,and put the call through.although at the time of trial eisenberg no longer remembered the name of the man who was on the line,she testified that she put this call through because his name was on the short list of persons whose calls rajaratnam would accept near the end of the trading day she recognized his voice as that of a frequent caller and the man said it was urgent that he speak to raj.tr.
rajaratnam took the call in his office and was on the telephone only briefly.eisenberg testified that rajaratnam thereafter summoned galleon cofounder gary rosenbach into his office and the two had a conversation.rosenbach then went back to his desk,picked up his telephone,and started saying buy goldman sachs.id.at.
galleon trader ananth muniyappa testified that at approximately on september,rajaratnam,as he was hanging up his telephone,instructed muniyappa,who was at his own desk nearby,to purchase shares of goldman sachs stock.when muniyappa determined that he would probably be unable to buy as many as shares before the market close he managed to buy only a total of shares,he quickly informed rajaratnam,who promptly instructed rosenbach to buy goldman stock.
rosenbach proceeded to buy shares of the stock,for rajaratnam portfolio which specialized in technology stocks and for rosenbach own portfolio.rosenbach also bought million shares for rajaratnam portfolio and for his own of a index fund made up of stocks of several institutions,including goldman.each of these trades was made in the final three to four minutes of the trading day tr,between approximately and.in all,the goldman sachs stock purchased by muniyappa and rosenbach at the behest of rajaratnam in the final minutes of the trading day on september excluding the shares of the index fund cost more than million.
warren buffett billion investment in goldman sachs was announced at approximately on september.the next morning,goldman stock price rose to a high nearly above its september closing price.a government witness testified that the profits on the above galleon purchases of goldman stock at the end of the trading day on september exceeded million.
eisenberg testified that after rajaratnam took the urgent call near the close of trading on september he was smiling more than usual.see tr.but not everyone at galleon was happy.leon shaulov was a galleon trader and portfolio manager.muniyappa did not buy any goldman sachs stock for shaulov on september.muniyappa testified that that evening,shortly after goldman announced the warren buffett investment,shaulov sent rosenbach an email saying,thanks for the heads up,by the way.i short million in financials.not one word from anyone.thank you very much.all i get is sick dilution.zero help.zero.id.at see also id.at a short position is one speculating that the market price will go down.
on the morning of september,before the stock markets opened,rajaratnam placed two calls from his cell phone which was wiretapped to ian horowitz,his principal trader.in the first call,at,rajaratnam began to tell horowitz about the events of the previous afternoon 
raj rajaratnam so,big drama yesterday,but i have to 
ian horowitz yeah,i,i,i heard.
raj rajaratnam hum.
ian horowitz i heard a little,um,you mean the last three minutes of the day

gx t second rajaratnam horowitz call,at emphases added.
galleon trades of goldman sachs stock on october,
on october,more than halfway through the fourth quarter of goldman sachs fiscal year,goldman chairman convened an unofficial board meeting by conference call to bring the directors on company events.at that time,wall street analysts were projecting that goldman which,since becoming a public company,had never reported a quarterly loss would continue to report profits.in the conference call,which began at,goldman management informed the board that the company result would be a loss.
records were introduced to show that gupta,on a telephone in his home office,participated in the goldman sachs conference call for approximately minutes and disconnected at.at,a call was placed from the telephone of gupta assistant renee gomes to the direct office line of rajaratnam gupta home office line was conferenced in to that call,and gomes line was disconnected.gupta home office telephone was connected to rajaratnam direct line for some minutes,until 
the next morning,october,in three transactions,rajaratnam sold a total of shares of goldman sachs stock.the first shares were sold at,one minute after the stock market opened the first opportunity to trade in goldman shares since the board meeting the previous day.another shares were sold at and the final shares were sold at goldman sachs losses were not announced to the public until december.based on the decline in goldman stock price after that announcement,the government introduced calculations showing that rajaratnam,by selling his shares on october,avoided a loss of more than million.
at on october,rajaratnam returned a call to david lau,a portfolio manager for galleon international,one of galleon hedge funds.lau had sought to reach rajaratnam for general investment advice.galleon international invested in securities primarily see tr,but not exclusively see id.at and it had in the past owned stock in goldman see gx.the conversation began with rajaratnam advising that,as a general matter,it would be safer to invest in united states companies than in emerging market countries raj 
rajaratnam hey david,you called 
david lau yeah,just to give me,give me a,find the pulse because we are quite shocked overseas and uh long bonds,i mean quite shocked in relative for the var because var broke out,blew out and our positions are the same so i just want to find out what you guys are thinking.
raj rajaratnam yeah,i mean,i think,ah we think that the is um relatively the safe haven,right.
david lau um.
raj rajaratnam because all of these um emerging market ah countries,many of them have to reduce interest rates,which is bad for their currencies,right.
david lau um um um.
raj rajaratnam and,i mean today for example there is a reasonable calmness in the market you know the market is only down or,right.
david lau yeah,that why i surprised.i thought it would go nuts.
raj rajaratnam yeah i mean our risk here is ah hedge fund redemption risk,right citadel i hear is in trouble,you know,and things like that but i think generally,not that i want to be long equities,but generally i think one trade in equities would be,you know,buy the spiders and short the eems or something,you know.
david lau hmm hmm.
raj rajaratnam but it looks like here the most cyclical companies the semi equipment companies,and the home builders are the ones that are leading the way out right.
david lau right.
gx t rajaratnam lau call,at emphasis added.
rajaratnam then proceeded to describe to lau the confidential negative information he had received the previous day from somebody who on the board of goldman sachs,which they do report until december.gx t,at.rajaratnam noted the current optimistic view of wall street analysts of goldman sachs likely profits,and he described the potential for selling the stock short 
raj rajaratnam um,now i,i heard yesterday from somebody who on the board of goldman sachs,that they are gon na lose per share.the street has them making.
david lau really 
raj rajaratnam you know.yeah.now i can get that number,you know,one,they do report until december,they,i think their quarter ends in november,but ui,unintelligible one more,but you know they have these huge marks in icbc and all of that stuff right.that uh is getting absolutely clobbered.you know.
david lau right.
raj rajaratnam so what he was telling me was that uh,goldman,the quarter pretty bad.they have zero revenues because their trading revenues are offset by asset losses,and to date they have lost per share,they just announced a cut and uh you know,the basic business is ok but uh you know this is uh tough for them.i do think that built into goldman sachs stock price.so if it gets to,i gon na,it now,it was at.i was looking for,i gon na whack it you know.
david lau laughs okay.okay.okay ui 
raj rajaratnam okay,i do think it makes sense to take longer term views right now 
gx t,at emphases added.
the relationship between gupta and rajaratnam 
the government also presented evidence that gupta and rajaratnam had a close relationship.gupta described rajaratnam as a close friend gx indeed,a very close friend gx and was in frequent communication with him.rajaratnam address book noted gupta as a good friend.tr.rajaratnam had instructed eisenberg that there were only five people she was authorized to connect with him near the end of the trading day gupta was one of them.see id.at,see also id.at during the two years when eisenberg was rajaratnam assistant,the list was expanded to about names.
gupta and rajaratnam were also involved in several business ventures together.in,they,along with a third partner,formed voyager capital partners voyager,an investment fund capitalized with million,million of which was contributed by gupta and million by rajaratnam gupta later borrowed million from rajaratnam in order to buy out the third partner share see tr,giving gupta a million stake in voyager.other collaborations were discussed in a july,call from gupta to rajaratnam see gx t gupta rajaratnam call the only call between these two that was captured in the wiretaps.in,gupta,rajaratnam,and two others launched another investment fund,new silk route,in which rajaratnam invested million see id.at gupta was the chairman see gx.gupta was also heavily involved in galleon itself.he had invested several million dollars in galleon funds he was involved in the planning of a new galleon fund called galleon global which ultimately was not created he had a keycard allowing him access to galleon new york offices and he regularly worked on galleon behalf in seeking potential investors see gx t,at.in early,gupta was made chairman of galleon international,which,as of april,managed assets totaling some billion and could earn performance fees tr.gupta was given a percent ownership stake.see,gx t,at id.at gupta you given me a position in galleon international.
in the july gupta rajaratnam call,rajaratnam asked gupta about a rumor that goldman sachs might seek to buy a commercial bank.gupta responded that there had been a big discussion of that possibility,in particular with respect to wachovia,as well as of the possibility of buying an insurance company,in particular aig.gx t,at.gupta said the goldman board was divided and that such purchases were unlikely to be imminent,but that if certain banks were a good deal it quite conceivable they come and say let go buy one.id.at.the board discussions were confidential.see,tr.even the matter of whether or not a subject had been discussed at a goldman board meeting was confidential.see,id.at.
b.the defense case 
gupta called several witnesses in his defense.most were character witnesses who testified that they believed gupta to be an honest person gupta also sought to have them testify that he had integrity and thus would not have been inclined to share inside information with rajaratnam.gupta daughter geetanjali gupta geetanjali testified about certain conversations gupta had with her about rajaratnam,and sought to indicate that gupta would not have been inclined to share inside information with rajaratnam because gupta believed rajaratnam had cheated him out of money with respect to the voyager investment.gupta also sought to introduce documentary evidence suggesting that a different goldman sachs insider was giving rajaratnam confidential information about goldman sachs,and that gupta contemplated leaving a substantial portion of his wealth to charity.as discussed in greater detail in part.below,the trial judge imposed limitations with respect to each category of gupta proposed evidence.
c.the verdict 
the jury found gupta guilty on four of the six counts against him count one,conspiracy to commit securities fraud in violation of,and three substantive counts of securities fraud in violation of b and the substantive securities fraud convictions were on count three,based on rosenbach purchase of shares of goldman sachs stock for rajaratnam on september,count four,based on muniyappa purchase of shares of goldman sachs stock for rajaratnam on september,and count five,based on rajaratnam sale of shares of goldman sachs stock on october.
gupta was sentenced principally to months imprisonment and ordered to pay a million fine.this court granted his motion for bail pending appeal.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,gupta argues principally that rajaratnam wiretapped conversations with horowitz and lau were inadmissible hearsay that the trial court erred in curtailing evidence proffered by gupta in his defense and that the errors,either singly or in combination,entitle him to a new trial.for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
a.the wiretap evidence 
preliminarily,we note that gupta brief on appeal challenged the admission of any wiretapped conversations,including the conversation between rajaratnam and gupta himself,on the ground that the wiretap authorizations were obtained in violation of title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of,see,and the fourth amendment to the constitution.rajaratnam,who was prosecuted and convicted on multiple counts of securities fraud and conspiracy,had raised such challenges in his case and gupta brief on appeal stated that gupta was raising the same issues as rajaratnam and was adopting the challenges made in rajaratnam appeal.rajaratnam challenges were rejected in united states rajaratnam,at.gupta title iii and constitutional challenges are thus foreclosed.
with respect to rajaratnam statements in his two conversations with horowitz and in his conversation with lau,gupta also objected to their admission on the ground that they were hearsay.the government contended that rajaratnam statements either were nonhearsay because they were statements in furtherance of a conspiracy of which rajaratnam and gupta were members,see.d e,or were hearsay statements within the exception for declarations against penal interest see.b,or within the residual hearsay exception,see.
the district court found that the government had sufficiently established the existence of a conspiracy among gupta,rajaratnam,and others see tr,and that rajaratnam statements in each of the three conversations were in furtherance of the conspiracy.the court thus ruled that all three conversations were admissible under rule d e.see tr,see also hearing transcript,may,hearing tr,at.
the district court rejected outright the government contention that rajaratnam statements were admissible under the residual hearsay exception.and the court stated that it was dubious as to whether the statements could be admitted as statements against penal interest but that it need not resolve that issue in light of its ruling that they were admissible as nonhearsay statements in furtherance of a conspiracy of which rajaratnam and gupta were members.hearing tr.
gupta challenges the rulings that rajaratnam statements to lau and horowitz were in furtherance of a conspiracy of which gupta was a member.he contends that lau was not alleged to be a coconspirator and that rajaratnam statements to horowitz were in furtherance only of a separate conspiracy between rajaratnam and shaulov.the government defends the court admission of the rajaratnam statements as coconspirator statements in furtherance of a conspiracy of which rajaratnam and gupta were not the only members in addition,it argues that rajaratnam statements could properly have been admitted as statements against his penal interest.we conclude that,under rules and of the federal rules of evidence,rajaratnam statements in all three conversations were admissible both as nonhearsay statements in furtherance of the rajaratnam gupta conspiracy and under the exception for statements against penal interest.we address these issues separately with respect to the statements to horowitz and those to lau.
statements in furtherance of a conspiracy 
under rule d,an statement offered for the truth of its contents is not hearsay if t he statement is offered against an opposing party and it was made by the party coconspirator during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.d e.thus,i n order to admit a statement under this rule,the court must find a that there was a conspiracy,b that its members included the declarant and the party against whom the statement is offered,and c that the statement was made during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy.united states maldonado rivera,cir,cert.denied.in determining the existence and membership of the alleged conspiracy,the court must consider the circumstances surrounding the statement,as well as the contents of the alleged coconspirator statement itself.see.d see also bourjaily united states.
to be in furtherance of the conspiracy,a statement must be more than a merely narrative description by one of the acts of another.united states skw metals alloys,cir skw metals quoting united states beech nut nutrition,cir.beech nut,cert.denied.
while idle chatter between does not further a conspiracy,see united states paone,cir.cert.denied,d,we have recognized that s tatements between conspirators which provide reassurance,serve to maintain trust and cohesiveness among them,or inform each other of the current status of the conspiracy,further the ends of a conspiracy.

a finding as to whether or not a proffered statement was made in furtherance of the conspiracy should be supported by a preponderance of the evidence,and such a finding will not be overturned on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous.united states thai,cir,cert.denied,see,united states james,cir,petition for cert.filed.where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.beech nut,at quoting anderson bessemer city.the court ultimate decision to admit or exclude a proffered statement is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see,united states persico,cir,cert.denied.skw metals,at.
rajaratnam statements to horowitz 
we see no error or abuse of discretion in the district court admission of the statements by rajaratnam in his two telephone conversations with horowitz.although gupta insists that rajaratnam had a separate conspiracy with shaulov gupta brief on appeal at,that rajaratnam statements to horowitz were focus ed on placating shaulov id.at,and that rajaratnam conversation with horowitz was not in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy id.at see id.at placating shaulov had nothing to do with furthering the alleged conspiracy between rajaratnam and gupta,that argument suffers from multiple flaws.first,the indictment did not allege a conspiracy only between rajaratnam and gupta it alleged that the conspiracy also encompassed other coconspirators at galleon indictment c,d.second,so long as a coconspirator statement was in furtherance of the conspiracy,there is no requirement that it have been in furtherance of the interests of the defendant himself or of any particular coconspirator.third,there was ample evidence that the conspiracy of which gupta and rajaratnam were members included horowitz,rosenbach,and shaulov.
for example,after receiving the september call at from gupta,rajaratnam had a conversation with rosenbach rosenbach immediately began buying goldman sachs stock and shares of an index fund that included goldman stock rosenbach made those purchases not only for rajaratnam portfolio but for his own portfolio as well and after the market closed,rosenbach returned to rajaratnam office for another conversation see tr.that evening,when shaulov bitterly complained that he had not been given a heads up on the buffett investment,he complained to rosenbach.id.at.the next morning,rosenbach sent rajaratnam an email stating i spoke to leon and believe i diffused sic him.gx.rajaratnam,in his conversations with horowitz that morning,explained why he had not immediately informed horowitz and shaulov upon receipt of the september goldman sachs information.in his first call,rajaratnam pointed out that horowitz,who was the head of the galleon trading desk and the trader principally responsible for executing trades for rajaratnam see tr,had not been in the office when the call came in.the district court found that this conversation was in furtherance of the conspiracy of which gupta was a member because rajaratnam needed to explain to horowitz,his trader,why the purchases of goldman stock were made see hearing tr.and the court found that the ensuing conversation between rajaratnam and horowitz reeks of knowledge,intent,and the need of rajaratnam to explain to his lieutenant why in his absence the significant trade occurred id.at.in that second conversation,rajaratnam told horowitz that shaulov was upset but should not have been because the call about goldman sachs came in late,at had it come in at one,rajaratnam would have informed shaulov because he always relayed everything to shaulov.gx t,at.
thus,there was ample evidence to support findings that the members of the conspiracy in which gupta passed confidential goldman sachs information to rajaratnam included not only gupta and rajaratnam but also rosenbach,horowitz,and shaulov,and that rajaratnam statements and explanations to horowitz served to further the conspiracy by informing horowitz,and eventually shaulov,of the status of that conspiracy,reassuring them of its continuity,and preserving trust and cohesiveness among the coconspirators.rajaratnam statements in his telephone calls to horowitz were properly admitted under rule d e.
rajaratnam statements to lau 
although the government concedes that lau was not a member of the alleged conspiracy,the district court admitted under rule d e rajaratnam statements to lau as well.while that rule requires that both the declarant and the party against whom the statement is offered be members of the conspiracy,there is no requirement that the person to whom the statement is made also be a member.in re terrorist bombings of embassies in east africa,cir terrorist bombings quoting beech nut,at emphasis ours,cert.denied.statements designed to induce the listener assistance with respect to the conspiracy goals satisfy the rule requirement.see,terrorist bombings,at beech nut,at coconspirator statements may be found to be in furtherance of the conspiracy within the meaning of rule d e if they prompt the listener to respond in a way that facilitates the carrying out of criminal activity.quoting united states rahme,at.
applying these principles,we conclude that there was no clear error in the district court finding that rajaratnam statements to lau were in furtherance of a conspiracy of which gupta and rajaratnam were members.lau was a portfolio manager for galleon international,seeking to make profitable investment decisions for his portfolio.the rajaratnam lau call resulted from lau solicitation of rajaratnam view of the pulse of the market.gx t,at.the conversation took place on october,shortly after rajaratnam had sold his goldman sachs stock in the wake of gupta call to rajaratnam,a call placed one minute after the end of the goldman sachs board of directors conference call in which gupta learned that goldman in december would report a quarterly loss.rajaratnam responded to lau request for guidance on the market by advising that the is relatively the safe haven and providing his opinion with respect to specific sectors id.at but rajaratnam went on to say that he had nonpublic information that,contrary to the prevailing view of market analysts,goldman current quarter would not be profitable see id.at i heard yesterday from somebody who on the board of goldman sachs,that they are gon na lose per share.the street has them making.rajaratnam noted that goldman would not report its quarterly results until december stated that if the stock price reached a certain level,he would sell short see id.whack it and concluded,i do think it makes sense to take longer term views right now id.
we see no error in the district court finding that rajaratnam statements to lau,an important colleague and subordinate who had the ability to execute further trades in galleon international hearing tr,were in furtherance of the conspiracy of which rajaratnam and gupta were members.although gupta argues that in connection with these statements the government was required to pro ve not merely that lau was theoretically capable of trading in goldman sachs stock but that rajaratnam purpose was to induce lau to trade gupta brief on appeal at emphasis omitted,this argument ignores the allegation and the proof that one of the goals of the conspiracy was to use inside information to avoid losses a goal clearly pursued by rajaratnam in dumping his goldman sachs shares as quickly as possible after learning that goldman would later publicly announce a quarterly loss.gupta had a percent ownership stake in galleon international,which was entitled to fees based on its performance.see tr.although galleon international invested principally in securities of states companies see id.at,it was not precluded from investing in domestic securities see id.at and,indeed,it had in the past owned stock in goldman see gx.in light of this evidence,rajaratnam statements to lau could have prompted lau not to purchase goldman shares for galleon international in october.this supports the district court conclusion that such statements were in furtherance of the conspiracy of which gupta was a member.
although gupta argues that rajaratnam was simply bragging about his sources gupta brief on appeal at,this was at best an argument for the jury.further,to the extent that it could be permissible to view the conversation as gupta urges,that it was merely a casual conversation about past events,not one in which rajaratnam statements were in furtherance of the conspiracy gupta brief on appeal at citing united states.lieberman,cir,the standard for reversal has not been met.to the extent that there may be more than one permissible view as to rajaratnam purpose in making the october,statements to lau,the district court determination that the statements about goldman shares were made in furtherance of the conspiracy was a choice between or among permissible inferences and hence can not be deemed clearly erroneous,see anderson,at.gupta contentions provide no basis for overturning the district court finding that rajaratnam statements to lau were in furtherance of the,conspiracy of which gupta was a member and by which gupta sought to profit,and thus were admissible.
statements against penal interest 
rule b allows the admission of statements against a declarant proprietary,pecuniary,or penal interest if the declarant is unavailable as a witness.a statement is against such an interest if it is a statement that 
a a reasonable person in the declarant position would have made only if the person believed it to be true because,when made,it was so contrary to the declarant proprietary or pecuniary interest or had so great a tendency to invalidate the declarant claim against someone else or to expose the declarant to civil or criminal liability and 
b is supported by corroborating circumstances that clearly indicate its trustworthiness,if it is offered in a criminal case as one that tends to expose the declarant to criminal liability.
b emphases added.this rule is founded on the commonsense notion that reasonable people,even reasonable people who are not especially honest,tend not to make statements unless they believe them to be true.williamson united states.
in assessing whether a statement is against penal interest within the meaning of rule b,the district court must first ask whether a reasonable person in the declarant shoes would perceive the statement as detrimental to his or her own penal interest,united states saget,cir saget,cert.denied,a question that can be answered only in light of all the surrounding circumstances,williamson,at see also saget,at an adequately particularized analysis is required.the proffered statement need not have been sufficient,standing alone,to convict the declarant of any crime,so long as it would have been probative in a criminal case against him.united states persico,at.
if the court finds that the statement is against the declarant penal interest,the court must then determine whether there are corroborating circumstances indicating both the declarant trustworthiness and the truth of the statement.united states.lumpkin,cir.further,the inference of trustworthiness from the proffered corroborating circumstances must be strong,not merely allowable.united states salvador,cir,cert.denied.in the context of assessing whether a statement against penal interest was sufficiently reliable to satisfy the confrontation clause of the constitution,we have noted that 
a statement incriminating both the declarant and the defendant may possess adequate reliability if the statement was made to a person whom the declarant believes is an ally,and the circumstances indicate that those portions of the statement that inculpate the defendant are no less reliable than the parts of the statement.

rajaratnam self incriminating statements to horowitz 
even if rajaratnam statements in his conversations with horowitz on the morning after his september purchases of goldman sachs stock were not in furtherance of the rajaratnam gupta conspiracy,the pertinent statements were contrary to rajaratnam penal interest and therefore could properly have been admitted pursuant to rule b.in the first rajaratnam horowitz call,rajaratnam said,i got a call at s aying something good might happen to goldman s o,i told ananth to buy some and i went to gary and said just buy me gx t,at.in the second rajaratnam horowitz call,rajaratnam statements included the following 
i got a call,right,saying something good gon na happen.
i asked ananth to buy some.
then i went to gary 
yeah at,i ca,i ca yell out in the fucking halls.
leon was very upset.you know,fuck him,look,i kept my mouth shut when he gave me wamu 
i f it was,one,i always am good with him,i always call him in,i tell him everything,you know amd,ibm,everything 
the corroborating evidence included proof that rajaratnam did receive a call minutes before the close of trading on september that the call was from gupta,who had said it was urgent that gupta was a goldman sachs board member who had just received confidential goldman information and that something quite good for goldman did in fact happen and was announced after the close of trading that very day.and rajaratnam reference to having shared information with respect to amd provided additional corroboration of rajaratnam knowing wrongdoing,as anil kumar who was on rajaratnam list of five people to whom he would speak near the close of trading see tr,testified at trial that he had pled guilty to one count of securities fraud for giving insider information to rajaratnam about a company called ati and amd acquisition of it in id.at.thus,it would have been well within the bounds of discretion for the district court to conclude that the statements by rajaratnam were contrary to his penal interest because they exposed him to criminal liability for trading on the basis of inside information,and that they were sufficiently reliable to be admitted in evidence under rule b.
rajaratnam self incriminating statements to lau 
we reach the same conclusion with respect to rajaratnam statements about his inside information on goldman sachs to lau.in his conversation with lau,rajaratnam statements included the following 
i heard yesterday from somebody who on the board of goldman sachs,that they are gon na lose per share.the street has them making.
t hey do report until december 
so what he was telling me was that uh,goldman,the quarter pretty bad i do think that built into goldman sachs stock price.so if it gets to,i gon na,it now,it was at.i was looking for,i gon na whack it you know.
given that this conversation occurred on october,less than two hours after rajaratnam unloaded his goldman sachs stock beginning one minute after the market opened rajaratnam statement that he had heard yesterday from a goldman board member that goldman would lose money and would not report its losses until december clearly exposed him to criminal liability for trading on inside information.moreover,rajaratnam statement that if the stock reached a certain level he planned to sell it short was an admission of a plan to engage in additional unlawful insider trading in the future.
although gupta argues that these statements were not sufficiently reliable to satisfy the exception,we disagree.the evidence as to the timing of the goldman sachs board conference call on october,which ended at and was followed by a call from goldman board member gupta to rajaratnam,coupled with rajaratnam commencing to dump his goldman stock one minute after the market opened the next morning,provided ample corroboration for the october statement that rajaratnam had received information yesterday of goldman per share losses from somebody who on the board of goldman sachs.
again,gupta argues that rajaratnam was merely attempting to impress lau.that was a contention that could be argued to the jury but as reasonable people,even reasonable people who are not especially honest,tend not to make statements unless they believe them to be true,williamson,at,it would have been within the district court discretion to find that rajaratnam,as founder and head of galleon,would have had no need to attempt to impress his subordinates and that he would not have made these statements without a foundation of truth.
limitations on gupta defense evidence 
gupta also contends that he is entitled to a new trial on the ground that the district court unduly limited evidence proffered by the defense to show that any communication by gupta of inside information to rajaratnam in the fall of was improbable.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that none of the challenged rulings constituted an abuse of the court discretion and that a new trial is unwarranted.
testimony by gupta daughter 
the linchpin of the defense gupta brief on appeal at was the proposition that in,gupta was angry with rajaratnam for having withdrawn million from the voyager fund in which gupta had invested million and rajaratnam had invested million without informing gupta of the withdrawal and without alerting gupta to withdraw some of his own capital so angry that gupta would not have shared inside information about goldman sachs with rajaratnam.to establish gupta state of mind and to suggest that his september and october calls to rajaratnam were merely efforts to obtain information about voyager the defense proffered testimony from gupta daughter geetanjali that on september gupta was angry with rajaratnam,believing that rajaratnam had cheated him.gupta argues that 
s pecifically,geetanjali would have testified 
he told me that he was upset about voyager.he told me that he was worried about the performance of the fund and that he was frustrated that he could get information from raj about it.
he also told me he was angry that raj had taken money out of the fund without telling him and that he thought that that he did understand why he had taken the money out of the fund,and why if he had taken money out of the fund,he had not gotten any of it.
gupta brief on appeal at quoting tr.geetanjali statement in response to questioning by the court outside the presence of the jury emphases in brief.
the government objected that this testimony would be hearsay gupta argued that it was admissible under rule state of mind exception to the hearsay rule.after exploring geetanjali proposed testimony in the absence of the jury and hearing arguments from both sides see tr,the district court ruled that geetanjali could testify to gupta attitude towards rajaratnam with respect to voyager,at a given point or maybe two or three points in time,but that geetanjali could not testify to the substantive details of what gupta said,that gupta stated that he believed rajaratnam had cheated him id.at see id.at.
accordingly,geetanjali testified that on september,she had a conversation with her father relating to an investment that he had with rajaratnam called voyager id.at and in that conversation gupta expressed significant concern about his investment in voyager id.at.geetanjali continued as follows 
the court and in relating this to you,what was his demeanor 
the witness he was upset.he was stressed.he was running his hands through his hair,which he often does when he stressed.he was walking about.he was quite upset.he normally a very calm and collected person.
the court was it your understanding,if you had one,that this was because of how the investment was doing or because of how rajaratnam was treating the investment or what 
the witness it was more because of how rajaratnam was treating the investment.my father had been very upset that 
the court no.you answered the question.
tr.geetanjali also testified that gupta was frustrated by the difficulty he was having in getting information from rajaratnam about voyager.see id.at see also id.at testifying that at thanksgiving gupta was still upset at rajaratnam about the voyager investment.the court instructed the jury that geetanjali testimony was to be considered only on the issue of what bearing it has,if at all,on gupta attitude toward rajaratnam during the period of time in question id.at,and that the limited purpose for which geetanjali testimony was admitted was not for whatever may or may not have been going on at voyager,but only for what gupta state of mind was with respect to rajaratnam at this particular time id.at.
gupta contends that the district court erred in preventing geetanjali from testifying that gupta believed rajaratnam had cheated him,because 
gupta did not seek to introduce geetanjali testimony to prove that rajaratnam had in fact stolen from him a point that was undisputed anyway rather,he wanted to show that he believed rajaratnam had stolen from him at a particular point in time.
gupta brief on appeal at emphasis in original see id.at gupta sought to establish that he believed at the time that rajaratnam was defrauding him emphasis in original.gupta argues that rule provides an exception to the hearsay rule for a declarant state of mind and that geetanjali testimony that on september,gupta told her he was angry that raj had taken money out of the fund without telling him tr.was classically admissible evidence establishing gupta state of mind,and directly relevant to his motive for calling rajaratnam.gupta brief on appeal at emphasis added see id.at his statement was admissible as evidence of his belief that rajaratnam was defrauding him emphasis added.
we disagree with the thrust of gupta arguments,as we think it clear from the record that the court limitation on geetanjali testimony was not based on a view that the testimony was being offered for its truth but rather was based on its view that the jury would likely be unable to comprehend that the statement could be considered only to show gupta belief and not to show the truth of what he believed.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the limitation imposed was within the court discretion,and that,in any event,if it was error to have thus limited geetanjali testimony,the error was harmless.
a.the exercise of discretion under rule 
generally,a statement made by a person while not testifying at the current trial,offered by that person to prove the truth of the matter asserted in his statement,is hearsay.see.a c.hearsay generally is inadmissible if it does not fall within an exception provided by rule or.see.rule provides an exception for a statement of the declarant state of mind such as motive,intent,or plan or emotional,sensory,or physical condition such as mental feeling,pain,or bodily health,but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed.emphasis added.
however,the fact that a statement falls within an exception to the hearsay rule does not mean that the statement is not to be classified as hearsay nor does it mean that the statement is automatically admissible.it means simply that the statement assuming that the criteria specified in the exception are met is not excluded by the rule against hearsay,b emphasis added see,li canarozzi,cir.the court retains its normal discretion to exclude the evidence on other grounds such as lack of relevance,see,improper purpose,see,or undue prejudice,see.li canarozzi,at united states detrich,cir for admissibility,it is not sufficient that a proffered statement is not hearsay to be admissible it must also be relevant.
under rule,even if proffered evidence is relevant,it may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following unfair prejudice,confusing the issues,misleading the jury,undue delay,wasting time,or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.rule see,huddleston united states,united states reifler,cir united states salameh,cir salameh,cert.denied.
in reviewing rule challenges,we accord great deference to the district court assessment of the relevancy and unfair prejudice of proffered evidence,mindful that it sees the witnesses,the parties,the jurors,and the attorneys,and is thus in a superior position to evaluate the likely impact of the evidence.
united states quinones,cir quoting united states paulino,cir,cert denied,cert denied.a district judge ruling following a rule analysis is reversible error only when it is a clear abuse of discretion.salameh,at.to find such abuse,we must conclude that the challenged evidentiary rulings were arbitrary and irrational.united states quinones,at internal quotation marks omitted see,united states scott,cir salameh,at.
we see no arbitrariness or irrationality in the present case.in limiting geetanjali testimony,the trial court made a rule assessment that the admission of testimony that gupta believed rajaratnam had cheated him which the court observed would be cumulative,given that the court had as discussed in part.below admitted other evidence to the same effect tr.would be unduly prejudicial.noting that,unlike the other witnesses whose similar testimony had been admitted,geetanjali had no personal knowledge about voyager,the court reasoned the jury would have undue difficulty in distinguishing between the aspect of geetanjali testimony that could be considered for its truth as to gupta state of mind and the aspect that indicated that gupta had been cheated.when gupta counsel argued that the defense would be prejudiced if it could not have geetanjali testify that gupta thought rajaratnam had cheated him,the court responded,
i think the prejudice is the other way.
the jury is going to,i think,draw from this,because the government ca the witness in any meaningful way,that rajaratnam,in fact,cheated gupta,that gupta knew it and that gupta,therefore,was completely outraged and,hence,it carries a danger here that no other witness carries for the reasons that i already elaborated on the record.
tr.emphasis added see,id.at t here is no way the jury can make th e distinction between the belief and the substance of what was said to have been believed.they are going to inevitably think if they accept this testimony at all that he is telling the truth to his own daughter,and they will be taking it for its truth,and i do see how under that gross violation of the hearsay rule can be avoided.emphases added.thus,the court limited geetanjali testimony not on the ground that it was offered to prove that rajaratnam had in fact cheated gupta but rather because the court view was that,if admitted,the jury would likely be unable to comprehend that it was not admitted for that purpose.we see no basis for the district court view as to the likely effect on the jury.although it would have been within the court discretion to admit the proposed geetanjali testimony along with a clear and detailed limiting instruction to the jury if it believed such an instruction would be effective,we see no abuse of discretion in the court decision to limit the testimony in light of its conclusion that there was no way such an instruction in this case would be effective.
we note that although gupta perhaps would have us classify the court ruling as arbitrary on the ground that geetanjali was not allowed to state that gupta was angry gupta brief on appeal at,the record does not support that contention.the court ruled that she would be allowed to testify to gupta attitude toward rajaratnam the record does not indicate that the court placed any restriction on the words she could use to describe his attitude.geetanjali described gupta as quite upset tr.and frustrated id.at by his inability to get information from rajaratnam about voyager descriptions likely sufficient to imply anger and there was no ruling barring her from expressly describing him as angry.
gupta additional contention that the limitation on geetanjali testimony made it seem only that gupta was upset in september about the performance of the voyager investment gupta brief on appeal at emphasis in original is belied by the testimony itself.the court asked whether gupta was upset because of how the investment was doing or because of how rajaratnam was treating the investment or what geetanjali responded it was more because of how rajaratnam was treating the investment.tr.
finally,gupta suggests that allowing geetanjali to testify that gupta believed rajaratnam had cheated him by taking money out of voyager without alerting gupta also to withdraw some of his capital from that venture would have been no more prejudicial than similar evidence that the court had previously admitted,because the excluded statement did no more than confirm undisputed facts gupta reply brief on appeal at.but this very argument substantiates the district court view that this aspect of the geetanjali testimony,with its potential for the jury to infer that gupta had in fact been cheated,would have been cumulative.we can not conclude that the court abused its discretion in viewing the potential for jury confusion and undue prejudice as substantially outweighing the cumulative evidence probative value.
harmless error 
the fact that the excluded statement did no more than confirm undisputed facts gupta reply brief on appeal at also contributes to our conclusion that,if the limitation on geetanjali testimony was error,the error was harmless.a party may gain relief for an error in a ruling to admit or exclude evidence only if,inter alia,the error affect ed a substantial right of the party.a see.a any error that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.thus,u nder harmless error review,we ask whether we can conclude with fair assurance that the errors did not substantially influence the jury.united states oluwanisola,cir oluwanisola internal quotation marks omitted see,kotteakos united states.if defense evidence has been improperly excluded by the trial court,we normally consider such factors as 
the importance of unrebutted assertions to the government case whether the excluded material was cumulative the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the government case on the factual questions at issue the extent to which the defendant was otherwise permitted to advance the defense and the overall strength of the prosecution case.
oluwanisola,at see also united states miller,cir focusing principally on the overall strength of the prosecution case,cert.denied.united states song,cir focusing principally on the extent to which the defendant was otherwise able to present the defense and on the presence of evidence corroborating the government case united states lawal,cir focusing principally on the overall strength of the prosecution case and on the cumulative nature and marginal probative value of the excluded evidence.
all five of the factors set out in oluwanisola lead us to conclude that,if there was error,it was harmless.first,as to the assertions in the government case that gupta sought to rebut,he pointed to testimony by kumar suggesting that gupta did not learn of rajaratnam withdrawal of capital from voyager until see tr.gupta argued that the singular importance of the proposed evidence as to his conversation with geetanjali was its timing,that gupta told her he was upset with rajaratnam on september several days prior to his september call to rajaratnam upon learning of the imminent buffett investment rather than not becoming upset until.see,id.at your honor,this proof is pretty critical and crucial because they put kumar on there to try and move the date to fit their theory.see also gupta brief on appeal at.thus,geetanjali statement that gupta told her he was angry that rajaratnam had impermissibly and covertly redeemed money from the voyager fund was offered to prove when gupta formed his belief about the redemptions.gupta reply brief on appeal at emphasis in original.the importance of this timing question can not be overstated.id.at.
but the court placed no restriction at all on the defense ability to bring out the timing of gupta conversation with geetanjali.geetanjali testified amply that the conversation occurred on september.she testified that she remembered the date because,inter alia,it was her birthday,and it occurred on a trip to connecticut to celebrate both her birthday and her mother birthday which was the next day.see tr.further,after geetanjali proceeded to describe gupta being upset with rajaratnam on account of rajaratnam treatment of the voyager investment,the court highlighted the fact that that testimony was relevant to the time of gupta anger at rajaratnam it instructed the jury that geetanjali testimony was to be considered only on the issue of what bearing it has,if at all,on gupta attitude toward rajaratnam during the period of time in question id.emphasis added,and that the limited purpose for which geetanjali testimony was admitted was not for whatever may or may not have been going on at voyager,but only for what gupta state of mind was with respect to rajaratnam at this particular time id.at emphasis added.the government assertions as to the timing of gupta animus toward rajaratnam thus did not go unnoticed or unchallenged.
second,the testimony that the basis for gupta attitude toward rajaratnam was that rajaratnam had made a concealed withdrawal from voyager was plainly cumulative.the government had introduced the testimony of kumar that gupta told him that gupta had discovered that rajaratnam had withdrawn some of rajaratnam capital from voyager,and that gupta said that this was just plain wrong and wanted to sue rajaratnam tr.in addition,gupta had introduced the deposition testimony of ajit jain that gupta had told him that he had million invested with raj in some venture and he had been gipped sic,swindled or cheated by raj and he had lost his entire million that he had invested with rajaratnam.jain deposition at see tr.
as to the third oluwanisola factor,the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the government case on the factual question at issue,at emphasis added,which was the timing of gupta anger at rajaratnam,plainly geetanjali testimony contradicted the government theory that gupta was not angry about rajaratnam treatment of voyager until early.but there was also evidence corroborating the government contention that gupta was on friendly terms with rajaratnam through the fall of.the government introduced a voice mail message from gupta to rajaratnam on october,well after the september conversation with geetanjali,saying hey raj,rajat here.just,uh,calling to catch up.i know it must be an awful and busy week.i hope you are holding up well.uh,and i,uh,try to give you a call over the weekend to just catch up.uh,all the best to you,talk to you soon.gx t see also gx mck a january email from gupta to rajaratnam wishing him a happy new year and a restful week,forwarding information about a possible galleon hiree,and concluding let catch up soon.
fourth,the record easily establishes that gupta was able,based on the evidence that was introduced,to advance his defense.the explicit testimony of kumar and jain that gupta believed rajaratnam had cheated him,along with documentary evidence that rajaratnam had in fact withdrawn million from voyager and a conversation in which rajaratnam stated he had not told gupta about the withdrawal,were highlights of gupta summation to the jury,cited by his counsel gary naftalis as among gupta badges of innocence tr.see id.at.
a second badge of innocence is rajaratnam defrauding of gupta about the voyager investment remember gupta invested million in this voyager investment,and ultimately and it kind of undisputed he lost all of his million we have heard testimony from a variety of sources about how gupta was very upset about how he was treated with that investment not only losing the money,but the conduct that he came to learn about which rajaratnam engaged in which consisted of not giving him information.
id.at emphasis added.naftalis argued 
kumar testimony is supportive of the fact that we were swindled,gupta was swindled by rajaratnam in his voyager investment.if you remember,gupta made this investment,put a lot of money,million in voyager,and it turned out that he lost every dime in that investment,every dime.he lost million,and we also established,if you recall,that there was a schedule 
this is what government exhibit shows,unbeknownst to rajat gupta,behind the back of rajat gupta,concealed from rajat gupta,that raj rajaratnam put his hands into the cookie jar and took million out 
y esterday we put in evidence,an october tape,wiretap conversation that the government captured of rajaratnam speaking on october with one of his colleagues,santhanam,and in this conversation rajaratnam admitted that he never told rajat gupta he had taken the equity out.
tr.emphases added.
naftalis continued can you stop the tape for a second there go back to i told him i did take the equity out.
i did tell him,i did tell rajat gupta that i took the equity out.i did tell him i took the million out.
you recall that kumar told us in october he had conversations,he is one of the many witnesses who testified on this subject about how rajat gupta was very upset because he had lost his money and indeed came to learn that he had been swindled by rajaratnam who took the money out,concealed it from him.
tr.emphases added see also id.at as we know,because we just played it a few minutes ago,we know that rajaratnam had taken million out of the fund and concealed it from gupta.counsel also cited the deposition of jain 
he told us,jain,he testified by videotape,that on january,he had lunch with gupta,and gupta told him that he had million invested with rajaratnam,and he had been gypped,swindled and mistreated by raj and lost his entire million.
id.at emphasis added.
counsel also emphasized that we learned that gupta was very upset about how he had been treated by rajaratnam with respect to voyager as early as september.tr.he argued that geetanjali told you that on the she had the conversation with her father in which gupta showed he was quite upset,and counsel pointed out,inter alia,that that is a date that stuck in geetanjali mind because she was celebrating on september,her birthday and her mother birthday was on the of september.id.
in sum,the evidence from a variety of sources,as defense counsel said id.at,including an exhibit,a wiretapped conversation,and testimony from three witnesses,was clearly sufficient to enable gupta to present his main defense.
finally,the government circumstantial evidence that gupta in fact passed confidential information to rajaratnam on september and october was strong.the timing of gupta calls to rajaratnam each placed approximately one minute after gupta received extraordinary news about goldman sachs finances and the timing and nature of rajaratnam large trades in goldman sachs stock,purchases within minutes of the first such call in the wake of gupta receipt of favorable information,and sales a month later within the first possible minute of trading after the call following gupta receipt of unfavorable information,were powerful evidence that rajaratnam was given the confidential information by gupta.and that evidence was supported by rajaratnam statements,in the wake of those trades,to horowitz and lau.
we see no basis for a conclusion that,if geetanjali had been allowed to testify that gupta believed rajaratnam actions with respect to voyager had cheated him rather than to testify as she was allowed to that gupta was quite upset over rajaratnam treatment of the voyager investment that testimony would have had any substantial influence on the jury.if it was error for the court to limit geetanjali testimony as it did pursuant to rule,we conclude that the error was entirely harmless.
evidence to suggest an alternative tipper 
gupta second defense at trial was to suggest that rajaratnam had received the confidential goldman sachs information from a person other than gupta.gupta brief on appeal at.the person specified was david loeb,a goldman vice president who was one of the sales guys who would call rajaratnam a lot tr.gupta sought to make this showing by proffering two taped telephone conversations and several dozen emails between loeb and rajaratnam collectively the documents or loeb documents that gupta contended showed that loeb had obtained inside information about technology companies including intel corporation and apple and immediately attempted to reach rajaratnam to pass that information to him.see,id.at.
the district court refused to admit the loeb documents on ground
