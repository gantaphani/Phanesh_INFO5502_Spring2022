this case comes to us as an appeal from the dismissal of appellant alan jacoby putative class action lawsuit.in his second amended complaint,jacoby alleged relationserve media,and eleven of its directors and employees violated sections b and a of the securities exchange act of by failing to disclose,before the company went public,that in stock had been privately offered for sale by unregistered brokers in ten different states.in the district court,jacoby joined richard thompson,who had previously initiated this action.thompson represented a subclass seeking recovery premised on state law claims in the second amended complaint.after twice allowing the plaintiffs to amend their complaint,the district court dismissed with prejudice jacoby b and a claims pursuant to.b.the district court found the allegations of the second amended complaint failed to satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of the private securities litigation reform act pslra and rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the court then dismissed thompson state law claims without prejudice after concluding it no longer had supplemental jurisdiction over those claims.in separate orders,on three different occasions,the district court denied defendant danielle karp motions for attorneys fees and rule sanctions.
jacoby appeals the dismissal of his federal putative class action.additionally,karp the denial of her request for rule sanctions and attorneys fees because we conclude the second amended complaint fails to satisfy the standard for pleading scienter,we affirm the district court dismissal of jacoby b and a claims.with regard to sanctions,we remand to the district court to make findings in accordance with the pslra.
factual allegations 
on may,relationserve entered into an independent consulting agreement with summit financial partners,llc summit.under the agreement,summit sold shares of relationserve through a private offering to investors in exchange for shares of stock and a seller fee.
on june,relationserve filed a form quarterly statement,its first securities and exchange commission sec filing,indicating chubasco resources corporation chubasco had completed a reverse acquisition of relationserve.relationserve media.quarterly business form,at june,on june,relationserve filed a form and disclosed,for the first time,the independent consulting agreement with summit.relationserve media,current report form,at june,on june,twelve days after relationserve disclosed its relationship with summit,richard thompson,an indiana resident,purchased shares at per share.tony altavilla,a summit employee,had advised thompson about the private offering and helped facilitate thompson purchase of the shares.on june,relationserve became a company and reported to the sec it had received in subscriptions through a private offering that same day,relationserve listed its shares on the over the counter bulletin board.on july,july,and august,alan jacoby purchased a total of shares of relationserve on the open market.
on march,thompson filed a lawsuit in indiana state court against relationserve and several of the defendants named in this federal action.unrelated to this litigation,relationserve filed a registration statement with the sec on march.this statement did not mention the thompson litigation.on may,relationserve amended the registration statement to provide the public with notice of the lawsuit,and indicated it believed the suit lacked merit.in response to an inquiry from the sec requesting more details about the lawsuit,relationserve updated its filings on may,
on may,relationserve stock was valued at per share.three weeks later,on june,the stock was valued at per share.jacoby attributes this decline in value to the public disclosure of thompson lawsuit.
ii.proceedings in the district court 
on august,thompson initiated this action by filing a class action in the united states district court for the southern district of florida.relationserve and the other defendants moved to dismiss the complaint the district court then denied these motions and ordered that thompson file an amended complaint.on november,thompson filed the first amended complaint,which added jacoby as a.the defendants again moved to dismiss,and on march,the district court dismissed the amended complaint without prejudice.
on march,thompson and jacoby filed the second amended complaint,raising claims for two putative classes one,led by thompson,which included all purchasers of securities through unregistered of relationserve,and another,led by jacoby,which included all purchasers who bought relationserve stock on the open market prior to may.defendants then moved to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim,and this time the district court granted the motion with prejudice,concluding jacoby had failed to state a claim for a violation of either b or a of the securities act.the district court also dismissed without prejudice thompson state law claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
once before and twice after the district court dismissed the second amended complaint,defendant karp moved for rule sanctions and attorneys fees,contending the claims against her were frivolous and demonstrated an utter lack of legal or factual investigation.the district court denied the motions in three separate orders.this appeal and ensued.
iii.discussion 
our discussion is divided into three parts.first,we address whether the second amended complaint satisfies the standard for pleading scienter.second,we address whether the second amended complaint states a claim of secondary liability under a.third,we address the district court refusal to impose rule sanctions and award attorneys fees.
scienter pleading requirements 
we review the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under.b de novo.fin.sec.assurance,stephens,cir.
in count i,jacoby asserted a violation of b of the securities act and sec rule.section b of the securities act makes it unlawful to use or employ,in connection with the sale of any security any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance.b.pursuant to b,the sec promulgated rule,which makes it unlawful,among other things,to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.b.
to state a claim for a violation of b,a plaintiff must allege the existence of a material misrepresentation or omission,made with scienter,a wrongful state of mind,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,on which the plaintiff relied,and which was causally connected to the plaintiff economic loss.dura pharm.broudo,see also bryant avado brands,cir elaborating on the scienter requirement because rule sounds in fraud,the plaintiff must plead the elements of its violation with particularity.see mizzaro home depot,cir stating rule b requires securities fraud complaints to state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.
when a b claim is brought by a private litigant,it is subject to the pslra,under which a plaintiff must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b.in this context,a strong inference of scienter is one that is more than merely plausible or must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.tellabs,makor issues rights.three guidelines govern our review courts must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true,consider the complaint in its entirety and determine whether all of the facts alleged,taken collectively,give rise to a strong inference of scienter,and take into account plausible opposing inferences.tellabs,at.at see also rosenberg gould,cir.moreover,scienter must be found with respect to each defendant and with respect to each alleged violation of the statute.phillips,cir.
although the pslra imposes a heightened standard for pleading scienter,it does not alter the substantive intent requirements necessary to establish a b and rule violation.mizzaro,at.in this circuit,b and rule require a showing of either an intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud,or severe recklessness.id.quoting bryant,at.an allegation of severe recklessness must satisfy a demanding standard 
severe recklessness is limited to those highly unreasonable omissions or misrepresentations that involve not merely simple or even inexcusable negligence,but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,and that present a danger of misleading buyers or sellers which is either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.
bryant,at.accordingly,to survive a motion to dismiss,jacoby must in addition to pleading all of the other elements of a b claim plead with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendants either intended to defraud investors or were severely reckless when they made the allegedly materially false or incomplete statements.mizzaro,at.
the second amended complaint alleges relationserve did not disclose a broker was involved in the securities sale to hide the fact that relationserve sold securities through unregistered brokers.further,the second amended complaint asserts this act of hiding relationserve use of a broker could not have been perpetrated over a substantial period of time without the knowledge and complicity of the individual defendants.viewed holistically,the second amended complaint alleges the following facts as supporting a reasonable inference of scienter ten of the individual defendants signed or authorized one or more certification s pursuant to the act that impermissibly omitted material facts each individual defendant held a management position at relationserve each individual defendant was involved in the drafting,producing,reviewing,dissemination of misleading statements and was aware of or recklessly fact that misleading statements were being issued and approved or ratified these statements each individual defendant,by virtue of his or her receipt of information,control over or receipt of relationserve materially misleading statements his or her associations with relationserve was an active and culpable participant several individual defendants signed sec forms that failed to indicate relationserve had contracted with summit and there were accounting irregularities in relationserve financial statements.
these conclusory allegations are insufficient to establish a strong inference that the defendants acted with the required state of mind.see tellabs,at.at.the inference that the individual defendants purposely failed to disclose the use of unregistered brokers to mislead the public regarding the company worth is not as compelling as the competing inference that the defendants did not disclose its use of unregistered brokers because the brokers were exempt from registration.without an allegation that any of the named defendants knew the summit employees were not registered brokers and were required to be registered brokers,we can not conclude the inference of nefarious wrongdoing is at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.see id.
even if the second amended complaint alleged the sales were not exempt transactions,it would still not be a cogent possibility that the defendants failed to disclose the use of unregistered brokers for the purpose of misleading the public.the second amended complaint does not allege facts tending to show that any of the individual defendants were even aware of relationserve relationship with summit.this is particularly so with respect to defendants soltoff,obeck,and,according to the second amended complaint,were not employed by relationserve until after the events relied on by plaintiffs with respect to defendant,according to the second amended complaint,was not employed by relationserve.
simply put,the allegations in the second amended complaint are insufficient to create a strong inference of scienter.accordingly,the district court did not err by dismissing jacoby b and rule claims against the individual defendants under the heightened pleading standards imposed by the pslra.
although the second amended complaint failed to adequately plead scienter for any of the individual defendants,theoretically,the second amended complaint could create a strong inference that the corporate defendant,relationserve,acted with the requisite state of mind.mizzaro,at.corporations have no state of mind of their own rather,the scienter of their agents must be imputed to them.id.here,the second amended complaint fails to sufficiently plead scienter as to any of the individuals who served as corporate directors or officers of relationserve,and there are no other allegations that give rise to an inference of scienter.thus,we affirm the district court dismissal of count i for failure to state a cause of action under b and rule of the securities exchange act.
secondary liability under section a 
in count ii,jacoby asserted a violation of a of the securities exchange act.section a provides 
every person who,directly or indirectly,controls any person liable under any provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such controlled person to any person to whom such controlled person is liable,unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation or cause of action.
a.section a is not a freestanding claim but rather a means of imposing liability not only on the person who actually commits a securities law violation,but also on an entity or individual that controls the violator.laperriere vesta ins.group,cir.
because a primary violation of the securities law is an essential element of a a derivative claim,a plaintiff who pleads a a claim can withstand a motion to dismiss only if the primary violation is pleaded with legal sufficiency.garfield ndc health,cir.as the second amended complaint failed to allege primary liability under b,there can be no secondary liability under a.thus,we affirm the district court dismissal of count ii for failure to state a cause of action under a of the securities exchange act.
rule b sanctions 
we review the denial of sanctions under federal rule of civil procedure for abuse of discretion.bankatlantic blythe eastman paine webber,cir.a district court denial of sanctions under the pslra is reviewed under the same standard.see morris wachovia,cir noting review of all aspects of a district court rule determination is for abuse of discretion,and n othing in the reform act sanctions provision changes this standard of review hartmarx corp abboud,cir reviewing the district court imposition of sanctions under the pslra for abuse of discretion gurary,cir same.
congress passed the pslra in,motivated in large part by a perceived need to deter strike suits by opportunistic private plaintiffs that filed securities fraud claims of dubious merit in order to exact large settlement recoveries.laperriere,at quoting novak kasaks,cir.through the pslra,congress hoped to put an end to the abuse of the discovery process to impose costs so burdensome that it is often economical for the victimized party to settle.id.
in addition to raising the standard for pleading scienter,the pslra mandate s imposition of sanctions for frivolous litigation.merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,dabit.the pslra provides 
in any private action arising under this chapter,upon final adjudication of the action,the court shall include in the record specific findings regarding compliance by each party and each attorney representing any party with each requirement of rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure as to any complaint,responsive pleading,or dispositive motion.
c emphasis added.if the court finds a party or attorney violated any requirement of rule b,the court shall impose sanctions in accordance with rule.c.if a complaint substantially fails to comply with rule b,the presumptive sanction is attorneys fees and expenses.c.accordingly,the pslra provisions eliminate a district court discretion on two fronts in choosing whether to conduct the rule b inquiry and in determining whether to impose sanctions following a finding of a rule b violation.see morris,at because the sanctions instruction comes in terms of the mandatory shall,which normally creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion,the district court must impose sanctions for each violation found.internal citation and quotation marks omitted simon debartolo group,v.the richard jacobs group,cir noting the pslra circumscribes a district court discretion in choosing whether to conduct the rule inquiry at all and whether and how to sanction a party once a violation is found.
although the pslra alters the consequences of a rule b violation in a private securities fraud action,the substantive analysis under rule remains the same see c see also citibank global,santana,cir noting the pslra does not alter the standards used to judge compliance with rule morris,at f or private securities fraud suits congress altered the consequences of a rule b violation but did not rewrite the conventional standards for evaluating rule b compliance.simon debartolo group,at the pslra does not in any way purport to alter the substantive standards for finding a violation of rule.moreover,nothing in the pslra changes our abuse of discretion standard of review of the district court rule b findings.this position is supported by the reasoning in cooter gell hartmarx,in which the supreme court held an standard applies in reviewing all aspects of a district court rule determination,including the legal aspects.id.at.at.the cooter gell court noted l egal issues are raised in considering whether a pleading is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for changing the law and whether the attorney conduct violated rule.id.at.at.it then explained even purely legal issues in the rule context require a district court to consider issues rooted in factual determinations.id.at.at.in this regard,the district court is better situated than the court of appeals to marshal the pertinent facts and apply the legal standard mandated by rule.id.at.at.
in this case,however,the district court conclusory rule analysis is not sufficient to permit meaningful appellate review.although the district court explicitly denied karp motion for sanctions its one paragraph order provides no explanation of the basis for its ruling and does not include the specific findings the pslra requires specifically,the district court order does not discuss compliance by each party and each attorney representing any party with each requirement of rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure as to any complaint,responsive pleading,or dispositive motion.c.in fact,nowhere in the june,order did the district court even mention the pslra or any of its requirements.as a result,we remand the case to the district court to permit it to make the findings in the first instance this approach is consistent with the procedure we use when a district court fails to make the pslra sanctions findings altogether.see ehlert singer,cir remanding for compliance with the pslra where the district court made no rule findings 
it may be tempting to engage in sanctions determinations ourselves,given the apparent frivolity of the plaintiffs claims.in fact,the extensive record on appeal may actually make such determinations possible.but,even assuming we have the ability to conduct a thorough rule analysis,doing so in this case would be.remand is the better route.
first,as is almost always the case,the district court is better situated than this court to marshal the pertinent facts and apply the legal standard mandated by rule.see cooter gell,at.at.given the district court familiarity with the case and the parties,the district court is in a better position to make these determinations in the first instance,explicitly and on the record.see mgmt.mendelsohn.moreover,our analysis of the sanctions issue would likely further develop the record by,for example,expounding upon the relevant sec filings or drawing inferences from undisputed facts.consequently,if we elect to make such sanctions findings at the appellate level,the parties would necessarily be less involved in the process and would be unable to object if and when appropriate.
further,our decision to remand recognizes that when the district court engaged in its sanctions analysis in our circuit had not yet explicitly addressed the level of specificity required by the pslra.to be sure,the pslra,by its own terms,clearly requires findings as to each claim,each party,and each attorney,such that the district court perfunctory analysis was insufficient even without clear precedent from this court.it is not until this case,however,that we emphasize just how extensive the district court sanctions findings must be in the pslra context.thus,in light of our reiteration and accentuation of the pslra requirements,it is appropriate to permit the district court to engage in a sanctions analysis prior to appellate review.
additionally,we recognize the practical reality that this appeal arises from complex factual circumstances that have not been organized in such a manner to facilitate efficient sanctions review.as a result,prior to engaging in a rule b analysis,we would first have to unravel the dense record and examine it in a way that no other issue in this case requires us to do.this task would require us to obtain a level of familiarity with the parties and the evidence that the district court already has as a result,we would end up replicating much of the work that the district court has already completed.this is not a wise use of judicial resources.the better solution,from a practical standpoint,is for us to carefully and promptly decide the issues on appeal,and then to remand to the district court to address any outstanding tasks.expeditiousness is every bit as important to a judiciary as is thoroughness.
finally,even if we were to engage in a full pslra sanctions analysis,it would still be necessary to remand to the district court to determine a number of outstanding issues.for instance,we would be unable to determine whether either thompson or jacoby himself as distinct from their lawyers violated rule the record is silent on this point,whether the lawyers violated rule b by filing the complaints for improper purposes a subjective analysis that will likely require testimony,or whether the plaintiffs can rebut the pslra presumptive award of attorneys fees.these issues require the kind of record development in which appellate courts can not engage.as a result,even if we did expend the enormous judicial resources necessary to parse through the record in the first instance,the district court would still have to reexamine and further develop the record to address these outstanding issues.such a process would introduce even more inevitable duplication of effort and would result in further depletion of limited judicial resources.
accordingly,even if we could in some cases engage in a pslra sanctions analysis ourselves,we decline to do so in this case.careful examination of the relevant considerations counsels against such a use of judicial resources.
iv.conclusion 
with respect to jacoby appeal,we affirm the district court dismissal of counts i and ii of the second amended complaint pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.with respect to karp,the district court order entered june,is vacated and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this,circuit judge,concurring in the appeal,and dissenting in the,
in the appeal,i concur in the court judgment affirming the district court dismissal of the second amended complaint.i dissent from the court decision in the,vacating in full the district court decision denying private securities litigation reform act plrsa sanctions,and remanding the sanctions issues to the district court for reconsideration ab initio.i would reverse the sanctions decision and remand the case with the instruction that the district court sanction plaintiffs counsel for prosecuting the federal securities law claims in the three complaints they presented to the district initial,first,and second amended,in presenting those claims,counsel violated federal rule of civil procedure b as a matter of law.they also violated rule b with respect to some of these claims because the claims lacked an evidentiary foundation.in remanding the matter of sanctions to the district court,i would instruct the court to hear from counsel for the parties on the questions of whether the remaining claims lacked the evidentiary support required by rule b,and whether plaintiffs counsel brought any of the claims for an improper purpose in violation of rule b.
the court is faced with two options in disposing of the.one is to vacate the sanctions decision and remand the case for further proceedings on the sanctions issues.the court has chosen this option.the court believes that it is incapable of meaningfully reviewing the district court denial of rule sanctions because the denial is framed in conclusory language,without findings of fact or conclusions of law.the other option is to decide whether plaintiffs attorneys failed to comply with rule b requirements,and,if so,whether sanctions are in order.i choose this option because,in the pslra context,congress explicitly requires a district court to impose sanctions whenever rule is violated.when,as here,the record so clearly indicates a rule violation,it is both within our capacity and in the broader interest of justice that we direct the district court to impose sanctions that it will have to impose on remand.
an objective examination of plaintiffs three complaints reveals that plaintiffs federal securities law claims are frivolous,and,under these facts,a district court would necessarily abuse its discretion to conclude otherwise.moreover,plaintiffs sued some individual defendants who had no involvement whatsoever in the management of relationserve media,or its predecessor,relationserve.the court disposition will require those uninvolved defendants to participate in the further proceedings on remand.the disposition i propose would limit their involvement to the simple task of presenting the court with a list of their expenses,including the attorneys fees they incurred.
the court disposition is also likely to result in a second appeal,which would put this court in the same position it now occupies.the disposition i would reach would avoid a second appeal and thus would reduce the time,effort,and expenses the district court,the parties,and this court will have to endure as a result of today decision.to make this clear,i must take the reader through this case as it the filing of the initial complaint through the filing and prosecution of the second amended complaint.i shall do so in accordance with the following outline.

vi.conclusion 
i.the facts 
relationserve media,and relationserve,corporate histories and the alleged fraud 
the principal defendant in this case,relationserve media,is an internet marketing firm that maintains its principal place of business in fort lauderdale,florida the other defendants,with three exceptions,are or were officers directors of the company officers.relationserve media,was formed when privately held relationserve,merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of publicly held chubasco resources.for the sake of clarity,i refer to the predecessor corporation as relationserve and the merged entities as relationserve media or simply media.
relationserve was incorporated in delaware on march.shortly thereafter,on april,relationserve commenced a private offering of common stock to accredited investors the april private offering.throughout april and may,relationserve received and accepted of subscriptions in exchange for relationserve shares.the shares were issued in reliance on a regulation d exemption from registration under the securities act of the act and were restricted shares as defined by the act.see et 
while the april private offering was going on,on may,relationserve acquired two internet marketing companies,omni point marketing llc and friendsand llc.in exchange for the ownership interest in those companies,relationserve paid cash,shares of its common stock,and a promissory note for.relationserve also issued shares to its founders as compensation for bridge loan advances and negotiating the acquisitions.relationserve chief operating officer at the time,scott hirsch,was also the indirect majority owner and president of omni point.relationserve then president,danielle karp,is scott hirsh sister.
after completing the april private offering and the acquisition of omni point and friendsand,on may,relationserve entered an independent consulting agreement the consulting agreement with summit financial partners,llc summit.under the consulting agreement,summit and its president,tony altavilla,agreed to i ntroduce relationserve to the financial community and p erform the functions generally assigned to stockholder relations and public relations departments in major corporations.relationserve media,current report form,ex,at june,summit also agreed to act as a finder of financing sources or acquisition candidates for relationserve.in exchange,relationserve paid summit shares of its common stock and promised to pay a cash finder fee.id.at.the consulting agreement noted that it is specifically understood that summit is not and does not hold itself out be sic a,but is merely a finder in reference to media procuring financing sources and candidates.id.at.
from inception,relationserve strategy was to become a publicly traded company by means of a reverse merger.accordingly,the april offering private placement memorandum explained the company intent to find 
a company which will acquire,by merger of relationserve all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of relationserve and any acquired businesses at the time of merger.thereafter,the present stockholders of relationserve and purchasers in the offering will,by virtue of the merger,become the controlling stockholders of the company.
relationserve,private purchase offering document,at.consistent with this representation,relationserve explored and ultimately entered a merger agreement with chubasco.
prior to the merger,chubasco,a nevada corporation with its principal place of business in canada,was an mining company yet to commence operations.in total,chubasco had shareholders and about in assets.the largest shareholder,scott young,owned million shares and also served as chubasco president,chief financial officer,and sole director.the remaining fifty shareholders purchased chubasco shares in at least one of two exempt regulation s offerings collectively,the fifty shareholders owned shares.chubasco became a public reporting company by filing a registration statement for these shares on october.once effective,the registration statement would allow the fifty holders to trade that stock publicly.chubasco res,registration statement under the securities act of.after a series of amendments,the registration statement became effective on february.chubasco res,quarterly report form,at.
sometime between march and june,relationserve management approached chubasco and suggested a reverse acquisition of relationserve.after determining that the reverse acquisition would be less speculative and contain greater benefits,chubasco terminated its mining exploration activities and negotiated a plan of merger and reorganization with relationserve.chubasco res,quarterly report form,at june.
the terms of the merger included the following.chubasco would form a subsidiary,reland acquisition.reland would then merge into relationserve,with relationserve surviving.upon consummation of the merger,each share of reland would automatically convert into the right to receive one share of relationserve thus chubasco would own all of the issued and outstanding shares of relationserve.relationserve media,current report form,ex.plan of merger a june.in exchange,relationserve stock would automatically convert into the right to receive chubasco stock on a basis.id.additionally,scott young agreed to cancel his million shares of chubasco and resign from his position as its sole director,president,and chief financial officer.danielle karp,relationserve president,would become the new president and sole director of chubasco.finally,chubasco would change its name to relationserve media.id.
the merger took place on june.as a result of the merger,relationserve media,chubasco resources,held relationserve as a wholly owned subsidiary.as planned,scott young resigned from all positions with media and danielle karp became its sole director and president.media now had two groups of shareholders.the first group consisted of the former chubasco shareholders who held shares these shares could be traded and constituted media public float.id.the second group consisted of former relationserve shareholders who owned shares of relationserve stock,now convertible into media stock.id.because the second group acquired the shares in unregistered offerings and no subsequent registration statement had been filed,the shares continued to be restricted and could not be traded.the merger did not,of course,alter the duty of media chubasco to make routine filings with the sec.
accordingly,just three days after the merger,on june,the newly formed media filed an sec current report form.among other disclosures,this report explained the merger and the resultant change in mining exploration to internet marketing.this report also disclosed,for the first time,that media predecessor,relationserve,had entered into an independent consulting agreement with summit financial partners,llc.id.at.a full copy of the consulting agreement was attached to the sec filing as an exhibit this attachment included,of course,summit express representation that it would not be acting as a,but rather would serve merely as a finder.as a consequence of the merger,summit performed the same services for media as it had for relationserve.
shortly after the merger,media commenced a regulation d,rule private offering pursuant to a private placement memorandum dated june,the june private offering it was in this offering that plaintiff richard thompson,an indiana resident,purchased media shares at two dollars per share and warrants with an exercise price of,for a total investment of.
thompson bought the shares on june,twelve days after media had disclosed the consulting agreement with summit.gary altavilla,summit president,advised thompson about the private offering and helped facilitate thompson purchase.at the time of his purchase,thompson signed a subscription agreement wherein he attested to his knowledge of the consulting agreement and that summit was not licensed and did not hold itself out as a.indeed,in the subscription agreement that he signed,thompson 
acknowledge d that he has read and evaluated,or has employed the services of an investment advisor,attorney or accountant to read and evaluate,all of the documents furnished or made available by the company to thompson including the company current report on form filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on june,current report and subsequent sec filings and reports 
relationserve media,current report form,ex.subscription agreement,at june,as indicated above,this june,current report included the agreement between media and summit in its entirety.
on june,media completed the june private offering.in a report filed with the sec,it disclosed 
on june,we completed a private offering of units to accredited investors as that term is defined in regulation d of the securities act,with each unit consisting of shares of our common stock,par value per share common stock,and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at per share the offering.we received and accepted of subscriptions in the offering.the units were issued in reliance on an exemption from registration provided under regulation d of the securities act and are restricted securities as defined by the securities act.
relationserve media,current report form,at june.attached to this filing was a copy of the private offering subscription agreement the purchasers signed the subscription agreement.as in relationserve april offering,all of the shares sold in media june private offering were restricted and therefore could not be resold until registered under the act 
in addition to this current report,on july,media filed a form d with the sec to give further notice of and basic details about the june private offering.relationserve media,notice of sale of securities pursuant to regulation d form d,at july.at the time,form d required the issuer to disclose information about each person who has been or will be paid or given,directly or indirectly,any commission or similar remuneration for solicitation of purchasers in connection with the sales of securities in the offering.id.at.media did not disclose summit involvement in the june private offering.
media also filed a notice of the sale of unregistered securities with the indiana secretary of state in compliance with indiana securities act.see et repealed.this notice,received and filed by the secretary of state office on july,disclosed that media june private offering had attracted accredited investors to purchase an aggregate total of million of media common stock.in particular,media attested to its sale of of media shares to five accredited investors in indiana 
while the june private offering was going on,media expanded its management team.recall that immediately after the merger,danielle karp was media sole president,chief executive officer,and director media subsidiary,relationserve,continued to be served by scott hirsch as its chief operating officer.on june,media hired mandee heller adler to serve as its chief executive officer and as a director and on june,media hired warren pete musser to serve as a director.
as discussed above,after the merger,the shares that had been registered by chubasco could be traded in the open market.media shares began to trade on the over the counter bulletin board the otcbb in late june.it was from this pool of stock that plaintiff alan jacoby purchased a total of shares of media stock in three separate transactions.these purchases occurred on july,july,and august,and jacoby claimed to have paid an average of six dollars per share by march,almost nine months later,media shares had lost of their value in the open market.
curiously,the plaintiffs alleged that media shares traded on the nasdaq stock exchange.there is no evidence in media sec filings,however,that media stock traded anywhere except the otcbb.media did apply for a nasdaq listing on or about july,but there is no evidence that the application succeeded.to the contrary,media annual report filed on march,disclosed our common stock has been quoted on the otc bulletin board since june,under the symbol.prior to that date,there was no active market for our common stock.relationserve media,annual report form,at,
around the same time that jacoby purchased his stake in media,media sec filings indicate that it entered into two key transactions.first,on august,media entered an asset purchase agreement to buy the business and substantially all of the assets of wholly owned subsidiary,sendtec,for million.relationserve media,current report form.the acquisition was subject to certain terms and conditions and did not close until october.second,on august,media merged with its subsidiary,relationserve,with media surviving.relationserve media,current report form,at.
for the purposes of this case,two facts are crucial about the sendtec asset acquisition.first,as part of the terms and conditions mentioned,media agreed to terminate its contract with summit.relationserve media,current report form,ex.at.second,media agreed that it would replace certain members of its current management with managers.relationserve media,current report form.
accordingly,on october,media terminated its agreement with summit the exodus of media senior management team began in late october director musser resigned on october chief executive officer and director adler resigned on november.with one exception,the exodus was complete by the first week of february with the departure of president and director karp and chief operating officer hirsch on february and february,respectively.the lone exception was chief financial officer adam wasserman who was hired on a basis as chief financial officer on august,and ultimately served media in some capacity until june,media original management team was replaced by replacements michael brauser joined as director and chairman of the board on october,shawn mcnamara joined as interim chief executive officer,senior vice president,and assistant secretary on november,and paul soltoff,as chief executive officer and director,erick obeck,as president,and donald gould,as chief financial officer,all joined on february.for a complete listing of the terms of media officers service,see the table attached to this opinion at.
richard thompson sues relationserve,media in indiana state court 
on march,in the circuit court of hamilton county indiana,thompson sued summit,altavilla,media,and several other entities who used summit services,seeking rescission of his shares.thompson was represented by cohen malad,llp,an indiana law firm.thompson directed three of his fourteen counts against media count claimed that media sold unregistered,securities in indiana count alleged that media had violated the indiana securities act provisions by failing to disclose the shares restricted status and count claimed media deceived thompson by failing to disclose the shares restricted status.the other counts of the complaint were brought against summit,altavilla,and other named defendants 
unrelated to this litigation,on march,media filed a registration statement and its annual report.media filed the registration statement to register the shares it sold in its private million shares of common allow the private offering stockholders to sell their shares.in the annual report,inter alia,media disclosed that,i n august,the company paid a success fee to summit for services rendered in connection with a private placement of its common stock.relationserve media,annual report form,at.neither the registration statement nor the annual report disclosed the thompson litigation.
on may,media amended this registration statement to give the public notice of thompson lawsuit.relationserve media,amendment to form registration statement form a,at may.media also related that thompson sought rescission because the shares were not registered as required under indiana law and because media failed to disclose a commission to altavilla.media also asserted its belief that the suit lacked merit but noted that it could not predict the range of any loss.this disclosure prompted the sec to send a letter to media requesting more information about the thompson litigation.
responding to the sec letter,on may,media augmented the amendment it had made to its registration statement.answering the sec questions,media added that thompson sought rescission of shares of stock,media did not register the shares in indiana because they qualified for an exemption,and altavilla did not sell shares on the company behalf but did receive a seven percent finder fee for introducing investors to media.media reiterated its belief that the action lacked merit.relationserve media,amendment to form registration statement form a,at may.the last amendment to this registration statement took place on july,and the sec declared it effective on july.
on may,relationserve media moved the hamilton county circuit court to dismiss it from thompson lawsuit.it argued that the forum selection clause in the subscription agreement required that all litigation be conducted in broward county,florida.thompson responded to this motion by filing an affidavit in which he averred that he had no direct communication with media and in fact did not read the private offering memorandum or any other materials concerning media rather,his son,greg thompson,read the materials.the court agreed with media position and,on july,dismissed media from the case.
just before the indiana circuit court dismissed the case,on july,thompson sold shares at a share,and another shares at a share.these sales obviously limited his ability to seek a full rescission of his initial purchase.thompson investment strategy took a turn later in the day,though,as he bought another shares of media at a share on july,only to sell shares the next day at a share.one month later,on august,thompson dumped the rest of his shares in three sales at,and a share.
ii.the federal procedural history 
a.the initial.thompson files the initial complaint 
on august,thompson brought the present lawsuit against media,three of its former officers and one of its former directors in the united states district court for the southern district of florida.the former officers were danielle karp,mandee heller adler,and ohad jehassi the former director was warren musser thompson was again represented by cohen malad,llp,and now also by a florida law firm,friedman,rosenwasser goldbaum,eight days after filing the complaint,on september,cohen malad issued a press release publicizing the lawsuit and inviting media shareholders to contact the firm 
thompson sued on behalf of a class consisting of a ll persons including himself who purchased relationserve media shares during the period beginning may,and ending on the date of the commencement of this litigation,on august,while not explicit,the complaint proposed class consisted of two subclasses those who bought shares in the private offerings and those who bought shares in the public market.the complaint contained nine counts.counts i through iii alleged violations of federal securities law and,for remedies,prayed for rescission or damages.counts iv through ix alleged violations of florida and indiana statutes 
count i,filing of false registration statement,alleged a violation of 
section of the securities act of,a.section is 
actually codified at,not a.section provides relief for persons who purchase securities in reliance on a false or misleading registration statement section a,which is a codification of of the act,provides relief for purchasers of securities who rely on a false or misleading statement in a prospectus or oral communication to solve this inaccurate citation problem,i read count i to seek relief under both sections and of the act.this squares with count i allegation that 
media filings with the securities exchange commission,including the registration statements,prospectus,and amendments thereto omitted to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading in at least the following particulars 
relationserve media was selling its securities through unregistered agents and and paying commissions to these unregistered agents and 
b.the sale of relationserve media stock through unregistered agents and was in violation of state and federal securities laws,which caused a substantial contingent liability for claims of rescission by investors and exposed relationserve to substantial legal fees and 
c.the potential civil liability of relationserve media for selling shares of its stock in violation of state and federal law,which would have an adverse impact on the relationserve media financial condition.
compl.emphasis added.count i thus alleged that media had violated the act by selling securities under a false or misleading registration statement s,prospectus,or oral communication,by failing to disclose its use of unregistered brokers and the contingent liability arising therefrom the theory.
count ii,violation of securities act of,incorporated all of the preceding allegations of the complaint,including count count ii alleged that media and the officers,who were controlling persons,offered and sold the shares of relationserve media in violation of.compl.because i construe count i to seek relief under,codified at,count ii added nothing to count 
count iii,violation of securities exchange act of,rule,incorporated all of counts i and ii and further asserted that media and the officers offered and sold the shares of relationserve media in violation of the securities exchange act of the act,and rule compl.section b of the act and rule provide relief for any person who relies on a false or misleading statement in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.
more specifically,count iii alleged that t he defendants offered and sold the shares in violation of rule.compl.because media and the officers only offered and sold shares to the private offering purchasers,the b,rule claim was limited to the private offering subclass.the complaint did not directly identify any false or misleading statement made by any defendant in connection with media sale of shares to thompson or any other private offering purchaser nor did the complaint allege any device or scheme to defraud.thompson did,however,refer to the omissions in count i section and claims.compl.as stated herein,the registration statement and prospectus contained untrue statements of material facts.therefore,thompson claimed the private offering purchasers could recover based on media failure to disclose its use of unregistered brokers in its public offering documents.
thompson invoked the district court supplemental jurisdiction for the state law claims asserted in counts iv though ix.see.count iv alleged that media,aided and abetted by the officers,sold media shares through brokers,dealers,and agents who were not registered in florida,in violation of florida statutes and.count v alleged that sales were made in indiana via unregistered brokers,dealers,and agents,in violation of indiana code.count vi alleged that media,aided and abetted by the officers,sold media shares that were unregistered in violation of indiana code and.count vii alleged that media,aided and abetted by the officers,sold media shares in violation of the provisions of the indiana securities act,indiana code.count viii alleged that media,aided and abetted by the officers,defrauded the purchasers of media shares,in violation of indiana code.count ix alleged that media and the officers defrauded the purchasers of media shares,in violation of the common law.
as remedies,thompson sought rescission or damages for the federal securities claims brought in counts i through iii.as for the state law claims,thompson sought rescission for counts iv through vii,trebled compensatory damages for count viii,and compensatory and punitive damages for count ix.prior to filing his complaint,thompson disposed of all of his media shares.accordingly,the remedy of rescission was not available to him in counts i through vii.nor was rescission available to the members of thompson open market subclass because they never bought shares from media therefore,they could not obtain a judgment requiring the company to return the purchase they never paid to the exchange for the shares they still held.
the defendants warn thompson attorneys that the suit is frivolous 
after media received the initial complaint,but before filing a responsive pleading,thomas fleming,one of media attorneys wrote to cohen malad to advise the firm that thompson claims were frivolous and that the complaint had been filed in violation of rule b.while the record does not contain fleming letter,it does contain cohen malad reply.richard bell replied on behalf of cohen malad,stating 
we are in receipt of your letter of october.we strongly disagree with your assessment of this securities litigation filed against your client.contrary to your opinion,the lawsuit was filed in good faith and was diligently investigated and researched before it was filed 
lastly at some point in time both our clients will want to resolve or settle this case.so i will commit to be respectful of your legal positions even though i may disagree.
pls.mot.to compel disc.ex.a,letter from richard bell to thomas fleming,at,footnote in original.
the defendants move to dismiss,request the court to retain jurisdiction to impose sanctions 
shortly thereafter,on october,the defendants moved to dismiss thompson complaint on a slew of grounds as for the federal securities law claims,the defendants pointed to several pleading errors.the counts i and ii claims under and of the act failed to identify any purchase made in reliance on false or misleading statements in a registration statement or prospectus the count iii b,rule claim failed to identify any false or misleading statements with the particularity and specificity required by rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure and the pslra.
turning to thompson state law claims,the defendants argued that those claims were barred by the securities litigation uniform standards act slusa,which mandates,with limited exceptions not applicable here,that class action claims involving the purchase or sale of nationally traded securities must be asserted under federal securities law 
in their motions to dismiss,defense counsel also notified thompson counsel that they considered the claims to be baseless and in violation of rule.indeed,both defendants who responded to the complaint moved the court to dismiss the case and to retain jurisdiction to impose sanctions pursuant to the pslra and rule 
thompson attorneys move the court for leave to amend and for limited discovery to add individual defendants 
thompson did not respond to the defendants motions.instead,on october,his attorneys moved the district court for leave to conduct limited discovery to obtain the last known addresses for fourteen of the company officers and directors so thompson could amend his complaint and name them as defendants.
the court grants the attorneys leave to amend and limited discovery and warns the attorneys about rule 
on november,the district court held a telephone conference to hear argument on the pending motions.during the call,thompson counsel informed the court that they wished to file an amended complaint the court granted them leave to do so over media strenuous objection that thompson request for limited discovery amounted to a litigation tactic the court granted thompson motion.in granting this motion,the court,although it had not yet read the complaint,reminded counsel,
also,there rule eleven which provides sanctions if there is no legitimate basis for bringing a suit or serving the various officers and directors 
i do know whether these officers and directors are legitimate targets or not.there is no way i can know.i do know you lawyers being experienced lawyers know about rule eleven.
goldbaum,i will tell you,you really ought to think long and hard before you just automatically sue everyone that happens to be on the list of officers and directors.that for you to decide 
teleconference tr.responding to this warning,thompson counsel promised the court that they would be mindful of rule and would name officers and directors as defendants only if they had a reasonable basis for doing so.
b.the first amended complaint 
thompson jacoby file the first amended complaint,each purporting to represent all class members on all claims 
on november,thompson,now joined by new plaintiff alan jacoby filed a first amended complaint against media,eleven officers and two recall that jacoby purchased media shares in the open market in july.both plaintiffs purported to represent all buyers of media securities who bought during the class period as to all claims.first am.compl.like the initial complaint,however,this complaint had two implicit subclasses one of private offering purchasers,and one of open market purchasers.also like the initial complaint,this complaint was a shotgun pleading.
the new complaint differed by adding to its federal securities law claims new theories of the defendants allegedly false or misleading statements.in addition to thompson theory,thompson and jacoby also alleged that media failed to disclose its retention of outside counsel to investigate accusations of employee theft and kickbacks the kickback theory that beginning in the third quarter of,its financial statements recognized income in violation of generally accepted accounting principles gaap and company policy the theory and that it did not disclose that director musser had been sued by stockholders of two other corporations for securities violations the theory.
the plaintiffs also tried to strengthen thompson original theory.they added an allegation that summit and another unregistered broker,barry honig,sold securities to a florida resident,stuart feick.first am.compl.additionally,the plaintiffs essentially listed all of media sec filings to date with one notable exception.the first amended complaint did not list media june,form current report,which revealed the summit consulting agreement,and,with it,summit representation that it was not licensed and would not act as a for media the amended complaint alleged that all of the listed sec filings were false or misleading because they failed to state the material facts recounted above,including media use of an unregistered sell its shares.
counts i through iii replicated nearly verbatim counts i through iii of the initial complaint.count i alleged that media violated by filing a false registration statement count ii claimed that media violated by issuing false or misleading prospectuses or oral communications count iii alleged violations of b and rule.the plaintiffs added a new count,count iv,violation of section a of the exchange act against the individual defendants.that count asserted that the officers were liable for the count iii b,rule violations because the officers were controlling persons under a of the act,for all three federal securities claims,the plaintiffs alleged the same misleading securities filings misled because they omitted media use of an unregistered broker,its investigation of kickbacks,its overstatement of income,and its sued director.
similarly,with two notable exceptions,the plaintiffs their state law claims almost verbatim.see part,supra.the state law claims were now pled as counts v through x they were pled as counts iv through ix in the initial complaint.the two exceptions involved the allegations of fraud in the now count viii indiana securities act fraud claim and the now count ix indiana deception claim.in the initial complaint iteration,thompson alleged that media fraudulently failed to disclose sizeable commissions and fees it paid to altavilla,that the stock was not registered and therefore restricted,and that media had hired unregistered agents to sell there sic securities.compl.in the amended complaint,thompson eliminated any claim that media misled him about the unregistered status of his shares and pled the,kickback,and theories of misrepresentation instead.first am.compl.
the defendants move to dismiss,request the court to retain jurisdiction to impose sanctions 
the defendants responded to the first amended complaint with motions to dismiss,which articulated virtually the same rationales as their previous motions to dismiss.addressing the counts i and ii claims under and of the act,the defendants argued that the private offering subclass could not have relied on a media registration statement or prospectus because none had been issued for those shares.addressing jacoby purchase of shares in the open market in july and august,the defendants argued that these shares were purchased under a registration statement and prospectus issued by chubasco in february and thus could not form the basis for a or claim against media.turning to the count iii b,rule claim,the defendants argued that the plaintiffs failed to plead the claim with the particularity and specificity demanded by rule b and the pslra.as for the state law claims,the defendants again reiterated that they were barred by the slusa,and,even if they were not barred by the slusa,they failed to state a claim.finally,defendants media,adler,musser,wasserman,brauser,mcnamara,soltoff,obeck,gould,and young,and,in her separate motion,defendant karp,reiterated the request that the court retain jurisdiction to impose sanctions.
in response to the defendants motions,plaintiffs counsel conceded that their claim had no merit although the plaintiffs also conceded that their claim could not succeed on the basis of any false or misleading prospectus,they maintained the claim had merit because thompson relied on certain unidentified oral communication s in the june private offering pls.resp.to defs.mot.to dismiss.as for the b,rule claim,counsel argued that they had met the strict pleading requirements of rule b and the pslra id.at.
regarding the state law claims,the plaintiffs conceded that the slusa barred them from maintaining three of the five claims as class actions the count viii indiana securities fraud claim,the count ix indiana deception claim,and the count x common law fraud claim.they argued that counts v,vi,and vii were cognizable.id.at.counts v and vi alleged that media sold securities via unregistered brokers in violation of florida and indiana law,respectively count vii alleged that media sold unregistered,securities in violation of the indiana securities act.the defendants contended that these claims were not within the purview of slusa because the claims do not allege that the defendants misrepresented or omitted a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of such security.id.at quotation omitted.
the court dismisses the first amended complaint 
the district court heard the defendants motions to dismiss during a conference call with counsel on march.referring to the b,rule claims,the court questioned whether thompson was a suitable class representative because of a possible conflict with the open market purchasers.the court also indicated that it had serious concerns about the adequacy of the plaintiffs pleading.at one point,the court said 
so i do see anything where it is alleged that thompson and jacoby relied on anything specific.nothing is tied together.there are a lot of things thrown out in the first amended complaint,but i see very little connecting of the dots.
seems to me there are some real gaps there.seems to me you may have more than one lawsuit tied into one lawsuit 
again,it kind of hard to follow.it like so what,who relied on it,who did what where is the reliance causation 
i do see where anyone is alleged to have relied on any particular filing whether a form k,form sb,or registration statement that led that person to purchase something.
hr g tr.after detailing why the federal securities claims failed,the court offered plaintiffs counsel one final time to take care of the deficiencies.id.at.the court therefore dismissed the first amended complaint without prejudice,with leave to file a second amended complaint by march.
c.the second amended complaint 
thompson jacoby file the second amended complaint with jacoby leading an purchaser subclass bringing federal securities claims and with thompson leading a private offering purchaser subclass bringing state law claims 
the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on march.this complaint,unlike the prior ones,pled two class actions one under federal securities law,with jacoby as the class representative,and the other under state law,with thompson as the class representative.both actions sought rescission or damages for purchasers of media stock.
as for the federal claims,jacoby brought his class action in two counts,i and ii,on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated that purchased relationserve media,inc securities on the open market prior to may.second am.compl.in count i,except for the class definition,jacoby replicated the claim brought by thompson in count iii of the initial complaint and by thompson and jacoby in count iii of the first amended media and the officers offered and sold relationserve securities in violation of b of the act and rule.second am.compl.in count ii,except for the class definition,jacoby replicated the a claim brought by thompson and jacoby in count iv of the first amended complaint b y virtue of their positions as controlling persons of media,the individual defendants are liable for media violation of b and rule.id.
the biggest difference between the federal securities claims in the first and second amended complaints was what the second amended complaint omitted.gone was thompson from any federal securities claim gone were two of the individual defendants gone were the and claims gone were the kickback and the theories of misrepresentation only jacoby remained,representing open market purchasers and bringing a b,rule 
claim and a parasitic a claim jacoby asserted only the and theories of misrepresentation.
thompson asserted his class action in count iii on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated that purchased relationserve media securities by way of a private offering.id.count iii alleged that the defendants 
violated the securities laws of california,connecticut,florida,illinois,indiana,nevada,new jersey,new york,ohio,and pennsylvania by way of their sale of relationserve media securities through the use of and agents who were not registered with the sec and those states and their payment of a commission 
id.furthermore,
e ach defendant having access to relationserve media business prior to and during relationserve media use of unregistered personally participated or aided in making the sales to thompson and his putative class and is jointly and severally liable for rescission if the purchaser still owns the security or for damages if the purchaser has sold the security.
id.here again,most notable was what was omitted gone was the claim that media sold unregistered,securities in violation of the indiana securities act,and gone were all of the state law fraud claims.
the first paragraphs resembled the first paragraphs of the first amended complaint.like that complaint,the second amended complaint omitted any reference to media june,current report,which indicated that summit was not registered and would not act as a,but,rather would only act as a finder.nevertheless,the second amended complaint addressed the licensing issue by alleging that relationserve media,and its officers and directors,knew and failed to report that summit and its agents we re not registered with the sec or the state securities divisions.second am.compl.it also alleged that the officers acted with scienter in failing to report this the officers knew recklessly disregarded the falsity and misleading nature of the information which they caused to be disseminated to the investing public.id.
the defendants move to dismiss,and defendant karp moves for sanctions 
once again,the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint.they did so on several grounds,among them that the b,rule claim allegations of misrepresentation and scienter were insufficient under the heightened pleading requirements of rule b and the pslra and as a consequence,the parasitic a claim failed.as for thompson state law class action,the defendants pointed out that of the ten states where media allegedly sold shares through unregistered brokers,the plaintiffs had identified only one sale in only one,media sale to thompson through summit in indiana.accordingly,the state law claims in all states except indiana failed from the.as for the indiana sale to thompson,the plaintiffs pointed out that summit did not need to be registered as a broker under indiana law.
in addition to moving for the dismissal of the complaint,defendant karp moved for sanctions against the plaintiffs and their attorneys under rule with respect to all counts and under the pslra with respect to the count i b,rule claim and the count ii a claim 
the court dismisses the complaint with prejudice but denies sanctions 
on june,the district court entered an order disposing of the defendants motions.the court dismissed count i because it failed to meet the heightened pleading standards of rule b and the pslra.in the court view,the b,rule elements of misrepresentation and scienter had not been pled with the requisite specificity.specifically,the b,rule claim did not identify one statement of significance in any sec filing that was allegedly false or misleading due to the omission of a material fact,and it pled scienter in a conclusory fashion,thereby failing to create a strong inference of severe recklessness on the part of media or the officers.the court dismissed count ii because count i was legally insufficient.the dismissal of counts i and ii left the court with the state law claims of count iii.the court declined to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over those claims and therefore dismissed them without prejudice.
in a separate order entered on june,the court denied karp motion for sanctions.the court found that plaintiffs claims are not frivolous,or so devoid of evidentiary support as to warrant sanctions.likewise,there is no evidence that plaintiffs instituted this action for improper purposes,such as to harass media,karp,or any other named defendant or needlessly increase the cost of litigation.sanctions order,june,internal citations omitted.karp contended that sanctions were warranted because,i n dismissing the instant matter three times for failing to state a cause of action,the district court in essence ruled plaintiffs claims were frivolous.
jacoby appeal,karp,and this court decision 
subsequently,jacoby appealed to this court and karp.jacoby appeals the district court dismissal of the b,rule and a claims of the second amended complaint.karp the court denial of pslra rule sanctions for the federal claims and ordinary rule sanctions for the second amended complaint state law claims.
today,the court correctly affirms the dismissal of jacoby federal securities law claims.the court disposes of karp appeal regarding pslra sanctions by vacating the district court sanctions order and remanding the case for further proceedings,because the district court pslra order is too conclusory to permit meaningful appellate review.the court disposition contains insufficient instructions as to precisely what the district court must do on remand.in my view,under the court disposition,the district court must carry out its pslra duties from scratch with respect to all parties and their respective attorneys.finally,the court makes no explicit holding regarding karp motion for ordinary rule sanctions on the state law claims.
iii.this court errs by summarily remanding karp for sanctions under the pslra 
in karp for rule and pslra sanctions,the court errs for two reasons.first,the court opinion fails to make perfectly clear that,on remand,the district court must review and make specific findings regarding plaintiffs and plaintiffs counsel compliance with each requirement of rule b with respect to all three complaints second,the court should not have remanded with a blank slate at bottom,the court should have instructed the district court to sanction plaintiffs attorneys for noncompliance with rule b.this discussion proceeds in two parts.part a sets out the duties the pslra imposes on district courts and shows that the district court must review all three complaints for rule compliance on remand.part b explains that under the pslra,there is no need for a remand when the record demonstrates conclusively that an attorney or party violated rule.
a.the pslra rule analytical framework requirements 
the pslra mandates sanctions for filing and prosecuting frivolous or abusive securities actions under the and acts and emphasizes the need not only to deter such filings but also to compensate the victims.see,at,reprinted in.accordingly,the pslra requires both mandatory findings regarding compliance with rule,and mandatory sanctions whenever any portion of a plaintiff complaint fails to comply with rule c c.
the rule compliance review is sweeping.in a paragraph entitled mandatory review by court,the statute provides that,in any private securities action,the court shall include in the record specific findings regarding compliance by each party and each attorney with each requirement of rule b as to any complaint,responsive pleading,or dispositive motion.c emphasis added.congress imposed this heavy duty on district courts via statute thus,whether a party moved for sanctions is irrelevant.
moreover,because congress extended this duty to any complaint,when a plaintiff files multiple complaints,each must be scrutinized.see reeves astrue,cir statutory interpretation begins and ends with the text of the statute so long as the text meaning is clear.the pslra does not grant a nonfrivolous complaint does not immunize the earlier filing of frivolous complaints.see atsi commc ns,shaar fund,cir the pslra sanctions provision forecloses the kind of safe harbor afforded in rule c.the pslra explicitly directs courts to make rule findings upon final adjudication of the action and it is that no safe harbor could apply retroactively.quoting c.even in the ordinary rule context,where a complaint contains multiple claims,one nonfrivolous claim will not preclude sanctions for frivolous claims,reed great lakes,cir the fact that reed accommodation claim,while it has failed,was not frivolous would be no bar to imposing sanctions for putting his opponent to the expense of opposing a frivolous claim or defense just because he had a nonfrivolous claim as well.here,the district court erred when it based its sanctions review on only the second amended complaint.the district court should have reviewed all three complaints as well as,for that matter,each party,each attorney,and each motion to dismiss for compliance with rule.
although the pslra forces a district court to conduct the rule inquiry,it does not alter the ordinary rule analysis.simon debartolo group,richard jacobs group,cir.rule is violated when a paper is presented for any improper purpose,such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation the legal contentions are not warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for changing existing law or the factual contentions lack evidentiary support.b a rule b or b a legally or factually frivolous often probative of a rule b improper purpose violation.therefore,it helps to begin the pslra examination with rule b and.
in this circuit,there are two prongs to the rule b and b inquiry whether the legal claims or factual contentions are objectively frivolous,and,if so,whether a reasonably competent attorney should have known they were frivolous.worldwide primates,mcgreal,cir.both inquiries measure attorney conduct under an objective reasonably competent attorney standard.donaldson clark,cir en banc.
a legal claim is frivolous if no reasonably competent attorney could conclude that it has any reasonable chance of success or is a reasonable argument to change existing law.worldwide primates,at quoting jones int l riding helmets,cir mcgregor bd.of comm rs of palm beach county,cir if an allegation in a complaint contains no colorable claim for relief,then a rule sanction is proper.not every federal rule of civil procedure b dismissal will warrant sanctions,but sanctions may be imposed when settled precedent clearly bars a claim.see davis carl,cir noting that legal claims are frivolous in egregious circumstances such as when a party ignores the plain language of a statute of limitations or conceals controlling authority compare thomas early county,wl,at cir,unpublished concluding that rule b had been violated where allegations of vicarious liability fail as a matter of law,with anderson smithfield foods,cir per curiam affirming a district court dismissal of a rico count,but reversing the imposition of sanctions when there was scant authority to guide the attorney to the conclusion that the claim had no chance of success.
a factual claim is frivolous if no reasonably competent attorney could conclude that it has a reasonable evidentiary basis.davis,at.thus,where no evidence or only patently frivolous evidence is offered to support factual contentions,sanctions can be imposed.id.at.if,however,the evidence supporting the claim is reasonable,but simply weak or,sanctions can not be imposed.id.at.
once a court concludes that either the factual or legal contentions are frivolous,the question becomes whether the attorney should have known they were frivolous.worldwide primates,at.we ask what was known or reasonably knowable when the paper was present ed to the court.b.again,measured objectively,if a reasonable investigation would have revealed the error to a reasonably competent attorney,then sanctions can be imposed if not,then sanctions can not be imposed.the reasonableness of the inquiry turns on the totality of the circumstances,including,for example,the time available for investigation and whether the attorney had to rely on the client,another member of the bar,or others.worldwide primates,at.
rule b sanctions are appropriate when an attorney or party presents a paper for an improper purpose.improper purpose is often inferred from circumstantial evidence.for example,it can be inferred from excessive persistence in pursuing a claim or defense in the face of repeated adverse rulings.indus.risk insurers gutehoffnungshütte gmbh,cir quoting pierce commercial warehouse.a motive to harass can also be inferred from an attorney filing of factually or legally frivolous claims.carr tillery,cir.
ordinarily,even in the face of a blatant rule violation,a district court retains discretion to decide how to sanction the party or even not to impose sanctions at all.this discretion derives from rule plain text if,after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond,the court determines that rule b has been violated,the court may impose an appropriate sanction on any attorney,law firm,or party.c emphasis added see also.advisory committee note,amendment w hat sanctions,if any,to impose for a violation are matters committed to the discretion of the trial court.thus,ordinarily,a court can excuse an attorney negligence,mistake,or incompetence.
but the pslra strips the district court of the discretion to grant pslra forces a district court to sanction an attorney for violating any prong of rule.the statute provides,in a paragraph entitled mandatory sanctions,that i f the court makes a finding that a party or attorney violated any requirement of rule b as to any complaint,responsive pleading,or dispositive motion,the court shall impose sanctions on such party or attorney c emphasis added.likewise,the pslra curtails a district court discretion in fashioning the sanction.it does so by erecting a rebuttable presumption that when any complaint substantial ly fails to comply with rule,the sanction is the defendant attorneys fees for the entire action.id.c a ii even when the presumption is rebutted a district court still must sanction the party in some appropriate manner.id.c c if the party or attorney to be sanctioned meets its burden under subparagraph b,the court shall award the sanctions that the court deems appropriate pursuant to rule emphasis added.
the pslra mandate regarding rule b compliance resulted from congress recognition of the need to reduce significantly the filing of meritless securities lawsuits without hindering the ability of victims of fraud to pursue legitimate claims,at,reprinted in.further,in enacting the pslra,congress commented that the e xisting rule has not deterred abusive securities litigation and that the pslra sanctions requirement would put teeth into rule.id.the senate report accompanying the legislation further notes,
although private securities class actions can complement sec enforcement actions,the evils flowing from abusive securities litigation start with the filing of the complaint and continue through to the final disposition of the action.a complaint alleging violations of the federal securities laws is easy to craft and can be filed with little or no due diligence.
most defendants in securities class action lawsuits choose to settle rather than face the enormous expense of discovery and trial.of the approximately securities lawsuits filed each year,almost settle at an average settlement cost of million.these cases are generally settled based not on the merits but on the size of the defendant pocketbook.
the fact that many of these lawsuits are filed as class actions has had an in terrorem effect on corporate america these lawsuits have added significantly to the cost of raising capital and represent a litigation tax on business.smaller companies bear the brunt of abusive securities fraud lawsuits.many of these companies are companies which,by their very nature,have unpredictable business prospects and,consequently,volatile stock prices.
at,reprinted in,footnotes omitted.
accordingly,the pslra sanctions mandate reflects congress policy to prevent the misuse of judicial resources in the securities context.to effectuate its goals,congress imposed a heavy burden on the district courts and removed the courts discretion to grant mercy for a rule b violation.
significantly,our sister circuits agree with this strict,literal,and unforgiving interpretation of the way congress has curtailed the district courts rule discretion through the pslra the courts of appeals that have considered the issue have uniformly meant what it said when it made rule sanctions mandatory whenever a violation is found.see citibank global,rodriguez santana,cir the statute requiring such findings does not appear to brook any exceptions morris wachovia,cir because the sanctions instruction comes in terms of the mandatory shall,which normally creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion the district court must impose sanctions for each violation found.quoting lexecon milberg weiss bershad hynes lerach,gurary,cir if the court determines that a violation has occurred,the imposition of sanctions is mandatory.
in addition to mandating the rule inquiry and mandating sanctions for any rule violation,the pslra imposes three procedural requirements.first,the district court duty to conduct the rule compliance review is triggered only upon final adjudication of the action.c.second,if,after examining the complaints,responsive pleadings,or dispositive motions,the court concludes that sanctions may be in order,the court shall give the party or attorney against whom sanctions might be imposed notice and an opportunity to respond.id.c.although the statute does not specify the type of notice that should issue,an order directing the party or attorney to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed would suffice.advisory committee note,amendment the power of the court to act on its own initiative is retained,but with the condition that this be done through a show cause order.third,a district court must reduce its rule compliance review to specific findings.these specific findings are akin to the findings of fact and conclusions of law a district court makes pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a at the conclusion of a bench trial.these findings aid the court of appeals in reviewing the district court sanctions decision.in this case,in addition to erring by focusing solely on the second amended complaint,the district court erred by entering only a conclusory order.
b.a court of appeals should not remand for rule findings when it can determine conclusively that the district court abused its discretion in denying sanctions 
the pslra does not explain how a court of appeals should review a district court failure to conduct an adequate pslra examination evidenced by specific findings regarding the parties and their attorneys compliance with rule.today,the court equivocates on whether it is possible for an appellate court to determine pslra rule compliance when faced with conclusory findings and declines to do so in this case.op.at.that conclusion,however,ignores the precedent of this circuit,will set the stage for error on remand,will generate another appeal,and will waste the time and resources of the district court,this court,and the litigants.in my view,under the pslra,when it can be determined conclusively that an attorney or party violated rule,the court of appeals should hold that sanctions must be imposed.this is so even where,as here,the court of appeals can reach that holding only as to some of the claims or defenses.
we review a district court rule determination for abuse of discretion.souran travelers ins,cir.a district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.mcgregor bd.of comm rs of palm beach county,cir quoting cooter gell hartmax.
the court seems to doubt whether it can review the district court exercise of discretion in this case because the record contains only a conclusory,unreviewable order.accordingly,the court remands the case to the district court so that it can make findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the parties and counsel compliance with rule.there is no doubt,however,that even without extensive findings,it is possible for this court to review pslra rule determinations under the abuse of discretion standard.sometimes,the record on appeal will disclose rule violations that are so egregious that any refusal by the district court to impose sanctions would necessarily constitute an abuse of discretion.to see why,it is necessary to unpack the abuse of discretion standard and the elements of a rule violation.
the critical difference between abuse of discretion review and de novo review is that abuse of discretion recognizes a range of possible conclusions the trial judge may reach.united states frazier,cir en banc.more specifically,
b y definition under the abuse of discretion standard of review there will be occasions in which we affirm the district court even though we would have gone the other way had it been our call.that is how an abuse of discretion standard differs from a de novo standard of review.as we have stated previously,the abuse of discretion standard allows a range of choice for the district court,so long as that choice does not constitute a clear error of judgment.
id.quoting rasbury,cir.that said,abuse of discretion never gives the district court unfettered discretion the court must not base its discretionary decision on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.accordingly,the range of possible conclusions varies with the nature of the inquiry legal factual and the relative merit of the parties competing positions whether the question is close.in sum,when reviewing the elements of a district court decision of whether to impose sanctions,the relevant question is not whether we would have come to the same decision if deciding the issue in the first instance.the relevant inquiry,rather,is whether the district court decision was the range of possible conclusions,or,metaphorically,in the ballpark.
in the context,the rule ballpark is large because,as discussed above,a district court has discretion to grant mercy for a violation of rule.moreover,no hard legal test governs the court exercise of this ability to be merciful.thus,in an ordinary rule case,although a district court could not arbitrarily ignore a rule violation,it has very broad discretion,and a remand will almost always be necessary.the pslra,however,eliminates this wellspring of discretion.
it follows that the pslra rule ballpark is much smaller.and while it is difficult to make generalizations about the size of its fences,because the rule inquiry is governed by an objective standard,it is clear that they will sometimes be so small as to admit only one conclusion.as discussed in part,supra,to conclude that rule has been violated,a district court must make two determinations.first,the court must determine that a paper was filed for an improper purpose,or contained legally frivolous claims,or contained factually frivolous claims.b.second,the court must decide that a reasonable investigation under the circumstances would have disclosed the frivolity.id.thus,if,for example,a statute of limitations clearly bars a claim and the record makes clear that the attorney had ample time for research a district court could only conclude that rule has been violated without abusing its discretion put differently,if the district court had the correct view of the law and facts in mind,it could only conclude that the claim is frivolous.see mcgregor,at a district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.emphasis added quoting cooter,at.at.
encapsulating this in a standard under the pslra,when the court of appeals can determine conclusively that rule has been violated,it should hold that sanctions must be imposed.in such a case,we would reverse the district court decision with respect to the claims a reasonably competent attorney could not have presented and remand the case for the imposition of sanctions.this standard finds support in precedent and avoids wasting the courts and litigants time and resources.
this standard is consistent with the clear precedent of this circuit.pelletier zweifel,cir concluding that a remand is unnecessary when the record demonstrates beyond any question that rule sanctions are in order.it also comports with how our sister circuits dispose of cases when a district court sanctions decision is unreviewable because no explanation is given,but the outcome is clear.see,carr tillery,cir imposing sanctions because the suit was so lacking in merit that its filing indicates a motive to harass made conclusive by the tone of the complaint and the briefs on appeal,even though the district court denied the motion without explanation citibank global,at concluding that no purpose would be served by remanding this case to the district court for rule findings pursuant to the pslra because,in part,the record revealed no basis for finding a rule violation dellastatious williams,cir finding no basis for sanctions under the pslra and,thus,concluding that a remand here would be unnecessary 
a case the court relies upon to justify its decision to remand,gurary winehouse,cir gurary i,illustrates how an unnecessary remand can invite error and waste resources.in gurary i,because the district court made conclusory pslra rule findings,the court of appeals remanded the case.id.at.on remand,the district court assumed the court of appeals regarded its findings as merely formalistic and simply gave a more detailed explanation of its original decision.gurary winehouse,wl,at.on appeal from that order,the second circuit reversed because two of the plaintiff claims were barred by both the plain language of the exchange act and case law.gurary winehouse,cir gurary ii.specifically,the guary ii court held that the plain language of rule would prohibit a court from adopting a rule that would support gurary claim.id.at.accordingly,the court remanded the case for a determination of the amount of sanctions.ultimately,it took a third appeal and one more remand to close the case but the parties and the court would have avoided considerable time and expense had the gurary i court pointed out the obvious.
to be sure,courts of appeals must exercise caution when deciding whether to remand a case.sometimes the rule violation will not be so clear as to admit only one conclusion.sometimes the party or attorney against whom sanctions have been imposed did not have the opportunity to be heard.sometimes the procedural history of the case will indicate that extenuating circumstances altered the standard of care for the prefiling inquiry.sometimes,particularly with respect to the prongs of rule,the record will not allow the court of appeals to determine conclusively whether sanctions were warranted.in those cases,a remand would be appropriate.but not in this case.
iv.with respect to plaintiffs federal securities law claims,the district court abused its discretion in denying sanctions 
after clearing the ground of any objection plaintiffs and their attorneys might have to a conclusion that they violated rule,i explain why the plaintiffs federal securities law claims and some of the factual allegations are so frivolous that the district court necessarily abused its discretion when it denied sanctions.that is,the violations are so clear that no matter what rationale the district court might have had,it abused its discretion when it denied sanctions.part a examines the federal securities law claims in all three complaints for rule b compliance part b examines all three complaints factual allegations pertaining to the securities law claims for rule b compliance part c then turns to whether the plaintiffs brought this action for an improper purpose under rule b part d explains how the district court should proceed on remand.
first,the ground clearing.the plaintiffs attorneys in this case had adequate notice of the possibility of sanctions and the possible grounds for the same the pslra itself gave statutory notice.see atsi commc ns shaar fund,cir by virtue of this statutory notice,consideration of sanctions in the pslra context can never be sua sponte and can never come as a surprise,because congress,not the court,has prompted and mandated a rule finding.moreover,as discussed above,in their motions to dismiss the three complaints,the defendants asked the court to retain jurisdiction to impose sanctions.in response to the second amended complaint,karp also sought sanctions in a separate motion.finally,the district court personally warned the plaintiffs attorneys about the requirements of rule.in response to these motions and in their briefs to this court,the plaintiffs attorneys never attempted to excuse their filing of frivolous claims because extenuating circumstances precluded an adequate prefiling investigation.nor could they have.the plaintiffs attorneys brought this case five months after filing a similar complaint against media in an indiana circuit court then,the district court gave the plaintiffs two chances to amend their initial complaint.because the plaintiffs attorneys had adequate notice and ample time to research the claims,all that remains to be decided is whether the complaints contained frivolous legal claims or factual allegations,or were brought for an improper purpose.
rule b compliance 
rule b prohibits claims that are not warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for changing existing law or the establishment of new law.b.the plaintiffs asserted claims under four federal securities law provisions which are subject to the pslra mandatory sanctions review the act claims,brought by thompson in the initial complaint and thompson and jacoby in the first amended complaint the act claims,brought by thompson in the initial complaint and thompson and jacoby in the first amended complaint the act b,rule claims the rule claim s,brought by thompson in the initial complaint,thompson and jacoby in the first amended complaint,and jacoby in the second amended complaint and the act a claims brought by thompson and jacoby in the first amended complaint and jacoby in the second amended complaint.
the section claims 
the claims advanced in both the initial and the first amended complaints are legally frivolous.section prohibits false or misleading statements in a registration statement.section provides,in relevant part,i n case any part of the registration statement,when such part became effective,contained an untrue statement of material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,any person acquiring such security may sue.id.a.thus,to state a claim,a plaintiff must show the purchase of a security under a registration statement,after the registration statement became effective,and that the registration statement contained a material misstatement or omission.herman maclean huddleston,d.because the claims in the initial and first amended complaints differed,i address each in turn.
a.the initial complaint section claim 
in the initial complaint,thompson was the only plaintiff,and the theory was the only alleged material misstatement or omission.thompson purchased media stock in two transactions shares in the june private offering,and shares in the open market after his shares were registered.
thompson private offering purchase could never have formed the basis for a claim because he did not purchase the shares under any effective registration statement.by definition,a private offering means that the shares were issued in reliance on an exemption from registration.it would have been impossible for thompson to rely on a registration statement that never existed.accordingly,as a private offering purchaser,thompson could never have succeeded on a claim.
because,however,thompson claimed to represent the open market based on his july open market and some of his class members purchased shares that had been registered.the class period stretched from may,to august,thompson first filed this suit on august.during that time,only two registration statements existed chubasco february statement,in effect for the entire class period,and media july registration statement,in effect after july.therefore,with the exception of one month,the sole registration statement in effect during the class period was chubasco.
it would have been impossible,however,for chubasco registration statement to misrepresent or omit media use of an unregistered broker because it became effective in february before any of this alleged wrongdoing took place.indeed,as of february,relationserve had not even been organized.without a crystal ball,it would have been impossible for chubasco to predict that relationserve would suggest a merger,much less that it would use an unregistered broker.therefore,no open market purchaser who bought before july,could ever have succeeded on a claim.
media first filed the other registration statement on march,to allow its private offering purchasers to sell their shares.this registration statement was amended three times and became effective on july.thus,for purchasers of media stock between july and august,thompson could at least identify an effective registration statement that was issued after the alleged use of an unregistered broker.
still,for the claim to have any chance of success,the july registration statement would have had to fail to disclose media use of an unregistered broker when it became effective.again,the theory was the only misrepresentation or omission identified in the initial complaint.the july statement,however,disclosed thompson state court action and thompson allegation that media failed to disclose a commission it paid to summit and altavilla.and indeed,thompson eventually contended that the may amendment to this registration statement corrected the alleged omission of media use of an unregistered broker.see second am.compl.between relationserve the sic may,disclosure in media amended registration statement and june,relationserve media shares fell this drop was caused by the public knowledge of thompson lawsuit.thus,even for this class of purchasers,thompson failed to identify any misstatement or omission.
even putting all of this aside,thompson could never have recovered on a claim based on his open market purchase.section expressly prohibits recovery by persons who at the time of the acquisition knew of such untruth or omission.a.by his own admission,thompson knew of media alleged use of an when he purchased the shares in july.accordingly,thompson could never have succeeded or adequately represented the open market purchasers on a claim.
particularly egregious was the initial complaint claim against the individual officers.for an individual to be liable under,the individual must have either signed the registration statement,been a director of the issuer at the time of the filing,been named as about to become a director,been named as a person having prepared or certified any report or valuation used in connection with the registration statement,or been an underwriter.id.none of the individual defendants were even affiliated with either media or chubasco when either registration statement was first filed nor do their names appear as having certified any report or valuation used in either registration statement.finally there is no allegation and there is no evidence that any of these officers sold stock under the registration statement,thus it would have been impossible for these individuals to act as underwriters.nevertheless,the plaintiffs sought to hold media and the individual defendants liable for violating.compl.
overall,thompson claim in the initial complaint is frivolous beyond doubt.none of the individual defendants had anything to do with either registration statement.as against media,the initial complaint attempted to state a claim on the basis of a registration statement that did not exist thompson private offering purchase,or,alternatively,a registration statement that never contained a material misstatement or omission when it became effective chubasco registration statement became effective long before any of the alleged misconduct took place and by the time media july registration statement became effective,it,too,had been cured of all deficiencies.finally,thompson admittedly knew of the alleged fraud when he purchased his shares,so the claim would fail even had the july registration statement omitted the alleged fraud.no argument for the modification of existing law could be deemed reasonable in view of thompson complete failure to satisfy the basic elements of.therefore,the district court necessarily abused its discretion by failing to sanction thompson attorneys for bringing this claim.
b.the first amended complaint section claim 
the first amended complaint claim differed from the initial complaint iteration by adding jacoby as a plaintiff,adding ten new individual defendants,and adding three new theories of misrepresentation.nevertheless,like the initial complaint,the first amended complaint claim is frivolous jacoby lacked standing to sue thompson knew of the alleged fraud.
as discussed above,any viable claim could only have been based on media july,registration statement.to have standing to sue under,a plaintiff must have bought the shares pursuant to an effective registration statement.huddleston,at.at.that is,a plaintiff must be able to trace the purchase of his securities to the registration statement that allegedly violated section.in re hamilton.sec,d,quoting in re unicapital.sec,d.here,jacoby swore that his only purchases of media stock occurred in july and august of.it therefore would have been impossible for jacoby to trace his stock to the july,registration statement and his claim is clearly frivolous.
turning to thompson two purchases,his attorneys new theories of alleged fraud did not render thompson claim.the july registration statement did not disclose the facts underlying the kickback,overstated income,and theories,but,even so,thompson could never have prevailed.for one,the theory is simply frivolous on the merits media had no duty to disclose the fact that a former director had been not necessarily found securities violations assuming that media had a duty to disclose the overstated income and kickbacks,thompson claim is still frivolous because,as discussed above,thompson admitted that he knew of the facts underlying the alleged fraud when he completed his july open market purchase see first am.compl.
most troubling,in both plaintiffs claims,the plaintiffs attorneys repeated their egregious claims against three of the initial complaint individual defendants who could never have been held liable for any violation based on the july registration statement.worse,in the face of the district court rule warning not to sue officers just because they were officers,the plaintiffs attorneys added ten new defendants,four of whom had nothing to do with the july,registration statement.this brought the total of individuals who were allegedly liable for the violation to thirteen,seven of whom could never have been liable under the plain language of.specifically,as to defendants karp,adler,musser,young,hill,honig,and hirsch,the plaintiffs claim is frivolous beyond any doubt young,hill,and honig never worked for media karp,adler,musser,and hirsch all ended their tenure with media well before the registration statement was first filed on march,
the section claims 
the as count ii in both the initial and first amended legally frivolous beyond doubt.section prohibits any person from offering or selling securities by means of a false or misleading statement in a prospectus or oral communication.because the act requires,in relevant part,that a prospectus include the information contained in the registration statement,a,there is substantial overlap between and.the major difference between the two statutes is that imposes a privity requirement not found in and allows liability for oral communications.see in re morgan stanley info.fund sec,cir.thus,even assuming that privity requirement is satisfied here,thompson and jacoby claims are frivolous for the same reasons as their claims 
nevertheless,in responding to the defendant motion to dismiss the first amended complaint,the plaintiffs attorneys defended thompson claims on the basis of certain oral communications by altavilla.see pls.resp.to defs.mot.to dismiss first am.this argument is frivolous because the plaintiffs never identified these oral communications in any complaint see,compl.first am.compl.
the section b,rule claims 
to evaluate the legal sufficiency of the rule claims in all three complaints,it is first necessary to clarify who brought the claim.in the initial complaint,thompson alone brought the claim in the first amended complaint,thompson and jacoby brought the claim together in the second amended complaint,jacoby alone brought the claim.i first discuss thompson rule claims in the initial and first amended complaints,and then turn to jacoby in the first and second amended complaints.
implementing b,rule forbids,in relevant part,any person,directly or indirectly b to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.to state a claim for an omission,a plaintiff must plead six elements with particularity an omission of material fact,made with scienter,in connection with the purchase or sale of a security,reliance on the omission,economic loss,and loss causation a causal relationship between the omission and the economic loss.see dura,broudo.
ultimately,i conclude that all of the rule claims are so frivolous that the district court necessarily abused its discretion when it denied sanctions.thompson claims are frivolous because he never identified a false or misleading statement and because he knew of the alleged fraud when he purchased his shares.jacoby claims are frivolous because he too failed to allege any actionable omission,he egregiously failed to allege scienter with the specificity required by the pslra and rule b,and because he advanced a frivolous argument so as to the starting point for measuring loss causation.
thompson rule claims 
neither of thompson purchases form the basis for a nonfrivolous rule claim.as for the purchase in the june private offering,thompson never identified any false or misleading statement.as for the july open market purchase,thompson admittedly knew about the alleged fraud when he bought the stock and suffered no loss that could have been traced to any fraud on the part of the defendants.
thompson identified no actionable false or misleading statement in connection with his june private offering purchase.the pslra requires plaintiffs to specify each statement alleged to have been misleading and the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading.b.in the initial complaint rule claim,thompson alleged only the theory of misrepresentation.compl.the trouble is that the june private offering formed the basis for this alleged omission,thus no sec filing prior to thompson purchase could have disclosed the alleged contingent contingency had not happened yet moreover,media did disclose summit unregistered status in the june current report,which thompson certified that he had read.thompson thus did could to any specific statement that was misleading because of media use of an unregistered broker prior to thompson june purchase.
in his indiana state securities law fraud claim brought in count vii of the initial complaint,thompson did allege other specific omissions.giving thompson attorneys the benefit of the doubt,i will assume that thompson meant to plead these same omissions in his rule claim.on this assumption,thompson alleged that media failed to disclose sizeable commissions and fees to altavilla and failed to explain that the shares in the private offering were restricted securities and were not registered.compl.but media disclosed all of this in the subscription agreement thompson signed.thompson acknowledge d that he has read and evaluated the company current report on form on june.relationserve media,current report form,ex.subscription agreement,june.the june,form attached media agreement with summit,including the provision that summit would be paid a seven percent finder fee.thompson also 
recognize d that the purchase of units involves a high degree of risk in that ii the units are not registered under the securities act of or any state securities law iii there is no trading market for the units,none is ever likely to develop,and the subscriber may not be able to liquidate his investment.
even further assuming thompson had he did in indiana circuit altavilla never provided him with the full subscription agreement and told him the shares would be registered and could be quickly sold for a profit,it would not save his rule claim.the subscription agreement expressly required thompson to 
represent that,except as expressly set forth in the offering documents,no representations or warranties have been made to the subscriber by the company or any agent,employee or affiliate of the company and in entering into this transaction,the subscriber is not relying on any information,other than that contained in the offering documents and the results of independent investigation by the subscriber.
id.at.in view of this representation,any argument that thompson justifiably relied on altavilla misrepresentation is frivolous.see rissman rissman,cir joining two courts of appeals in holding that clauses in written agreements preclude any possibility of damages under the federal securities laws for prior oral statements.and because justifiable reliance on a misrepresentation is a prerequisite to a rule recovery,even this hypothetical rule claim utterly fails.
any rule claim based on thompson july open market purchase is preposterous.it is hornbook law that an investor who is aware of the fraudulent conduct can not recover in a rule action predicated on that same fraudulent conduct because it is impossible to prove reliance or transaction causation.see thomas lee hazen,treatise on the law of securities regulation ed.see,gurary winehouse,cir.and indeed,by thompson own admission,he became aware of the alleged fraud on may,fully two months before his open market purchase.first am.compl.thompson did not discover the omissions set forth above until may.worse than simply knowing of the alleged fraud,when wearing the open market purchaser hat,thompson caused his own harm.specifically,he brought suit in an indiana circuit court,then,five months later,sued in federal court purporting to represent a class of shareholders injured by media failure to disclose the factual basis of his indiana lawsuit.thus,there can be no doubt that thompson purchased media stock in the open market with full awareness of the alleged fraud,if fraud there was,and could not,under any circumstances,have succeeded in a rule claim based on that purchase.
even assuming thompson did not have knowledge,he could never have proved loss causation.thompson purchased shares on july,at cents a share,only to sell them the very next day at cents per share.to prove loss causation,thompson would have needed to show that the market became aware of the alleged fraud in the hours between his purchase and sale.thompson alleged no such disclosure,nor could i find one.in fact,media did not file any sec documents on july or july,or any day thereafter until august.
for many of the same reasons,thompson could never have fairly and adequately represented the subclass of purchasers who bought media shares in the open market as required by federal rule of civil procedure rule a.unlike thompson,most open market purchasers who purchased before the disclosure of thompson indiana lawsuit,would not have had actual knowledge of media use of an unregistered broker.see,gary plastic packaging merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir c lass certification is inappropriate where a putative class representative is subject to unique defenses which threaten to become the focus of the litigation there is a danger that the absent class members will suffer if their representative is preoccupied with defenses unique to it.internal citations omitted 
worse,thompson had a fundamental conflict of interest with the open market purchasers.assuming,for the sake of argument,that thompson could have rescinded his private offering purchase,media illegal sale of securities gave him a de facto put option at two dollars.a put option grants the holder the right to sell the securities at a given price the seller promises to buy the securities at that price.thus if thompson could have rescinded his purchase,media would have had to return his full purchase price two dollars per share in exchange for the securities shares plus warrants.of course,thompson would never have exercised this right if the value of his shares grew beyond two dollars per share but if they fell,he could have recouped his entire investment less the cost of enforcement.thompson essentially had a investment that harmed the open market purchasers.accordingly,thompson derive d a net economic benefit from the very same conduct alleged to be wrongful to the open market purchasers.valley drug geneva,cir.when a named plaintiff has such a conflict with the proposed class,the named plaintiff can never adequately represent the class.see id.at a fundamental conflict exists where some party members claim to have been harmed by the same conduct that benefitted other members of the class.in such a situation,the named representatives can not vigorously prosecute the interests of the class through qualified counsel.quoting in re healthsouth.no reasonably competent attorney could have contended otherwise 
jacoby rule claims 
i now turn to jacoby rule claims in the first and second amended complaints.under a literal reading,jacoby claim is simply laughable.jacoby alleged that media and its officers offered and sold relationserve media securities in violation of and rule.second am.compl.emphasis added see also first am.compl.the defendants,including the individual defendants offered and sold the shares of relationserve media emphasis added.jacoby purported to bring this claim on behalf of the open market purchasers,but media never offered and sold securities in any public offering.rather,media only sold securities in exempt private offerings.no rule claim can survive on the basis of an offer and sale of securities that never existed.
in an abundance of caution,however,i will read jacoby rule claim broadly to invoke the doctrine.under the doctrine,a plaintiff must still plead all the elements of a rule claim,but benefits from a presumption that the plaintiff indirectly relied on the alleged misrepresentation by relying on the integrity of the stock price established by the market.see basic,at.at citing peil speiser,cir.
read broadly,jacoby claimed that media misstated its financial health in sundry sec filings by failing to report in contingent civil and criminal liabilities and other material information to the investing public.second am.compl.in the first amended complaint,jacoby asserted four theories of fraudulent omissions,which formed the basis of this liability the theory,the kickback theory,the theory and the theory.in the second amended complaint,jacoby only replicated the theory whether based on any of these theories,jacoby rule claim is legally frivolous.
the three abandoned theories are the easiest to conclude are frivolous.assuming media had a duty to disclose the kickbacks,overstated income,and sued director,jacoby never alleged that the truth became known to the market and that this failure caused any economic loss to him.no rule claim can survive without these elements jacoby completely failed to plead three chances to do any claim based on the theories frivolous 
only the theory remains.on this theory,jacoby,rule claim fails because jacoby never identified an actionable omission,utterly failed to plead scienter,and advanced an untenable theory of loss causation.
jacoby failed to identify an actionable omission 
most importantly,jacoby never identified any actionable omission.under the plain language of rule,for the omission of a material fact to be actionable,there must have been a duty to disclose the fact.prohibiting the omission of a material fact necessary to make the statements made not misleading.basic,at.at,silence,absent a duty to disclose,is not misleading under rule.most commonly,a duty to disclose is triggered either because the omitted fact was necessary to render a preexisting statement not misleading,or because the securities law otherwise required its disclosure.thomas lee hazen,supra.
here,jacoby identified no specific statements made by the defendants rendered actually misleading by the alleged omission,or any other duty to speak.the closest jacoby came was quoting the act certifications signed by officers adler and wasserman on media august form.second am.compl.jacoby alleged that adler and wasserman certified that the quarterly report complie d with the requirements of section a or d of the securities exchange act of and that the information contained in the report fairly present ed,in all material respects,the financial condition and results of the operations of the company.id.jacoby further alleged that the statements adler and wasserman made in their certifications were false and misleading because they failed to indicate that relationserve media and its officers and directors had violated state and federal securities law,presenting a contingent civil and criminal liability.id.as the district court aptly noted,however,jacoby argument is circular because it contends that the filing was misleading precisely because the filing promised not to be misleading.dismissal order,june.
again endeavoring to give the plaintiffs lawyers the benefit of the doubt,i will not stop here.i will assume that jacoby meant to say that,after the june private offering,media had a duty to report the contingent liability on its financial statements or sec reports either because of specific sec disclosure requirements or a gaap violation because media promised to comply with gaap even so,jacoby did not point to an actionable omission.
as relevant here,two on the form required management to disclose certain contingent liabilities.see et repealed.first,item of regulation required disclosure of any pending legal proceeding or of any proceeding that a governmental authority is contemplating if the small business issuer is aware of the proceeding.id.second,item of regulation required disclosure of a ny known uncertainties that have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the small business issuer or liquidity.id.b i emphasis added 
for its part,at the time,gaap,via financial standards accounting board fasb,financial accounting standards fas required the reporting of a loss contingency when there wa s at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred.fas,see also id.distinguishing loss contingencies that are probable,that is,the future event or events are likely to occur from those that are reasonably possible,that is,the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely from those that are remote,that is,the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.gaap did not require disclosure of loss contingencies arising out of unasserted claims when there was no indication that the potential claimant was aware of the claim,unless it was both probable that a claim w ould be asserted and there was a reasonable possibility that the outcome w ould be unfavorable.fas,
despite jacoby shotgun pleadings,his allegations do not even remotely suggest that media or any of its officers knew enough about thompson possible claim to trigger a reporting obligation under regulation or gaap.for one,as of august,media had no duty to report the claim as a pending legal proceeding.other than thompson march,indiana lawsuit,jacoby did not allege that any private placement purchaser sued media.nor did jacoby allege any government investigation into media contract with summit despite media full disclosure of that agreement in the june form.as a result,media had absolutely no duty to report the contingent liability as a pending legal proceeding.
nor did jacoby allege facts that would have required disclosure under item of regulation,management discussion and analysis.jacoby claimed that media should have disclosed a contingent liability arising out of the conduct of another entity,summit.in the consulting agreement,summit represented that it was not a registered broker and that it did not need to be a registered broker,because it would only act as a finder.under federal law,this contract was not per se illegal.see paul anka,sec letter,fed.sec.july,granting no action relief to a finder who would merely refer accredited investors to the issuer.state regulation of and finders varies.thus,to show a known uncertainty reasonably likely to have a material impact on media liquidity,jacoby would have had to plead some facts indicating that media knew that summit had breached its agreement and violated federal or state law jacoby failed to do so.
jacoby identified only one private offering transaction allegedly brokered by summit thompson the factual allegations concerning thompson purchase focused almost entirely on summit interaction with thompson rather than summit interaction with media.see,second am.compl.in june,altavilla began soliciting thompson and other class members and encouraged them to purchase relationserve media securities by way of a private offering.id.at thompson reviewed all documents presented by altavilla,and listened to the sales pitch of altavilla.it simply does not follow that because summit gave thompson a sales pitch that media knew about the sales pitch,much less that it would subject media to legal liability.
the closest jacoby came to alleging media awareness of summit breach was,altavilla negotiated the purchase price of thompson shares,facilitated the wire transfer,and oversaw the delivery of certificates.id.at.viewed in the light most favorable to jacoby,it could be inferred that altavilla had some contact with someone at media.it can not be inferred that whoever acted for media gleaned that the exchange gave thompson the ability to rescind his purchase,let alone that it was reasonably likely that thompson would seek rescission.
this is especially so in light of indiana law.thompson theory of liability relied on indiana securities law b.section b provided,in relevant part,i t is unlawful for a n issuer to employ an agent unless the agent is registered.b repealed.an agent was defined as an individual,other than a,who represents a n issuer in effecting or attempting to effect purchases or sales of securities.b repealed.however,an agent did not include an individual who represents an issuer in effecting transactions exempted by section b of this chapter.id.section b,in turn,exempted transactions where a the issuer reasonably believed there were no more than purchasers in indiana b the issuer did not offer or sell securities by means of a form of general advertisement or general solicitation c the issuer reasonably believed that each purchaser was buying for the purchaser own investment and was aware of the restrictions imposed on the transferability of the securities d e f g t he issuer need not have compl ied with clause d,e,or f if there were not more than fifteen purchasers in indiana and each indiana purchaser wa s an accredited investor id.
media had every reason to believe that it complied with this exception.media form d disclosed that there were only five indiana investors total.to qualify for the rule regulation d exemption under federal law,media could not have offered or sold securities by means of a general advertisement or solicitation.in signing the subscription agreement,thompson certified that he purchased the units for his own account,for investment only.relationserve media,current report form,ex.subscription agreement,june.additionally,thompson certified that he knew the shares were not registered under the act and that the shares could not be traded under federal law for at least one year and there can be no assurance that the conditions necessary to permit such sales will ever be satisfied.id.at see also id.at.finally,thompson certified that he was an accredited investor under indiana law consequently,even assuming that media knew of summit breach,media would have had little reason to suspect that thompson would have sued because he could not recover under state law 
even putting the exemption aside,this would still be correct.indiana law prevented plaintiffs who knowingly participated in a violation of the securities law from prevailing.see a repealed a person who offers or sells a security in violation of this chapter is liable to any other party to the transaction who did not knowingly participate in the violation or who did not have,at the time of the transaction,knowledge of the violation emphasis added.again,in the subscription agreement,thompson certified his knowledge of summit unregistered status and that he relied only on the offering documents.
by now,it should be apparent that jacoby did not plead sufficient facts to show that the alleged contingent liability was known,much less reasonably likely to materially impact media liquidity.therefore,regulation imposed no duty to report the contingent liability on media forms or.a fortiori,then,jacoby failed to allege sufficient facts to trigger a reporting obligation under gaap.under gaap,because jacoby did not allege that any lawsuit had even been threatened,media had a duty to report the purported liability only if it was both probable that a suit would be filed and reasonably possible that media would lose.i have already explained at length why media would have had no reason to believe either that thompson would have filed suit or that he could have succeed.
all in all,even giving jacoby the benefit of the doubt by assuming that he invoked the theory,jacoby completely failed to point out any actual statement that was misleading on account of the alleged omission or any other duty to speak.even further assuming that jacoby had pled a duty to report the liability under regulation or gaap,his claim is still frivolous because he alleged no facts that would have triggered any reporting requirement.an actionable misrepresentation or omission is step one in any rule claim jacoby failed to take this first step,and his claim is therefore frivolous under any reasonable view of the law.
ii.jacoby made only frivolous scienter allegations 
jacoby rule claim is also legally frivolous because he completely failed to plead scienter with the specificity required by established law.this is especially inexcusable with respect to the officers because the district court cautioned against just automatically su ing everyone that happens to be on the list of officers and directors.teleconference tr.
negligence has long been insufficient to trigger civil liability under rule.in ernst ernst hochfelder,the supreme court held that a defendant must act with scienter,defined as a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud,d.in this circuit,severe recklessness can amount to scienter,but it is the bare minimum.bryant avado brands,cir we quantify scienter as encompassing at least a showing of severe recklessness.severe recklessness is limited to those highly unreasonable omissions or misrepresentations that involve an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care.id.at quoting mcdonald alan bush brokerage,cir.
since,the pslra has required plaintiffs to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b emphasis added.thus,in a securities fraud class action,a plaintiff may no longer plead the scienter element generally,as was previously possible under rule b.rather,the complaint must allege facts supporting a strong inference of scienter for each defendant and with respect to each violation.phillips,cir.jacoby attorneys do not come close to meeting this standard because they alleged only conclusory statements,not facts giving rise to an inference of scienter.
jacoby best argument is that karp intentionally hid summit involvement in the june private offering on the form d she signed and filed with the sec.karp did not list summit in response to a question that asked for basic information about each person who has been or will be paid or given,directly or indirectly,any commission or similar remuneration for solicitation of purchasers in connection with sales of securities in the offering.relationserve media,notice of sale of securities pursuant to regulation d form d,at july.at the time,however,it was unclear that a finder constituted a person compensated for solicitation of purchasers.a new version of form d,adopted by the sec in,requires information about any person paid compensation in connection with the offering,including finders.thus,it is unclear that karp even knew that she needed to disclose summit on the form d,particularly so because media had already publicly disclosed that summit could act as a finder on the june,current report.
jacoby remaining scienter allegations can loosely be grouped into three categories the officers must have known,the venal character of the corporation,and motive and opportunity.
typical of jacoby they must have known allegation is the following the ongoing fraudulent scheme and violation of securities laws described in this complaint could not have been perpetrated over a substantial period of time without the knowledge and complicity of the personnel at relationserve media highest level,including the individual defendants.second am.compl.when jacoby filed the first and second amended complaints,it was absolutely clear that this sort of conclusory allegation could not satisfy the requirement that the complaint state facts with particularity.see,in re recoton.sec,d,conclusory allegations that do no more than state that the defendant would have known,knew and ignored,or recklessly failed to know are insufficient to state a claim under pslra and b.footnotes omitted.rather,this kind of allegation is a mere conclusion.and particularly because of the theory of liability asserted failure to disclose a contingent liability arising from summit breach of its contract with is a dubious conclusion at that.
this conclusory allegation that they must have known is particularly dubious when applied to certain officers.recall that the alleged fraud involved summit breach of the consulting agreement during the june private offering.media sec filings indicate that the offering ended on june.of all the individual defendants named in the complaints,only karp,hirsch,adler,and musser worked for media when summit allegedly breached the agreement.moreover,adler and musser did not commence their employment with media until june,only nine days prior to the end of the june private offering.all of the other individual defendants either never worked for media young,honig,and hill,or began their tenure after summit alleged breach concluded jehassi,wasserman,brauser,mcnamara,soltoff,obeck,and gould.see table at,infra.as applied to the latter group of defendants,the they must have known allegation is absurd.without more,especially after a personal warning from a district court not to sue officers just because they were officers,no reasonably competent attorney could have sued these officers 
perhaps recognizing the insufficiency of the they must have known allegations,jacoby counsel also alleged that accounting irregularities show that media had a venal corporate character.according to jacoby,an officer of media discovered a memorandum from richard hill a founder of relationserve to an employee in relationserve finance department instruct ing the employee to recognize specific revenue in violation of company operating procedures,applicable law,and accounting principles.second am.compl.this entire argument is frivolous because the alleged accounting irregularities were ordered by richard hill,who was never a media employee or even a defendant in the second amended complaint especially because the alleged misconduct violated company operating procedures,it can not be inferred that media had a venal corporate culture based on the misdeeds of a.
moreover,the media employee who allegedly followed hill instruction was not a corporate officer or defendant in the suit and never signed an sec filing.in any event,five months before jacoby filed his second amended complaint,this court squarely held that accounting irregularities,even violations of gaap in certified accounting statements,can not support an inference of scienter unless the officer certifying the statements was severely reckless.garfield ndc health,cir.this standard is satisfied if the person signing the certification had reason to know,or should have suspected,due to the presence of glaring accounting irregularities or other red flags,that the financial statements contained material misstatements or omissions.id here,jacoby pointed to no glaring violations in media certified accounting statements.thus,he based his venal corporate culture allegation on the misdeeds of two individuals when neither individual was a defendant in the second amended complaint and both acted in violation of company policy.without more,alleging that the defendant officers or media had a venal character is unfounded and irresponsible.
finally,jacoby claimed that scienter could be inferred because t he individual defendants engaged in the activities to inflate the price of relationserve media securities,to protect and enhance their respective positions,and to enhance the substantial compensation they obtained thereby.second am.compl.it is immediately apparent that,like the other scienter allegations,this one is conclusory.notably,jacoby never alleged that any officer or director defendant sold media stock during the class period,or did anything else that would support the motive and opportunity theory.it stands to reason,of course,that a company officers and directors have a motive to commit securities fraud.but that could be said of any public company officers and directors,which is why the precedent of this circuit squarely forecloses any argument that allegations of motive and opportunity will satisfy the pslra standard.bryant,at while allegations of motive and opportunity may be relevant to a showing of severe recklessness,we hold that such allegations,without more,are not sufficient to demonstrate the requisite scienter in our circuit.
jacoby scienter allegations boil down to three empty conclusions born of no facts because the defendants were officers or directors of media,they must have known about summit breach,they were immoral,and they had a motive to lie.these allegations probably fail under ordinary notice pleading standards they certainly fail under any reasonable view of the pslra heightened pleading requirements.without more,no reasonably competent attorney could have brought jacoby claim.
iii.jacoby advanced a frivolous loss causation argument 
finally,jacoby rule claim is legally frivolous because he advanced an untenable theory of loss causation.loss causation is an essential element of a rule claim and requires a plaintiff to prove that the defendant fraud proximately caused the plaintiff loss.dura,at.at.as explained above,jacoby rule claim alleged that media fraudulently hid a million contingent liability arising out of summit work in the june private offering.jacoby theory fails because he began to measure loss causation over twenty days after the market had learned of the alleged fraud.
even before dura,our cases explicitly require d proof of a causal connection between the misrepresentation and the investment subsequent decline in value.robbins koger,cir citing cases.to prove loss causation,a plaintiff must allege that the price inflation was removed from the stock price and caused the plaintiff losses.id.granting judgment as a matter of law for defendant company because there was no evidence that this price inflation caused by defendant fraud was removed from the market price of the stock.
jacoby loss causation theory boils down to this media may,disclosure of thompson indiana lawsuit corrected media failure to disclose its use of an unregistered on may,media shares traded at and eventually fell to per share on june,the may disclosure caused this stock price drop.media,however,initially disclosed thompson indiana suit on may.jacoby loss causation argument is frivolous because the market had already known and digested all the information supposedly added by the may disclosure.
on march,thompson filed his indiana lawsuit against media.media first disclosure of this lawsuit came in the may,amendment to the registration statement that was filed on march.that amendment disclosed,in pertinent part,that 
on march,richard thompson,thompson family wealth management,dwight thompson,greg thompson and parabolic investment fund,commenced an action in the state court of indiana,county of hamilton,against anthony altavilla,summit financial partners,llc,barron partners,lp,medsys and relationserve media.the plaintiffs in this action assert a variety of claims against defendants.as against the company,plaintiffs seek rescission of the rsmi common stock they purchased in july,alleging that the shares they received were not registered as required under indiana law,and that the company failed to disclose a commission to anthony altavilla.the company believes this action is without merit,and intends to vigorously defend itself with respect to this matter,however its outcome or range of possible loss,if any,can not be predicted at this time.the company can not provide any assurance that the outcome of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.
relationserve media,amend.to form registration statement form a,at may.jacoby seems to have alleged that this disclosure was insufficient because it was incomplete.see second am.compl.on may,relationserve media updated its disclosure concerning thompson lawsuit.
media filed a second amendment to the registration statement on may,which amplified the may amendment this amendment stated 
on march,richard thompson,thompson family wealth management,dwight thompson,greg thompson and parabolic investment fund,commenced an action in the state court of indiana,county of hamilton,against anthony altavilla,summit financial partners,llc,barron partners,lp,medsys and relationserve media.the plaintiffs in this action assert a variety of claims against defendants.as against the company,plaintiffs seek rescission of the shares of company common stock they purchased in july plaintiffs also received warrants for shares of rsmi common stock,alleging that the shares they received were not registered as required under indiana law,and that the company failed to disclose a commission.the company intends to file a motion to dismiss this action because the shares did not need to be registered under indiana law,as they were exempt from registration as a federal covered security.altavilla did not sell shares on the company behalf.altavilla did receive,in addition to other compensation,a finder fee in the amount of of total gross funding provided for introductions made by him to investors not already having a preexisting relationship with the company.
relationserve media,amend.to form registration statement form a,at may.
jacoby argument that the may amendment was incomplete and that the public did not know about the compensation package summit and altavilla received is frivolous.as relevant to the theory,the may amendment added the number of shares purchased by the plaintiffs,and that summit did not sell shares on media behalf but did receive a finder fee.the material aspects of both of these amplifications had already been disclosed to and digested by the market.the efficient market which jacoby that all publicly available information about a security is reflected in the market price of the security.as of july,the market knew that media sold worth of stock to five indiana investors.relationserve media,notice of sale of securities pursuant to regulation d form d,at july.as of june,the market knew that summit could act as a finder and would be paid a seven percent finder fee.relationserve media,current report form,ex.june.and as of march,the market knew that media paid summit a total success fee of in connection with its private placement of common stock.relationserve media,registration statement under the securities act of form,at march.accordingly,the market had absorbed this information well before the may amendment.if not,those shares were not being traded in an impersonal,and efficient market,as required for the application of the doctrine.basic,at.at.it follows that the proper starting place for measuring loss causation should have been no later than may.
the section a claims 
the a claims are frivolous beyond doubt.as discussed in part c,supra,a is a parasitic federal securities claim that imposes joint and several liability against individuals who,directly or indirectly,control any person liable under any provision of the act or of any rule and regulation thereunder.a.in this circuit 
a defendant is liable as a controlling person under section a if he or she had the power to control the general affairs of the entity primarily liable at the time the entity violated the securities laws and had the requisite power to directly or indirectly control or influence the specific corporate policy which resulted in the primary liability.
brown enstar group,cir quoting brown mendel,alteration in original see also theoharous fong,cir.
here,the plaintiffs attorneys alleged that each of the fourteen individual defendants in the first amended complaint and the eleven individual defendants in the second amended complaint were liable as control persons under a.all of the a claims are frivolous because the plaintiffs never pled a nonfrivolous primary rule claim.moreover,some of the defendants never even worked for media therefore,absent extraordinary facts not alleged here they could not conceivably have had the power to control either media general affairs or to directly or indirectly control or influence the specific corporate policy resulting in the primary liability.thus,even had the plaintiffs pled a valid rule claim,as against defendants young,hill,and never worked for a claim would still be clearly frivolous.either way,the a claims were so frivolous that the district court necessarily abused its discretion when it denied sanctions.
rule b compliance 
i now review all three complaints for rule b compliance.rule b requires that the factual contentions have evidentiary support or,if specifically so identified,are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.b.ordinarily,it is difficult for a court of appeals to conclude that a complaint factual contentions lack all evidentiary support because there is no requirement that all evidence be attached to the complaint.here,however,it is possible to conclude this with respect to some of the factual contentions because the plaintiffs attorneys misrepresented easily verifiable sec filings.after setting out these violations,i also point out suspicious factual contentions to facilitate the district court review on remand.
first,the blatant violations.as discussed above,in their claims,the plaintiffs attorneys alleged that each of the individual defendants met at least one of the statutory conditions necessary to their liability as individuals.paraphrasing,to be liable,an individual must have either,signed the registration statement in some capacity,been a director or named as about to become a director,or been an underwriter.see.when the plaintiffs filed suit,the two registration statements and the sec filings clearly indicated that eight of the named individual defendants could not possibly have fit into either of the first two categories.with respect to the underwriter category,with one exception,none of these eight individual defendants even sold shares under either registration statement.moreover,there is no allegation that any of the individual defendants had been underwriters.accordingly,the plaintiffs factual contention that these individual defendants fit into categories of those who could be held liable is frivolous beyond doubt.see also supra part.
moving on,in all three complaints,the plaintiffs attorneys alleged that media and its officers knew and failed to report in sec filings that summit and its agents were not registered with the sec.compl.first am.compl.second am.compl.but as explained above,media repeatedly disclosed summit unregistered status.on june,media made its entire agreement with summit public by filing it with the sec.the agreement declared it is specifically understood that summit is not and does not hold itself out be sic a,but is merely a finder in reference to the company procuring financing sources and candidates.relationserve media,current report form,ex.consulting agreement,at june.media attached the same agreement to its august quarterly report.see relationserve media,quarterly report form,at,incorporating the agreement by reference.in light of these disclosures,no reasonably competent attorney could have alleged that media failed to disclose summit unregistered status in its sec filings.
nor could a reasonably competent attorney have alleged,as plaintiffs attorneys did,that karp signed a form on june,which failed to indicate that relationserve media had contracted with summit to sell relationserve media securities or alert the investing public to the contingent civil and criminal liabilities that derive from this agreement.second am.compl.this is because karp never signed this form scott young did on behalf of the predecessor public corporation,chubasco.see chubasco resources,quarterly report form,at june,signed by scott young,dated june.plaintiffs counsel also alleged that karp signed a form o n june,second am.compl.but no such filing exists only a form was signed or filed on that date.no reasonably competent attorney could have contended that karp signed forms that were never filed or forms that were filed but without her signature.
i now turn to some of the questionable factual assertions that the district court should examine on remand.to begin,the first amended complaint contained allegations and defendants not realleged and renamed in the second amended complaint.the first amended complaint alleged altavilla sold media securities to florida resident stuart feick,and media received information about employee thefts and kickbacks in july.first am.compl.neither allegation appears in the second amended complaint.in the first amended complaint,the plaintiffs named barry honig and richard hill as defendants,but not in the second.to be sure,there may be a completely innocent explanation for not realleging these facts and renaming these defendants,but the district court must determine what evidentiary basis the plaintiffs had in the first place.
appearing in both the first and second amended complaints,another questionable factual contention is that media traded on the nasdaq stock exchange.see first am.compl.second am.compl.media sec filings indicate that it traded only on the national association of securities dealers bulletin board.this seems to be confirmed by the otcbb website,which has stock prices for media beginning in july through the filing of the second amended complaint.if media traded on nasdaq,jacoby would have had an easier time proving his rule claims.this is because jacoby seemed to invoke the doctrine,which requires a plaintiff to prove that the security traded on an efficient market.securities traded on nasdaq are often presumed to be traded on an efficient market,burke china aviation oil singapore,d,the nasdaq is recognized as maintaining an efficient market,but the court is unaware of any court holding that the otcbb or pink sheets meet this same standard.if an efficient market can not be presumed,a plaintiff must plead and prove its existence,id.although i can not take judicial notice that media never traded on nasdaq,the district court should explore the basis for the plaintiffs contention.
finally,in the initial and second amended complaints,jacoby in effect alleged that summit sold all of the securities in the june private offering where media grossed million dollars from buyers in california,connecticut,florida,illinois,indiana,nevada,new jersey,new york,ohio,and pennsylvania.relationserve media,notice of sales of unregistered securities form d,at,july.this allegation is implicit because the plaintiffs repeatedly claimed that media failed to report a million dollar contingent liability arising out of media sales of securities through summit.see,second am.compl,see also compl.in order to complete the purchase of relationserve media shares by the plaintiff and class members.this allegation is suspicious for two reasons.
first,other than thompson,in the initial and second amended complaints plaintiffs never provided specific facts about private offering purchasers in the other states.second,in the initial and second amended complaints,the plaintiffs never alleged that any unregistered broker participated in the sales except for summit.this latter point is significant because summit was entitled to a finder fee of the total gross funding provided by investors summit introduced to the company.relationserve media,current report form,ex.consulting agreement,at june.therefore,if summit had been responsible for all million raised in the june private offering,it would have earned a finder fee.media sec filings,however,indicate that summit received only.relationserve media,registration statement under the securities act of form,at march.thus,the district court should find out what evidence the plaintiffs had to support their claim that summit activity subjected media to a million liability.
i could go on,but will stop here.the plaintiffs attorneys must be sanctioned for their clear violations of rule b and the district court should explore their questionable factual those i identified and any remand.
rule b compliance 
rule b prohibits filing papers for an improper purpose.on this record,while there are indications that the plaintiffs attorneys brought this action for an improper purpose,it is not so clear that the district court necessarily abused its discretion in denying sanctions under rule b.
most troubling is that,in the face of a warning by the district court,the plaintiffs attorneys sued multiple officers with only the barest allegation that they had any part even knowledge alleged wrongdoing.this is especially so in light of the particular officers the plaintiffs added in the first amended complaint nine out of ten of the new defendants either never worked for media or began working there after and in most cases long after summit allegedly breached the consulting agreement.see table at,infra.and,particularly with respect to the claims,the defendants added four new plaintiffs who could not possibly be held liable under the statute bringing the total number of such defendants to seven eight if jehassi is included from the initial complaint.suing individual defendants without any legal or evidentiary basis is strong evidence that,as the defense counsel argued,plaintiffs were conducting scorched earth litigation.hr g trans.
and indeed,it could be inferred that the plaintiffs attorneys attempted to extort a settlement by strategically bringing frivolous claims,adding numerous defendants,overstating the scope of the plaintiffs injury,and filing difficult to decipher shotgun pleadings,all while counting on the district court not to clear the smoke.if plaintiffs counsel pursue this strategy long enough,defendants will settle.further evidence of this comes from plaintiffs attorney richard bell letter,replying to defense counsel warning that the suit was frivolous,that at some point in time both our clients will want to resolve or settle this case.
on the other hand,the plaintiffs attorneys did voluntarily drop some of the officer defendants and some of their frivolous claims.and as for bell letter,most civil cases settle.accordingly,it is unclear whether the plaintiffs attorneys were employing a calculated strategy or were just incompetent after considering any new rule b and violations,the district court should evaluate the evidence and determine whether the attorneys brought this case in bad faith or for an improper purpose.
finally,i note that the district court must determine whether jacoby or thompson violated rule the current record is much less developed in this regard,but there is still one fact that raises an eyebrow thompson purchase on july,of media shares,only to sell them the next day for a small loss.this could indicate that thompson purchased the shares to enable himself to act as lead plaintiff for the open market purchasers.the district court should consider this on remand.
d.the plaintiffs attorneys rule violations trigger the pslra presumptive sanction of attorney fees and other expenses 
having identified the violations of rule b that can be conclusively determined from the record,all that remains is to determine whether the violations are substantial.the pslra creates a presumptive sanction of a defendant attorneys fees incurred in the action for any complaint that substantially fails to comply with rule.
here,i would hold that the plaintiffs attorneys triggered this presumption three separate times.in the initial complaint,all of the federal securities claims violated rule b the claim,the claim,and the rule claim.
in the first amended complaint,all of the federal securities claims violated rule b thompson and jacoby claims,claims,rule claims,and a claims.in the second amended complaint,jacoby realleged his frivolous rule and a claims.even setting aside the rule b violations and the possibility of b improper purpose violations,it is clear that each of the three complaints substantial ly fail ed to comply with rule.c a ii on remand,the plaintiffs will have the opportunity to rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the award of attorneys fees would impose an unreasonable,unjust burden on them and that the failure to award fees would not impose a greater burden on the defendants.see c b i.
in sum,with respect to karp motion for rule sanctions under the pslra,i would hold as follows.i would hold that the plaintiffs attorneys violated rule b with respect to every federal securities claim brought in this case.i would hold that the plaintiffs attorneys violated rule b by alleging that some of the individual defendants met statutory requirements,karp signed and filed sec filings that she never signed or filed,and media never disclosed summit unregistered status.finally,i would hold that the rule b violations triggered the pslra presumptive sanction of the defendant attorneys fees incurred in the entire action.a remand would still be necessary for four determinations whether thompson and jacoby violated rule,whether the plaintiffs attorneys violated rule b by filing any or all of the complaints for an improper purpose,whether other rule b violations exist,and,in any event,whether the plaintiffs can rebut the pslra presumptive award of attorneys fees.i would also instruct the district court to consider whether the plaintiffs should be sanctioned under for unreasonably and vexatiously multiplying these proceedings.
v.the court errs by ignoring karp for rule sanctions on the state law claims advanced in the second amended complaint 
the court does not address karp seeking rule sanctions against the plaintiffs attorneys for filing the state law claims.karp properly moved for rule sanctions only with respect to the second amended complaint.see.c requiring that a motion for sanctions be made separately from any other motion and be served but not filed for days.the district court did not consider karp motions for sanctions because it refused to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over the claims and dismissed them without prejudice.such a dismissal does not and should not insulate frivolous claims from rule scrutiny.accordingly,i would vacate the district court refusal to consider rule sanctions on the state law claims brought in the second amended complaint and order the district court to decide whether to impose sanctions for those claims.
vi.conclusion 
congress enacted the pslra to address the evils flowing from abusive securities litigation,especially in the class action format as the senate judiciary committee observed,these evils generally have their onset with the filing of the complaint and continue through to the final disposition of the action.among other evils,these actions generate an in terrorem effect on corporate america,add ing significantly to the cost of raising capital and represent ing a litigation tax on business.this is precisely what has occurred in this case.in addition to imposing a litigation tax on media,this action has wreaked havoc on individuals who had absolutely nothing to do with the injuries purportedly suffered by jacoby and thompson and the members of the classes they attempted to represent.
a careful reader of the orders and opinions in this district court perfunctory order refusing to sanction plaintiffs counsel because,although plaintiffs were unable to state a claim sufficient to withstand a rule b motion to dismiss,their claims were not frivolous,and this court conclude that congress was out to lunch when it enacted the pslra.for,if this case is typical,the federal courts can not,as a practical matter,enforce the pslra.that is,if a case is pled as this case was,handled in the district court as this case was,and disposed of on appeal as this case is,i doubt that the time,expense,and burden on judicial resources incurred in pslra enforcement is worth the candle.the point is not to pick fault with congress for passing the pslra the point is that the courts must carry out the pslra mandate by enforcing it in a manner consistent with congressional intent.
this case was litigated under the rule b umbrella.the initial and two succeeding complaints were typical shotgun pleadings and thus were practically incapable of precise comprehension by the district judge and opposing counsel.after reading the first amended complaint,the district judge indicated as much in a telephone conversation he conducted with counsel.referring to the complaint allegations,he made these observations nothing is tied together i see very little connecting the dots seems to me there are some real gaps there again,it kind of hard to follow.it like who did what the court therefore gave plaintiffs counsel one more chance to file a comprehensible pleading that would connect the dots,close the gaps,and explain who did what.they responded with the second amended complaint.it did not clear the air,so the court dismissed it under rule b for failure to satisfy the heightened pleading standards of rule b and the pslra.
when the court subsequently turned to the question of whether the plaintiffs their attorneys should be sanctioned under the pslra for noncompliance with the requirements of rule b,it did not parse the allegations of the complaints that had been filed,as i have done here.rather,it perfunctorily reference to any of the complaints plaintiffs had complied with rule.the court stated,plaintiffs claims are not frivolous,or so devoid of evidentiary support as to warrant sanctions.likewise,there is no evidence that plaintiffs instituted this action for improper purposes,such as to harass defendants or needlessly increase the cost of litigation.order on mot.for fees and rule sanctions,june,internal citations omitted.i am convinced that the court ruled in this way because it did not realize just how insufficient the pleadings were the court was too busy to plow through the pleadings and see them for what they smoke and mirrors.
this case demonstrates that it is easy for a district court to dismiss a federal securities law complaint under rule b and rule b without carefully parsing it,identifying which allegations pertain to which claims,and squeezing the controversy down to its core.that approach,however,is not consistent with the pslra requirements.the pslra forces a district court to determine whether the complaints in this each requirement of rule b,and,having done that,to enter in the record specific findings regarding compliance with those requirements the approach the court must take is the one i have taken here parse the complaint allegations,determine which allegations pertain to which claims,and examine the claims under the pslra lens.
the pslra and the broader interests of justice would best be served by a district court laying the foundation for this task early on.here,for example,the district court could have done so after it examined plaintiffs first amended complaint it could have parsed the complaint,detailed the problems,and,pursuant to its inherent power,ordered a repleader.such an order would be akin to a federal rule of civil procedure e motion for a more definite statement in that it would point out the defects of the complaint and explain what would be necessary to cure them we have stated on several occasions that 
the importance of using the rules to uncover bogus claims and defenses,thereby reducing the parties dispute to its bare essentials,can not be overemphasized.as we have stated on several occasions if,in the face of a shotgun complaint,the defendant does not move the district court to require a more definite statement,the court,in the exercise of its inherent power,must intervene sua sponte and order a repleader implicit in such instruction is the notion that if the plaintiff fails to comply with the court filing a repleader with the same court should strike his pleading or,depending on the circumstances,dismiss his case and consider the imposition of monetary sanctions.
byrne nezhat,cir footnote in original 
the attorneys representing the plaintiffs in this case purport to be sophisticated class action lawyers who specialize in federal securities law cases.i have no doubt that faced with a detailed order requiring a more definite statement connecting the dots,filling in the gaps,and indicating who did what,so that the allegations would not be hard to follow,sophisticated securities lawyers would have done a better job of drafting the second amended complaint.better yet,had the court engaged counsel in chambers,explained what the pslra and rule b demanded,and told them what they would have to allege to stay in court,we probably would not be here.counsel would have dismissed the case voluntarily under federal rule of civil procedure a a,or,if they produced an amended complaint that simply mimicked their earlier complaint as the second amended complaint did,the court,in the exercise of its discretion,would have dismissed the complaint under rule b and its inherent power for failure to comply with a court order had the court dealt with plaintiffs counsel in this way,it would have been easier for the of the tact plaintiffs counsel may have taken in responding to the court demand for a more definite carry out its pslra duties at the end of the day.
of course,that is not how the district court handled this case.and that would have been satisfactory had the district court taken up the task of parsing the complaints at the end of the action.instead,the district court kicked the task down the road.today,this court unfortunately follows the same approach.this judicial approach takes the teeth out of the pslra and delays the day when the parties will have repose.meanwhile,litigants in the court queue waiting to have their cases heard will have to wait even longer.worst of all,handling pslra cases in this manner destroys confidence in the ability of the courts to resolve disputes and administer civil justice.congress,the courts,the litigants,and the public deserve better.
