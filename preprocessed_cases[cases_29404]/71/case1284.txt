this appeal challenges an opinion and order of the securities and exchange commission denying two certified public accountants the privilege of practicing before the commission.it revisits the question of whether the commission has articulated a clear standard for a finding of improper professional conduct under rule e of its rules of practice,e.we conclude that the lack of clarity identified in the two checkosky sec opinions of the court,checkosky i,and checkosky ii,was not rectified until rule e was amended in.as amended,rule e establishes that one of the mental states required for a finding of improper professional conduct,is recklessness,defined as an extreme departure from the standard of ordinary care for auditors.although the rule is clear now,because it was unclear at the time of the sanctioned conduct in and the commission application of the amended rule is impermissibly retroactive,we grant the petition for review.
michael marrie and brian berry,as employees of the accounting firm,coopers lybrand llp coopers,acted as engagement partner and manager,respectively,for coopers audit of california micro devices,cal micro,which designs,manufactures,and distributes electric circuits and semiconductors.as engagement partner and engagement manager,marrie and berry were responsible for ensuring that the fiscal year audit of cal micro was conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards gaas,and that the financial statements filed with the securities and exchange commission were in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap.they prepared an audit plan and began field work in july,and on september,filed with the commission the company form annual financial report for the fiscal year ending june.
marrie and berry conducted the audit against a backdrop of massive financial reporting fraud by cal micro,unknown to the accountants.the commission found that in fiscal year,the company fraudulently recognized revenue and receivables for the sale of unshipped or products,even though its stated policy was to recognize revenue for products only upon shipment to customers falsified sales records,invoices,and shipping documents,such as shipping merchandise to fictitious customers and improperly overstated net assets and income,while understating net loss.cal micro had attempted to make reported revenues as high as possible in order to maintain the impression of growth after it had lost one of its major customers,apple computer,which had accounted for of the company total product sales the prior year.to avoid detection for improper revenue recognition,cal micro management attempted to clean the company books before the end of the fiscal year,informing marrie and berry that it had decided to issue approximately million in credit to write off certain accounts receivable.on august,however,cal micro issued a press release announcing its net income and earnings for the fourth quarter of,and stated that it was writing off million,not million of accounts receivable,million of which was written off as bad debt expense.because amounts written off for returned products would be deducted directly from reported revenues,while amounts written off as bad debt would be treated as expenses and would not decrease reported revenues,cal micro attempted to maximize the portion of the allocated to bad debt expense.following the august,press release,however,cal micro stock price dropped and shareholders brought a lawsuit alleging accounting improprieties.
regardless,on august,marrie and berry,on behalf of coopers,presented their independent accountants report addressed to cal micro shareholders and directors,stating that cal micro financial statements complied with gaap and that the audit had been conducted in accordance with gaas.following an independent investigation,cal micro filed a revised financial report with the commission on february,showing a net loss of million instead of earnings of million,total revenue of million rather than the previously reported million,accounts receivable of million instead of million,million in inventories instead of million,and net property and equipment of million instead of the previously reported million.
on august,just shy of five years after marrie and berry presented the audit report to cal micro shareholders,the commission,through the division of enforcement and office of the chief accountant,instituted disciplinary proceedings against marrie and berry pursuant to rules e ii and e iv a.the commission alleged that marrie and berry had engaged in improper professional conduct in that they each violated gaas by failing to exercise appropriate professional skepticism,obtain sufficient competent evidential matter,or adequately supervise field work in connection with three aspects of the audit the of million of accounts receivable the confirmation of the accounts receivable and the accounting of the sales returns and allowances for sales returns.the commission also claimed that marrie and berry failures to examine the,to investigate discrepancies in the confirmation responses,and to analyze cal micro sales returns and the adequacy of its allowance for returns,were an extreme departure from professional standards.further,according to the commission,marrie and berry were reckless in ignoring unmistakable red flags that indicated potential accounting irregularities in the areas of revenue recognition,accounts receivable confirmations,sales returns,sales cutoff,and cash collections.as a result,the commission alleged that cal micro financial statements for the fiscal year were materially false and misleading and were not prepared in conformity with gaap.
on september,an administrative law judge alj dismissed the charges,finding that marrie and berry had not engaged in improper professional conduct within the meaning of rule e.the alj ruled that reckless conduct under rule e iv a must approximate an actual intent to aid in the fraud being perpetrated by the audited company,and that the commission had failed to prove that marrie and berry conduct had been reckless.in re marrie,initial decision of the alj,release,file,at,in re marrie i.on july,the commission reversed the dismissal of the charges and imposed remedial sanctions barring marrie and berry from practicing before the commission,subject to rule e provision for reinstatement.see e.in sanctioning marrie and berry,the commission stated that t he question is not whether an accountant recklessly intended to aid in the fraud committed by the audit client,but rather whether the accountant recklessly violated applicable professional standards.recklessness,then,can be established by a showing of an extreme departure from the standard of ordinary care for auditors.in re marrie,exchange act release,wl at july,in re marrie ii.according to the commission,proof of an actual intent to defraud or assist in a fraud was not required.id.at.nor was it necessary to show that the auditor had filed a materially misleading document an auditor who fails to audit properly under gaas should not be shielded because the audited financial statements fortuitously are not materially misleading.id.at.finally,the commission did not consider a good faith defense.the commission found that marrie and berry recklessly violated fundamental principles of audit work,failed to exercise due care and appropriate professional skepticism,and failed to collect sufficient competent evidential matter to provide a basis for the audit opinion with respect to cal micro,accounts receivable,and sales returns.id.at.
rule e,e,provides the commission with a means to ensure that the professionals on whom it relies perform their tasks diligently and with a reasonable degree of competence.touche ross sec,cir.it is directed at protecting the integrity of the commission own processes,as well as the confidence of the investing public in the integrity of the financial reporting process.recognizing the particularly important role played by accountants in preparing and certifying the accuracy of financial statements of public companies that are so heavily relied upon by the public in making investment decisions,the commission,following the court checkosky opinions,adopted amendments to rule e to specify under what circumstances accountants could be held liable under the rule.prior to the amendments,rule e provided that 
generally.the commission may censure a person or deny,temporarily or permanently,the privilege of appearing or practicing before it in any way to any person who is found by the commission after notice and opportunity for hearing in the matter i not to possess the requisite qualifications to represent others or ii to be lacking in character or integrity or to have engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct or iii to have wilfully violated,or willfully aided and abetted the violation of any provision of the federal securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder.
e emphasis added.on june,in response to the court holding in checkosky ii,at,that the commission had failed to articulate a clear standard for improper professional conduct,the commission proposed amendments to rule e to set forth categories of conduct that would constitute improper professional conduct.the amendments provided,among other things,that a finding of improper professional conduct could be made based on reckless conduct,as defined in the securities fraud context,see sec steadman,sundstrand sun chem,cir,cert.denied,d,but with no accompanying requirement of an actual intent to defraud.the amendments,effective november,added the language in rule e iv,which provides 
with respect to persons licensed to practice as accountants,improper professional conduct under e ii means a intentional or knowing conduct,including reckless conduct,that results in a violation of applicable professional standards or b either of the following two types of negligent conduct 
a single instance of highly unreasonable conduct that results in a violation of applicable professional standards in circumstances in which an accountant knows,or should know,that heightened scrutiny is warranted.
repeated instances of unreasonable conduct,each resulting in a violation of applicable professional standards,that indicate a lack of competence to practice before the commission.
e iv emphasis added.
marrie and berry contend that the commission impermissibly retroactively applied its based recklessness standard to the rule e proceedings for conduct occurring in,and erred in finding recklessness where there was no knowing violation or intent to defraud.the commission responds that retroactivity is not an issue because rule e iv a is consistent with its practice well before the misconduct at issue,and that in the commission simply codified a standard that had been applied previously.it maintains that in borrowing the definition of recklessness from steadman,at,and sundstrand,at,it was not required to import into its rule the requirement in those cases of actual knowledge of fraud.in its brief,the commission states that the applicable professional standards at issue in the rule are indisputably not.respondent br.at.
the court has engaged in an extended dialogue with the commission about its standard for sanctioning professionals for improper professional conduct.the court has twice concluded that the commission had failed to articulate an intelligible standard for improper professional conduct under rule e ii,the predecessor to rule e,and had failed to specify what mental state was required for a violation of the rule.in checkosky i,at,where there was no majority opinion,judge silberman,writing separately,referred to two unreconciled lines of commission based on negligence,the other on whether a professional acting in good faith could be subject to discipline for improper professional conduct.the commission had stated that a mental awareness greater than negligence wa s not required,checkosky i,at,but also note d that the accountants conduct rose to the level of recklessness.id.at.the judge concluded it was unclear both whether simple negligence could constitute a violation of the rule,and also whether recklessness meant a higher form of ordinary negligence,or a lesser form of intent,as defined in steadman,at,and sundstrand,at.see checkosky i,at.those cases defined recklessness as not merely a heightened form of ordinary negligence,but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it.steadman,at citations omitted sundstrand,at.in steadman,the court stated that this type of recklessness was a lesser form of intent.steadman,at quoting sanders john nuveen,cir.
judge randolph,by contrast,concluded that there was no ambiguity with regard to the commission finding that negligence sufficed for a violation of rule e ii,id.at,but that the commission had failed adequately to justify its ruling that accountants could be suspended from practice under rule e ii without any proof of an intent to defraud or bad faith.id.at.referring to the commission decision in in re carter,transfer binder fed.sec.cch,involving a rule e proceeding against lawyers,he concluded that the commission had failed adequately to justify why auditors,but not lawyers,could be found to have engaged in improper professional conduct without proof of an intent to defraud.id.at.as the language of rule e ii drew no distinction between professionals,applying to any person who practices before the commission,id.at,and the definitions from the federal securities laws did not make culpability turn on the nature of the professional,id.at,he reasoned that the commission was obligated in changing course to supply a reasoned analysis,which it had failed to do.see id.at.because he concluded that the commission had acted arbitrarily and capriciously,vacation of the commission order was required in his view rather than the simple remand to the commission that was favored by judge silberman and adopted by the court.id.at.
on remand the commission provided a further explanation,then affirmed the suspension of the accountants.but,in checkosky ii,at,the court concluded that the commission had still failed to provide a uniform theory as to the necessary mental state for a violation of rule e ii.in the court view,the commission on remand had simultaneously embraced and rejected standards of recklessness,negligence,and strict liability,with no guidance as to which standard it had relied upon in finding a violation of the rule.id.at.although the commission first appeared to rely on a theory of recklessness,it proceeded to state that it was treating recklessness as relevant only to the sanction,that rule e ii did not mandate a particular mental state,and that negligence could,under certain circumstances,constitute improper professional conduct.id.at citations omitted.the commission did not define those circumstances with any degree of specificity,and offered no further definition of negligence than those deviations from gaap or gaas that threaten the integrity of the commission processes.id.this left open the possibility,the court observed,that the standard might not even require a showing of negligence,for there was no way of knowing in advance what kind of errors,innocent mistakes or isolated,serious deviations from gaas or gaap would meet this standard.id.at.in addition,the court concluded the commission had again failed to articulate a clear standard for the mental state required to violate rule e ii.id.at.for these reasons,the court observed that the commission statements come close to a license to charge and prove improper professional conduct whenever it pleases,constrained only by its own discretion combined,perhaps,with the standards of gaas and gaap.id.because of strong signs that the commission was unlikely to provide a uniform theory anytime soon,the court remanded with instructions to dismiss the charge.id.at.
congress has codified rule e as amended in in the act of,and we begin with the observation that in the amended rule e,the commission has cured the defects identified in checkosky i and ii.absent such a conclusion,there would be no need to address marrie and berry retroactivity contentions for,once again,the rule would be unclear.
the amended rule clearly sets out the standard for when an accountant is deemed to have engaged in improper professional conduct.it provides that improper professional conduct means i ntentional or knowing conduct,including reckless conduct that results in a violation of applicable standards.e iv a.it also identifies two types of negligent conduct that would warrant sanctions.id.e b.in its accompanying explanation of the amended rule,the commission stated that for purposes of consistency under the federal securities laws,it was adopting the definition of recklessness used for substantive violations of the securities laws.amendments to rule e of the commission rules of practice,fed.sec.cch,at,adopting release.thus,recklessness means not merely a heightened form of ordinary negligence,but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the actor or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it.id.the commission added,this recklessness standard is a lesser form of intent.id.however,it emphasized that the standards for finding a violation of professional conduct were not fraud based,indicating that the elements for violations of professional practice would not be identical to that of the federal securities laws.in explaining the amended rule,the commission also rejected suggestions that filing a materially false or misleading document should be a threshold requirement for a finding of improper professional conduct,concluding that,a n auditor who fails to audit properly under gaas should not be shielded because the audited financial statements fortuitously turn out to be accurate or not materially misleading.id.at.finally,the commission stated that good faith,although it may remain relevant in determining the appropriate sanction,would not be a defense to reckless conduct,because good faith would be inconsistent with a finding of knowing or intentional,including reckless,conduct.id.at.thus,as of november,when the amendments took effect,the commission provided a uniform theory of the necessary mental state required for a finding of improper professional conduct,see checkosky ii,at,defined recklessness,and specified the types of negligent conduct that would result in a violation of the rule.see checkosky i,at silberman.further,in amending the rule,the commission accompanying statement eliminated any lack of clarity as to good faith created by its precedents.see,checkosky i,at silberman.
the language and history of the amended rule support the commission interpretation that recklessness under that rule can be demonstrated simply by evidence of an extreme departure from the standard of ordinary care for auditors.in re marrie ii,at.in this case,the commission explained that a dherence to applicable professional auditing standards protects the commission processes regardless of whether a fraud has been committed.id.the commission further explained in in re marrie ii that r equiring proof of a mental state approximating an actual intent to aid in the fraud committed by the audited company would conflict with this purpose and fail to protect the commission processes from accountants who lack competence to appear before it.id.the commission reasoned that a based standard was warranted given the heavy reliance that it and the public placed on accountants to assure disclosure of accurate and reliable financial information as required by the federal securities laws.id.although it stated in a cryptic footnote that the concept of materiality continued to be relevant,see id.at,it explained that the rule did not require a showing that the financial statements filed by the accountants be false or materially misleading,for the commission concern was to protect the integrity of its processes and investor confidence in its markets.id.at.thus,a n auditor who fails to audit properly under gaas should not be shielded because the audited financial statements fortuitously are not materially misleading.an auditor who skips procedures designed to test a company reports or looks the other way despite suspicions is a threat to the commission processes.id.at.
the amendments reflect choices that the commission was authorized to make in promulgating its rule,and marrie and berry do not contend to the contrary.instead,they contend that the commission took diametrically opposite positions in explaining the amendments and in its holding in their case.they proceed on the basis that the commission adoption of the definition of recklessness also required inclusion of a fraud element.but,in contending that they could not be found culpable absent a finding of conscious or deliberate conduct,which the commission conceded was lacking,their premise is faulty.the commission authority to discipline professionals has long been distinguished from the execution of its substantive enforcement functions.see touche ross,at.marrie and berry proceed under the erroneous assumption that because the commission borrowed the definition of recklessness used in substantive provisions,it also was required to adopt other elements of a securities fraud violation into rule e iv a,such as the requirements of an intent to defraud and materiality.as explained in checkosky i,however,rule e,the predecessor to rule e,was analytically distinct from substantive provisions of the securities laws,and cases such as steadman,at,which involved those provisions,were not determinative in the analysis of whether improper professional conduct had occurred.see checkosky i,at silberman.their contention,therefore,that recklessness must involve deliberate or conscious conduct by an auditor,fails to appreciate that the line of cases addressed violations of section b of the securities and exchange act and rule that were targeted specifically at securities fraud.here,the commission did not,and did not need to,charge fraud or aiding and abetting the fraud of cal micro,but instead charged marrie and berry on the basis of formulated standards of professional practice designed to protect the commission processes.
no more problematic is marrie and berry contention that the amended rule is arbitrary and capricious,see,or unconstitutionally vague,see gates fox occupational safety health review comm n,by failing to provide fair warning of the conduct it prohibits or requires,and by incorporating an elastic concept of recklessness that opens the door to of accountants judgment calls.because of t he complexity of gaap and gaas,see checkosky i,at randolph,quoting james strother,the establishment of generally accepted accounting principles and generally accepted auditing standards,vand,calling for j udgments to be made about specific transactions about which auditors could disagree,defining recklessness in the context of audits entails obvious difficulties.see id.citing jerry sullivan et,montgomery auditing ed.in the amendments,however,the commission has specified the applicable intent standard and has limited the occasions where it will find sanctionable conduct to extreme departure s from professional standards that demonstrate that an accountant lacks competence to practice before the commission.adopting release,at.it can not be gainsaid that the commission could reasonably conclude that any licensed accountant is on notice of professional standards generally and of what constitutes extreme departures in particular.for this reason,professional disciplinary rules have withstood vagueness challenges.see,united states hearst,cir.the duties to exercise due care,see american institute of certified public accountants aicpa,codification of statements on auditing standards,au,to obtain sufficient evidential matter,see id.au,and to exercise professional skepticism,see id.au,are standards to which all accountants must adhere.potts sec,cir.see in re potts,see also ponce sec,cir checkosky i,at randolph.rule of aicpa code of professional conduct recognizes the codification of statements on auditing standards as an interpretation of gaas.as the commission explained in the instant case,professional misc
