several individual investors appeal from judge crotty dismissal of their complaint alleging securities fraud in violation of section b.we dispose of this appeal by both summary order and opinion.in the summary order issued simultaneously with this opinion,we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part with regard to most appellees.in this opinion,we affirm the dismissal of the federal claim and vacate and remand on the state law claim with regard to one group of appellees,principally isaac dweck 
background 
this litigation arises out of a fraudulent scheme engaged in by a,baron baron.over the course of four years beginning in,baron defrauded customers of millions of dollars.as a result,baron former officers,directors,and key employees have been convicted of various crimes.
as pertinent here,and based on the complaint,the allegations of which we assume to be true,baron scheme used sales campaigns involving cold calls to potential customers.the goal of the scheme was to induce the customers to purchase securities in initial public offerings of small,unknown companies with negligible profits.the salespeople would falsely represent that the stocks were the subject of an active,rising market,and the purchasers were led to believe that the prices they paid were set by trading in that market.in fact,the market was principally a series of artificial trades orchestrated by baron designed to create a false appearance of volume and increasing price.baron scheme was a paradigmatic pump and dump scheme.
the scheme was in part furthered by parking stock with trusted baron investors,including dweck.parking would involve placing stock in the investor account while baron retained the risk of loss by promising to buy back shares,if necessary,at a price that afforded the insider a guaranteed profit.based on baron salespeople false representations of trading volume and increasing stock prices inducing customers to buy,baron and its would sell their holdings at a profit before the stock crashed.
appellants do not allege a liquid,efficient market in the securities.rather,they allege that the only market for them was based on artificial trading by baron and others.see pls.first am.compl.at t here was no real market for the manipulated securities outside of baron,and its customers,and other brokers with whom it conspired.because of the limited public information available few,if any,were followed by other brokerage firm analysts,baron brokers were able to box the stock.appellants alleged that baron and bear stearns,see infra note,falsely represented the securities were trading in an active,liquid,bona fide market,see pls.first am.compl.at,and that appellants believed the price at which the securities were offered was that established by that public market rather than an artificial price established by baron.the deception on which appellants relied,therefore,were statements by baron salespeople that the customers were buying at a price set by public market activity.
the complaint alleged that dweck was one of baron principal investors,provided baron with cash infusions and financing for specific deals,and allowed baron to park certain securities on particular occasions in his accounts at other.dweck was rewarded with ownership in companies on a preferential basis and a guaranteed return on his parking arrangements as well.these acts undoubtedly facilitated baron frauds.the impact of dweck involvement is alleged to have been twofold.parking by dweck and others creat ed a false impression in the minds of baron customers of the value and liquidity of the parked securities and induced baron customers to make investments based on baron illusion of trading activity,id.at,while dweck provision of funds to baron prolonged the firm frauds.see id.at noting the importance of collective action for the fraud to succeed see also id.at.
however,appellants claims for damages do not contain discrete claims related to the prices paid for the particular securities parked by dweck at times they were trading.rather,they seek to recover damages for all losses caused by baron.while the complaint contains voluminous records of trades involving securities of various firms over extended periods of time,no attempt is made to connect particular trades in particular securities to dweck parking.
discussion 
as noted with regard to dweck,the only legal claims in the complaint argued on this appeal are that i his conduct involved market manipulation in violation of section b and rule and ii he aided and abetted,and conspired to commit,fraud under new york law.also,appellants make no claim for recovery from dweck for damages caused by parking particular securities but seek,like our dissenting colleague,to impose liability on dweck for all of baron deceptive activities.
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim under rule b.selevan thruway,cir.in conducting this review,we assume all factual allegations to be true,and determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.id.quoting ashcroft iqbal,d.a complaint alleging securities fraud in a private action for damages is subject to heightened pleadings standards.first,it must satisfy rule b,which requires that a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.b.second,under the pleading standards of the private securities litigation reform act,codified at b,the allegations of the state of mind required for a section b violation scienter or recklessness,ganino citizens utils,cir must state facts either showing that the defendants had both motive and opportunity to commit the fraud or constituting strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.atsi commc,shaar fund,cir.
valid claims under section b must allege manipulative acts damage caused by reliance on an assumption of an efficient market free of manipulation scienter in connection with the purchase or sale of securities furthered by the defendant use of the mails or any facility of a national securities exchange.id.at.these elements save for the requirement of manipulative acts and a misplaced belief in the price of the security as being set by,bona fide are,of course,identical to section b claims generally.see stoneridge inv.partners,scientific atlanta,d noting that the typical b claim must make the same allegations.
there is no doubt that appellants have alleged a valid section b claim against baron based on false representations that the price baron charged customers for securities was established in a market independent of artificial trading by baron itself.they have also adequately alleged their reliance upon baron misrepresentations.
our difficulty with regard to dweck liability under section b arises from the lack of an allegation that dweck was involved in any communication with any of the appellants.dweck is alleged to have been one of a group that engaged in phony trading activity that created an impression of value and liquidity in securities being pedaled by baron.there is no allegation that any appellant was told of dweck artificial trading,or purchased such securities in specific reliance on such trading.see pls.first am.compl.at noting the importance of collective action for perpetrating the fraud see also id.at alleging reliance on defendants collectively and not individually.baron and bear are the sole sources alleged regarding the appellants perceptions of prices at which trades were being made.
dweck is sufficiently alleged to have had particular knowledge of some artificial trades,to have participated in them,and to have actively facilitated baron fraudulent business generally by loans and other investments.the issue is whether,as appellants argue and our dissenting colleague agrees,these allegations sufficiently support a section b claim for damages by all the appellants for all the fraudulent sales of securities to them by baron.
in pursuing a claim against dweck for all damages caused by baron,appellants make no claim of dweck liability under respondeat superior or other common law theory of vicarious liability.they have also abandoned any claim on appeal that dweck is liable under section a as a controlling person any person who,directly or indirectly,controls any person liable under the act is liable jointly and severally for the violation,a with regard to baron fraud.and,they have dropped all claims based on section of the act.prohibiting any transaction effected for the purpose of creating a false or misleading appearance of active trading in any security or a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for any such security 
therefore,because there is no aiding and abetting liability in private actions under section b,dweck may be liable in this matter only as a primary violator.cent.bank of denver first interstate bank of denver,d.the supreme court has held that to prove a primary violation of section b,in such a private action,a plaintiff must allege that the specific defendant was identified as making the pertinent misrepresentation s.stoneridge,at.otherwise,the plaintiff complaint would fail to allege reliance upon a misrepresentation made by that defendant,an element of a valid section b claim for damages caused by a primary violator of that section.in short,an allegation of acts facilitating or even indispensable to a fraud is not sufficient to state a claim if those acts were not the particular misrepresentations that deceived the investor.see,id.at.
for example,in stoneridge,the defendant,scientific atlanta,had knowingly structured a sale of cable boxes to charter at an artificially high price.id.at.at the end of the year,scientific atlanta returned the excess portion of the price by purchasing advertising from charter at prices.id.at.this was alleged to have been a phony transaction designed only to allow charter to report the returned excess as a purchase of advertising by scientific atlanta,thus inflating charter revenue,and then to capitalize the inflated costs of the cable boxes,thereby decreasing charter apparent operating costs.id.although the complaint in stoneridge alleged that the transactions had no economic substance and were specifically intended by scientific atlanta to deceive investors and charter auditor precisely as appellants have alleged with regard to dweck acts the supreme court held that scientific atlanta could not be liable in a civil action for damages under section b.id.at.the ground for this holding was that only charter,and not scientific atlanta,had made the fraudulent statements to the public through its financial statements.id.at.
the supreme court further elaborated this test in janus capital,first derivative traders,d.in janus,the court held that a corporation serving as the investment advisor and administrator the manager of a mutual fund could not be liable under section b for false statements made in the mutual fund prospectuses.id.at.the court held that the was insulated from section b civil liability because the false statements to the public were made only in the name of the mutual fund,a separate corporate entity.id.at.given that the,as the fund manager,had surely prepared the prospectuses,dweck more limited involvement in baron frauds,although serious,is foreclosed by janus and stoneridge as well.
applying these principles to the present claims,appellants were required to allege acts by dweck that amounted to more than knowingly participating in,or facilitating,baron fraud to state a claim under section b.to reiterate,under atsi,manipulation violates section b when an artificial or phony price of a security is communicated to persons who,in reliance upon a misrepresentation that the price was set by market forces,purchase the securities.at.under stoneridge,at,and janus.at,only the person who communicates the misrepresentation is liable in private actions under section b.the present complaint alleges only that baron and bear stearns communicated the artificial price information to the buyers.therefore,allegations of financing baron operations and parking some securities fail to state a section b private claim for damages against dweck.
to summarize,appellants have sufficiently pleaded with particularity that dweck provided knowing and substantial assistance in financing and facilitating the baron fraud.while such allegations would easily be sufficient in an sec civil action,see e,or a federal criminal action because this knowing and substantial assistance constitutes,at the least,aiding and abetting,see,they do not meet the standards for private damage actions under section b.
nevertheless,with regard to appellants state law claims civil conspiracy to defraud and aiding and abetting fraud the complaint alleges sufficient involvement by dweck in the scheme to survive a motion to dismiss.therefore,we vacate the dismissal and remand appellants state law claims against dweck for further proceedings 
conclusion 
we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of appellants federal securities claims against dweck and vacate and remand the state law claims.
although i agree with the majority resolution of the fraud claims against isaac dweck dweck,i respectfully dissent from the majority disposition of the federal securities claim of market manipulation against dweck.in my view,the plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded such a claim by alleging that dweck participated in a manipulative scheme in which he conveyed to the investing public,through a series of securities transactions,false signals that he controlled securities that were in fact controlled by a boiler room,baron baron,these false signals distorted the market for the relevant securities,and they relied on an assumption of an efficient market free of manipulation in buying the relevant securities.
the majority opinion takes at least three wrong turns as it navigates the complaint and the relevant legal landscape.first,it ignores the fact that dweck is alleged to be an insider of baron who has primary liability under section b of the securities exchange act of,and rule promulgated thereunder,for engaging in a manipulative scheme.instead,it interprets the complaint to state a claim only for aiding and abetting securities fraud.second,it conflates market manipulation claims and pure misrepresentation claims.third,it misreads janus capital group,first derivative traders,d,and stoneridge investment partners,llc scientific atlanta,d,to require a direct communication of false information to the plaintiffs in the context of a claim of market manipulation.
as the supreme court explained in central bank of denver,first interstate bank of denver,
t he absence of b aiding and abetting liability does not mean that secondary actors in the securities markets are always free from liability under the securities acts.any person or entity,including a lawyer,accountant,or bank,who employs a manipulative device or makes a material misstatement or omission on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable as a primary violator under.
d emphasis added.the court in central bank also highlighted the distinction between those who do not engage in the manipulative or deceptive practice,and those who aid and abet the violation.id.at.a iding and abetting liability reaches persons who do not engage in the proscribed activities at all,but who give a degree of aid to those who do.id.at.in other words,secondary actors who do more than aid and abet a securities fraud can be liable as primary violators.neither the supreme court nor our precedents have modified the principle that an individual who commi tted a manipulative act and thereby participated in a fraudulent scheme is a primary violator.sec,cir.
here,the plaintiffs claim that dweck was a primary violator because he engaged directly in market manipulation.the supreme court has described market manipulation as a term of art in connection with securities markets that generally refers to practices,such as wash sales,matched orders,or rigged prices,that are intended to mislead investors by artificially affecting market activity.santa fe,green,d.as i describe in greater detail below,the first amended complaint alleges that dweck engaged in at least some of these manipulative practices directly.
the majority opinion itself aptly de
