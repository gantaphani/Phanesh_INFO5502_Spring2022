this case arises from the settlement of a complex of securities fraud cases involving the sale of municipal bonds for renovation and construction of health care facilities.the litigation was commonly referred to as the in re heritage bond litigation.the district court ultimately approved multiple settlement agreements between different plaintiffs and defendants pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure rule,california code of civil procedure section section,and the private securities litigation reform act of pslra.in approving the settlements,the district court issued five bar orders that barred defendants from bringing against settling defendants any future claims arising out of or related to any of the transactions or occurrences alleged.appellant bruce talley talley,a defendant,objected to the scope of the bar orders on the ground that he sought to pursue independent state law claims against several of the settling defendants.
the district court,applying the interrelatedness test from wisconsin investment board ruttenberg,d following in re oil gas litigation,cir,determined that talley claims were related to and arose out of the litigation involving the heritage bonds and,in the five bar orders,specifically barred his claims.in this appeal,talley challenges the scope of the bar orders and argues that under federal common law,the pslra,and section,the orders should have been limited to claims for contribution and indemnity or disguised claims for such relief talley concedes that any claims for indemnity,contribution,and comparative fault were appropriately barred by the orders at issue here.he contests the bar orders only to the extent they bar his allegedly independent state law claims.appellees argue that the district court has broad authority to issue bar orders and that this court should apply the interrelatedness test to determine that talley state law claims arise from the same core facts as those extinguished by the district court approval of the settlement agreements.
we have jurisdiction under,and we vacate the bar orders and remand for modification.in so doing,we adopt the approach of the second circuit in gerber mtc electronic technologies,cir,in limiting the scope of a bar order issued as part of a securities fraud class action settlement we hold that bar orders issued pursuant to the pslra or section may only bar claims for contribution and indemnity or disguised claims for such relief.independent where the injury is not the defendant liability to the not be barred under either federal law or section.see gerber,at federal common law props.evans pac,d,section.the bar orders issued by the district court here do not pass muster under the pslra or section,and because they are impermissibly broad,they must be vacated.
background 
the underlying litigation in this case involved investor plaintiffs securities fraud claims against the individuals responsible for creating,operating,marketing and selling heritage bonds certain defendants against each other for indemnity and contribution and talley separate tort claims against certain employers and the creators and operators of the heritage bonds.
in the,defendant robert kasirer joined with several other entities to develop a series of fraudulent municipal bond offerings the heritage bonds,ostensibly to finance or renovate healthcare facilities in several states.see in re heritage bond litigation,d.the principals of the heritage bonds offerings included talley employer,miller schroeder,which was the underwriter for the offerings.see id.in,investors discovered that the heritage bonds principals had been stealing and commingling the bond investors funds,that the heritage bonds principals had lied about their backgrounds and the nature of the healthcare facilities that were the subjects of the bond offerings,and that miller schroeder principals and lawyers had known of these facts.see id.at.
the first lawsuit was filed in june in the united states district court for the central district of california,case,captioned betker partners one,et trust company,et.betker lawsuit the betkers were investors in the heritage bonds.their claims included securities fraud and control person liability under the securities exchange act of and violations of the securities act of.they also alleged state law claims for breach of fiduciary duty,violations of the california corporations code,misrepresentation,breach of contract,and negligence.
in august,the betker lawsuit and other related class action lawsuits that had been filed around the country were consolidated by the judicial panel on litigation and transferred to the central district of california under the title of in re heritage bond litigation,case.see.talley was a defendant only in the betker lawsuit.he filed an answer and against several in the consolidated case.his were for indemnity and contribution.
in december,talley filed a complaint in the california superior court,county of san diego,no.gic,against many of the heritage bonds and others,alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duty,negligence,interference with economic advantage,avoidance of fraudulent transfer,unfair or unlawful business practices,constructive fraud,and violation of california labor code section,and requesting declaratory relief and both economic and reputational damages he also alleged the same claims for indemnity and contribution that he had alleged in his answer in the betker lawsuit.in august,upon motion by the defendants,the superior court stayed talley case pending the outcome of the claims against talley in the in re heritage bond litigation.in may,this state court case was dismissed without prejudice while talley pursued settlement discussions with the betkers.
in october,while settlement discussions with the betkers were in progress,talley filed a second state court lawsuit in the california superior court,county of san diego,case no.gic.this case concerned only talley affirmative claims for damages and did not include the contribution and indemnity claims that he had previously alleged in his answer and in the betker lawsuit.while the instant appeal was pending,talley second state court case moved forward through the california court system,and all of his claims were ultimately dismissed pursuant to the bar orders at issue here.see talley miller schroeder,no,wl not reported in d.on appeal,d ue to the broad language of all th e bar orders,the california court of appeal affirmed the majority of the trial court dismissal orders id.at.the decision allowed talley to pursue certain of his claims against trust corporation and trust company,and valuation counselors group,valuation,but,pursuant to the bar orders at issue here the superior court,on remand,dismissed the remaining claims with prejudice as to these two defendants talley did not appeal 
by february,talley settlement with the betkers was finalized,and talley was dismissed from the in re heritage bond litigation.during this time,other defendants were also negotiating settlements with the in re heritage bond litigation plaintiffs.as part of the settlements that emerged from these negotiations,each agreement required a good faith settlement determination and bar order pursuant to section and a bar order pursuant to the pslra.these determinations were an essential part of the settlement agreements because they allowed the court to make a finding that the settling party would pay its fair share of liability to the settling plaintiffs and,if so,to bar any further obligation by that settling defendant to contribute funds to the settling plaintiffs,either directly or indirectly by indemnifying another liable party.see pslra,f a,cal d,discussing section franklin kaypro,cir holding that a bar order in a class action securities fraud case should bar future claims for contribution to ensure that liability is equitably distributed among settling and defendants.
in november,defendants bhmc corporation,llc health care holdings,llc jddj holdings,lp debra kasirer and robert kasirer kasirer defendants filed a motion for approval of settlement,good faith determination and bar order in the betker lawsuit before the district court.the motion included a request that the court enter a broad bar order extinguishing any future claims by defendants against the settling defendants related to or arising out of the in re heritage bonds litigation.talley filed an opposition to this motion,urging the court to bar only claims for contribution and indemnity.he argued that the bar orders would preclude his independent state court claims against the settling defendants.the district court rejected talley arguments and granted the motion and entered two granting preliminary approval and another granting final approval of the december.the district court specifically identified talley state court case in the final order.
in doing so,the district court considered whether the proposed settlement satisfied the requirements of rule e,which requires that class action settlements be fair,reasonable,and adequate,see hanlon chrysler,cir,and section,which requires that a settlement be made in good faith.see,at.the court was guided by the following factors the fact that the proposed settlement was the result of,informed,and negotiations the adequacy and reasonableness of the settlement amount the absence of any evidence of collusion or fraud aimed to injure defendants and the fairness of the settlement amount relative to both the proportionate liability of the settling defendants and the approximate total recovery of the plaintiffs.see staton boeing,cir rule dunk ford,th,d section,at section.
additionally,in response to talley challenge to the bar orders,the court evaluated the appropriate scope of the orders by reference to the interrelatedness test of wisconsin investment board ruttenberg,d following in re oil gas litigation,cir,which asks whether the claims extinguished by the bar order arise out of the same facts as those in the underlying securities litigation.ruttenberg,d at.the district court found that talley bald assertions that his claims rely on facts that are separate and distinct from the facts alleged in the present securities litigation are insufficient to support a finding that the proposed bar order is overly broad.talley filed a notice of appeal on january,appealing the final approval order appeal.
in january,defendants jerold goldstein valuation counselors group,cbiz bank of new york trust company leo dierckman and hfs consultants in the heritage bonds consolidated case each filed an identical motion for approval of settlement,good faith determinations,and bar orders.talley filed an opposition to these motions,asserting the same arguments that he raised in his opposition to the similar motion noted above.the district court held a good faith hearing on the motions and entered two orders granting preliminary approval.the court again rejected talley arguments.the district court subsequently entered four final orders approving the settlements and bar orders on february,the district court specifically identified talley state court case in the challenged bar orders,with the exception of the goldstein bar order.talley filed his second notice of appeal on march,appealing the four february,final approval orders appeal 
in sum,each of the five final settlement approval orders from which talley appeals includes a broad bar order that specifically bars his state court claims that relate to the in re heritage bond litigation.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
a district court may approve a proposed settlement in a class action only if the compromise is fundamentally fair,adequate,and reasonable.e hanlon,at.ordinarily,we review a district court decision to approve a settlement for abuse of discretion.hanlon,at resolution trust rice in re consol.pinnacle sec.litig.resolution trust,cir.talley,however,does not question the district court authority to approve a settlement he challenges the district court interpretation of section and the pslra to determine the permissible scope of a bar order issued pursuant to those statutes.the district court interpretation of a statute is a question of law that we review de novo.beeman tdi managed care,cir see also in re mclinn,cir en banc whether the district court properly construed state law is a question we review de novo.
as discussed above,talley state law claims were dismissed pursuant to the bar orders challenged here.talley,wl.the california court of appeal affirmed the superior court dismissal d ue to the broad language of all th e bar orders.id.at.appellees argue that because talley state law claims have been dismissed and the dismissal has been affirmed,this appeal is moot.we disagree.
the court of appeal stated clearly that its reliance on the bar orders was premised on its view that it was bound by the broad language of the orders because the bar orders should be considered final while talley federal appeals were pending.see talley,wl,at,plaintiff has appealed that bar order to the ninth circuit court of appeals,and appeal is pending,but for our purposes,under the rule of levy cohen cal d,it is currently deemed to be final.we must consider ourselves bound by the broad language of that bar order.the court followed the federal res judicata rule applied by the california supreme court in levy,cal d at,that a judgment or order,once rendered,is final for purposes of res judicata until reversed on appeal or modified or set aside in the court of rendition.see talley,wl,at quoting levy,cal d at.by specifying that it affirmed the dismissal of talley claims solely on this basis,the court implied that modification of the bar orders could revive talley claims.
we therefore agree with talley that this appeal is not moot because we can still grant relief in his favor.we have previously held that a n appeal is moot when,by virtue of an intervening event,a court of appeals can not grant any effectual relief whatever in favor of the appellant.united states strong,cir.however,t he party asserting mootness bears a heavy burden of establishing that there is no effective relief remaining for a court to provide.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
although the federal courts are unable to grant talley the ultimate relief he of his state law has outlined several procedures he could follow in state court,such as filing a motion under california code of civil procedure section to vacate the judgment or filing a new action in state court,once the bar orders are modified.see romadka hoge,d.reversing denial of plaintiff motion to vacate where plaintiff attorney requested dismissal with prejudice without authorization hoover galbraith,cal d,w here it is not possible to bring an action to trial pending determination of an appeal in a related case,the time consumed on such appeal is impliedly excluded from the period of limitations.we can not order the superior court to reinstate talley claims,but by limiting the scope of the orders,we make it reasonably likely that he can succeed in obtaining reinstatement of his claims and,to the extent they are truly independent,have them heard on the merits.because talley can point to avenues for relief that will be open to him when the district court modifies the bar orders at issue here,appellees have not carried their burden of demonstrating that there is no effective relief remaining for us to provide.accordingly,we hold that this appeal is not moot and proceed to the merits of talley arguments.
scope of the bar orders 
talley argues that,to the extent that they would bar him from bringing independent,or contribution claims in the superior court,the five bar orders challenged in this appeal exceed the scope allowed by the contribution bar provisions of the pslra,f a and section we agree with talley and the second circuit that a bar order issued in a partial settlement of a securities fraud class action case can not bar independent claims.see gerber.
we have already acknowledged the authority of a district court under federal common law to issue bar orders barring future claims for contribution and indemnity as part of its approval of a proposed settlement in a class action securities fraud case,once it has found that the settlement satisfies the requirements of rule.see resolution trust,at kaypro,at in re first alliance mortgage,cir in kaypro,this court concluded under federal common law that a partial settlement in a securities case,pursuant to which defendants rights to contribution are satisfied and further contribution barred,may be approved under rule if the liability of defendants is limited to their actual percentage of liability for the amount of total damages determined at trial.we have not,however,previously addressed the question of whether the bar order provisions of section and the pslra permit a district court,having found a good faith settlement in accordance with section and rule,to issue bar orders barring future claims other than those for contribution and indemnity.we address each statute in turn.
private securities litigation reform act section f a 
as we have previously acknowledged,congress passed the pslra in because it was distressed with the proliferation and cost of allegedly meritless federal securities class actions.the pslra sought to curb abusive and frivolous securities suits by imposing new procedural and substantive requirements.mortgage,saxton,cir see also in re silicon graphics.secs,cir noting that congress enacted the pslra in part to prevent abusive securities fraud class actions designed to impose costs so burdensome that it was often economical for the victimized party to settle.its provisions limit recoverable damages and attorney fees,provide a safe harbor for statements,impose new restrictions on the selection of and compensation awarded to lead plaintiffs,mandate imposition of sanctions for frivolous litigation,and authorize a stay of discovery pending resolution of any motion to dismiss.merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,dabit,d.
in its effort to reform litigation and settlement of securities fraud class actions,congress also included the provision at issue here,which makes the entry of a bar order against future claims for contribution mandatory upon a court approval of a settlement in such a case f a.we are asked to determine whether the scope of a bar order under the pslra may also encompass independent claims,meaning claims other than those for contribution and indemnity,and we hold that it may not.in so holding,we adopt the federal common law approach taken by the second circuit in gerber,and apply it to bar orders issued pursuant to the pslra.
gerber was not decided under the pslra.gerber,at.prior to adoption of the pslra,federal courts determined the appropriate scope of bar orders issued in partial settlements of class action cases by reference to federal common law evolving from rule e.see kaypro,at holding that federal common law should govern the issue of contribution bars in securities class action settlements.under the federal common law rule,once a court determined that a proposed settlement satisfied the requirements of rule e,it could impose a bar order barring defendants future claims for contribution and indemnity.kaypro,at.the contribution bar provision of the pslra essentially codified this rule and made the imposition of a bar against future claims for contribution mandatory in securities fraud class action settlements.f a.because the text of the pslra,which is geared to orders that bar claims for contribution,does not speak to whether a court may issue an order that bars independent claims,we look to the reasoning of cases determining the appropriate scope of similar bar orders under federal common law.
appellees urge us to affirm the district court application of the approach taken by the eleventh circuit in in re oil gas litigation,cir in determining the scope of the challenged bar orders,the district court relied upon the holding of in re oil gas litigation,as applied in ruttenberg,d at,that 
t he propriety of the settlement bar order should turn upon the interrelatedness of the claims that it precludes,not upon the labels which parties attach to those claims.if the that the district court seeks to extinguish through the entry of a bar order arise out of the same facts as those underlying the litigation,then the district court may exercise its discretion to bar such claims in reaching a fair and equitable settlement.
in re oil gas litigation,at.
however,the eleventh circuit called this interrelatedness test and its opinion in in re oil gas litigation into question with its decision in aal high yield bond fund deloitte touche,llp,cir.in aal,certain defendants in a securities fraud class action suit challenged the district court bar orders as impermissibly broad under the pslra contribution bar when they precluded the defendants from bringing future claims against settling.id.the aal court explicitly distanced itself from in re oil gas litigation by explaining that its holding in that case had narrow applicability because it had barred the at issue there only because they were disguised contribution and indemnity claims,not truly independent claims.aal,at noting that in re oil gas litigation expressly declined to address the issue of truly independent claims.the court also declined to consider ruttenberg as persuasive authority because of its reliance on in re oil gas litigation.id.because we find the reasoning of aal persuasive,we likewise decline appellees invitation to adopt the federal common law rule articulated in in re oil gas litigation to determine the appropriate scope of a bar order issued pursuant to the pslra 
instead,we hold that the correct standard for determining the appropriate scope of a bar order issued pursuant to the pslra is the federal common law test articulated by the second circuit in gerber,that asks whether a defendant claims are independent.id.at.we are persuaded that limiting bar orders issued pursuant to the pslra to claims for contribution and indemnity accords with the purpose and plain language of the statute and strikes an appropriate balance between the judicial policies of encouraging settlements,on the one hand,and protecting the legal rights of parties in lawsuits,on the other.see,kaypro,at identifying policy of encouraging settlements in support of allowing contribution bars in partial settlements under federal common law new england health care employees pension fund woodruff,cir holding that defendants had standing to challenge bar orders that eliminate certain independent claims because they palpably interfere with the defendants preexisting rights and potential legal claims.similarly,interpreting the pslra to bar disguised claims for contribution and indemnity prevents defendants from engaging in an end run around a settlement agreement and an accompanying contribution and indemnity bar,while allowing them to pursue genuinely independent claims.see,in re masters mates pilots pension plan irap,cir.
like the instant case,gerber addressed a challenge by certain defendants in a securities fraud class action to the district court approval of a settlement bar order extinguishing any claims against certain relating to or arising from the allegations of the litigation.gerber,at.the parties did not contest the authority of the district court to bar claims for contribution and indemnity and conceded that a disguised contribution or indemnity claim,such as a negligence claim where the injury to the defendants was their liability to the plaintiffs,could be barred.id.at.instead,the appellants argued that the district court bar order was impermissibly broad only insofar as it barred independent claims.id.the gerber court determined under federal common law that if a defendant is able to prove that it sustained independent reputational damages or losses relating to the cost of defense arising out of a breached contractual or fiduciary relationship with the settling defendant,it has not been compensated for those losses by the judgment credit,and any such claims should not be extinguished by the bar order.id.at.
in addressing which claims should not be precluded,the court explained that the only claims that could appropriately be barred by such an order,in addition to those for contribution and indemnity,were disguised claims for contribution or in which the injury is the defendant liability to the plaintiff,or where damages are calculated based on th
