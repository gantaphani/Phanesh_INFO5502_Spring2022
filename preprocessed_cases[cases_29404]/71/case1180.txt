introduction 
jerome wenger published a newsletter called the next superstock and hosted a syndicated radio program of the same name.after failing to inform his listeners that he had been receiving compensation from certain companies in exchange for touting their stocks on his show,he was indicted and convicted of securities fraud under section b of the securities act of,b,which makes it unlawful to publicize a stock for consideration from an issuer,underwriter,or dealer without disclosing the fact and amount of the payment.in addition,for failing to inform readers of the next superstock newsletter that he was selling his shares in the companies he had been recommending they buy,he was convicted under section b of the securities exchange act of,b,which makes it unlawful to employ any manipulative or deceptive device in connection with the sale of securities.
on appeal,wenger challenges his convictions on the grounds that section b violates the first amendment,section b is unconstitutionally vague,his convictions were against the weight of the evidence presented at trial,the district court impermissibly admitted evidence of a prior consent decree with the sec,and the district court failed to send the indictment to the jury room along with the jury instructions.
accepting jurisdiction under,we affirm.
background 
in,wenger began publishing penny stock news,a newsletter that gave investment advice concerning penny stocks,or shares of small companies with large numbers of shares outstanding.after the securities and exchange commission determined that wenger penny stock news had violated the disclosure requirements of section b and section b because he received money from companies he recommended,wenger and the sec entered into a consent decree that stipulated he would disclose the full value of any consideration he was receiving from any issuer about which penny stock news was giving advice.
ten years later,wenger began publishing a similar newsletter called the next superstock and also began hosting a radio program based in salt lake city.to further these ventures,wenger approached a company called panworld minerals international,and told its management that he could help publicize its stock.after panworld expressed interest,wenger offered to provide certain consulting services for a standard fee of.because panworld could not compensate wenger in cash,wenger agreed instead to accept million shares of panworld,of which he had received million by april.
in early,wenger consulted with a law firm to determine how he could comply with section b disclosure requirements.in a letter dated june,the firm recommended a disclosure,according to which wenger would first state on the air that he was a paid consultant to some of the companies mentioned,and second send details regarding his compensation to listeners upon request.sometime in wenger began to tell listeners that they could request a list of his stock holdings.in response to such requests,he would send a form letter,which stated,i presently charge a company for services which may include introducing them to market makers and stock brokers,introduction to newspaper and magazine writers,introduction to newsletter writers and exposure through the radio.the letter then stated that a s far as my portfolio is concerned the following stocks i bought,among which was listed panworld.
panworld employees also appeared on wenger radio program several times in.on june,wenger stated on his show that panworld is trading at book value and has a great direction to go,and that north.on the same day,when interviewing panworld consultant david hesterman,wenger stated that i know i been doing some consulting and helping you to get more of a better broker network in place and you seen a lot more people come on the sheets for you and do some significant trading.hesterman and panworld president robert weeks,both of whom had appeared several times on wenger show,testified at trial that they had never heard wenger disclose that he was being paid in panworld stock.six regular listeners also testified that they had never heard wenger disclose the amount of stock he was receiving from panworld.
in june,wenger newsletter published an article listing several reasons to buy panworld stock.the newsletter contained a standard fine print disclosure stating that the next superstock or its employees may purchase,sell,or have a position in the stocks discussed and may have a paid consulting arrangement with the companies.wenger never disclosed in his newsletter that he had received million shares in panworld or that he had contracted to receive up to million shares.
by april,wenger had already begun selling the stock he had received from panworld.by the end of the summer he had sold over a million shares for a total of more than.in august,two of his brokerage accounts were oversold in panworld.because short selling of a penny stock was illegal at the time,wenger broker bought enough stock to cover the short position at a lower price.several listeners to wenger program testified that they bought panworld stock as a result of wenger recommendations.they also testified that had wenger disclosed he was selling his panworld stock,they would not have bought any shares in panworld.
after the sec began investigating wenger activities,wenger attorney submitted a letter to the sec dated november.the letter included a partial transcript of the june,broadcast,and argued that wenger statement that he had been doing some consulting for panworld was an adequate section b disclosure.on november,after the sec requested copies of all broadcast tapes in which panworld was discussed,counsel sent the sec a second letter.this letter enclosed taped portions of the june,broadcast and a february,broadcast,and stated that i t is our understanding that wenger has conducted a diligent search and he has located no other tape recordings or transcripts thereof that refer or relate to panworld.
wenger was indicted in.
discussion 
we first must resolve a threshold issue posed by wenger was his conduct protected from prosecution by the first amendment.in other words,is section b constitutional as applied to his speech 
section b makes it unlawful for any person 
to publish,give publicity to,or circulate any notice,circular,advertisement,newspaper,article,letter,investment service,or communication which,though not purporting to offer a security for sale,describes such security for a consideration received or to be received,directly or indirectly,from an issuer,underwriter,or dealer,without fully disclosing the receipt,whether past or prospective,of such consideration and the amount thereof.
b emphasis added.according to wenger,this provision unconstitutionally compels him to speak by requiring disclosures as a part of his communications with his readers or listeners.we review first amendment challenges de novo,phelan laramie county cmty.coll.bd.of trustees,cir.
i.the first amendment 
wenger first claims that section b impermissibly regulates speech and thus should be subject to strict scrutiny review under the first amendment.he claims that,as applied to him,this exacting scrutiny prohibits the government from compelling by section b.we disagree.
section b regulates commercial speech 
the initial question we must resolve is whether section b reach is limited principally to commercial speech.if so,according to supreme court precedent it is subject to judicial review under the standard set forth in central hudson gas public serv.comm of,d.
neither the supreme court nor any of our sister circuits have addressed this question explicitly.two circuit courts and one district court have upheld section b against first amendment attack,however.in,the seventh circuit,although without explicitly determining what level of scrutiny it was applying,held that t he substantial interest of the investing public in knowing whether an apparently objective statement in the press concerning a security is motivated by promise of payment is obvious.we see no significant abridgement of freedom of the press in requiring disclosure of a promise of payment if there has been one.united states amick,cir.
similarly,in sec wall street publ g,the district of columbia circuit upheld the constitutionality of section b under the federal government broad powers to regulate the securities industry,without expressly linking its holding to the first amendment as an aside,however,the court also suggested that section b disclosure requirements would have been upheld as a regulation on commercial speech even when the government has not shown that absent the required disclosure the speech would be false or deceptive,or that the disclosure requirement serves some substantial government interest other than preventing deception.id.at quoting zauderer office of disciplinary counsel,d.finally,in an unpublished opinion,a district court judge applied rational basis scrutiny to uphold section b.sec huttoe,no.civ.gk,wl.
unfortunately,none of these cases helpfully analyzes more recent supreme court commercial speech jurisprudence.we begin there.
commercial speech is that which does no more than propose a commercial transaction.virginia state bd.of pharmacy virginia citizens consumer council,d.advertising is widely recognized as the most obvious example of commercial speech.adolph coors brady,cir.the distinction between commercial and speech rests on the grounds that the former occurs in an area traditionally subject to government regulation.united states edge broadcasting,d quoting ohralik ohio state bar ass n,d.commercial speech therefore occupies a subordinate position in the scale of first amendment values.ohralik,at.see also bolger youngs drug prods,d.t he state power to regulate commercial transactions justifies its concomitant power to regulate commercial speech that is linked inextricably to those transactions.liquormart rhode island,d internal quotations omitted.
typically state regulation of commercial speech must satisfy a form of intermediate scrutiny.central hudson,at.united states carolene prods.presuming that regulatory legislation affecting ordinary commercial transactions rests upon some rational basis.as the supreme court has explained,unlike ordinary commercial transactions,commercial speech deserves constitutional protection under the first amendment because it not only serves the economic interest of the speaker,but also assists consumers and furthers the societal interest in the fullest possible dissemination of information.central hudson,at.see also first bank of boston bellotti,d.in other words,the protection of commercial speech largely derives from the listener first amendment interests as well as the speaker.city of cincinnati discovery network,d blackmun,concurring emphasis added.
no single formulaic test can be applied to the question of whether certain speech falls within the rubric of commercial speech.see bolger,at.and accompanying text.the supreme court has,however,stated that o ur lodestars in deciding what level of scrutiny to apply to a compelled statement must be the nature of the speech taken as a whole and the effect of the compelled statement thereon.riley fed of the blind of north carolina,d.in cases where commercial speech is inextricably intertwined with otherwise fully protected speech,more substantial constitutional scrutiny will apply.id.
the court has emphasized that it will review a combination of factors in sorting out commercial from speech,including several characteristics of commercial speech that,in our view,help illuminate the issue.according to the court,speech may properly be characterized as commercial speech where,among other things,it is concededly an advertisement,it refers to a specific product,or it is motivated by an economic interest in selling the product.see bolger,at.in the context of securities regulation under section b,this inquiry is focused on the security and the relationship of the speaker to the issuer of the stock.has the issuer bought and paid for the speech promoting the stock,or is the speech disinterested commentary of a stock pros and cons 
we find that the speech congress regulated through section b fits well within the framework of bolger.as the supreme court in bolger observed,its cases instruct that we draw common sense distinctions between various kinds of speech.common sense suggests that the nature of the speech regulated by section b here is primarily akin to commercial advertising and subject to less protection than purely speech.paid promoters such as wenger serve as the medium through which a company may promote its stock.
although there are some elements of entertainment and information contained in the programs and newsletters,in the end,they do little more than propose a commercial transaction,namely,the purchase of shares in a company.moreover,while speech such as wenger is concededly not a traditionally structured advertisement,it does refer to a specific product in this case panworld stock the raison for panworld inclusion in wenger newsletter and radio program is fundamentally premised on a direct economic relationship between the company and the promoter.paid publicists such as wenger have agreed to promote a security for a price.and congress has made the reasonable policy judgment that the promoter disclose its relationship to the public.
in his facial challenge,wenger nevertheless argues that we ought to apply strict scrutiny because section b may reach expression.if section b merely sought to regulate disinterested financial analysis,this argument might have some force.but as the district court noted,a common sense distinction also exists between disinterested analysis of the securities markets and compensated promotion of particular stocks.one example of the latter is found in lowe sec,d.in lowe,the supreme court considered whether a publisher of impersonal investment advice and commentary could be enjoined under the investment advisors act of because the publisher was not a registered investment advisor.id.at.the court stated,in dicta,that because the expression of an opinion about a commercial product,such as a loudspeaker,is protected by the first amendment,see bose consumers union,d,it is difficult to see why the expression of an opinion about a marketable security should not also be protected.lowe,at.
in contrast to the speech at issue in lowe,however,section b regulates speech which,though not purporting to offer a security for sale,describes such a security for consideration received or to be received,directly or indirectly,from an issuer,underwriter,or dealer.b emphasis added.while disinterested investment advice will still qualify for full first amendment protection,paid publicists speech is grounded in commercial transactions of the kind that the state has traditionally regulated.friedman rogers,d.a lower level of constitutional protection is therefore justified than in the case of disinterested advice and commentary.
this would be true even if the speaker really believed in the stock or company he was promoting.it is undoubtedly the case a tout frequently believes in the products he promotes.the problem congress sought to address,however,was not the bona fides of the publicist,but the scope of information available to the public.as in many areas where conflicts of interest are involved,the disclosure of the financial interests of the speaker can say volumes to the listener.
in any event,section b disclosure requirement presents little risk that listeners will tune out a publicist message.a promoter of the kind covered by section b must wait for his audience to subscribe or tune in.a listener to a radio show or a reader of a newsletter is already in the act of seeking information he is therefore unlikely to tune out the promoter message just because the promoter makes a required disclosure.even a casual observer of contemporary television financial programming can see that section b does not hamper the discussion of particular stocks,even those owned by a show host or guests.
in sum,the disclosures required by section b will be scrutinized as would any limitation on commercial speech.
application of commercial speech scrutiny 
we recently summarized the supreme court test governing first amendment challenges to regulations restricting commercial speech that relates to lawful activity 
first,the government must assert a substantial interest to be achieved by the regulation.central hudson,at.second,the regulation must directly advance that governmental interest,meaning that it must do more than provide only ineffective or remote support for the government purpose.id.third,although the regulation need not be the least restrictive measure available,it must be narrowly tailored not to restrict more speech than necessary.see board of trs.of the state of fox,d.together,these final two factors require that there be a reasonable fit between the government objectives and the means it chooses to accomplish those ends.united states edge broad,d.
mainstream mktg.servs.ftc,cir.
in applying central hudson,we require the government first to prove that the law provides more than ineffective or remote support for the government purpose.central hudson,at.we then distinguish between a regulation aimed at the activity the government seeks to prevent,and a regulation aimed at something else in the hope that it would sweep the targeted activity in during the process.secretary of state of maryland joseph munson,d.this standard does not require that the government response to protect substantial interests be the least restrictive measure available.all that is required is a proportional response.mainstream,at.
in the context of disclosure requirements,the supreme court has provided additional guidance.in zauderer office of disciplinary counsel,d,the supreme court upheld an ohio rule that attorneys advertising their availability on a basis should reveal in their advertising that clients will have to pay costs even if their lawsuits are unsuccessful.in reaching this conclusion,the court distinguished between statutes like section b that compel disclosures from those that prohibit speech.it noted,in part,that because disclosure requirements trench much more narrowly on an advertiser interest than do flat prohibitions on speech,warnings or disclaimers might be appropriately required in order to dissipate the possibility of consumer confusion or deception.id.at.internal citation omitted.the court concluded that an attorney constitutionally protected interest in not providing any particular factual information in his advertising is minimal,and thus found the disclosure requirement at issue was reasonably related to the state interest in preventing deception of consumers.id.citing central hudson emphasis supplied.
zauderer,therefore,eases the burden of meeting the central hudson test.in assessing disclosure requirements,zauderer presumes that the government interest in preventing consumer deception is substantial,and that where a regulation requires disclosure only of factual and uncontroversial information and is not unduly burdensome,it is narrowly tailored.these principles are easily met here.
section b contains two forms of disclosure that a promoter disclose his status as such,and that a promoter disclose how much he is paid for his promotions.we discuss each separately since the former addresses slightly different interests than the latter.
disclosure of the payment 
it is undisputed that the government has an interest in protecting consumers from being misled.illinois,ex rel.madigan telemarketing,d t he first amendment does not shield fraud.section b directly advances this interest because as the listeners to wenger radio program and readers of his newsletter who testified in this their decisions whether to buy a stock in part on whether various opinions about the product are or not.by requiring publicists to disclose their interests,the government prevents investors from mistaking for disinterested advice.and as the supreme court suggested in lowe,the dangers of fraud,deception,or overreaching are present not only in publicity that contain s any false or misleading information,but also in publicity that is designed to tout any security in which publicists ha ve an interest.lowe,at.
the disclosure requirement imposed by section b is thus reasonably related to the goal of fraud prevention.a publicist who fails to disclose that he has an interest in the companies he promotes will almost always mislead his audience into thinking that his advice is disinterested.similarly,we are influenced by the fact that the disclosure requirement applies only to those securities that a promoter has been paid to tout.the fact that the promoter must provide a disclaimer as to each security he touts at the time he promotes the security is only a minimal burden imposed by the statute.
therefore,to the extent section b requires stock publicists to disclose that they are receiving consideration from the companies they are promoting,it is tailored to prevent fraud and does not offend the first amendment.
disclosure of the amount of payment 
the last question is whether section b survives scrutiny to the extent it requires publicists to disclose the amount of consideration they are receiving.wenger argues that disclosure of an interest ordinarily suffices to put listeners on notice that a publicist advice may not be trustworthy.
in our view,however,by requiring publicists to disclose the amount of consideration they are receiving,section b imposes only a de minimis additional disclosure burden on the paid promoter.telling a listener or reader that the promoter has been bought and paid for,and for how much,directly informs prospective purchasers of the speaker biases.the listener is free to make an informed investment decision in light of that knowledge.the amount requirement of section b is a natural corollary to the disclosure of the speaker status as a promoter.as such,its satisfies the requirement that there be a reasonable fit between the congressional objective and the statutory command.
in addition,congress has a substantial interest through the securities laws in making capital markets more open and efficient.it requires but little appreciation of what happened in this country during the and to realize how essential it is that the highest ethical standards prevail in the securities industry.silver new york stock exchange,d and see auchincloss,the embezzler describing fictionalized stock promoter.furthermore,i n the eyes of some,the best way to achieve both fairness and efficiency is to give all investors equal access to all relevant information.dirks sec,rev on other grounds,d.in enacting section b,congress could reasonably conclude the amount of consideration a publicist receives will influence a rational investor decision whether to buy or sell a stock,because a publicist recommendation will be given more or less weight depending on how much he stands to benefit from trumpeting a stock.therefore,even if section b requirement that publicists disclose the amount of consideration did impose some burden,such a burden is reasonably related to the government interest in promoting open capital markets.
and as a final matter,the disclaimers at issue here impose little burden on speech.in the context of a half hour broadcast or newsletter,it takes only a slight effort to tell one listeners or readers,i have been paid million shares of pan world stock in exchange for putting the company on this show or in this newsletter.
in sum,section b does not violate wenger commercial speech rights.it allows publicists to still assert a message while advancing the consumer interest in knowing the publicists financial stake in promoting a stock,thereby reasonably advancing the government interest in preventing deception and achieving more open securities markets.accordingly,we reject wenger first amendment challenge to section b.
ii.vagueness 
wenger also argues that section b is unconstitutionally vague.we review vagueness challenges de novo.united states agnew,cir.
