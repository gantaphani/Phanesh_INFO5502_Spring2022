the people of the state of california sued edward jones edward jones,a brokerage firm,for failing to adequately disclose to investors and potential investors certain agreements under which edward jones received additional compensation for selling certain preferred mutual funds.the trial court dismissed the action on the ground it was preempted by federal,the national securities markets improvement act of,stat.nsmia because,in the court view,t he assertion of california authority in this manner conflicts with the federal regulation of information provided in mutual fund prospectuses.
we conclude this action is not preempted by the nsmia because it is a type of action expressly permitted by that statute.we also conclude the action is not preempted by the united states securities and exchange commission sec rule because the action does not conflict with that rule.accordingly,we will reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
we take the following facts from the second amended complaint,which is the operative pleading for our purposes.
edward jones is a national brokerage firm that maintains at least branch offices in california and is a within the meaning of corporations code section since at least january,edward jones has offered for sale and sold shares of mutual funds from seven mutual fund complexes referred to in this action as the preferred funds.during this time,edward jones has had agreements with the preferred funds.
generally,a agreement occurs when a mutual fund pays additional compensation in exchange for the preferentially marketing its shares.agreements may increase costs to investors as well as create conflicts of interest between investors and the financial professionals with whom they deal.
since january,edward jones has received approximately million in additional compensation under its agreements with the preferred funds in exchange for heightened visibility of the preferred funds within edward jones s distribution sales systems and privileged access to edward jones s distribution sales systems.edward jones,however,has not disclosed to investors or potential investors sufficient facts to alert them to the existence of the agreements,the consideration paid under the agreements,edward jones obligations under the agreements,or the potential actual conflicts of interest between edward jones and its customers created by those agreements collectively the undisclosed matters.the mutual fund prospectuses and statements of additional information collectively the disclosure documents prepared by the preferred funds disclose only that from time to time additional cash bonuses or other incentives are made to selected participating brokers in connection with the sale or servicing of mutual fund shares and on occasions such bonuses or incentives may be conditioned upon the sale of a specified minimum amount of those shares.
in december,the people commenced this action against edward jones based on the agreements.specifically,the people alleged that in offering for sale selling shares of the preferred funds mutual funds without disclosing the undisclosed matters,edward jones violated section and section,subdivision a because the undisclosed matters are material facts that are necessary to make the statements in the disclosure documents not misleading.the people sought injunctive relief,civil penalties,disgorgement,and other relief.
after an unsuccessful attempt to move the case to federal court,edward jones demurred as relevant here on the ground that the action was preempted by federal securities law,specifically,rule.edward jones asserted that under that rule it was not obliged to provide the details and significance of its revenue sharing agreements,agreements with certain mutual fund companies.edward jones further argued that allowing the people to proceed in this case would be a usurpation of the sec regulatory authority.
the trial court judge brian van camp overruled the demurrer,concluding based on the long history of concurrent state and federal securities law,that while sec rule section may overlap with state enforcement actions,that rule is not determinative of whether sections and a have been violated.t here is no policy objective sought to be advanced by the sec which would be frustrated by this enforcement action,therefore sections and a are not preempted by federal securities law.
because edward jones had entered into a series of agreements and consent order requiring jones to modify its policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of revenue sharing agreements and payments,the trial court granted edward jones motion to strike the request for injunctive relief but gave the people leave to amend.the people filed their first amended complaint in august,but the trial court ultimately struck the request for injunctive relief from that complaint without leave to amend,leaving the people to seek monetary relief only.
thereafter,in december,edward jones filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings.once again edward jones contended the people action was preempted by rule same argument edward jones had unsuccessfully asserted in support of its demurrer to the original complaint.in addition,however,edward jones asserted the action was preempted by the nsmia.on this point,edward jones pointed to a recent decision by the los angeles county superior court dismissing an identical action by the people against one of the preferred funds on that basis.
in opposing the motion,the people asserted both that the action was not preempted and that edward jones motion was an improper motion for reconsideration of the order overruling the demurrer.
in its tentative ruling,the trial court judge loren mcmaster rejected the people procedural challenge to the motion,but agreed the action was not preempted under either the nsmia or rule.after argument,however,the court changed its mind on the issue of preemption by the nsmia.the court explained that it was persuaded that the contents of a prospectus are subject to federal conflict preemption.the court gave the people leave to amend,however,regarding additional disclosures edward jones could have provided.
in april,the people filed their second amended complaint the operative pleading here.edward jones demurred again,and this time the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.relying on the nsmia,the court concluded that the people action here seeks to impose the state of california view of what a prosect us should say on mutual funds that have a shelf agreement with s.the assertion of california authority in this manner conflicts with the federal regulation of information provided in mutual fund prospectuses and hence is by such.this is clearly an area that requires nationwide uniformity and consistency and not be subject to the differing rules of states.
the court entered judgment in favor of edward jones in june,and after the court denied the people motion to vacate the judgment or for a new trial,the people filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
ijudgment on the pleadings following an unsuccessful demurrer 
the people first contend we should reverse the judgment because it was premised on judge mcmaster order granting judgment on the pleadings with leave to amend.according to the people,in granting judgment on the pleadings,judge mcmaster,in effect,reversed judge van camp order overruling jones s demurrer.the people contend judge mcmaster action was improper because of the general rule that one trial judge can not reconsider and overrule an order of another trial judge.people riva th,d.they also contend it was improper because jones motion was not based on new or different facts,circumstances,or law.in support of this latter contention,the people rely on both code of civil procedure section,subdivision g,which governs motions for judgment on the pleadings and code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,which governs motions for reconsideration generally 
for its part,edward jones argues that code of civil procedure section does not apply because edward jones motion was a common law motion for judgment on the pleadings rather than a statutory motion for judgment on the pleadings code of civil procedure section and the general rule against one judge overruling another judge do not apply because edward jones did not move for reconsideration of the order overruling the demurrer,but instead moved for judgment on the pleadings,which is a different order altogether and in any event,edward jones motion was based on new law,specifically,an intervening superior court decision finding preemption under the nsmia.
the foregoing arguments raise a number of interesting issues.we need not reach any of them,however,because even if we assume for the sake of argument that it was error for judge mcmaster to rule on edward jones motion for judgment on the pleadings and thereby effectively overrule judge van camp order on the demurrer,that error can not be deemed reversible without reaching the merits of the preemption issue.in other words,even if the people are right in their assertion of procedural error,we can not reverse the judgment unless the people are also correct on the substantive issue of preemption.accordingly,we may resolve the case based on the substantive issue alone,and that is what we will do.
the conclusion that we must reach the substantive issue even if we find procedural error flows from the constitutional doctrine of reversible error.section of article vi of the california constitution commands that n o judgment shall be set aside in any cause,for any error as to any matter of procedure,unless,after an examination of the entire cause the court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.what that means here is that we can not reverse the judgment of dismissal based on judge mcmaster alleged error in ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings unless we are convinced that that ruling resulted in a miscarriage of justice to the people.but if judge mcmaster was ultimately right on the substantive issue he this action is preempted by federal securities no miscarriage of justice occurred even if judge mcmaster never should have ruled on the motion for judgment on the pleadings in the first place because preventing the people from proceeding on an action that is preempted by federal law can not be deemed a miscarriage of justice.
of course,if judge mcmaster ruling on the substantive issue was wrong,and this action is not preempted,then the people can show a miscarriage of justice.but that miscarriage of justice would exist not simply because judge mcmaster reconsidered judge van camp ruling on the preemption issue when he should not have,but because he came to the wrong conclusion on that issue when he did so.in other words,a miscarriage of,reversible be found in this case only if judge mcmaster was wrong on the substantive issue of preemption,and therefore we can and should resolve the case on that issue alone.
our conclusion is supported by payne city of perris th,d.payne involved a tort action arising out of a death from a police vehicle pursuit.the city demurred,contending it was immune from liability under a certain vehicle code provision because the city had adopted a written policy on vehicle pursuits.id.at,d.the demurrer was overruled on the ground the guidelines in the policy were not sufficient and that a question existed as to whether the policy was actually adopted or implemented.ibid.later,however,the city moved for summary judgment,again contending the statutory immunity applied.ibid.this time the trial court found the city was immune from liability and entered judgment accordingly.ibid.
on appeal,the appellate court first considered whether it was error for the second judge,on the motion for summary judgment,to reanalyze whether the city was immune and to render a different ruling on that issue than the one previously made by a different judge in connection with the city demurrer.payne city of perris,supra,th at,d.the appellate court concluded that any error committed by the second judge in essentially overruling the first judge determination on the immunity issue d id not warrant reversal.id.at,d.the court explained that because the issue involved was a pure question of dependent upon any factual determinations and one not left to the trial court discretion,little purpose would be served in reversing the judgment.this court is not bound by either the first judge or the second judge determination on the question of law presented and there is,therefore,no reason for this court not to proceed to the issue on its merits at this time.to conclude otherwise would require the parties to litigate an action possibly based on an incorrect legal premise only for this court to later reverse any subsequent judgment because of that same incorrect legal premise.we refuse to elevate form over substance in that fashion and accordingly proceed to the immunity question id.at,d.
although the court in payne did not speak in terms of reversible error,the court reasoning fully supports our conclusion here.by refusing to elevate form over substance,the payne court was refusing to reverse a judgment based on a procedural error that would turn out to be harmless if the court ultimately determined the action was barred as a matter of law.such is the case here.
the people contend payne was impliedly overruled by the supreme court decision in le francois goel cal th,d,but we disagree.in le francois,our supreme court concluded that code of civil procedure section constitutionally prohibit s a party from seeking reconsideration not based on new facts or law,but do es not limit a court ability to reconsider its previous interim orders on its own motion,as long as it gives the parties notice that it may do so and a reasonable opportunity to litigate the question.le francois,at,d.justice kennard filed a concurring and dissenting opinion in which she concluded the judgment should be affirmed,notwithstanding the trial court error in granting an impermissible motion for reconsideration,because no miscarriage of justice had been shown.id.at,d.the majority disagreed that the judgment should be affirmed on the basis of harmless error because defendants have made no such harmless error argument,and thus plaintiffs have had no chance to argue against it.moreover,the trial court did not inform the parties that it might change its previous ruling on its own motion and give them an opportunity to be heard,as it should have done.we do not know what would have occurred if it had done so.under the circumstances,we think it best to remand the matter for the court and parties to follow proper procedure.id.at,fn,d.
contrary to the people suggestion,le francois did not purport to establish that a procedural error in considering an improper motion for reconsideration is always reversible without regard to the substantive issue involved.the majority decided to reverse on the facts of that case both because the parties had not argued harmless error and because,essentially,the court could not tell if the error was harmless because it did not know what would have occurred if the trial court had followed the proper procedure.
here,both parties have argued whether the reasoning in payne applies here and thus have,at least tangentially,addressed the issue of harmless error.more importantly,since we confront here a pure question of law that was argued three times in the trial court,there is no basis for concern about what might have happened absent the alleged procedural error.the question before us now is the same question that will be presented on appeal if the case is tried and the people the action preempted by federal law if edward jones is correct in asserting that the action is preempted,then the people have suffered no harm from the procedural error they assert here.
under the constitutional principle of reversible error set forth in section of article vi of the california constitution,we can not reverse a judgment based on a procedural error unless there has been a miscarriage of justice,and here we can not determine whether there has been a miscarriage of justice without addressing the substantive issue of preemption,since there would be no miscarriage of justice in precluding th
