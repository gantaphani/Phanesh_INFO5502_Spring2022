electronic gaming has become ubiquitous even slot machines are now made to operate at the push of a button rather than the pull of a lever.electronic game card,set out to further this trend by producing electronic scratch off devices for casinos,lotteries,and other gaming establishments.the company appeared to be flying high,with millions of dollars in reported assets as late as september.but a little over a year later,electronic game card,filed for bankruptcy and reported it was broke.
a group of investors filed suit,alleging that the company former chief executive officer and chief financial officer violated section b of the securities exchange act,and that others violated section a of the act.the private securities litigation reform act of pslra provides that all discovery shall be stayed during the pendency of any motion to dismiss in a private securities litigation action.b b.the complaint at issue in this appeal,the third amended complaint,was based in large part on discovery materials subpoenaed before the company former ceo gave notice of his intent to file a motion for judgment on the pleadings.these materials were not received until after the ceo gave such notice.
the questions we must decide are whether the district court properly struck allegations and exhibits from the third amended complaint because they were based on discovery obtained in violation of a pslra discovery stay and whether the third amended complaint adequately pleaded false statements and scienter.for the reasons explained below,we reverse the district court judgment dismissing this action and remand for further proceedings.
background 
in september,the lead plaintiffs investors,appellants here,filed a first amended complaint fac alleging violations of section b of the securities exchange act of by lee cole and linden boyne,and violations of section a of the act by all remaining.cole and boyne are the former ceo and cfo,respectively,of electronic game card,company.the other individual served as company executives,on its board of directors,or both section b prohibits securities fraud by use of deceptive and manipulative practices.b.section a makes control persons liable for violations of other rules or regulations under the act,including securities fraud.a.
according to investors,until the company owned all shares of a subsidiary called electronic game card,subsidiary that operated in the united kingdom and europe.the subsidiary played an essential role in the company business.in fact,investors alleged that nearly all of the company reported revenues and income were derived from the subsidiary.
under the purported terms of a agreement through which the company acquired all shares of the subsidiary,if the company attempted to change the memorandum or articles or other governing instruments of the subsidiary,change the number of persons constituting the board of directors of the subsidiary,or change the persons constituting the board of directors of the subsidiary,a default would be declared and the shares would revert to the original owners 
in,control persons kevin donovan and eugene christiansen assumed control of the company in place of cole and boyne.the record indicates substantial infighting during this period.under new leadership,the company removed the subsidiary board,causing ownership of the subsidiary stock to revert back to its original owner sometime in early.
in february,the company announced that its auditor,mendoza berger company auditor,had withdrawn its audit opinions of the company financial statements for fiscal years to after becoming aware of irregularities in the audit confirmation of a bank account represented as having been held by the subsidiary.in may,the company publicly announced that these financial statements should no longer be relied upon because of significant concerns as to the ir integrity.the company announcement revealed that it was concerned that reported revenue may be materially overstated and that the reported carrying value of its assets and investments in companies may not be fairly stated.investors alleged that the withdrawal of the company financial statements and related information in its annual reports filed with the sec demonstrated that these statements were false when made.they also alleged that the highly adverse fact that the company could lose ownership of the subsidiary was hidden from them,rendering its statements about its ownership of the subsidiary,its assets and revenue stream,materially false and misleading.
control persons moved to dismiss the fac,and the district court granted the motion,in part.it dismissed the b claims against control persons,but it did not dismiss the a claims.the court ruled that investors had adequately pleaded a primary b violation by the company,as well as each moving defendant status as a control person.the court also concluded that investors adequately pleaded the company scienter a prerequisite to finding a violation of section b through its allegations relating to cole and boyne.the court observed none of the moving defendants contest the notion that the fac contains viable allegations of boyne and cole scienter,which may be imputed to the company.but cole and boyne had not answered the fac by this point in the litigation.from the record available on appeal,it appears they lived abroad and had not been served with the fac at the time of the district court ruling.
investors filed their second amended complaint sac in february.it alleged b violations by all defendants except control persons christiansen,farrell,and houssels,and a violations against all individual defendants.
both the fac and sac made substantially similar factual and legal allegations as to the primary b violations.in particular,investors alleged that the company and its management made false statements concerning the company ownership of the subsidiary,and that the subsequent retraction of the auditor opinions shows that the company public financial statements were false over several years 
these basic factual allegations of the company scienter were not initially challenged by the defendants.after the district court ruled on control person donovan motion to dismiss the sac,it set a schedule for discovery,and on june,investors commenced discovery by issuing a subpoena to the company auditor.the subpoena was returnable on july.
at some point after filing the sac,investors managed to contact cole,and he agreed to answer the investors allegations.on august or,cole counsel notified investors of his intent to file a motion for judgment on the pleadings.in cole opinion,this notification gave rise to a stay of discovery under the pslra,but investors communicated their disagreement with the contention that a pslra discovery stay was in effect.
on august,investors received materials from the auditor in response to their discovery requests.cole filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings shortly thereafter,along with a motion to confirm the existence of a pslra discovery stay,and boyne filed a motion to dismiss.the district court granted both dispositive motions without prejudice and denied as moot cole motion to confirm the existence of a discovery stay.
the third amended complaint tac was filed in november,and it presents a substantially more detailed and unified account of the alleged misfeasance by cole and boyne.specifically,the tac alleges that cole and boyne actively concealed the existence of the agreement from the auditor,and perhaps from the company board as well in support of their earlier efforts to have the sac dismissed,cole and boyne argued that the board knew about the agreement,and boyne pointed to the minutes of a february,board meeting at which the agreement was supposedly discussed.but cole and boyne were the only two directors listed as present for this meeting,and the tac asserts that cole and boyne either concealed or fabricated these minutes.in support of this contention,the tac alleges that while cole and boyne claimed to have provided the auditor with all company board minutes for,discovery from the auditor did not include the february minutes,despite including minutes for other board meetings around the same time.
the tac also alleges the company was able to report millions of dollars in cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal years,and because its financial statements were wrongfully consolidated with its subsidiary.allegedly,much of this cash was represented to the auditor as being held in a bank account with credit suisse in gibraltar,spain that was controlled by the company and its subsidiary.
relying on the auditor discovery materials,the tac claims that the dollar gibraltar account never existed.discovery materials obtained from the auditor and appended as exhibits to the tac include allegedly false bank audit confirmations and bank statements on credit suisse stationary,which appear to bear boyne signature the tac alleges that these forms also bear forged bank employee signatures and a fabricated address for a credit suisse audit confirmation unit in malaga,spain.the exhibits,if authentic and accurate,would be consistent with investors theory that false representations concerning the company finances began when cole and boyne were ceo and cfo of the company,respectively,and continued while boyne remained cfo.the tac alleges that forms were sent in credit suisse name to the auditor in order to falsely confirm the existence of bank accounts represented as the company or the subsidiary.
the tac alleges that these falsified confirmations were the reason the company auditor withdrew its audit opinions for fiscal years,and.in support of this allegation,the tac includes an exhibit that purports to be a letter from credit suisse stating that a bank account represented by boyne as belonging to the company in fact belonged solely to cole and boyne,not the company.another exhibit appears to be a letter credit suisse subsequently wrote to control person donovan who had become the company new ceo stating that the bank would be reporting the matter to the royal gibraltar police and advising the company to do the same.
investors allege that the dramatic shift in the company fortunes,illustrated by the withdrawal of the audit opinions,was principally explained by its loss of the subsidiary in.they allege that,had the auditor known the company could lose ownership of the subsidiary under the terms of the agreement,it would not have allowed the company and subsidiary financial reports to be consolidated because this would have been contrary to generally accepted accounting principles gaap investors claim that cole and boyne concealed the existence of the agreement from the company auditor because the agreement restrictions on changing the subsidiary board and articles of association deprived the company of its ability to exercise control,and that this limitation,in turn,made the consolidation of the company financial statements with the subsidiary inappropriate under gaap.the tac alleges that the company consolidated financial statements were therefore false,and that as a result of this alleged pattern of fraud,investors lost the entire value of their investment when the value of the company stock collapsed.cole responded to the tac by filing a motion to strike several of its exhibits,and to strike allegations in the tac that were derived from the auditor discovery materials.cole,boyne,and control persons filed motions to dismiss the tac.
the district court ruled that a discovery stay arose automatically on august or pursuant to the pslra,when cole announced his intent to file a motion for judgment on the pleadings.the court opined that investors should have immediately ceased all discovery at that point.acknowledging that motions to strike pleadings are disfavored,the court nonetheless ruled that investors can not be permitted to openly flaunt a direct violation of the pslra.under federal rule of civil procedure f,the court struck the portions of the tac referring to or relying upon the auditor discovery materials,in light of its conclusion that the materials were obtained in violation of the pslra discovery stay.
the district court ultimately ruled without the stricken allegations,the tac does not contain sufficient facts to state a claim for violations of section b or section a of the exchange act,and investors allegations did not sufficiently allege falsity or scienter to meet the heightened pleading requirements of the pslra.the district court dismissed the tac with prejudice and entered final judgment in favor of defendants.investors appealed

discussion 
i.the private securities litigation reform act discovery stay provision 
the pslra was enacted in in response to several perceived abuses in securities litigation,including discovery abuses.sg cowen sec.dist.court for dist.of,cir.the pslra creates heightened pleading requirements for private securities fraud actions like this one.metzler,at.in addition,under the heading stay of discovery,the pslra provides 
in any private action arising under this chapter,all discovery and other proceedings shall be stayed during the pendency of any motion to dismiss,unless the court finds upon the motion of any party that particularized discovery is necessary to preserve evidence or to prevent undue prejudice to that party.
b b.our decision in sg cowen analyzed this provision.there,we observed that the pslra discovery stay was designed to avoid the unnecessary imposition of discovery costs on defendants.sg cowen,at quoting,at,reprinted in sess.we held that the failure to muster facts sufficient to meet the act pleading requirements can not constitute the requisite undue prejudice to the plaintiff justifying a lift of the discovery stay.id.at.congress clearly intended that complaints in these securities actions should stand or fall based on the actual knowledge of the plaintiffs rather than information produced by the defendants after the action has been filed.id.at quoting medhekar dist.for dist.of,cir.the stay of discovery provision of the act clearly contemplates that discovery should be permitted in securities class actions only after the court has sustained the legal sufficiency of the complaint.id.at quoting,at,reprinted in,emphasis in original.
the district court relied on federal rule of civil procedure f when it struck the portions of the tac that were based on the auditor discovery materials.we review this ruling for abuse of discretion.nurse,at.rule f provides the court may strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant,immaterial,impertinent,or scandalous matter.the district court emphasized without elaboration the term immaterial,which suggests that it struck part of the tac because it believed the auditor discovery was rendered immaterial by investors violation of the stay.
we have defined immaterial as that which has no essential or important relationship to the claim for relief or the defenses being plead.fantasy,fogerty,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted,rev on other grounds.under this definition,even if the incorporation of the auditor discovery materials into the tac was improper,the discovery would not be immaterial under rule f.evidence of forgery and fraud clearly has an essential or important relationship to investors claim for relief in their securities fraud action.see fantasy,at.nor are the discovery materials redundant,impertinent,or scandalous as contemplated by rule f.the district court may have cited the immaterial provision of rule f to signal that it concluded the discovery could not be considered because it had been obtained in violation of the pslra discovery stay,but this interpretation of rule f does not accord with how our court has defined the term immaterial.see id.
we recognize that the district court may have relied on rule f because congress did not expressly provide a remedy for violations of the pslra stay.investors do not offer any convincing argument that the district court would not have the discretion to sanction a violation of the pslra stay provision,as it would any discovery stay.b a iii permitting courts to strike pleadings when a party fails to obey a discovery order.but because,as discussed below,we decide the auditor discovery materials were not obtained in violation of a pslra discovery stay,we do not need to define the contours of the district court authority to strike pleadings obtained in violation of this type of stay.even if a pslra discovery stay arose on august or when cole announced his intent to file a motion for judgment on the pleadings,such stay would not have been violated by the use of discovery received in response to discovery requests properly issued before any stay arose.
ii.appellants did not violate the pslra discovery stay provision.
the pslra requires that all discovery and other proceedings shall be stayed during a pending motion to dismiss.b b.defendants argue that investors impermissibly obtained the auditor discovery materials in violation of this stay provision.their theory depends on the assumption that the pslra prevents the use of discovery that was properly requested,but received after a stay arose 
our decision in sg cowen makes clear that no discovery may proceed until the court has sustained the legal sufficiency of a complaint.at.the supreme court recently noted that the pslra permits defendants to obtain automatic stays of discovery.chadbourne parke llp troice,emphasis added when an amended complaint is filed after an earlier complaint has been upheld at least in part,the bulk of district courts have ruled that filing a motion to dismiss the amended complaint also triggers a stay of any discovery.see,fosbre las vegas sands,cv kjd gwf,wl,at,i t is proper to impose the stay of discovery pending the decision on the motion to dismiss the second amended complaint,notwithstanding that the parties engaged in discovery prior to its filing.mcguire dendreon,no.mjp,wl,in re smith barney transfer agent,civ.whp,wl,at,sedona,wl,at in re lantronix.sec,no.cv pa,wl,at,refusing to lift stay even when defendant did not challenge part of plaintiffs claim.nonetheless,assuming that a discovery stay arose when cole gave notice of his intent to file a motion for judgment on the pleadings,we do not read the statute to have retroactive application that is,the admonition that all discovery and other proceedings shall be stayed during the pendency of any motion to dismiss does not prohibit a party from accepting responses to requests for written discovery.
the common sense reading of the pslra plain language all discovery and other proceedings shall be stayed is that no litigant shall take any steps in pursuit of discovery during the pendency of any motion to dismiss there is no indication that investors did so here.instead,on june,after the district court had ruled on the first dispositive motions and upheld part of the fac,the court issued a scheduling order allowing the parties to proceed with discovery.neither cole counsel nor any other party represented at the june scheduling conference objected to the district court proposed schedule.the parties except boyne subsequently exchanged initial disclosures consistent with the scheduling order,and no party argues on appeal that the scheduling order was improperly entered.furthermore,it is undisputed that there was no dispositive motion pending and therefore no discovery stay in effect as of june,when investors subpoenaed records from the company auditor.no party objected to the subpoena at that time,and cole did not notify investors of his intent to file a motion for judgment on the pleadings until august at the earliest.the subpoena to the auditor was therefore properly issued,and the only question here is whether investors could permissibly rely on tardy discovery responses,delivered to them after a pslra discovery stay allegedly came into effect again.
we would expect that if congress intended a pslra discovery stay to prohibit the use of documents received in response to discovery requests,it would have said so explicitly.the determinative fact for this appeal is that investors subpoenaed the auditor records pursuant to the district court discovery schedule at a time when no motion to dismiss was pending.the pslra was enacted to reform abusive practices committed in private securities litigation,at,reprinted in.in arguing that investors engaged in abusive practices,defendants rely heavily on our decision in sg cowen,which noted that discovery should be permitted in securities class actions only after the court has sustained the legal sufficiency of the complaint.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted emphasis in original.but here,the district court did sustain the sufficiency of the complaint,and it initially allowed discovery to proceed pursuant to its discovery scheduling order.none of the defendants objected to this scheduling order.even on appeal,no party has asked us to hold that a district court may not allow discovery in a securities class action case when a prior complaint has been upheld as to some parties and no motion to dismiss is pending or anticipated,simply because the court has not expressly upheld every part of the complaint as to all parties.this record does not show that investors engaged in abusive practices or violated a statutory stay.
defendants contend that investors violated the stay by incorporating some of the auditor discovery materials into the tac.the purpose of the pslra would not be furthered by the broad reading of the discovery stay provision that advocate.the discovery stay was intended to prevent discovery abuses such as the unnecessary imposition of discovery costs on defendants,particularly as a means to coerce settlement.sg cowen,at quoting,at,reprinted in.discovery costs may also affect third parties like the company auditor.but if the auditor was concerned about the costs of complying with the subject subpoena,it did not object,nor did it argue that a discovery stay was in effect such that it should be relieved of the obligation to respond similarly,if defendants believed investors subpoenas were issued improperly,they could have sought immediate relief from the court.they did not do so,and we see no basis for such an objection defense counsel conceded at oral argument before our court that no discovery stay was in place when the june subpoena was issued to the auditor 
if the receipt of discovery was not a violation of the pslra,surely the use of the discovery materials in the tac was not prohibited.the mere reliance on materials is not an abusive practice,nor does it impose unnecessary discovery costs on defendants.we hold that a party does not violate a pslra discovery stay by relying on materials provided by a pursuant to a valid subpoena issued when no pslra discovery stay was in effect.because we conclude that investors did not violate the pslra,we reverse the district court order striking portions of the tac that incorporated the auditor discovery materials.
iii.the tac adequately pleads falsity and scienter.
we now consider whether the full tac including the portions the district court struck pursuant to rule f adequately pleads falsity and scienter as to defendants cole and boyne.
we review the dismissal of a complaint pursuant to b de novo.metzler,at.the required elements of a private securities fraud action are a material misrepresentation or omission of fact,scienter,a connection with the purchase or sale of a security,transaction and loss causation,and economic loss.id.internal quotations omitted.t he complaint shall specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with
