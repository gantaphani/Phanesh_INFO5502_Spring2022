we hold the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing the plaintiffs claim with prejudice because their two unsuccessful attempts to replead the claim adequately demonstrated,as the district court found,that they could not plead additional facts consistent with,but sufficient to cure the deficiency in,their original pleadings.the district court did not,however,adequately explain why the plaintiffs attempt in their draft complaint,submitted with a motion to reconsider the first dismissal of their complaint,was inadequate to demonstrate they could cure the deficiencies in pleading their b and a claims.accordingly,we vacate the order in part and again remand the question of prejudice for clarification with respect to those two claims.
background 
the plaintiffs allege they purchased debt securities from interbank funding ibf and its subsidiaries between and,including the class period of july,to june.ibf,at least a majority of which was owned by simon hershon,had formed several investment funds with the purpose of purchasing and restructuring or rehabilitating underperforming loans.the plaintiffs claim ibf funds were actually part of a ponzi scheme,wherein proceeds from successive securities offerings were used to make interest payments to those who had invested in prior offerings.cibc world markets sold securities to the plaintiffs and radin glass served as ibf independent auditor for ibf fund vii,now called collateralized finance corporation.
the plaintiffs suits against hershon,radin,cibc,and others were consolidated,after which they filed a consolidated amended complaint and settled their claims against hershon.in the consolidated amended complaint,the plaintiffs alleged radin and cibc had disseminated materially false and misleading information about ibf funds and engaged in a scheme to defraud investors,in violation of b of the act,b,and of rule promulgated thereunder.in addition,they claimed radin,by attesting that ibf financial statements complied with generally accepted accounting principles gaap when,in fact,the statements were materially false or misleading,had violated of the act.finally,they alleged cibc had violated the prospectus delivery requirements of a and of the act,a,when it sold ibf securities to investors.
radin and cibc each moved,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.after a hearing,the district court granted the defendants motions to dismiss.see in re interbank funding.sec,d,belizan i.with respect to the alleged violations of b,the court held the plaintiffs had failed adequately to plead scienter allege their claims with the specificity required by federal rule of civil procedure b and the private securities litigation reform act of pslra.no,stat,and plead causation.d at.the district court also held they failed properly to plead a violation of failed to plead with specificity that their a was timely and lacked standing to bring the a claim.id.at.
the district court also held the plaintiffs would not be allowed to amend their complaint,which it dismissed with prejudice.id.at.the court explained that counsel references at the hearing to the possibility of amending the complaint did not amount to formal motions for leave to amend and that even if they did,the pslra counsel s restraint in granting leave to amend.id.as for the dismissal being with prejudice,the court cited in re champion enterprises.securities litigation,d,for the proposition the pslra set s a high standard of pleading which if not met results in a mandatory dismissal with prejudice.id.
the plaintiffs filed a motion under federal rule of civil procedure e seeking reconsideration insofar as the court had not permitted them leave to amend the complaint and dismissed their claims with prejudice.with their motion,they submitted the draft complaint.the district court denied reconsideration and stated that the plaintiffs revised complaint share d important failings with their earlier effort.
on the plaintiffs first appeal,we held the district court did not err in determining counsel oral reference to the possibility of amending the consolidated amended complaint was not a proper motion for leave to amend.belizan ii,at.we vacated the order of dismissal with prejudice,however,and remanded the case for the district court to exercise its discretion under firestone,which required the court to determine whether the allegation of other facts consistent with the challenged pleading could not possibly meet the heightened pleading requirements of the pslra.id.at citing firestone firestone.

ii.analysis 
the parties dispute whether the district court abused its discretion when it denied their motion to amend and looked to the draft complaint but not the draft complaint and,if not,then whether the new allegations in the draft complaint indicated the plaintiffs possibly could have cured the deficiencies of their consolidated amended complaint.
motion to amend and draft complaint 
invoking the policy of federal rule of civil procedure a that leave to amend is liberally to be granted,the plaintiffs argue that the district court abused its discretion in denying their motion for leave to amend their complaint and in determining whether to dismiss their claims with prejudice by looking solely to the draft complaint,rather than evaluating their draft complaint.cibc and radin argue the district court correctly denied the plaintiffs motion to amend and ignored the allegations in the draft complaint because the district court has no power or authority to deviate from this court mandate,indep.petroleum ass of am.babbitt,which instructed the district court to enter a new order either dismissing without prejudice or explaining its dismissal with prejudice in a manner consistent with our opinion,belizan ii,at.
in our view,it would not have been inconsistent with our mandate for the district court to have considered the draft complaint in order to determine whether the plaintiffs could cure the deficiencies of their previous efforts,nor would the court have erred in granting the plaintiffs motion to amend.nothing in the mandate required the court to do so,however,and the court certainly did not abuse its discretion by looking solely at the record as it stood before the first appeal or by denying the motion to amend.doe mcmillan,when a plaintiff seeks to file an amended complaint this tardily on remand to district court,it is within the sound discretion of the district court,in consideration of the potential prejudice to the other party and the interest in eventual resolution of litigation,to deny leave to amend.
