defendants appellants pentagon capital management and lewis chester appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york sweet,judge.after a bench trial,the district court found the defendants liable for securities fraud under section a of the securities act of the securities act,section b of the securities exchange act of the exchange act,and rule ordered disgorgement and imposed a civil penalty.each monetary award was imposed jointly and severally in the amount of.we find no error in the district court determination of liability,the amount of its disgorgement award,and its decision to impose that award jointly and severally.but we reverse the district court imposition of joint and several liability for the civil penalty,vacate that penalty,and remand for reconsideration of its amount in light of the supreme court decision in gabelli sec.
background 
we assume the parties familiarity with the background of this case and recite only those facts relevant on appeal.for additional detail,we refer the parties to the district court thorough opinion.see sec pentagon capital mgmt.plc,d.the basis for the district court imposition of fraud liability was the defendant practice of late trading in the mutual fund market.late trading occurs when,after the price of a mutual fund becomes fixed each day,an order is placed and executed as though it occurred at or before the time the price was determined,thereby allowing the purchaser to take advantage of information released after the price becomes fixed but before it can be adjusted the following day.
mutual funds and late trading 
mutual fund shares are priced according to the fund net asset value,or nav.sec rule,promulgated under the investment company act of,requires that a mutual fund calculate its nav at least once per day,monday through friday.c b.a mutual fund nav is generally calculated by using the closing prices of portfolio securities on the exchange or market on which the securities principally trade.disclosure regarding market timing and selective disclosure of portfolio holdings,proposed,to be codified at pts,final rule adopted in.however,if the closing price of a security held in a mutual fund portfolio does not reflect its current market value at the time of the fund nav calculation,a mutual fund must calculate its nav by using the fair value of that security,as determined in good faith by the fund board.id.this could occur,for example,when some event occurs after the closing price is established but before the fund nav calculation.if a mutual fund shares are mispriced,an investor may take advantage of the disparity between the portfolio securities last quoted prices and their fair value.id.
rule also requires that mutual funds sell and redeem their shares at a price based on the nav next computed after receipt of an order,a practice called forward pricing.id.emphasis added see also c a.forward pricing prevents dilution of mutual fund shares by keeping traders from profiting off of a stale share price.some mutual fund investors,however,engage in late trading,the practice of placing orders to buy or redeem mutual fund shares after,eastern time,as of which most funds calculate their nav,but receiving the price based on the nav,instead of the next day nav,as required by rule.disclosure.at.in vancook sec,cir,we held that such late trading violated rule.
ii.pentagon capital management 
chester formed pentagon capital management pentagon in to facilitate mutual fund trading in the european markets with a market timing strategy in,chester and pentagon explored the possibility of market timing and late trading in the united states mutual fund market to facilitate its trading in the united states,pentagon formed pentagon special purpose fund pspf,the relief defendant in this case.pspf was the sole member and manager of three delaware limited liability companies that were established solely for pentagon use in trading mutual funds in the united states.at all times relevant to this case,pentagon was pspf investment advisor and made all of its trading decisions.
in the united states,unlike in europe,pentagon was required to trade through a broker.as relevant here,pentagon primarily used two individual brokers,james wilson and scott christian,first at other brokerage firms,and finally at trautman,wasserman company trautman.pentagon began trading through trautman on february.
based on pentagon instructions,wilson and christian executed pentagon trades through bank of america,trautman clearing broker.notwithstanding that the nav was normally fixed at,bank of america used a processing system for mutual fund orders that allowed brokers to change an order until or and later,until 
the parties do not dispute that pentagon utilized bank of america permissive clearing system to engage in late trading with the assistance of trautman brokers.pentagon opened different accounts with trautman,each of which could trade separately without a mutual fund knowing they were related.wilson and christian registered the accounts with different broker numbers with the effect that if a mutual fund detected late trading or market timing and blocked one account from trading,other accounts could remain active.pentagon knew that various of its accounts had been expelled from at least thirteen funds,but it continued to trade in those funds using different accounts.
in april,chester sent an email to wilson and christian detailing pentagon after hours trading instructions.chester instructed that wilson and christian would receive a target figure on the standard poors s p near the close of the markets from a pentagon employee then,if the future exceeded or fell below the target,the brokers were to contact pentagon to ask them what to do.chester then emailed other executives at pentagon about the potential for late trading through trautman 
for this week only,trautman can place or cancel any trades up to pm uk time.from next week trautman to confirm the time will be pm pm uk time.
the significance of this is great.
for instance,last night,the s p future shot up at around pm uk time.even though we had placed any trades before uk time,we still could have placed the trade after the bell,which we should have done given the marked rise in the future.
i have been in jimmy wilson office.every day,whether we do a trade or not,they our trade sheets before,and then sit on them until they leave the office,at which point they will process them or not.hence,the ability to place a buy order after the bell,even if we have done so before the bell.
this facility is very valuable and we should utilize it accordingly.
it does matter whether we place trades or not before the bell,we can do so afterwards,up to trautman time limits.
pentagon,d at alterations omitted.
thereafter,christian would create potential trade sheets for pentagon each day and them before,notwithstanding that the actual decision to place the order or not would be made after then,sometime after,a pentagon employee would email christian the instructions for pentagon late trades for that day.the district court found that pentagon realized profits of approximately from the mutual fund late trades they executed through trautman between february,and september.id.at.
pentagon tried to conceal its late trading activities.for example,on july,chester sent an email to a broker that instructed him not to use the words market timing which,viewed broadly,includes late trading on any correspondence,telling him to label what we do dynamic asset allocation,but never market timing id.at.in august,chester instructed another pentagon employee to phone around first union to see if late trading was available because late trading is key,adding i do know how you find out about this late trading without actually saying it.no doubt you work it out id.at.
in september,the new york attorney general announced that it had settled an enforcement action with canary capital partners for violations of the new york state securities laws,including late trading.shortly thereafter,chester received a request from an investor for a letter stating that pentagon had not engaged in late trading or any other illegal activity.chester provided the letter,stating that pentagon had never entered into arrangements with any onshore mutual fund in order to trade post pm est for nav,and that all of pentagon trading arrangements were in accordance with the relevant rules,regulations,investment prospectus,any other such relevant documentation relating to the investment s concerned.id.at.
on april,the sec brought this enforcement action against pentagon.the complaint alleged that pentagon market timing and late trading activities violated section a of the securities act,section b of the exchange act,and rule.after a bench trial,the district court found chester and pentagon primarily liable for late trading the district court found that appellants did not act merely in reliance on their but directed,indeed micromanaged,the late trading that trautman performed on their behalf.id.at.the district court entered an injunction prohibiting pentagon from late trading in the future.it also held pentagon,chester,and pspf jointly and severally liable for a disgorgement award and in civil penalties.the amount of was based on the district court valuation of the profit pentagon,chester,and pspf realized in late trading through trautman between february,and september.this appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,pentagon and chester argue that they can not be held liable because their actions involved no fraud or deceit and that as investment advisors as opposed to brokers,they can not be held primarily liable for securities fraud.they further argue that the district court made various errors related to the monetary awards.following a bench trial,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.sec mayhew,cir.
primary liability for securities fraud 
section a of the securities act makes it 
unlawful for any person in the offer or sale of any securities 
to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,or 
to obtain money or property by means of any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading or 
to engage in any transaction,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser.
a.section b of the exchange act,in relevant part,makes it unlawful for any person to use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe.b.finally,rule,implementing section b,includes three subsections 
it shall be unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,
a to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,
b to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading,or 
c to engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,
in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
we have held that to violate section b and rule,a party must have made a material misrepresentation or a material omission as to which he had a duty to speak,or used a fraudulent device with scienter in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.sec monarch funding,cir.the requirements for a violation of section a apply only to a sale of securities but in other respects are the same as section b and rule,except that no showing of scienter is required for the sec to obtain an injunction under section a or a.id.
pentagon and chester do not deny that they engaged in late trading.the defendants argue,however,that there was no fraud or deceit in their actions.the defendants also argue that an investment advisor as opposed to a broker may not be held liable for securities fraud because the advisor is not responsible for communicating the direction to late trade to the clearing broker.we reject both arguments.
first,the defendants argument that their lack of fraudulent or deceitful intent bars a finding of liability fails because deceitful intent is inherent in the act of late trading.the late trader places an order after the daily mutual fund price is set,but receives the benefit of additional information that the earlier price does not reflect.for this reason,we have held that late trading violates all three subsections of rule because,as discussed above,it violates rule,the rule.see vancook,at.in vancook,an individual broker sought out a clearing broker that would allow him to clear late trades,used trade sheets as evidence that orders were placed before when they were not,and assured his employer that he had not facilitated late trading.in short,he was the scheme architect.id.at.we found that vancook went beyond making misrepresentations,taking a series of actions over several years to implement a scheme that he devised.id.on these grounds,we held that vancook late trading violated all three subsections of rule.although section a was not at issue in vancook,the requirements for a violation of section a,as relevant here,are identical to the requirements for a violation of section b.thus,we have no trouble concluding that section a is also implicated by late trading activity so long as some of the late trading involves the sale of securities.
pentagon and chester engaged in similarly deceitful behavior.they sought out brokers who would engage in late trading.as evidenced by chester email,they knew that the trade sheets were before,even though they had no intention of trading before that time.finally,they issued a false and deceitful letter of assurance that they were not engaging in late trading,similar to vancook false assurances to his employer.
the defendants are not identically situated to vancook,however.vancook was a broker,directly bound by the language of rule,which applies to issuers of securities,persons authorized to consummate transactions in any such securit ies,principal underwriters,and dealers in securities.c a.investment advisors are not explicitly mentioned in rule,but that is of no moment when the claims are brought under sections and and rule.pentagon and chester were as much the architects of this scheme as vancook was,and they orchestrated the late trading program carried out by their brokers.they are liable under section a,section b,and rule because their actions caused the misrepresentations as to the time of the trades and led to their concomitant deception pentagon role as an investment advisor therefore does not shield it from liability under the securities laws.
we also reject the defendants corollary argument that they may not be held liable because they did not communicate directly with the mutual funds.in janus capital group,first derivative traders,shareholders of janus capital group sued janus capital group and janus capital management for making false statements in mutual fund prospectuses filed by janus investment fund.because janus investment fund retained ultimate control over the content of the prospectuses,the supreme court held that janus capital management could not be liable as a maker of the statement under rule 
for purposes of rule,the maker of a statement is the person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement,including its content and whether and how to communicate it.without control,a person or entity can merely suggest what to say,not make a statement in its own right.one who prepares or publishes a statement on behalf of another is not its maker.
id.at.to illustrate its point,the supreme court used the analogy of the relationship between a speechwriter and a speaker.even when a speechwriter drafts a speech,the content is entirely within the control of the person who delivers it.id.pentagon and chester argue that because they never communicate
