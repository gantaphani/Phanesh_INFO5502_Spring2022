in this appeal,we determine that even securities claims without a fraud element must be pled with particularity pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b when that nonfraud securities claim is alleged to be part of a defendant fraudulent conduct.we also remind district courts of their supervisory obligation to sua sponte order repleading pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e when a shotgun complaint fails to link adequately a cause of action to its factual predicates.applying these determinations to this case,we vacate the district court orders and remand with instructions to order repleading.
background 
this securities class action alleges violations of both the securities act of securities act,et,and the securities exchange act of exchange act,et.because the case is before us on a motion to dismiss,we draw all inferences in favor of the plaintiffs.see bryant avado brands,cir.the class of plaintiffs in this case consists of all people who traded first horizon securities between april and april.a subclass of these plaintiffs consists of those people who purchased common stock in first horizon secondary offering and relied on a march registration statement,which subsequently was amended.
first horizon is a pharmaceutical company that markets and sells,but does not develop,prescription drugs.first horizon focuses its marketing efforts on the physicians who prescribe the drugs but sells the drugs only to wholesalers,drug store chains,retail merchandisers,and,occasionally,directly to retail pharmacies.plaintiffs allege that there is a disconnect between first horizon marketing efforts and its sales such that reports of increased prescriptions by physicians may not reflect accurately increased sales from first horizon to its distributors and retailers.
the secondary offering that underpins the securities act claim was completed to finance the acquisition of a new product line,sular,which is an drug.plaintiffs contend that first horizon needed to maintain market confidence in its securities in order to keep the trading price of its stock at a price that would bring in enough capital for the number of shares first horizon desired to add to the market.plaintiffs allege that first horizon,therefore,employed a fraudulent scheme to control the revenue growth.the gist of the fraudulent scheme was to push more inventory into the supply chain and to recognize revenue without increased market demand for the product,that is,without increased sales by the product distributors and retailers.
reviewing defendants motions to dismiss,the district court concluded that the plaintiffs had fail ed to link their specific allegata to the causes of action pled in their complaint and that this failure meant that plaintiffs had not met the pleading requirements of rule b and the private securities litigation reform act,b pslra.at.anticipating a motion to amend,the court conditioned any such amendment on the payment of defendants costs and fees associated with the motion to dismiss.
plaintiffs filed a motion to lift that condition.the district court denied that motion and observed that both parties had defaulted on the court offer.at.the court then extend ed substantially the same offer defendants were to submit a claim for fees and costs with information sufficient to allow the court to determine their reasonableness,and plaintiffs were to file an amended complaint with the understanding that plaintiffs will have to pay some reasonable fee for the defendants fees and costs associated with the motions to dismiss.id.at.the court noted that the plaintiffs then could reargue the reasonableness of the defendants requested expenses and whether the court should impose them at all.
plaintiffs allowed the conditional period to expire and filed a notice of appeal challenging both orders on appeal,plaintiffs continue to argue the merits of whether the complaint stated a claim and whether the district court properly conditioned amendment of the complaint.as explained in the subsequent section,we take a different path and conclude that the complaint is so deficient that the court sua sponte should have ordered repleading.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo a district court order granting a motion to dismiss.oxford asset,jaharis,cir.first,we determine when nonfraud claims under the securities act must be pled with particularity.second,we review the district court conclusions about whether the plaintiffs met their heightened pleading burden.
a.when nonfraud claims must be pled with particularity 
section of the securities act creates a cause of action against persons preparing and signing materially misleading registration statements.a.a registration statement can be misleading either by containing an untrue statement or by omitting facts that are necessary to prevent other statements from being misleading.id.there is no state of mind element to a claim,and liability is virtually absolute,even for innocent misstatements.herman maclean huddleston,d.likewise,a extends similar liability to misrepresentations in prospectuses and oral communications.see a.it is clear that neither allegations of fraud nor scienter are necessarily part of either of these claims.for this reason,we refer to these two claims as nonfraud claims in this opinion.
the question presented to us,however,regards whether there are circumstances when federal rule of civil procedure b would require nonfraud securities claims to be pled with particularity.our sister circuits are split on this matter.compare cal.pub.employees ret.chubb,cir rombach chang,cir lone star ladies inv.club schlotzsky,cir in re stac elecs.sec,cir,with in re nationsmart.sec,cir.in line with the majority of circuits to address the matter,we hold that rule b applies when the misrepresentation justifying relief under the securities act is also alleged to support a claim for fraud under the exchange act and rule b 
rule b requires that,i n all averments of fraud or mistake,the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.b.the rule requires this particularity in order to alert defendants to the precise misconduct with which they are charged and to protect defendants against spurious charges of immoral and fraudulent behavior.durham bus.mgmt,cir quotations omitted.t he rule ensures that the defendant has sufficient information to formulate a defense by putting it on notice of the conduct complained of and protects defendants from harm to their goodwill and reputation.harrison westinghouse savannah river,cir quotations omitted.the twin purposes of providing notice and protecting reputation guide our decision in determining the scope of rule b reach.
we acknowledge that federal rule of civil procedure e allows a plaintiff to plead in the alternative and note that separate counts of the complaint must be read separately.thus,if a complaint were to state properly a claim for battery and fraud,the allegations surrounding the fraud claim would have to be stated with particularity whereas the allegations surrounding the battery claim would need be stated only in accordance with notice pleading standards.however,the and a claims in this case are different from the previous hypothetical in that the complaint alleges that the misrepresentation at issue in the nonfraud claims are also the beginning otherwise part predicate fraud for the rule b securities fraud claim.
we conclude that a or a claim must be pled with particularity when the facts underlying the misrepresentation at stake in the claim are said to be part of a fraud claim,as alleged elsewhere in the complaint.it is not enough to claim that alternative pleading saves the nonfraud claims from making an allegation of fraud because the risk to a defendant reputation is not protected.it would strain credulity to claim that rule b should not apply in this allegation the defendant is a no good defrauder,but,even if he is not,the plaintiff can still recover based on the simple untruth of the otherwise fraudulent statement.nor is it enough to present a general disclaimer in an attempt to immunize the nonfraud claims from the rule requirements,for the same common se
