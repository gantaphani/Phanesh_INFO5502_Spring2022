defendants waddell reed,and its various associated entities,waddell reed timely appeal from a district court order denying their motion to dismiss plaintiff united investors life insurance united investors securities action and sua sponte remanding the action to state court.waddell reed argues that the district court erred in determining that the securities litigation uniform standards act slusa,b,f,does not preempt united investors representative class action,and that it should not have remanded the case.because we lack jurisdiction to review the district court remand order,we dismiss the appeal.
the allegations in the complaint provide us with the background of this dispute.waddell reed is a federally registered investment advisor and broker that sells mutual funds,variable annuities,and financial planning services.waddell reed maintained a contractual relationship with united investors,an life insurance company,whereby waddell reed sold united investors variable annuities in exchange for a commission.united investors alleges that its relationship with waddell reed began to sour when waddell reed threatened to cause united investors policyholders to switch to a rival company unless united investors consented to increase its commission compensation beyond the original contract price.
united investors rebuffed these demands and terminated its relationship with waddell reed with respect to future variable annuity contracts.in response,waddell reed commenced a concerted campaign to induce,pressure,and cause united investors policyholders to replace their united investors variable annuity contracts with variable annuity contracts issued by a competitor of united investors.within approximately eight months,waddell reed agents had replaced almost million of united investors variable annuity policies.of this sum,nearly million came from california policyholders.united investors alleges that waddell reed agents procured these replacement contracts by using material misstatements and misrepresentations,as well as other deceptive and manipulative practices,to pressure and deceive united investors policyholders.
on october,united investors filed this action in los angeles county superior court on behalf of persons who purchased its variable annuities from waddell reed.united investors contends that waddell reed alleged foul play violates california business and professions code et,which prohibits unfair competition,including any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and any unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising.cal.bus.on behalf of its past and present policyholders,united investors sought injunctive relief to prevent waddell reed from continuing its allegedly false and misleading sales practices,as well as restitution of commissions and other income derived from these practices to be paid to united investors policyholders.
waddell reed filed a timely notice of removal in federal court,asserting federal subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to slusa,a federal statute that preempts securities actions under the following circumstances 
no covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any state or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any state or federal court by any private party alleging 
an untrue statement or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security or 
that the defendant used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.
b see also id.f containing virtually identical language.
having removed the case to federal court,waddell reed immediately filed a motion to dismiss united investors complaint.waddell reed notice of removal contends that united investors securities action falls squarely within slusa preemption provisions because it constitutes a covered class action that alleges an untrue statement or omission of a material fact or that the defendant used or employed a manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.id.b.relying on slusa preemptive scope,waddell reed argued that the district court should dismiss the action.
in response to waddell reed motion to dismiss,the district court issued a remand order stating only that 
the court has considered defendants motion to dismiss,together with the moving and opposing papers.
it is ordered that the motion to dismiss be,and hereby is,denied.
it is further ordered,sua sponte,that the case be,and hereby is,remanded.
before advancing to the merits of waddell reed federal preemption claim,we must first ascertain whether we possess jurisdiction to review the district court order.d declares in part that a n order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal.courts have narrowed the reach of this facially unlimited proscription by construing it to preclude only appellate review of remand orders based on one of the two grounds listed in subsection c lack of subject matter jurisdiction or removal procedure irregularities.things remembered,petrarca,d abada charles schwab,cir.remand orders based on other grounds,such as abstention,are fully susceptible to appellate review,subsection d notwithstanding.quackenbush allstate ins,d abada,at.thus,we may reach the merits of waddell reed motion to dismiss only if the district court remand order does not fall within subsection c.
waddell reed argues that subsection c does not apply to this case,because the remand order does not specifically rest on removal procedure irregularities or lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court could not have relied on either of these grounds,waddell reed maintains,because its order makes no explicit reference to them,and because the record as a whole suggests that the district court remanded on purely discretionary grounds.waddell reed points out that only remand orders issued under subsection c and invoking the grounds specified therein that removal was improvident and without jurisdiction are immune from review under subsection d.thermtron,hermansdorfer,d see also united ins.r d latex,cir stating that subsection d does not prevent appellate review of remands based on a district court failure to exercise discretionary jurisdiction.thus,if waddell reed is correct that the district court remanded on c discretionary grounds,then subsection d does not bar appellate review.
united investors challenges this interpretation of the district court order.subsection c precludes appellate review,it argues,because the district court remanded the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
simply put,the district court was called upon to decide whether the action should be maintained,if at all,in federal court under slusa.the district court decision was that the action could be maintained on the state court allegations,but only in state court.this is the very sort of remand decision that is shielded from appellate review.
while it would have aided our review had the district court identified the specific grounds for remanding sua sponte or had there been any remand motion or argument,their absence does not deter our analysis.in assessing the parties rival interpretations,we examine the full record before the district court to ascertain the court actual reason for remanding.see spielman merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir transit cas.certain underwriters at lloyd of london,cir.the remand order failure to cite subsection c affirmatively or to invoke one of its enumerated grounds is not necessarily dispositive.kunzi pan am.world airways,cir accord dalrymple grand river dam,cir.but see new sports recreation,cir a district court must openly state its reliance on grounds other than those contained in section c to permit review of a remand order.rather,i n instances of ambiguity,we can determine a district court actual reason for remanding by examining the substance of the order,executive software,united states dist.court,cir emphasis added,quoting schmitt ins.of,cir,and by l ooking beyond the language of the remand order to all the surrounding circumstance
