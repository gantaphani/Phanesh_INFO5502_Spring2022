opinion of the court 
the plaintiffs,shareholders in several investment companies,filed an interlocutory appeal of the district court dismissal of their state law claims for breach of fiduciary duty and deceit.they claim that the district court erred in concluding that these claims are preempted by b of the investment company act of,as amended ica.because we conclude that the claims are not preempted,we will reverse their dismissal and remand this case to the district court.
the plaintiffs are shareholders in seven investment companies,the named defendants in this action munienhanced fund,munivest fund ii,muniyield fund,muniyield insured fund,muniyield insured fund ii,muniyield quality fund,and muniyield quality fund ii,the funds.the plaintiffs invested more than in the funds between may and october.the named plaintiff,jack green,has brought suit individually and in his capacity as a trustee of seven trusts that invested in the funds.the other plaintiffs,lawrence belden and stanley simon,sue solely as trustees of trusts that invested in the funds.although not named in the caption,the complaint also identifies as plaintiffs seven trusts that allegedly purchased shares of the funds.the plaintiffs have brought the case as a putative class action,seeking to represent more than investors in the funds.
the funds are investment companies,which are registered with the securities and exchange commission sec and publicly traded on the new york stock exchange.all of the funds are incorporated under the laws of maryland and have their principal places of business in plainsboro,new jersey.by investing in municipal bonds,the funds aim is to provide shareholders with income that is exempt from federal income taxes and to increase return to shareholders through the use of leverage.the funds gain leverage by issuing shares of preferred stock that pay dividends based upon prevailing interest rates and investing the proceeds from the sale of this preferred stock in obligations that,under normal market conditions,pay higher rates.as long as there is a spread between the rates paid by the funds to holders of the preferred stock and the rates received by the funds from investments,the fund managers are able to provide the shareholders with higher yields.
defendant fund asset management,fam serves as the funds investment adviser and is responsible for managing the funds investment portfolios and providing administrative services to the funds.pursuant to written investment advisory agreements,the funds pay fam a fee for its services based upon a percentage of the funds weekly net assets.the munienhanced fund,prospectus describes its advisory fee as follows 
for the services provided by the investment adviser fam under the investment advisory agreement,the fund will pay a monthly fee at an annual rate of of of the fund average weekly net assets,the average weekly value of the total assets of the fund,minus the sum of accrued liabilities of the fund and accumulated dividends on the shares of preferred stock.for purposes of this calculation,average weekly net assets is determined at the end of each month on the basis of the average net assets of the fund for each week during the month.

the plaintiffs brought this action seeking to remedy alleged violations of state law and of b of the investment company act of the ica,codified at b in their complaint,plaintiffs allege that defendants breached their disclosure obligations and fiduciary duties under the ica and under state law.the plaintiffs contend that the defendants failed to explicitly or sufficiently disclose that the calculation of fam management fee would include assets purchased with the proceeds from the sale of preferred stock.they claim that because the advisory fee is measured as a percentage of the funds capitalization,including leverage,there is a strong financial incentive for fam to keep the funds fully leveraged at all times,even when it would be in the best interest of shareholders to reduce or eliminate leverage.the plaintiffs contend that fam would lose approximately of its advisory compensation if it eliminated leverage.they argue that the fee arrangement creates an inherent conflict of interest,which was not disclosed in the funds prospectuses,the funds filings with the sec,or the funds periodic reports to the shareholders.the plaintiffs also allege that the defendants failed to disclose that the issuing of the preferred stock was subject to a conflict of interest they find this conflict in the fact that fam affiliate,mlpfs,received fees from the sale of the preferred stock.in addition,plaintiffs claim that the defendants have continually misled investors with respect to the advisory fees,which are ultimately paid by the funds shareholders.
the plaintiffs seek both compensatory damages and injunctive relief.they ask for an order permanently enjoining the defendants from entering into any compensation arrangement between the funds and any investment adviser under which the compensation payable to such investment advisor is determined by,dependent upon,or measured or influenced by,the amount of financial leverage of its common equity investment maintained by such fund.green i,d at internal quotation marks omitted.
the defendants filed a motion,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c,to dismiss the plaintiffs state law claims for breach of fiduciary duty and deceit.the defendants contend that the plaintiffs state law claims are preempted by b of the ica,which creates a federal,private right of action for breach of fiduciary duty by an investment adviser or mutual fund management company with respect to payment and compensation for services.the district court granted the defendants motion and dismissed the plaintiffs state law claims.the district court did acknowledge,however,that the question presented,whether b of the ica preempts the plaintiffs state law claims for breach of fiduciary duty and deceit,was a close one and a question of first impression in the courts of appeals.for that reason,the district court permitted the plaintiffs to file an interlocutory appeal pursuant to b.green fund asset management,d,green ii.

iii.discussion 
the question we must answer on this appeal is as follows does state law in this case,common law establishing liability for breach of fiduciary duty and deceit stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives which congress had in mind in enacting b of the ica 
defendants argue that b of the ica,codified at b,preempts the plaintiffs state law claims for breach of fiduciary duty and deceit.section b is a lengthy and detailed statutory provision.it provides that an investment adviser of a registered investment company has a fiduciary duty with respect to compensation for services.an action may be brought in district court by a security holder of the registered investment company against the investment adviser for breach of that fiduciary duty regarding compensation.in such an action,it is not necessary to allege or prove personal misconduct on the part of any defendant 
in order to determine whether b preempts the plaintiffs state law claims for breach of fiduciary duty and deceit,we must first determine what preemption theory is applicable.federal law preempts,and thereby displaces,state law in three different situations express preemption,field preemption which is also sometimes referred to as implied preemption,or conflict preemption.see,orson,miramax film,cir en banc.
preemption is express when there is an explicit statutory command that state law be displaced.see morales trans world airlines,d.an example of express preemption can be found in the employee retirement income security act of erisa which states that the provisions of that act shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.a.see orson,at.preemption is implied,and state law may be displaced,if federal law so thoroughly occupies a legislative field as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it.cipollone liggett group,d internal quotation marks omitted.finally,as we stated in orson,state law may be displaced under conflict preemption principles if the state law in question presents a conflict with federal law in one of two situations when it is impossible to comply with both the state and the federal law,or when the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.orson,at quoting jones rath packing,d.
in this case,the defendants do not contend that b expressly preempts the plaintiffs state law claims for breach of fiduciary duty and deceit nor do they assert that b of the ica,or even the entire ica itself,impliedly preempts these claims the preemption theory that the defendants claim is applicable is conflict preemption.in doing so,the defendants do not argue that it is impossible to comply with both the state and federal law.instead,they assert the other prong of conflict preemption that state law in this case stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.the district court was persuaded by the defendants arguments and dismissed the claims,concluding that they were preempted by b under the theory of conflict preemption.we conclude,however,that,when plaintiffs state law claims are properly analyzed under the supreme court conflict preemption jurisprudence,they are not preempted by b.
in arguing for conflict preemption,the defendants have attempted to analogize this case to earlier cases.however,as the district court recognized,none of the cases they cite are controlling the cited cases dealt with the proposition that,with respect to other sections of the ica,b is the exclusive remedy for grievances concerning mutual fund service fees.green ii,d at citing numerous cases.the district court also correctly noted that,while defendants cite the unpublished decision in batra investors research,wl.may,and a subsequent unpublished decision in a related case,batra investors research,wl,batra ii,as authority for their preemption argument,these decisions concern the exercise of pendent jurisdiction,and n either decision expressly holds that section b preempts state common law remedies.id.at citing several cases.
the plaintiffs and the defendants have also attempted to analogize this case to several supreme court preemption cases,all of which address the issue of express preemption,not conflict preemption,and thus are inapposite.see,freightliner myrick,d pilot life ins.dedeaux,d jones rath packing,d.
we conclude that prior case law is not on point.we are left,therefore,to determine,guided by the supreme court conflict preemption jurisprudence,whether state law,specifically common law establishing liability for breach of fiduciary duty and deceit,stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress as set forth in b of the ica.
the supreme court has held on multiple occasions that,when analyzing preemption issues,because the states are independent sovereigns in our federal system,we have long presumed that congress does not cavalierly causes of action.medtronic,lohr,d.we start with an assumption that the historic police powers of the states will not be preempted unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.id.moreover,in making our analysis,the purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in every case.id.internal quotation marks omitted.see,chicago northwestern transp.kalo brick tile,d new york state dep t of soc.servs.dublino,d florida lime avocado growers,paul,d.
thus,in deciding whether state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress,as set forth in b,we must focus on and attempt to discern the intent of congress in enacting b.further more,because b represents congressional legislation in a field which the states have traditionally tort actions for breach of fiduciary duty and must,as the court stated in medtronic,start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states,in this case the power of states to hold investment company management liable for improper compensation arrangements,were not to be superseded unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.medtronic,at.
in arguing that state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purpose and objectives of congress,and thus that the plaintiffs state law claims conflict with and are preempted by b,the defendants rely heavily upon and quote extensively from the legislative history of b of the ica.because congressional intent is the ultimate touchstone in every case,we will examine that legislative history to discern the intent of congress in enacting b.
in its own review of the legislative history,the district court found that congress enacted the ica because it had concluded that the nationwide activities of investment companies called for federal regulation and,more relevant to the issue at hand,enacted section b because the existing remedies for improper compensation arrangements had been ineffective.green ii,d at.we agree with this conclusion.a careful survey of the relevant legislative history clearly and unequivocally indicates that congress enacted b because it deter mined that existing remedies for improper compensation arrangements were inadequate to protect mutual fund investors.
the district court quoted the senate report,accompanying the final version of the amendments,which states that the unique structure of mutual funds has made it difficult for the courts to apply traditional fiduciary standards in considering questions concerning management fees,reprinted in,senate report.id.at.the court then added that the senate report noted that the provisions contained in the ica as originally passed in concerning the regulation of management fees and other charges to the investor did not provide any mechanism by which the fairness of management contracts could be tested in court,quoting senate report at.the senate report went on to conclude that under general rules of law,advisory contracts that had been ratified by the shareholders or approved by disinterested directors could not be upset except upon a showing of corporate waste 
as one court put it,the fee must shock the conscience of the court.such a rule may not be an improper one when the protections of arm length bar gaining are present.but in the mutual fund industry where,these marketplace forces are not likely to operate as effectively,your committee has decided that the standard of corporate waste is unduly restrictive and recommends that it be changed.id.
the district court then cited the conclusion in the senate report that the express statutory requirement of reasonableness be eliminated and a specific fiduciary duty be imposed on mutual fund investment advisers with respect to management fee compensation.green ii,d at citing senate report at.the fiduciary duty standard would make it easier for a shareholder to prevail in an action against an investment adviser who had entered into an improper or unfair compensation arrangement 
the defendants acknowledge that congress enacted b and implemented the breach of fiduciary duty standard because it concluded that the corporate waste standard previously applied in most states was largely ineffective in preventing improper compensation arrangements.however,neither the district court nor the defendants point to any language,either in the legislative history of b or in the statute itself,that suggests that congress intended to preempt state law claims for breach of fiduciary duty or deceit when it enacted b.
because congress had found that the corporate waste standard was inadequate to meet the problem,it sought to provide mutual fund shareholders with additional protection from improper compensation arrangements.nevertheless,the fact that the prior remedy might be less effective does not mean that it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purpose and objective of congress.even though the common law is less effective than b,it may still be the remedy of choice in certain situations.the creation of a greater protection does not mean that the lesser protection is an obstacle if a complainant elects to employ it.moreover,the lesser protection,even if it is more difficult for a complainant to prove a breach of the standard of care,may offer a greater range of targets and of remedies.defendants have not demonstrated that congress intended to eliminate common law access to these targets or these remedies.
our conclusion that b does not preempt the plaintiffs state law claims is reinforced by cases,involving other aspects of corporate governance,which hold that the presence of a federal remedy to relieve a problem does not preclude the recourse to a common law remedy which is directed at the same problem.an example is cts dynamics,d,a securities law case discussing the potential preemptive effect of the williams act.in holding that the williams act did not preempt an indiana state law regulating corporate takeovers,the court stated 
the indiana act operates on the assumption,implicit in the williams act,that independent shareholders faced with tender offers often are at a disadvantage.by allowing such shareholders to vote as a group,the act protects them from the coercive aspects of some tender offers in such a situation under the indiana act,the shareholders as a group,acting in the corporation best interest,could reject the offer,although individual shareholders might be inclined to accept it.the desire of the indiana legislature to protect shareholders of indiana corporations from this type of coercive offer does not conflict with the williams act.rather,it furthers the federal policy of investor protection.
cts,at.emphasis added.
this conclusion can be stated in another way the creation of a federal remedy,in the field of securities law,does not necessarily eradicate existing state law remedies or require that the federal remedy be exclusive.see,medtronic,lohr,d holding that k of the medical device amendments of does not preempt overlapping state tort law.
the defendants contend,nevertheless,that the strict limitations of b demonstrate that the plaintiffs state law claims should be preempted.the defendants point out that,unlike the plaintiffs state law claims 
section b expressly limits the parties against whom relief can be sought,see b 
section b limits the type and amount of relief a shareholder may recover,see 
section b precludes shareholders from suing for advisory fees paid more than one year prior to the filing of the complaint,see 
section b imposes upon the plaintiff the burden of proving that the investment adviser breached his or her fiduciary duty,see b 
section b requires plaintiffs to bring suit in federal district court,see b 
section b creates no cause of action for the investment fund the securities and exchange commission and shareholders of the investment fund may bring suit against an investment adviser for breach of fiduciary duty and 
at least one court of appeals has concluded that b creates an equitable cause of action and thus plaintiffs suing under b are not entitled to a jury trial,see krinsk fund asset management,cir 
focusing on these procedural differences between a common law cause of action and one under b,the defendants reason that the differences reflect congress intent to preempt state law claims and,as a consequence,demonstrate that state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purpose and objectives of congress.if,however,procedural differences were sufficient both to indicate congressional intent to preempt overlapping state law and to demonstrate that state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purpose and objectives of congress,federal law would preempt overlapping state law every time federal law did not exactly mirror all the state law or state laws in question.this argument finds no support in relevant federal case law and is actually contrary to the supreme court preemption jurisprudence.see,medtronic,lohr,d florida lime avocado growers,paul,d.in short,establishing that federal law overlaps state law is,by itself,insufficient to establish that federal law preempts state law.
indeed,if we were to accept the defendants argument that procedural differences both indicate congressional intent to preempt the plaintiffs state law claims and demonstrate that state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purpose and objectives of congress,then the act and the act would also,by definition,preempt much state law in the areas of corporate and securities law since many of the procedural and substantive requirements of the act and the act differ markedly from the corresponding procedural and substantive requirements of corporate and securities law in most states.however,as noted above,it is that the act and the act do not preempt overlapping state law except where the overlapping state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purpose and objectives of congress or where it is impossible to comply with both state and the federal law.the act and the act are just two of many possible examples of federal laws that do not generally preempt overlapping state law.as the supreme court noted in medtronic in regard to the potential preemptive effect of k of the medical device amendments of 
nothing in k denies florida the right to provide a traditional damages remedy for violations of duties when those duties parallel federal requirements.even if it may be necessary as a matter of florida law to prove that those violations were the result of negligent conduct,or that they created an unreasonable hazard for users of the product,such additional elements of the cause of action would make the state requirements narrower,not broader,than the federal requirement.while such a narrower requirement might be different from the federal rules in a literal sense,such a difference would surely provide a strange reason for finding of a state rule insofar as it duplicates the federal rule.the presence of a damages remedy does not amount to the additional or different requirement that is necessary under the statute rather,it merely provides another reason for manufacturers to comply with identical existing requirements under federal law.
medtronic,at.emphasis added.
in this case,as in medtronic,we are presented with overlapping state and federal laws that impose different procedural requirements upon plaintiffs seeking to bring suit.however,here,as in medtronic,state law furthers the accomplishment and execution of the full purpose and objectives of congress.neither the language of b nor the accompanying legislative history indicates,or even suggests,that the plaintiffs state law claims stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purpose and objectives of congress.this fact is fatal to the defendants preemption arguments,especially in light of the presumption against preemption in situations where congress has legislated in a field which the states have traditionally occupied.see,medtronic,at.
while the defendants argue that the procedural differences in question both indicate congressional intent to preempt the plaintiffs state law claims and demonstrate that state law in this case stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purpose and objectives of congress,we find it more likely that these differences demonstrate a congressional attempt to limit the relief available to plaintiffs under b.in enacting b in,congress not only created a federal,private right of action previously unavailable under federal law,congress also radically altered the legal standard under which the fairness and corresponding legality of mutual fund compensation arrangements had been evaluated.consistent with congress intent in enacting b,the legal standard under which mutual fund compensation arrangements are evaluated under b is markedly more than the corporate waste standard applied by most state courts prior to.in order to temper the radical change in the legal standard under which the fairness and corresponding legality of mutual fund compensation agreements would be evaluated under b,congress instituted various procedural limitations.these procedural limitations are the same procedural differences highlighted by the defendants as evidence that state law in this case stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purpose and objectives of congress.
although the defendants argue to the contrary,we conclude that these procedural differences and limitations do not indicate that state law in this case stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purpose and objectives of congress,but rather show that congress realized that b sweeping change in the legal standard,under which the fairness of mutual fund compensation agreements would be evaluated,necessitated corresponding limitations in the relief available.
in addition,we note that the defendants reliance on recent the supreme court preemption decisions in united states locke,d,geier american honda motor,d,norfolk southern ry.shanklin,d,and crosby national foreign trade council,d is misplaced.the supreme court holding in locke that title ii of the ports and waterways safety act pwsa preempts conflicting state law was based primarily on the doctrine of stare decisis.many of the issues raised in locke were raised,analyzed and addressed by the supreme court in ray atlantic richfield,d.to the extent that the subsequent enactment of the oil pollution act opa modified or amended the ports and waterways safety act,the relevant statutory history explicitly states that the opa does not disturb the supreme court decision in ray atlantic richfield,d.locke.at quoting con.no,at.more importantly,locke is distinguishable from the case now before us because congress,in enacting the opa and pwsa,did not legislate in a field which the states have traditionally occupied.thus,the presumption against preemption present in this case did not exist in locke.locke.at.
in geier,the supreme court held that the petitioners state tort claim,based on a lack of an automobile airbag,conflicted with the objectives of federal motor vehicle safety standard and therefore was preempted by the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of.see geier.at.however,geier,like locke,is distinguishable from the case before us because the court in geier relied upon federal statutory language and the corresponding legislative history,concluding that state law stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purpose and objectives of congress.
similarly,the supreme court recent opinions in norfolk southern ry.shanklin,d and crosby national foreign trade council,d are distinguishable.the court in norfolk held that the federal railroad safety act of,in conjunction with various regulations promulgated under the act,preempted state law tort claims stemming from a railroad failure to maintain adequate warning devices at crossings where federal funds were used to install such warning devices.see norfolk.at.however,the supreme court holding in norfolk,like its holding in locke,was based primarily on the doctrine of stare decisis.see norfolk.at csx,easterwood,d.moreover,norfolk addressed the issue of express preemption,not conflict preemption and thus is inapposite to the case now before us.
the court in crosby also held that a massachusetts law barring state entities from buying goods and services from companies doing business in burma was preempted by a subsequent federal law imposing mandatory and conditional economic sanctions on burma.in contrast to norfolk,crosby clearly presented a question of conflict preemption.however,like locke and geier,crosby is distinguishable because the court in crosby relied upon the language of three clear and unambiguous federal statutory provisions in concluding that state law stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purpose and objectives of congress.in addition,in enacting the federal statutory provisions at issue in crosby,congress sought to affect national foreign policy not a field which the states have traditionally occupied.thus,the presumption against preemption present in this case did not exist in crosby.
finally,we note that the party claiming preemption bears the burden of demonstrating that federal law preempts state law.see,silkwood,d buzzard roadrunner trucking,cir.here,the defendants bear the burden of demonstrating that b of the ica preempts the plaintiffs state law claims for breach of fiduciary duty and deceit.in order to prevail under a theory of conflict preemption,the defendants must demonstrate that the state law at issue in this case stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purpose and objective of congress as set forth in b.because we conclude that the defendants have failed to make this showing,we hold that the plaintiffs state law claims are not preempted by b.
iv.conclusion 
in arguing that the plaintiffs state law claims for breach of fiduciary duty and deceit are preempted by b of the ica,the defendants fail to point to any language,either in b itself or in the accompanying legislative history that demonstrates that congress intended b to preempt,and thereby displace,the plaintiffs state law claims.the defendants also fail to demonstrate how state law in this case stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purpose and objectives of congress.we hold,therefore,that the plaintiffs state law claims are not preempted by b.we will reverse the district court grant of judg
