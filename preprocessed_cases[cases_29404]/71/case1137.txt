in this case we address several securities fraud issues,centering on whether a plaintiff must have traded at about the same time as the insider it alleges violated securities laws.jules brody and joyce crawford brought suit against transitional hospital corporation thc or the company and its officers claiming violations of the securities and exchange act of exchange act and state law because the defendants both traded in reliance on inside information and released misleading public information.the district court granted the defendant motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.brody and crawford now appeal the district court order on several grounds.
background 
in determining whether the complaint states a claim upon which relief could be granted,we assume the facts alleged in the complaint to be true.ronconi larkin,cir.the facts alleged in the complaint are as follows 
thc was a nevada corporation that delivered acute care services through hospitals and satellite facilities across the united states.in august,the company announced its plan to buy back from time to time on the open market up to million in company stock.two months later,thc expanded the repurchase plan to million.
on february,vencor,submitted to thc board of directors a written offer to acquire the company for per share.thc did not disclose this offer publicly.between february and february,thc purchased shares of its own stock at an average price of per share.this million was in addition to another million that thc had spent purchasing its stock in the three month period that ended on february.the plaintiffs do not allege that the total repurchase exceeded million.
thc issued a press release on march,detailing the progress and extent of its stock repurchase program.the press release did not mention vencor or any other party interest in acquiring thc.the plaintiffs argue that because of this omission,the march press release was misleading.
on april,vencor increased its offer to purchase thc to per share.in the next few weeks,thc also received offers from two other competing bidders.on april,after receiving all three offers,thc issued another press release,stating that the company had received expressions of interest from certain parties who have indicated an interest in acquiring it.the same document also stated that thc had hired financial advisers to advise the company in connection with a possible sale.the plaintiffs argue that this press release was also misleading,because it did not state that substantial due diligence had already taken place,that thc had received competing offers exceeding per share,or that a thc board meeting would take place two days later to consider these offers.
at the board meeting,the thc board voted to negotiate a merger agreement with select medical corporation select.on may,thc publicly announced that it and select had entered into a definitive merger agreement and that select would purchase thc at per share.vencor thereupon threatened a hostile takeover.to fend off that maneuver,thc ultimately agreed,on june,to a takeover by vencor rather than select,at per share.
brody and crawford sold shares at times that sandwich the april press release.two days before that press release was issued,crawford sold shares at per share.brody sold shares of thc stock at per share on april,just after the press release was made public.the plaintiffs argue that had they not been misled by thc,they would have held onto their shares,and benefitted from their subsequent increase in value.
brody and crawford filed a class action complaint against thc and its officers on august.in addition to alleging violations of nevada state law,brody and crawford alleged violations of sections b,e,and a of the exchange act,b,e,and a,and rules and,and,promulgated thereunder by the securities exchange commission sec.these claims focus on two aspects of thc course of action brody and crawford accuse the company of illegal insider trading because thc repurchased shares of its stock between february and february without first disclosing that vencor and other parties had expressed interest in thc.in addition,brody and crawford claim that thc,in its march and april press releases,materially misled them about thc progress toward its eventual merger.
the district court dismissed all of brody and crawford claims.in so doing,the district court held that brody and crawford are not proper parties to assert any insider trading claims,as brody and crawford did not trade contemporaneously with thc.in addition,the district court decided that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim under rule or any other law based on materially misleading information,as the press releases were not misleading under the applicable standards.
the plaintiffs appeal these aspects of the district court dismissal.we review de novo the district court dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to federal rule of procedure rule b.zimmerman city of oakland,cir.
discussion 
insider trading 
as they pertain to insider trading,section b,rule,section e and rule make it illegal in some circumstances for those possessing inside information about a company to trade in that company securities unless they first disclose the information.see,united states smith,cir.this type of prohibition is known as an abstain or disclose rule,because it requires insiders either to abstain from trading or to disclose the inside information that they possess.
the district court dismissed the insider trading claims,holding that the named plaintiffs could not assert them because they did not trade contemporaneously with thc.on appeal,brody and crawford argue that nothing in the applicable securities laws requires investors to have traded contemporaneously with insiders in order to maintain a suit for insider trading.in addition,they argue that even if such a requirement exists,they in fact did trade contemporaneously with thc.
section b and rule 
neither section b nor rule contain an express right of action for private parties.the supreme court has held,however,that proper plaintiffs may sue for damages for violation of the statute and rule.see superintendent of ins.bankers life and cas,d.because neither the statute nor the rule contains an express right of action,they also do not delineate who is a proper plaintiff.in the absence of explicit congressional guidance,courts have developed various standing limitations,primarily on policy bases 
for example,in blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d,the supreme court held that to bring an insider trading claim under rule,a plaintiff must have traded in the same stock or other securities as the insider trader.the contemporaneous trading requirement,at issue in this case,is another standing requirement,specifying that to bring an insider trading claim,the plaintiff must have traded in a company stock at about the same time as the alleged insider.
in neubronner milken,cir,the ninth circuit adopted a contemporaneous trading requirement for section b and rule actions.see also in re worlds of wonder sec,cir.neubronner explained that two reasons animate this rule first,noncontemporaneous traders do not require the protection of the disclose or abstain rule because they do not suffer the disadvantage of trading with someone who has superior access to information.at quoting wilson comtech telecommunications,cir.second,the contemporaneous trading requirement puts reasonable limits on section b and rule reach without such a limitation,an insider defendant could be liable to a very large number of parties.id.at.
brody and crawford offer two reasons why the contemporaneous trading rule adopted in neubronner should not here apply.first,they argue that the rule does not make sense,as a matter of statutory interpretation.in other words,they request that we declare that neubronner interpretation of section b and rule was incorrect.although the decision in neubronner is not beyond debate,we do not consider the question further,as a ninth circuit panel may not overrule a prior ninth circuit decision.hart massanari,cir.
brody and crawford attempt to avoid this precedential barrier by claiming that neubronner implementation of the contemporaneous rule was dictum,and therefore not binding on us.it was not.neubronner explicitly described its ruling regarding the contemporaneous trading requirement as a holding.at.in addition,the determination was a necessary predicate for the case ultimate conclusion that contemporaneous trading must be pleaded with particularity.id.at.
brody and crawford second submission in avoidance of neubronner is that united states,d,overruled neubronner.that assertion is simply wrong,which was a criminal case,addressed neither the contemporaneous trading requirement in private actions nor any other standing rule.instead,by approving of an expansive concept of who qualifies as an insider under section b,the supreme court in clarified that more defendants may be liable under section b than some courts have previously thought.id.at.in so doing,the supreme court did not alter notions concerning whom insiders harm when they trade based on privileged information.
brody and crawford next argue that even if the section b and rule contemporaneous trading requirements remain,the court should define contemporaneous trades as trades that take place within six months of one another.under this definition,brody and crawford would have standing,as they sold their stock just under two months after they allege thc bought the large block of stock in february.
in neubronner,this court did not decide the length of the contemporaneous trading period for insider trading violations under section b and rule,at,nor has this court decided the question since.because the time period presented by the facts of this case exceeds any possible delineation of a contemporaneous trading period,it is not necessary in this case either to define the exact contours of the period.we simply note that a contemporaneous trading period of two months would gut the contemporaneous trading rule there is a need to filter out plaintiffs who could not possibly have traded with the insider,given the manner in which public trades are transacted.
section e and rule 
brody and crawford also argue that the district court erred in dismissing their claims under section e and rule by holding that insider trading actions brought under section e and rule must also conform to a contemporaneous trading requirement.in making this argument,the plaintiffs urge that we hold for them on two matters of first impression whether a private right of action exists under rule and if a private right of action does exist,whether it contains a contemporaneous standing requirement.we can assume,without deciding,that a private right of action exists under rule,for we see no reason why the same contemporaneous trading rule that applies under rule would not apply in such an action.
as noted,this court has definitively adopted a contemporaneous trading requirement under rule.although rule differs in some respects from rule,and was adopted in order to plug some holes the sec perceived in rule its core,like the core of rule,is an abstain or disclose requirement.and,as is true of the abstain or disclose requirement of rule,the similar requirement of rule is designed to prevent the disadvantage that inheres in trading with an insider with superior access to information.fed.reg.so we would have to have some excellent reason to adopt a different standing rule under rule from the one we use under rule.we are convinced that there is no basis for drawing such a distinction.
the best candidate appellants have advanced as a basis for differentiating the standing requirement under the two rules is plaine mccabe,cir.plaine held that a plaintiff suing under section e need not have traded at all,let alone contemporaneously.id.at.
the fulcrum of plaine was a distinction suggested by piper,d,between the types of shareholder protections contained in sections b and e piper noted that while section b was enacted to protect only individuals who actually traded in stocks,section e can be understood as protecting not only those who buy or sell stocks but also shareholders who decide not to trade.at.because rule was promulgated under section e,the argument that a plaintiff who alleges insider trading under section e or rule need not worry about the contemporaneous trading he need not have traded at some initial plausibility.
on a closer examination,however,plaine does not speak to the issue at hand.rather,plaine focused only on trading claims brought under section e,and did not consider the standing requirements for an insider trading claim brought under rule.
section e broadly prohibits fraudulent,deceptive,or manipulative acts or practices,in connection with any tender offer it does not contain any specific reference to insider trading.rule,on the other hand,focuses on one type of behavior,insider trading,whose prohibition is thought to prevent fraudulent,deceptive,or manipulative acts see,at.in accordance with its specific,prophylactic focus,rule applies to a different set of behaviors than does section e section e centers on the actual tender offer,whereas rule regulates illegal insider trading that takes place while a tender offer is under consideration.as appellants brief states,a ll the elements of a section e rule insider trading violation are supplied by the language of rule.
a comparison of the facts in plaine with the facts in this case illustrates the difference between the section e claim considered in plaine and the rule claim considered here.plaine held shares in a company subject to a tender offer.she complained that false information in proxy materials had induced other shareholders to tender their shares.because so many other shareholders tendered their shares,the merger went through at a price plaine viewed as inadequate.although plaine did not tender her shares,the court ruled that she alleged injury occurring as a result of fraudulent activity in connection with a tender offer and had standing to assert her claim.at.plaine did not,however,allege insider trading,and therefore could not have made out a claim under rule.
brody and crawford,on the other hand,did allege insider trading but did not allege that thc manipulated the tender offer process through the use of false information or by any other means.as such,the facts in the current case present a very different situation than that presented in plaine.the circumstances do,however,bear a much closer resemblance to those in neubronner,a rule case centering around accusations of insider trading in violation of an requirement.see neubronner,at.
despite the similarities of the issues here and in neubronner and between rules and,as applied to insider trading allegations,brody and crawford emphasize the differences between the rules.unlike rule,rule does not require proof that a person traded on information obtained in violation of a duty owed to the source of the inside information.instead,rule a creates a duty for a person with inside information to abstain or disclose without regard to whether the trader owes a fiduciary duty to respect the confidentiality of the information,at.quoting united states chestman,cir en banc.although rule thus expands the notion of who is an insider,it does not follow that the rule also expands the class of shareholders who may complain when an insider trades without disclosing insider information.as a result,the fact that rule and rule are not identical does not lead to the conclusion that one has a contemporaneous trading requirement and the other does not.
more importantly,perhaps,in this case,the allegation is that thc traded in its own stock on the basis of inside information.such allegations would state a traditional or classical theory of insider trading liability under rule based on a relationship of trust and confidence between the shareholders of a corporation and those insiders who have obtained information by reason of their position with that corporation,at.quoting chiarella,at.as such,this case is one that could indeed,under both rule and rule,and as to which any differences between the two rules regarding the necessary relationship between the insider and the source of information is not relevant.
brody and crawford note an
