lead plaintiff dekalb county pension fund dekalb appeals from the district court order dismissing its second amended complaint for failure to meet the heightened requirements of rule b and the private securities litigation reform act pslra.we affirm the district court order dismissing the second amended complaint and hold that dekalb waived its right to further amendment of its complaint by taking the instant appeal.
on april,dekalb brought a claim in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia for securities fraud as a putative class action against ndchealth corporation ndc,several of its officers individual defendants,and the accounting firm ernst and young llp.dekalb set forth two causes of action in its second amended complaint securities fraud pursuant to section b,b and rule,cfr and violation of section a of the exchange act.
the gravamen of the second amended complaint is that during the class period of august,through august,ndc engaged in a variety of undisclosed accounting manipulations and business practices which caused the company financial results to be materially overstated.dekalb alleges that ndc engaged in channel stuffing prematurely recognized sales revenue did not follow generally accepted accounting principles and materially misstated the value of a failed investment in a company known as medunite.is being sued because it served as ndc independent auditor and issued audit opinions on the company and financial statements.
ndc and filed motions to dismiss dekalb second amended complaint on october.after the opposition and reply papers were filed,on january,ndc filed a form and a form document with the sec disclosing that it would restate its accounts for the prior period beginning with its fiscal year ended may,through the first quarter of fiscal year ended august.the district court took judicial notice of these documents the second amended complaint contains no allegation regarding the restatement of accounts.
the district court dismissed appellant second amended complaint on july,with leave to amend.the order states plaintiff shall file its third amended complaint within thirty days of entry of this order,and defendants shall file their motions to dismiss within thirty days of the filing of the third amendment.in re ndc health,slip op.at.july.instead of filing a third amended complaint,dekalb filed a notice of appeal on august,the last day of the period allotted for filing an amended complaint.
on september,this court inquired nostra sponte whether the district court order of july,constitutes a final appealable order.in response,the parties agreed that g enerally,an order dismissing a complaint is not final and appealable unless the order holds that it dismisses the entire action or that the complaint can not be saved by amendment.van poyck singletary,cir citing czeremcha int l ass of machinists and aerospace workers,cir.
w here an order dismisses a complaint with leave to amend within a specified period,the order becomes final and therefore appealable when the time period allowed for amendment expires.briehler miami,cir.however,the plaintiff need not wait until the expiration of the stated time in order to treat the dismissal as final,but may appeal prior to the expiration of the stated time period.schuurman motor vessel betty k v,cir.accordingly,this court has jurisdiction over this timely filed appeal pursuant to.by filing an appeal in this manner,however,dekalb elected to stand on its second amended complaint and waived its right to further amendment.schuurman,at once the plaintiff chooses to appeal before the expiration of time allowed for amendment,however,the plaintiff waives the right to later amend the complaint,even if the time to amend has not yet expired.
dekalb argues the district court erred in dismissing its second amended complaint because,in determining that dekalb did not plead facts sufficient to give rise to a strong inference of scienter,t he district court failed to consider all of the facts pled and also failed to view the allegations in a light most favorable to appellant.appellant br.dekalb also argues that the district court erred in determining that appellant failed to plead the reasons for the falsity of the alleged misstatements and omissions with requisite specificity.finally,dekalb assigns error to the district court for improperly impos ing conditions on appellant right to amend its complaint.
at the motion to dismiss stage,all facts are accepted as true,and the reasonable inferences therefrom are construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.bryant avado brands,cir.the court reviews de novo the dismissal of a complaint pursuant to rule b.oxford asset mgmt.jaharis,cir.

section a of the exchange act provides for liability of controlling persons who aid and abet any person liable under any provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder.dekalb claims under section a are alleged against the individual defendants,and predicated upon the same alleged unlawful conduct relevant to its claims under section.compl.accordingly,the success of dekalb section a claim turns on the resolution of its claims under section and rule.
channel stuffing is not fraudulent per se.greebel ftp software,cir there is nothing inherently improper in pressing for sales to be made earlier than in the normal course.in greebel,the first circuit commented that in the context of alleged improper revenue recognition,channel stuffing evidence has some probative value.but that value is weak.id.at but see in re cabletron,cir allegations of improper revenue recognition,including fictitious sales,and channel stuffing,were supported by averments of testimonial evidence from insiders and pled with adequate specificity to survive a motion to dismiss.the seventh circuit determined in makor issues rights,et tellabs,cir that w hile there may be legitimate reasons for attempting to achieve sales earlier via channel stuffing,providing excess supply to distributors in order to create a misleading impression in the market of the company financial health is not one of them.id.at.we agree with the seventh circuit that channel stuffing may amount to fraudulent conduct when it is done to mislead investors,but the allegations of channel stuffing in the instant case were not pled with sufficient detail to overcome the pslra scienter hurdle.
rule b provides that i n all averments of fraud or mistake,the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.rule b.rule b is satisfied if the complaint sets forth precisely what statements were made in what documents or oral representations or what omissions were made,and the time and place of each such statement and the person responsible for making or,in the case of omissions,not making same,and the content of such statements and the manner in which they misled the plaintiff,and what the defendants obtained as a consequence of the fraud.ziemba cascade int l,cir quoting brooks blue cross and blue shield of florida,cir.a sufficient level of factual support for a claim may be found where the circumstances of the fraud are pled in detail.this means the who,what,when where,and how the first paragraph of any newspaper story.gross medaphis,quoting dileo ernst young,cir.
for claims brought under the exchange act,including appellants claims under section and section,the complaint must specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.b 
dekalb argues that it set forth a claim satisfying the requirements of rule b and the pslra when it alleged that ndc understated expenses in violation of gaap in three ways it began to capitalize costs well before its development projects reached technological feasibility it amortized costs over periods much greater than the economic life of its software assets and it applied an excessive burden factor to its capitalized costs,thereby expensing less than necessary in the present term.in discounting this argument,the district court stated plaintiff allegations are thin,and are based almost entirely on statements by an undisclosed former executive in the physician services group.in re ndc health,slip op.at.
the district court did not err because dekalb allegations regarding amortization and capitalization are vague and difficult to evaluate.for example,the second amended complaint does not specify when the improper accounting occurred.it also fails to allege how and what products were improperly capitalized or amortized.
dekalb also argues that the district court erred in holding that dekalb allegations regarding material misstatement in ndc financial statements were overly speculative and amount to nothing more than corporate mismanagement.the district court determined that the financial reporting was itself accurate and the reports accurately reflected the performance of the company.at the time the district court issued its opinion,ndc had already declared its intention to restate its accounts.on january,ndc filed a disclosure with the sec stating that it identified certain practices regarding the exchange of physician software inventory held by the company resellers that were inconsistent with company policies.accordingly,ndc announced that after discussion with the company independent accountants,on january,the audit committee of the board of directors determined it is appropriate to restate results beginning with its fiscal year ended may,through the first quarter of fiscal year ended august.ndc also noted that t he restatement will also include other identified adjustments from prior periods.it follows that ndcs prior financial reporting may not have been accurate and may not have reflected the performance of the company.
dekalb elected to stand on its second amended complaint.ndc intention to restate its accounts is not alleged in the second amended complaint.because dekalb waived its right to file a third amended complaint,we limited our review to the facts set forth in the second amended complaint instead of speculating whether dekalb could have filed a third amended complaint that would have met the pleading requirements of the pslra and rule b.
turning to the allegations set forth in the second amended complaint,dekalb maintains that it alleged improper revenue recognition with adequate specificity by stating that in march of,a management level employee in the physician services unit notified of a dire situation facing that business accounts receivable were very high as a result of aggressive practices,which rendered the unit reported revenues highly suspect.compl.according to dekalb,ndc determined that approximately million of inventory was in the channel as of march.id.at.the second amended complaint goes on to state that,after management learned of this information,ndc decided to delay its earning release pending a review of its revenue recognition practices in the physician services unit.id.in sum,dekalb alleged that ndc issued erroneous financial statements that contained substantial misstatements due to the improper recognition of revenue and channel stuffing in the physician services unit.
dekalb also alleged that defendants sought to conceal their improper revenue recognition by increasing reserves and taking large,charges for uncollected receivables,without explanation.absent from these allegations are any detailed allegations of scienter with respect to the alleged misrepresentations.
dekalb argues it was plain error for the district court to conclude that the complaint does not contain allegations sufficient to give rise to a strong inference of scienter with respect to appellees.a complaint must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b this statutory requirement alters the usual contours of a rule b ruling because,while a court continues to give all reasonable inferences to plaintiffs,those inferences supporting scienter must be strong ones.in re cabletron,at citing greebel,cir.f actual allegations may be aggregated to infer scienter and must be inferred for each defendant with respect to each violation.phillips,cir.
dekalb contends the district court fail ed to properly consider all scienter allegations in the aggregate,and the court patently failed to interpret the allegations in a light most favorable to appellant.a securities fraud plaintiff must plead scienter with particular facts that give rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted in a severely reckless manner.bryant,at.severe recklessness is limited to those highly unreasonable omissions or misrepresentations that involve not merely simple or even inexcusable negligence,but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,and that present a danger of misleading buyers or sellers which is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.id.at quoting mcdonald alan bush brokerage,cir.
turning to the salient allegations of scienter set forth in the second amended complaint,dekalb alleged that defendants hoff and miller attended monthly operations meetings in arizona and every aspect of the physician services business was discussed in detail,including the aggressive channel stuffing and mounting problems with accounts recevable sic.compl.in the second amended complaint,dekalb alleged that testimonial evidence provided by a former senior executive would show defendants miller and hoff knew there was a problem with mounting accounts receivable but decided to continue with aggressive discounting and credit terms because the company had to make its numbers.
absent from these allegations are any particularized averments of fraud or scienter.in theoharous fong,cir,this court held that scienter was not pled with adequate specificity because the plaintiffs did not allege the context in which fong made this statement,and it does not appear from the face of the complaint that fong must have known that the statement presented a danger of misleading buyers or sellers.id.at.as in fong,dekalb broad claim of testimonial evidence is not set forth with requisite detail because dekalb failed to allege what was said at the meeting,to whom it was said,or in what context.accordingly,the averment lacks the requisite particularity.it is well established that claims of securities fraud can not rest on speculation and conclusory allegations.hoffman comshare,in re comshare.sec.litig,cir quoting san leandro emergency med.plan philip morris,cir.a general allegation that individual defendants promoted channel stuffing at a series of meetings does not establish scienter.
dekalb also avers that the individual defendants,mssrs.hoff,hutto and miller,made a powerpoint presentation in atlanta on march,that contained several statements identifying problems with the var channel.the presentation included discussion of the following topics heavy promotion discounting to drive var sales,and change behavior of vars from promotion discount buying to pull through demand buying and add additional vars.dekalb also alleges identified as conditions for sic were var accounts receivable collections and visibility into var inventory levels and outbound to move inventory physician practices pull through sales.dekalb maintains that these allegations establish a strong inference of scienter on the part of the individual defendants.we disagree.
viewing these confusing statements in the best possible light,it is possible to surmise that the individual defendants might have been aware of improper revenue recognition in the var channel and also knew that they needed to increase actual sales rather than promot e discount buying.but that conclusion is based on multiple inferences and drawn from somewhat baffling language.dekalb failed to allege what was actually discussed at the meeting.accordingly,the allegation regarding the meeting of march,does not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.
dekalb also argues that the personal certifications required by the act and signed by senior executives are indicia of defendants scienter.dekalb contends that by signing the certification,defendants represented to the general public that they reviewed the filing being certified the report did not contain any untrue statement of material fact the report fairly presented the financial condition of the company and they designed the disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the company was disclosed to them for the period in question.
the plain meaning of the language contained in,does not indicate any intent to change the requirements for pleading scienter set forth in the pslra.requires that the chief executive officer and chief financial officer certify e ach periodic report containing financial statements filed by an issuer with the securities and exchange commission a.the statute also provides for imprisonment of up to years or a fine of for any person who certifies a periodic financial statement knowing that the periodic report accompanying the statement does not comport with all the requirements set forth in section a or d of the securities exchange act of a or d c.an individual who willfully certifies such a statement is subject to a prison term of years and a fine of up to.nowhere in the statute is there any mention of civil liability or pleading requirements for scienter in civil actions brought for securities fraud.
a fundamental canon of statutory construction is that,unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.perrin united states,d citing burns alcala,d.when construing the meaning of a statute,the beginning point must be the language of the statute,and when a statute speaks with clarity to an issue judicial inquiry into the statute meaning,in all but the most extraordinary circumstance,is finished.estate of cowart nicklos drilling,d citing demarest manspeaker,d.in the instant case,the statute does not speak to the issue of pleading scienter.the plain language of evidences no congressional intent to alter the pleading requirements set forth in the pslra.
dekalb interpretation of conflicts with the plain language of the pslra.w hen two statutes are capable of coexistence,it is the duty of the courts,absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary,to regard each as effective.ag supply pioneer int l,d quoting morton mancari,d.if we were to accept dekalb proffered interpretation of,scienter would be established in every case where there was an accounting error or auditing mistake made by a publicly traded company,thereby eviscerating the pleading requirements for scienter set forth in the pslra.we decline to adopt such an interpretation.
instead,we hold that a certification is only probative of scienter if the person signing the certification was severely reckless in certifying the accuracy of the financial statements.this requirement is satisfied if the person signing the certification had reason to know,or should have suspected,due to the presence of glaring accounting irregularities or other red flags,that the financial statements contained material misstatements or omissions.in the instant case,there are no allegations in the second amended complaint that indicate the presence of such red flags in the company financial statements.
the second amended complaint states that the physician services accounts receivable grew from to almost million in approximately eighteen months beginning in late.by way of comparison,ndc announced that its revenue for the third quarter of was million and net income was only million.dekalb alleged that i n the fourth quarter ended may,ndc increased its allowance for doubtful accounts by million,nearly seven times the average for the three previous quarters.compl.those numbers are somewhat alarming because they indicate a relatively large amount of revenue that might never be realized.but those statements themselves do not appear to be untrue or misleading.
viewing the allegations individually and in aggregate,the facts set forth in the second amended complaint do not create a strong inference of scienter.see b mandating strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.accordingly,the district court did not err in dismissing dekalb second amended complaint.
ndc argues that dekalb did not have standing to bring a claim regarding the stated value of medunite because dekalb did not purchase any stock until after the alleged fraudulent conduct occurred.dekalb alleged that the impact of the sale of medunite was realized on march.compl.but dekalb did not buy stock until march and.accordingly dekalb did not have standing to bring this claim because they did not buy the stock until long after the impact of the sale was realized.see marsh armada,cir standing is established by allegations that plaintiffs bought or sold shares of the stock in question within a reasonable period of time after the allegedly fraudulent conduct occurred to support an inference of reliance.see also blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d holding that the plaintiff class for purposes of a private damage action under b and rule i s limited to actual purchasers and sellers of securities.
dekalb argues that the district court erred in dismissing its complaint against because certified ndc financial accounts even though their practices did not comport with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and generally accepted auditing standards gaas dekalb alleged that ignored red flags when it issued unqualified audits and financial statements in and.compl.
dekalb argues that anomalous increases in ndc reserve for doubtful accounts put on notice of the other defendant fraudulent scheme.drastic overstatement of accounts,or other red flags,combined with alleged violations of gaas or gaap may be enough to establish the requisite level scienter.in re eagle.tech,sec,d,finding sufficient particularity where fraudulent contracts made up of the company business,financial statements had out of line items restated,and red flags included inter alia,purchase order discrepancies in the hundreds of thousands,delivery discrepancies of of goods,and license agreements see also in re friedman,sec,d,finding a strong inference of scienter where auditing firm had continuous arguments with company management over allowance for uncollected accounts,the firm knew that the company was,the firm discussed doubtful accounts every quarter,and the firm committed numerous gaap and gaas violations in re hamilton,sec,d finding sufficient particularity where auditing firm committed numerous gaap and gaas violations and ignored an investigation by the office of the comptroller of the currency,the simultaneous sale and purchase of overpriced loans or securities to avoid write down on its books,and the corporation failure to adhere to sec requirements.
red flags are those facts which come to the attention of an auditor which would place a reasonable auditor on notice that the audited company was engaged in wrongdoing to the detriment of its investors.in re sunterra.sec,d.it is established,however,that the purported red flags can not simply the alleged gaap violations.in re spear jackson sec,d,citing holmes baker,d.
dekalb alleged that was put on notice of fraudulent activity by ndc increased allowance for doubtful accounts in the fourth quarter of and.compl.dekalb also claimed that a n analysis of ndc reserve for doubtful accounts and related and recoveries for fiscal year and fiscal year reveals a pattern strongly suggesting that defendants concealed overstated revenues for fiscal year and by increasing ndc provision in the fourth quarter of both years and taking a large,anomalous charge for uncollectible accounts receivable id.the complaint alleged
