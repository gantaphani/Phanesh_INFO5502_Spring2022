the securities act of,et the act,exempts from federal regulation annuity contracts issued by a corporation subject to regulation by state insurance laws.petitioners seek review of a rule promulgated by the securities and exchange commission sec or commission stating that fixed indexed annuities fias are not annuity contracts within the meaning of the act.as a result of this new rule,fias are subject to the full panoply of requirements set forth by the act,instead of being subject solely to state insurance laws.petitioners argue that the commission unreasonably interpreted the term annuity contract not to include fias.petitioners also assert that the sec failed to fulfill its statutory responsibility under the act to consider the effect of the new rule on efficiency,competition,and capital formation.because we hold that the sec interpretation of annuity contract is reasonable under chevron,we deny the petitions with respect to this issue.we grant the petitions,however,with respect to petitioners alternate ground that the sec failed to properly consider the effect of the rule upon efficiency,competition,and capital formation.accordingly,we remand the rule for reconsideration.
background 
the securities act of governs the offer or sale of any security through interstate commerce.the act defines the term security as including any investment contract.a sec variable annuity life ins.of am.valic,d.section a of the act,however,provides an exemption under the act for an annuity contract or optional annuity contract subject to state insurance laws.a.
a traditional fixed annuity is a contract issued by a life insurance company,under which the purchaser makes a series of premium payments to the insurer in exchange for a series of periodic payments from the insurer to the purchaser at agreed upon later dates.in a fixed annuity,the insurance company guarantees that the purchaser will earn a minimum rate of interest over time.fixed annuities are subject to state insurance law regulation,and are exempt from federal securities laws.see id.state insurance laws governing fixed annuity contracts require insurance companies to guarantee a minimum of the contract value after any costs and charges are applied.these state laws generally require the minimum guarantee be at least percent of the premiums paid,accumulated at an annual interest rate of to percent.indexed annuities and certain other insurance contracts final fia rule,to be codified at parts and.the laws also generally impose disclosure and suitability requirements,which vary from state to state.
a fixed index annuity fia is a hybrid financial product that combines some of the benefits of fixed annuities with the added earning potential of a security.like traditional fixed annuities,fias are subject to state insurance laws,under which insurance companies must guarantee the same percent of purchase payments.unlike traditional fixed annuities,however,the purchaser rate of return is not based upon a guaranteed interest rate.in fias the insurance company credits the purchaser with a return that is based on the performance of a securities index,such as the dow jones industrial average,nasdaq index,or standard poor index.depending on the performance of the securities index to which a particular fia is tied,the return on an fia might be much higher or lower than the guaranteed rate of return offered by a traditional fixed annuity.due to the fact that the purchaser actual return is linked to the performance of a securities index,however,the purchaser return can not be calculated until the end of the crediting period.insurance companies typically apply an annual crediting period that is,the interest of an fia is typically calculated on an annual basis after each period ends.
while this is the first case in which we have had occasion to address the a annuity exemption as it regards fias,the supreme court has offered guidance on the scope of the exemption in valic,d,and sec united benefit life ins,d.in valic,the supreme court considered whether a variable annuity fell within the a exemption.a variable annuity is a financial product under which purchasers pay premiums that are invested in common stocks and other equities to a greater degree than traditional annuities,and the benefit payments vary with the success of the investment management.see valic,at.the court explained that a variable annuity did not fall within the a exemption because it placed all the investment risks on the purchaser,none on the company.id.at.as the court said,the concept of insurance involves some investment on the part of the company.id.i nsurance involves a guarantee that at least some fraction of the benefits will be payable in fixed amounts.id.therefore,an issuer of an annuity that has no element of a fixed return assumes no true risk in the insurance sense.id.the fact that there exists a risk of declining returns in difficult economic times is not sufficient to show that the insurer has assumed more risk under the contract.see id.accordingly,because the variable annuity at issue did not offer a true underwriting of risks,the one earmark of insurance,the court held that it did not fall within the exemption offered to traditional fixed annuities offered by insurers.id.at.in a concurring opinion later approved by the full court in united benefit,justice brennan explained that when a form of investment arrangement emerges which is labeled insurance or annuity by its promoters,the functional distinction that congress set up in must be examined to test whether the contract falls within the sort of investment form that congress was then willing to leave exclusively to the state insurance commissioners.id.at.brennan,concurring see united benefit,at.
in united benefit,the court concluded that another product similar to a variable annuity called a flexible fund annuity was not exempt under a of the act.a flexible fund functioned in much the same way as a variable annuity.most notably,the purchaser paid premiums into a separate account that was primarily invested in common stocks,with the object of producing capital gains as well as an interest return.united benefit,at.unlike the variable annuity in valic,however,the insurer guaranteed that the purchaser would receive a percentage of his premiums back.this percentage gradually increased from percent of net premiums in the first year to percent after years.id.united benefit argued that,under valic,the existence vel non of substantial investment risk by the insurer ultimately determined whether a product fell within the a exemption.
the court disagreed that valic should be interpreted so narrowly.id.at.rather,the critical inquiry under a was whether the product at issue involve d considerations of investment not present in the conventional contract of insurance.id.quoting prudential ins.sec,cir.in concluding that the flexible fund did not fall within a,the court relied significantly on the fact that the flexible fund appeal ed to the purchaser not on the usual insurance basis of stability and security but on the prospect of growth through sound investment management.united benefit,at.though the court acknowledged that the guarantee of cash value based on net premiums reduces substantially the investment risk of the contract holder,it reasoned further that the assumption of an investment risk by the insurer can not by itself create an insurance provision under the federal definition.id.citing helvering le gierse.the court recognized that a basic difference exists between a contract which to some degree is insured and a contract of insurance.united benefit,at.in the case of the flexible fund,the insurer assumption of risk was minimal.the insurer was obligated to produce no more than the guaranteed minimum at maturity,and this amount is substantially less than that guaranteed by the same premiums in a conventional deferred annuity contract.id.at.
since the court decisions in valic and united benefit,the sec has engaged in rulemaking to address the newer financial products that have entered the market.in the,the sec promulgated rule in response to the creation of a new hybrid financial product called a guaranteed investment contract.see.guaranteed investment contracts are like traditional fixed annuities,in that they promise a return at a guaranteed rate of return for the life of the contract.in some guaranteed investment contracts,however,the insurer may agree to periodically pay the purchaser an additional discretionary amount above the already guaranteed return amount.rule provided that,under certain conditions,a guaranteed investment contract would qualify for the a exemption notwithstanding an insurer ability to pay a discretionary amount to the purchaser.under rule,a contract falls within the a exemption if 
the annuity or optional annuity contract is issued by a corporation the insurer subject to the supervision of the insurance commissioner,bank commissioner,or any agency or officer performing like functions,of any state or territory of the united states or the district of columbia 
the insurer assumes the investment risk under the contract as prescribed in paragraph b of this section and 
the contract is not marketed primarily as an investment.
a.though the sec considered excluding from the rule safe harbor any product in which an issuer calculates the rate of any excess return by reference to an index,it concluded that an issuer may reference an index to set the excess return rate,but only if the rate is set before each crediting period begins and remains in effect for at least one year.definition of annuity contract or optional annuity contract,release,wl,at may.
in the,insurance companies began marketing fias.the sec did not take any regulatory action with respect to fias until.by this time,the sales volume of fias had increased to billion indexed annuity assets totaled billion.a total of fias were being offered by insurance companies.having grown increasingly concerned that these fias were not being sold through registered and were not registered with the sec despite their to a securities market,the sec proposed rule.rule provides that a contract that is regulated as an annuity under state insurance law is not an annuity contract under a of the act if 
the contract specifies that amounts payable by the issuer under the contract are calculated at or after the end of one or more specified crediting periods,in whole or in part,by reference to the performance during the crediting period or periods of a security,including a group or index of securities and 
amounts payable by the issuer under the contract are more likely than not to exceed the amounts guaranteed under the contract.
a a.by redefining an annuity contract to exclude fias,the commission sought to ensure that purchasers of fias would be entitled to the full protection of the federal securities laws,including disclosure,antifraud,and sales practice protections.
to support this new rule,the sec first noted that the securities act did not define annuity contract,and that fias were not in existence at the time the annuity contract exemption in the securities act was enacted.final fia rule.at.without express statutory guidance,the commission looked to the reasoning set forth in the supreme court decisions in valic and united benefit to assess whether fias were the type of financial product that congress would have been willing to leave to state insurance regulation.id.at.
the sec began its analysis by considering the level of risk associated with fias.citing valic,the commission reasoned that congress intended to include in the insurance exemption only those policies and contracts that include a true underwriting of risks and investment by the insurer.id.citing valic,at.the annuities that were offered at the time of the enactment of the a exemption were fixed annuities that generally involved no investment risk to the purchaser.final fia rule.at.therefore,the sec reasoned,congress was willing to offer a securities law exemption to these types of no risk products because,by their nature,they did not raise the kinds of problems or risks that the federal securities laws were intended to address.id.additionally,the state insurance laws in existence could adequately deal with any issues that might arise from such low risk insurance products.id.on the other hand,the sec explained,i ndividuals who purchase fias are exposed to a significant investment,the volatility of the underlying securities index.id.at.at the time an fia is purchased,the purchaser assumes the risk of an uncertain and fluctuating financial instrument,in exchange for participation in future returns.id.at.unlike the guaranteed,fixed return offered by a traditional fixed annuity,the sec asserted that an fia return was neither known nor guaranteed.id.the sec acknowledged that indexed annuities contracts provide some protection against the risk of loss,but determined that these provisions did not adequately transfer the investment risk from the purchaser to the insurer.id.because the value of the purchaser investment was entirely dependent upon an unknown and fluctuating securities index,the assumption of a guaranteed minimum percentage of the fia,though giving fias an outward aspect of insurance,was a superficial and unsubstantial offset of the purchaser risk.id.therefore,the sec reasoned that an fia value is much like that of a security,as the value of each product depends on the performance of the market.this investment risk,the sec explained,was the exact type of investment risk that the securities act was created to address.id.
though the sec set forth in rule that the manner in which a product was marketed factored into the sec determination of whether it constituted an annuity contract under a,see a,the sec opted not to include such an element in rule.the sec noted that the performance of an fia is obviously associated with the performance of a securities index,given the nature of the product.final fia rule.at.moreover,the sec noted that the supreme court in valic did not consider how the variable annuity was marketed in determining whether it fell within a exemption.id.for these reasons,the sec felt that inclusion of a marketing element in rule was unnecessary.id.
the sec supplemented its analysis of rule by undertaking a consideration of the rule promotion of efficiency,competition,and capital formation,as is required by b of the act for certain sec rulemakings.see b.the sec first concluded that rule would promote efficiency,reasoning that the rule would extend the benefits of the disclosure and sales practice protections of the federal securities laws to fias that offered payments to the purchaser that fluctuated with the securities markets.id.at.the imposition of disclosure requirements would enable investors to make more informed investment decisions about purchasing fias,and would promote more suitable recommendations by issuers of fias to purchasers.id.at.next,the sec asserted that the improvement in investors ability to make informed investment decisions would increase competition between issuers of fias.the sec reasoned that the imposition of federal securities laws to regulate fias was particularly important because it would bring about clarity in what has been an uncertain area of law,id.at,which would in turn increase competition because registered who currently may be unwilling to sell unregistered fias because of their uncertain regulatory status may become willing to sell fias that are registered.id.at.finally,the sec concluded that,based upon the increased efficiency resulting from the enhanced investor protections under federal law,rule a would promote capital formation by improving the flow of information among insurers that issue fias,the distributors of those annuities,and investors.id.at.
petitioners seek review of rule 
ii.analysis 
petitioners first argue that the sec erred in excluding fias from the definition of annuity contract under a of the act.petitioners assert that their argument is supported by the plain language of the provision,as well as by the supreme court decisions in valic and united benefit.petitioners argue that rule is in conflict with the text of a,the aforementioned decisions of the court,and the text of the sec prior rule,rule.finally,petitioners argue that the sec failed to undertake properly its statutory responsibility to consider rule effect on efficiency,competition,and capital formation,pursuant to b of the act.we will address each argument in turn.
when an agency is given express authority to execute and enforce its enabling statute and to prescribe such rules and regulations as are or may be necessary to carry out provisions of the statute,courts must apply a analysis in reviewing the agency interpretation of the statute under chevron natural res.def.council,d.section a of the act bestows upon the sec the power to define terms and make rules to that effect.a.rule,which interprets the term annuity contract in a of the act is clearly such a rule.
under chevron,we first determine whether the statute being interpreted is ambiguous.if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue then that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.on the other hand,if the court determines that the statute is either silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,then chevron step one is satisfied.id.at.here,chevron step one is satisfied because the act is ambiguous,or at the very least silent,on whether the term annuity contract encompasses all forms of contracts that may be described as annuities.indeed,the analyses in the supreme court decisions in valic and united benefit confirm this ambiguity.see generally valic,d united benefit,d.had the statute been unambiguous,the court need not have undertaken such an exhaustive inquiry in determining whether the two products at issue in those cases were annuities under a of the act.
petitioners nevertheless argue that the court decisions in valic and united benefit establish that an annuity falls outside of a only if it is subject to the insurer investment management,and not subject to state insurance laws.given the absence of these two elements,petitioners assert,a clearly governs fias because fias are not subject to the insurer investment management and are governed by a panoply of state insurance laws.petitioners argument misses the mark because it interprets valic and united benefit too restrictively.
nothing in those cases indicated that the court determination whether the a exemption applies to particular contracts depends on the investment management of the issuer and the applicability of state insurance regulation.rather,the court embraced a broader approach in its a analysis.the court clearly indicated in both valic and united benefit that the a exemption applied to products that did not present very squarely the sort of problems that the securities act was devised to deal with,and which were,in many details,subject to a form of state regulation of a sort which made the federal regulation even less relevant.united benefit,at.quoting valic,at.brennan,concurring.the court therefore focused its a analysis on whether the product at issue involve d considerations of investment not present in the conventional contract of insurance.id.quotation omitted.though an insurer investment management actions associated with a product may be relevant to determining whether that product is an annuity,this is not the only relevant characteristic.petitioners reliance on the existence of state law regulation governing fias is also too limited.the court recognized in united benefit that it had conclusively rejected in valic the argument that the existence of adequate state regulation was the basis for the a exemption.id.quotation omitted.therefore,the fact that fias are subject to state insurance regulation does not,without more,place them within the a exemption.accordingly,the language of a does not unambiguously include fias within the a exemption.in light of the fact that the statute is ambiguous with respect to the term annuity contract,we reiterate that chevron step one is satisfied.
we must next determine whether the sec rule is a reasonable interpretation of the statute.the sec rule will satisfy step two of the chevron analysis so long as it meets this requirement.it is irrelevant that this court might have reached a than the sec.see cable telecomm.ass brand x internet,d.
in this case,the sec has adopted an interpretation that is based in reason.by their nature,fias appeal to the purchaser not on the usual insurance basis of stability and security but on the prospect of growth through sound investment management.united benefit,at.an fia is akin to an annuity contract with respect to its and guaranteed minimum value of purchase payment features.the interest return rate of an fia,however,is decidedly more like a security in that the return of an fia is not known until the end of a crediting cycle,as the rate is based on the actual performance of a specified securities index during that period.similar to an investor in securities,a purchaser of an fia knows the level of annual return he will receive once the year is concluded and the index value is compared with its value at the beginning of the year.in fias,as in securities,there is a variability in the potential return that results in a risk to the purchaser.by contrast,an annuity contract falling under rule exemption avoids this variability by guaranteeing the interest rate ahead of time.as these characteristics show,fias involve considerations of investment not present in the conventional contract of insurance.id.at.quotation omitted.accordingly,the sec interpretation that an fia does not constitute an annuity contract under a of the act was reasonable.
petitioners assert that the sec based its analysis of rule on an insupportable definition of investment risk.the sec determined that a purchaser bears sufficient risk to treat a product as a security when a mounts payable by the issuer under the contract are more likely than not to exceed the amounts guaranteed under the contract.a a emphasis added.in petitioners view,investment risk exists only where the purchaser of a security faces the possibility of a loss of principal.petitioners view is certainly a defensible one.however,that is not sufficient to establish that the sec rule is arbitrary or capricious.as the sec points out,comparing two slightly different annuity with a percent interest rate guaranteed ahead of time one with an interest rate that could be between and percent determined at the end of the second product is riskier than the first product because its potential return could be lower than the rate of return from the first product,even though it guarantees a minimum return rate of at least percent.moreover,the sec has also been consistent in its position on investment risk.when it adopted rule,which provided a safe harbor to certain types of annuity contracts including those that based interest payments on an investment index,the sec noted that it was allowing products involving investment indices with the caveat that such interest rates be calculated in advance of the upcoming year.see definition of annuity contract or optional annuity contract,release,wl,at.this,the sec said,would minimize the investment risk exposure of the purchaser.we can not hold that this interpretation is unreasonable.
petitioners argument that the sec failed to balance the investment risks assumed by the insurer against those assumed by the purchaser misses the mark.to the contrary,the sec considered the risk to insurers,and weighed that risk against the risk to the fia customer in determining whether the product is an annuity or security.see final fia rule.at.the sec concluded in its adopting release that annuities were those products that included a true underwriting of risks and investment by the insurer,with more minimal risk exposure to the purchaser.id.at.in traditional fixed annuities,the insurer bears the investment risk under the contract.id.at.fias did not fall within this term because insurers offering fias left a more than minimal risk upon the purchaser.rule appears to be the sec means of ensuring greater protection for consumers exposed to greater risk when insurers are exposed to less risk than normal.indeed,the rule sets forth a test to dist
