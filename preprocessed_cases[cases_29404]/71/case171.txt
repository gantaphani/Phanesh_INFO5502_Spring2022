this appeal arises from the collapse of the hedge fund lipper convertibles.the plaintiffs appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment on their federal claims against lipper convertibles auditor,pricewaterhousecoopers llp pwc,under section b of the securities exchange act of the exchange act,as well as their state law claims of fraud and negligent misrepresentation.with respect to the section b claims,we conclude that there is a genuine dispute as to whether the plaintiffs suffered a direct injury at the time of investment by purchasing their shares in lipper convertibles funds at fraudulently inflated prices.accordingly,we vacate the grant of summary judgment on the section b claims and remand to the district court to consider in the first instance pwc scienter argument and for further proceedings.as for the state law claims,we affirm.
background 
on appeal of a grant of summary judgment in favor of pwc,we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all ambiguities in their favor.gould winstar commc ns,cir brackets and quotation marks omitted.
at all relevant times lipper convertibles to which we sometimes refer as the fund was a hedge fund organized as two new york limited partnerships managed by a general partner,lipper holdings,llc,pursuant to a partnership agreement under the agreement,the fund limited partners did not acquire direct ownership of the securities in which lipper convertibles invested.instead,each limited partner contributed capital entitling it to a share of the fund profits and losses.after a limited partner invested,its capital account with the fund would be debited and credited with proportionate shares of the partnership profits,losses,and expenses.each limited partner initial percentage ownership interest in the fund was calculated by taking the value of that limited partner cash contribution and dividing it by the total stated value of all existing partners capital accounts.
a significant portion of the securities in which lipper convertibles invested on behalf of the partnership consisted of convertible preferred stocks and convertible that traded and for which there were no publicly available valuations.according to the plaintiffs expert report submitted at summary judgment,lipper convertibles was to determine the fair value of the fund securities based on available market quotations in the form of bid and asked price quotes from or from bloomberg.edward strafaci,the fund principal trader was responsible for valuing the fund securities at all relevant times.
for fiscal years through,lipper convertibles retained pwc as its outside auditor to review the financial statements that detailed the fund performance and the value of each limited partner interest,and to confirm that the statements were accurate and conformed with generally accepted accounting principles gaap.see continental cas.pricewaterhousecoopers,llp.each year,pwc issued an audit letter opining that the financial statements present fairly,in all material respects,the financial position of lipper convertibles,in conformity with gaap and that its audit complied with generally accepted auditing standards.
two different groups of plaintiffs purchased interests in lipper convertibles as limited partners.collectively,these plaintiffs invested a total of in the fund through five separate investments on various days between may and april.
in january strafaci abruptly left lipper convertibles.in february lipper convertibles issued a letter to its limited partners announcing that it would be revaluing the securities in which it had invested in the wake of strafaci unexpected departure and after an internal review indicated that a more cautious valuation was warranted.the letter warned that lipper convertibles anticipated reducing its portfolio valuation by approximately percent.the following month,march,lipper convertibles announced that the portfolio valuation had in fact declined by approximately percent during the calendar year,and that lipper convertibles would be immediately dissolved and the remaining assets distributed to the limited partners according to an established distribution plan.
the bdo reports 
following the announcement,lipper convertibles retained an accounting firm,bdo seidman,llp bdo,to determine a methodology for the distribution of lipper convertibles assets upon its dissolution.bdo issued an initial report the bdo report in october and a report with variances not relevant to this appeal in december at the outset,the bdo report cautioned that bdo ha d not been asked to develop an opinion regarding whether the values of the securities contemporaneously reported in lipper convertibles records were appropriate at any specific point in time.the report then proceeded to revalue lipper convertibles securities on a retrospective basis from january to november at prices lower than those contemporaneously reported by lipper convertibles.joint app x at.the alternative values listed in the report were calculated based on securities pricing information provided by independent pricing services associated with the financial times group and merrill lynch,as well as on brokerage statements from brokers reflecting their contemporaneously reported pricing of certain of the securities.
in justifying the revaluations,the bdo report explained that it was fair and reasonable to obtain and utilize securities market prices from through from the same types of reputable third party sources relied upon by its professionals when auditing hedge funds,joint app x at,and that bdo had employed a reasonable methodology of determining the investors ownership interests in percentages and dollars as of june,without significant use of the market values of the securities reported in the records for the fund vehicles in which the plaintiffs had invested,joint app x at.bdo calculated revised values for the hedge fund total capital as well as each limited partner ownership interest.having determined that the fair value of the underlying securities had been overstated,bdo also concluded that there had been an overstatement of the fund total capital as well as the interests of the limited partners.accordingly,for each year from through november,bdo analysis showed a difference between the fund contemporaneously reported total capital and bdo alternative calculation of total capital of between percent and percent.
in october the fund began liquidating its assets,and the general partner filed a petition in new york state supreme court for an order winding up the fund and approving the distribution of million in assets to limited partners in accordance with the revised ownership interests calculated by bdo.the subsequent state court proceedings,which included the appointment of a liquidating trustee,were described by the new york court of appeals when it reviewed various state claims against pwc arising out of a separate action commenced by other limited partners of lipper convertibles in continental casualty company pricewaterhousecoopers,llp 
in the spring of,a trustee was appointed,charged with,among other things,investigating and bringing claims against the former fund managers,and any other culpable parties,on behalf of the limited partners who lost money as a result of the fund collapse.in july,the trustee commenced an action against pwc for damages allegedly caused to the fund by pwc improper audits.the trustee alleged,among other things,that pwc was aware of the misstatements in the financial reports,but failed to bring them to the attention of the fund management,instead falsely representing that the financial statements were prepared in accordance with gaap.based on these allegations,the trustee asserted causes of action for accountant malpractice,fraud,breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.
cont l cas,at 
in february the state lower court ordered the distribution of lipper convertibles remaining assets to the limited partners in accordance with the analysis contained in the bdo report,including the bdo report revaluations of lipper convertibles securities.the plaintiffs supported the proposed distribution.
strafaci guilty plea 
in august,two years after leaving lipper convertibles,strafaci pleaded guilty in the southern district of new york to one count of securities fraud in violation of section b based on the fraudulent overvaluations of lipper convertibles securities.in effect,in determining the fair value of the fund securities,strafaci us ed market quotations from as his benchmark or starting point.he would adjust such market quotations based on his own judgment using various criteria.there was no formal or documented review within lipper of his valuations.joint app x at plaintiffs expert report footnote omitted.during the plea,strafaci acknowledged that he had engaged in securities fraud in connection with the limited partnership interests in the fund from to january,the period of criminal misconduct alleged in the indictment against him 
at various times during the period alleged in count of the indictment,within the southern district of new york,and elsewhere,i knowingly and willfully and with the intent to defraud made untrue statements of material fact in connection with the purchase and sales of interests in the lipper convertibles funds.i knew that the lipper funds utilized the instrumentalities in interstate commerce in connection with the purchase and sale of these securities.
during the period alleged in the indictment,i knew that audited financial statements were prepared by auditors and were mailed to investors.i also knew that the annual financial statements contained representations that the portfolio was valued based on a fair value methodology the amount that the funds could reasonably expect to receive upon expect to receive or receive for the securities upon the current sale.however,i deliberately did not use this methodology.instead,the values that i assigned to the securities were higher because i valued them based on my estimate of what they would be worth at some point in the future.
confidential app x at strafaci also admitted that he understood that his fraudulent overvaluations would affect the investment decisions of limited partners in the fund.
procedural history 
both sets of plaintiffs filed virtually identical complaints in two separate actions that were eventually consolidated before the same district judge in the southern district of new york.the complaints alleged a variety of federal and state claims against pwc,lipper convertibles,lipper holdings,and other defendants.as against pwc,the sole appellee in this appeal,the plaintiffs alleged both claims on behalf of lipper convertibles,which they conceded were derivative,and claims on behalf of themselves that they were fraudulently induced to invest in lipper convertibles by pwc annual auditor opinion letters.the plaintiffs ultimately agreed to dismiss the clearly derivative claims based on the liquidating trustee action against pwc.as relevant to this appeal,then,the plaintiffs remaining claims against pwc included claims under section b of the exchange act and rule,as well as state law claims alleging common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation and malpractice.the plaintiffs insisted that these remaining claims were for injuries distinct from the injuries sustained by the fund.
after discovery,pwc moved for summary judgment dismissing all of the plaintiffs claims for two reasons.first,pwc argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing because their injuries were suffered in common with the other limited partners and therefore gave rise to derivative,rather than direct,claims.second,pwc maintained that the plaintiffs had failed to submit evidence that pwc acted with the requisite scienter in issuing its auditor opinion letters.
in november the district court granted pwc motion for summary judgment and dismissed all of plaintiffs claims.the court held that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they had not demonstrated any injury distinct from the injury suffered by the fund itself,rendering their claims derivative rather than direct.in doing so,the district court pointed to the new york court of appeals decision in continental casualty,which it described as strikingly similar to the case at bar.in continental casualty,the new york court of appeals had held that pwc was entitled to summary judgment in a case brought by other limited partners in the fund,and affirmed the dismissal of those limited partners claims as derivative in nature.the district court observed that the plaintiffs in continental casualty were required but failed to come forward with direct,distinct injuries to support such a claim,portfolio valuations showing the amount of the claimed overvaluation of the portfolio on the day of their respective investments.lewin lipper convertibles,d,quoting cont l cas,at.
having concluded that the plaintiffs in the instant case lacked standing because their claims against pwc were similarly derivative,the district court understandably did not address pwc alternative argument about scienter.after the court denied their motion for reconsideration,the plaintiffs appealed.

accordingly,the plaintiffs have standing to sue only for injuries distinct to themselves and not sustained in common with the other lipper convertibles limited partners.
pwc burden as the moving party 
the moving party bears the initial burden of showing that there is no genuine dispute as to a material fact.vivenzio city of syracuse,cir.however,w hen the burden of proof at trial would fall on the nonmoving party,it ordinarily is sufficient for the movant to point to a lack of evidence to go to the trier of fact on an essential element of the nonmovant claim.cordiano metacon gun club,cir.in that event,the nonmoving party must come forward with admissible evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact for trial in order to avoid summary judgment.id.here the plaintiffs bore the burden of establishing that they have standing because their claims are direct rather than derivative.in the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact or of evidence presented by the plaintiffs on the issue,pwc would have been entitled to summary judgment.
based on the affidavit of chudozie okongwu,the district court concluded that pwc demonstrated an absence of a genuine dispute regarding plaintiffs standing to bring a direct claim.the okongwu affidavit,relying on the bdo report,asserted that all of the damages claimed as part of the plaintiffs federal and state causes of action were merely the plaintiffs share of partnership losses and thus were derivative in nature the difference between the plaintiffs net capital investments and their june,capital balances,as calculated by the bdo model,are sic exclusively a function of three components,each of which accrued to plaintiffs in common with the other limited partners in lipper convertibles over the course of their investment in lipper convertibles,and none of which is unique to plaintiffs or accrued at the moment of plaintiffs investment.the okongwu affidavit identified the three components as lipper convertibles trading losses,lipper convertibles overpayments to withdrawing limited partners,and lipper convertibles payment of inflated management and incentive fees to the general partner.
at oral argument on appeal,pwc indicated that it was arguing only that plaintiffs could not show that the fair value of the interests that plaintiffs purchased was fraudulently overstated at the times of plaintiffs investments.that is,pwc conceded that if such a showing were made,then the plaintiffs would have a direct,rather than derivative,claim.oral arg.tr.at.pointing largely to the okongwu affidavit,however,pwc contends that it presented evidence that the plaintiffs interests were in fact not overvalued at the time of purchase and that other reasons common to all of the limited partners including those whose claims were dismissed in continental casualty explained the plaintiffs losses.as a result,pwc maintains,the plaintiffs injuries were no different from those suffered by other limited partners.
pwc clearly failed to satisfy its initial minimal burden of showing a lack of a genuine dispute about whether the plaintiffs respective interests were overvalued at the times they were purchased.we arrive at this conclusion for two reasons.first,the strafaci guilty plea allocution provided what appears to be direct evidence of the overvaluation of the securities underlying those interests at all relevant times.second,the bdo report,which was part of the record on summary judgment and was cited by the parties,also provided some evidence that the relevant securities were overvalued in each year from through november.certainly in combination,the guilty plea allocution and the bdo report provided evidence from which a jury reasonably could find that the plaintiffs purchased their interests at fraudulently overvalued prices.
the strafaci plea allocution 
we start with the more compelling evidence of strafaci plea allocution,which,it seems to us,supported the plaintiffs claim that their interests in the partnership were overvalued at all relevant times,including the time of purchase.as part of his guilty plea to securities fraud,strafaci stated that between and january,in valuing the securities in lipper convertibles portfolio,he deliberately did not use the fair value methodology that the financial statements represented was used.instead,strafaci stated,the values that he assigned to the securities were higher because he valued them based on his estimate of what they would be worth at some point in the future.strafaci also stated that he understood that his actions would affect the decisions of persons engaged in transactions in securities of the fund.put simply and in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,strafaci,the principal trader in charge of valuing the securities,admitted that over the period during which the plaintiffs purchased their interests in the fund,he consistently and systematically assigned higher values to the securities underlying those interests than were appropriate based on the methodology that lipper convertibles financial statements represented was being used.the evidence of strafaci plea,moreover,was indisputably before the district court on the summary judgment motion.for example,it was specifically referenced by the plaintiffs in their rule counterstatement,and the district court opinion referred to the plea in a footnote.
we conclude that strafaci admission that he overvalued the securities during the period of time that the plaintiffs purchased their interests was sufficient to create a triable issue of fact as to whether the plaintiffs purchased their interests at an inflated price and thereby suffered a direct injury at the time of their investments.
the bdo reports 
as discussed,the bdo report provided evidence that the relevant lipper convertibles securities were overvalued in each year from through november.without disputing the revaluations of the relevant securities contained in the bdo report,pwc argues that the district court properly discounted the report on both procedural and substantive grounds.
we turn first to the procedural ground.the district court faulted the plaintiffs for not designating specific parts of the bdo reports in opposing summary judgment.although the plaintiffs surely could have presented the evidence of the overvaluation of the securities more clearly to the district court,their brief in opposition to summary judgment referenced the bdo reports at some length as evidence of the overvaluation.to be sure,the district court is not required to scour the record on its own in a search for evidence when the plaintiffs fail to present it.archie comic publ ns,decarlo,d,quotation marks omitted.nevertheless,we conclude that the court erred in disregarding the bdo reports on that basis.first,neither the initial bdo report nor the report was especially long including a cover letter,the initial report spanned just pages,while the report was all of pages and stated up front that it did not alter the initial report retrospective monthly revaluations.plaintiffs were not asking the district court to peruse a haystack looking for needles.id.at.second,the report was central to the summary judgment record,as evidenced by the fact that it was cited repeatedly by the plaintiffs in opposing summary judgment and by the district court itself in its opinion.the report was properly before the district court as evidence that the plaintiffs had purchased their shares at inflated prices.
in the alternative,the district court determined that the report substantively did not demonstrate that the plaintiffs overpaid for the relevant securities.the court held that the report failed to determine with precision the value of the relevant securities at any particular time of purchase.the district court understandably arrived at this conclusion based largely on the report disclaimer that bdo was not asked to develop an opinion regarding whether the values of the securities contemporaneously reported in convertibles records were appropriate at any specific point in time.
but we think the able and experienced district judge placed too much emphasis on the disclaimer at this stage in the litigation.a jury could reasonably infer from the events following the issuance of the bdo reports,as well as the methodology used in the reports,that the bdo valuations were both reliable and reflected contemporaneous pricing.first,the new york state court based its distribution of several million dollars entirely on the bdo reports alternative valuations of the securities.a jury could reasonably infer that bdo valuations were therefore sufficiently reliable measures during the relevant period.second,whether or not bdo was asked to develop an opinion regarding the appropriateness of convertibles reported values,the bdo reports functioned more or less as expert reports.a jury could reasonably conclude that bdo methodology in revaluing the securities was sound and that its calculations were reliable even though they were not the primary purpose of the reports.third,on a consistent basis,the valuations contained in the report showed significa
