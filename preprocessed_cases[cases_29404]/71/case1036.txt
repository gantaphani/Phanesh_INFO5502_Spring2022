richard berger appeals the sentence imposed by the district court following our affirmance of his conviction for twelve counts of bank and securities fraud.berger argues that,in sentencing him on remand,the district court erred by not adhering to the civil loss causation principle in finding shareholder loss,as described by the supreme court in dura pharmaceuticals,broudo,d and applying an erroneous standard of proof in determining total loss for sentencing enhancement purposes.while we decline to extend the dura pharmaceuticals principle to criminal securities fraud,we conclude that the district court loss calculation approach was nevertheless flawed.thus,although we conclude that the district court used the correct standard of proof in determining the total loss,we vacate berger sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing.
facts and procedural background 
craig consumer electronics,craig was a publicly traded consumer electronics business that primarily distributed its products to retail electronics stores.during the relevant time frame,berger was craig president,chief executive officer,and chairman of the board.two other corporate officers,donna richardson and bonnie metz participated in the fraudulent scheme and were convicted along with berger for their involvement.
in august,craig entered into a million revolving credit agreement with a consortium of banks.under the agreement,the amount craig was permitted to borrow was based on the value of its current inventory and accounts receivable.to determine the fluctuating amount craig was eligible to borrow,berger and his were required to provide the lending banks with a daily certification concerning those assets.
berger and his accomplices began the fraudulent scheme as early as starting at that time and continuing through september,craig lacked sufficient qualifying accounts receivable and inventory to continue borrowing the funds needed for craig ongoing operations.to conceal craig true financial condition from the lending banks,berger and his cohorts employed various accounting schemes to falsify the information contained in the certifications.relying on these false statements,the banks lent millions of dollars to craig based on either nonexistent or substantially overstated collateral.
in may,craig made an initial public offering ipo of its stock.in connection with the ipo,berger publicly misrepresented the company fiscal viability,misstating craig financial condition in several mandatory reports filed with the securities and exchange commission sec.at the time of the ipo,craig was actually operating in default of its credit agreement with the lending banks,and was substantially overdrawn on its credit line.none of this information was disclosed in craig mandatory sec filings,or to its lenders.
in,an audit of the company records by craig accounting firm uncovered various accounting irregularities.as a result of the audit,craig was required to restate its earnings for and part of,thereby revealing that its earnings were substantially lower than those shown in its previous financial statements.in the months following this restatement,craig stock price fell from to per share in july,craig stock was delisted from the nasdaq because of its failure to meet nasdaq minimum bid price.the securities fraud and accounting irregularities noted were not publicly revealed until after the delisting.the lending banks did not discover the full extent of the fraud until august,when craig filed for bankruptcy.
in march,berger was indicted for counts of bank and securities fraud including conspiracy,loan fraud,falsification of corporate books and records,making false statements to accountants of a publicly traded company,and making false statements in reports filed with the sec.berger went to trial and was convicted on twelve of those counts.in september,the district court,believing controlling authority prohibited it from applying any sentencing facts not found by the jury,calculated an applicable sentencing range of zero to six months and sentenced berger to six months imprisonment.the district court also ordered berger to pay restitution of million and a million fine.berger appealed his conviction and restitution order,and the government the sentence.
we affirmed the conviction and the restitution amount.however,we vacated berger sentence and remanded to the district court for resentencing in light of united states booker,d.on remand,using a preponderance of the evidence standard,the district court found several facts that significantly increased berger sentencing range among other things,the district court found that berger fraud caused a loss of million to the various banks with which craig did business,thereby triggering a enhancement under.
to determine the loss to shareholders,the court adopted one of the government suggested calculation methods,the modified market capitalization theory,comparing the change in stock value of other,unaffiliated companies after accounting irregularities in those companies records were disclosed to the market.the court determined that the average depreciation of those selected companies stock was and applied that figure to the value of craig initial public offering although in craig case,the fraud was never disclosed to the market before trading was halted.the court calculated the resulting shareholder loss at million.
therefore,the total calculated loss was million,which triggered a sentencing enhancement,from level sixteen to thirty.this enhancement increased the applicable sentencing range from months to months.the district court imposed a sentence.berger appeals the sentence,arguing that the district court committed two significant legal errors in calculating the applicable sentencing range.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we review de novo the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines,united states kimbrew,cir,which are relevant to this case because the guidelines address the permissible methods for loss calculation.we review for abuse of discretion the district court application of the guidelines to the facts of this case id.if the district court makes a material miscalculation in the advisory guidelines range,we must vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.united states zolp,cir.whether the district court violated due process by using an improper standard of proof is a question of constitutional law that we review de novo.united states johansson,cir.
discussion 
berger raises two issues on appeal.first,he argues that in calculating loss in securities fraud cases,district courts must employ the civil securities fraud loss causation approach as described in dura pharmaceuticals,d,and that the district court erred by not doing so here.he also contends that the district court erred in finding facts resulting in a significant sentencing enhancement by a preponderance of the than a clear and convincing of proof.
loss causation principles applied to criminal securities fraud 
berger first argues that the district court erred by including losses in its million shareholder loss figure that did not actually occur,or that were not caused by his fraudulent conduct.
civil securities fraud standard 
the supreme court has ruled that to sustain a damages claim for civil securities fraud under b and,a plaintiff must show that the fraud was publicly revealed and that the disclosure caused the shareholders to suffer loss.dura,at.finding that plaintiff must show that share price fell significantly after the truth of the fraud became known.in so holding,the dura pharmaceuticals court rejected the notion that stock overvaluation resulting from may form the basis for a plaintiff damages award in a private securities action.id.at.in other words,a shareholder allegation that he was led to buy stock at a price that was artificially inflated due to fraud does not state a claim for loss.id.noting that while one might say that the inflated purchase price suggests that the misrepresentation touches upon a later economic loss that is insufficient because t o touch upon a loss is not to cause a loss internal citations omitted citing b.as a result,it is now clear in civil securities fraud actions that the complaint must allege that the practices that the plaintiff contends are fraudulent were revealed to the market and caused the resulting losses.metzler inv.gmbh corinthian,cir.
application of civil rule to criminal securities fraud 
the supreme court has not applied its dura pharmaceuticals loss causation principle to sentencing enhancements in criminal securities fraud cases,but two federal circuit courts have suggested that they are applicable in this context.in united states olis,the fifth circuit intimated that the civil loss causation principle described in dura pharmaceuticals should inform criminal securities fraud sentencing.see olis,cir the civil damage measure should be the backdrop for criminal responsibility both because it furnishes the standard of compensable injury for securities fraud victims and because it is attuned to stock market complexities.citing dura,d.olis cited several cases,including various cook the books scenarios,and noted with approval that each case takes seriously the requirement to correlate the defendant sentence with the actual loss caused in the marketplace,exclusive of other sources of stock price decline.id.at.
and in united states rutkoske,the second circuit endorsed the application of dura pharmaceuticals principle to criminal sentencing even more strongly,stating that 
t he government contends that the principles set forth in dura pharmaceuticals,a civil case,should not apply to loss calculation in a criminal case.the dicta in our decision in united states ebbers,cir strongly undermines that position.moreover,we see no reason why considerations relevant to loss causation in a civil fraud case should not apply,at least as strongly,to a sentencing regime in which the amount of loss caused by a fraud is a critical determinant of the length of a defendant sentence.
this court has not applied dura pharmaceuticals strict loss causation standard to criminal fraud cases,but we have endorsed a more general loss causation principle,permitting a district court to impose sentencing enhancements only for losses that resulted from the defendant fraud.united states hicks,cir.in hicks,we stated that t he guidelines relevant conduct provision requires a defendant sentence to be based on all harm that resulted from the acts or omissions of the defendant.id.quoting a id.at holding that government must show both and proximate causation in establishing loss berger now urges us to take the next step and follow the second circuit in expressly applying dura pharmaceuticals civil principle to criminal securities fraud sentencing.
we decline to do so for two reasons.first,we believe that the primary policy rationale of dura pharmaceuticals for proscribing overvaluation as a valid measure of loss does not apply in a criminal sanctions context.second,application of dura pharmaceuticals civil rule to criminal sentencing would clash with the parallel principles in the sentencing guidelines,which have persuasive value in federal courts.see united states staten,cir holding that failure to consider guidelines note in applying sentencing enhancement was reversible error.
as noted,dura pharmaceuticals rejected the notion that an allegation by a private plaintiff that he purchased securities that were overvalued because of fraud is sufficient to state a damages claim for civil securities fraud.at.reversing broudo dura,cir.a key component of the court holding was that as a matter of pure logic,at the moment the transaction takes place,the plaintiff has suffered no loss the inflated purchase payment is offset by ownership of a share that at that instant possesses equivalent value.id.because s hares are normally purchased with an eye toward a later sale,if,say,the purchaser sells the shares quickly before the relevant truth begins to leak out,the misrepresentation will not have led to any loss.id.moreover,the court reasoned,the common law has long insisted that a plaintiff in such a case show not only that had he known the truth he would not have acted but also that he suffered actual economic loss.id.at.citing,pasley freeman,eng.thus,the court was concerned principally with the plaintiff ability to show that he suffered actual loss caused the defendant fraudulent misrepresentation.
the dura pharmaceuticals court concern is not implicated in the criminal sentencing arena.as demonstrated,in a private civil fraud action,a court gauges loss from the perspective of the,whether the plaintiff can show the amount and cause of loss he sustained.id.because a civil plaintiff bears the burden to show loss,it is logical to require that the plaintiff show that any loss he sustained was attributable directly to devaluation caused by revelation of the defendant fraud.it likewise follows that a plaintiff mere allegation that he purchased overvalued stock is insufficient to state a claim,because the allegation does not by itself establish that the plaintiff personally incurred loss commensurate with the overvaluation.
in criminal sentencing,however,a court gauges the amount of loss caused,the harm that society as a whole suffered from the defendant fraud.see,zolp,at.whether and to what extent a particular individual suffered actual loss is not usually an important consideration in criminal fraud sentencing.therefore,where the value of securities have been inflated by a defendant fraud,the defendant may have caused aggregate loss to society in the amount of the overvaluation,even if various individual victims respective losses can not be precisely determined or linked to the fraud.as a result,the principle underlying the dura pharmaceuticals court reluctance to allow mere overvaluation as a basis for establishing loss is generally not present in the criminal sentencing context,and we are not persuaded that it would be appropriate to expand the dura pharmaceuticals rule to the criminal sentencing context 
the sentencing guidelines provide further support for limiting the scope of dura pharmaceuticals loss causation rule in a criminal sentencing context.in arguing for this interpretation,the government cites the commentary to the guidelines the version applied at berger sentencing,specifically its endorsement of a flexible approach to loss calculation in criminal sentencing,zolp,at.the government notes that commentary note of the guidelines states that 
the court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss,given the available information.this estimate,for example,may be based on the approximate number of victims and an estimate of the average loss to each victim,or on more general factors,such as the nature and duration of the fraud and the revenues generated by similar operation.the offender gain from committing the fraud is an alternative estimate that ordinarily will underestimate the loss 
in addition,the government contends that condones measuring loss by overvaluation.see,cmt.a.that note states 
a fraud may involve the misrepresentation of the value of an item that does have some value in contrast to an item that is worthless.where,for example,a defendant fraudulently represents that stock is worth and the stock is worth only,the loss is the amount by which the stock was overvalued.
thus,were dura pharmaceuticals loss causation rule applied to criminal sentencing enhancements,that principle plain rejection of the overvaluation loss measurement method,see at,would collide with congress clear endorsement of that method,see,cmt.a.
for these reasons,we decline to require,in finding facts relevant to sentencing,a showing that share price fell significantly after the truth became known.dura,at.we instead reiterate our broader rule that t he guidelines relevant conduct provision requires a defendant sentence to be based on all harm that resulted from the acts or omissions of the defendant.hicks,at quoting a.
c.the district court loss valuation approach 
while the district court was not required to follow dura pharmaceuticals loss causation approach,the method it did employ troubles us it leaves us with little confidence that the government demonstrated,by
