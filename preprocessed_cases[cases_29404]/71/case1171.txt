in this civil enforcement action,the securities and exchange commission commission or sec charged that jon marple marple and grateful internet associates,llc grateful violated section b of the securities exchange act of b,b commission rule rule,and section a of the securities act of a,a,in relation to material misstatements and omissions contained within a public company periodic financial reports filed with the commission.marple,who was a consultant to the public company,drafted the relevant filings on the company behalf and otherwise played a significant role within the company.finding that marple and grateful could be treated as primary violators of the securities laws based on the contents of the filings which marple drafted,the district court granted summary judgment to the commission on each cause of action pursued.
defendants appeal that decision,principally arguing that they can not be held liable under the securities antifraud statutes because the commission failed to show that marple,rather than the public company itself,made the material misstatements and omissions.we disagree and hold that when a consultant causes misstatements or omissions within periodic financial reports submitted to the commission,knowing that those misstatements or omissions will reach investors,he can be held primarily liable under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.exercising jurisdiction under,we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
before delving into the specific,complicated facts of this case,we set forth a brief overview of the broader fraud alleged by the sec against the various defendants named below.in,oil and gas properties,a public company,entered into an agreement with sukumo limited sukumo related to the sale of newly issued stock the parties agreed that sukumo would purchase up to million shares of stock,but only as it was able to sell such shares to overseas investors although sukumo ostensibly acted only as an intermediary in the sale of these new shares,the parties contracted to allow sukumo,rather than,to retain the vast majority of the proceeds generated from sukumo sales of the stock to overseas investors.under the agreement,only of the money raised by sukumo was actually designated for payment to sukumo pocketed a full,and the remaining was paid to allen wolfson and his son david,who brokered the original deal between sukumo and.
marple connection to this scheme arises out of his relationship to.as a consultant,he drafted periodic financial reports on behalf of,which were ultimately filed with the commission during the time sukumo was selling stock.those reports failed to,among other things,appropriately disclose the nature of agreement with sukumo and the relevant distribution of proceeds between the various parties.
from to,marple worked as a consultant to.jon marple,marple father marple,served as chief executive officer,and mary blake,marple stepmother,served as the company chief financial officer marple signed a formal agreement with in february,in which he contracted to provide various consulting services consulting agreement.two of these services are relevant to the instant appeal.first,marple agreed to present with any strategic partnerships,acquisition candidates or other business opportunities within of sic interest to of which he became aware.second,marple agreed to provide,where requested,assistance in the preparation of filings with the commission and in compiling,preparing and consolidating the financial statements of for quarterly and annual reports.marple had prior experience preparing filings for the commission,having served as president of an otcbb company and as a consultant to other otcbb companies under the agreement,marple would be compensated for these services by a combination of salary,stock,and stock options.in addition,if closed on any business opportunity that marple brought to its attention,he would receive a finder fee equal to of that opportunity value.
as part of his consulting duties,marple introduced his father,marple,to allen wolfson in early.at the time of the introduction,wolfson was associated with sukumo,an offshore boiler room operation wolfson orchestrated a contract between and sukumo,whereby agreed to sell sukumo up to million shares of stock.sukumo was,however,under no obligation to purchase any or all of the shares contemplated by the agreement,and sukumo primary objective was to sell as many of the shares as possible to overseas investors at full bid price.
in accordance with the parties arrangement,sukumo retained of the proceeds from its sales of stock and remitted the remaining to an escrow account designated by the parties.wolfson and several entities controlled by him and his son david the wolfson entities,contracted to receive of the total sale proceeds,which were to be paid from the escrow account.would receive the remaining of the proceeds.but because he had introduced wolfson to,marple was entitled to a finder fee under the consulting agreement,and paid marple of its portion of the proceeds or of the total sale price through his company grateful.thereby retained only of the total sales price as new capital.
sukumo began selling stock to investors in the united kingdom,australia,and new zealand in late january or early february.from that time until september,when sales ceased,received approximately from the offerings,and marple,through grateful,received approximately sukumo made million from the sale of stock over this same period.
given its impact on financial affairs,was required to disclose the arrangement with sukumo in its periodic financial reports.at request and in accordance with the consulting agreement,marple prepared draft versions of two such filings,which together form the gravamen of the commission complaint against him and grateful.first,marple drafted quarterly filing for the three months ending on december,as well as the balance sheet contained within that filing.second,he prepared the draft of annual commission filing for.
with respect to the,independent auditors reviewed marple draft,and marple,and blake certified the form accuracy in their respective capacities as ceo and cfo.counsel,however,did not review the form,and according to marple,and blake,they did not make any changes to the portions of the filing describing the sukumo arrangement.the final version of the disclosed that had issued million shares of stock to sukumo and that would receive approximately of its bid price per share.it did not,however,disclose that sukumo would keep of the proceeds on the stock sales or that sukumo was under no obligation to purchase any of the million shares.the filing further failed to reveal that of the offering proceeds went to the wolfson entities and another was paid to grateful.in other words,although the made it appear that would receive payment for the shares purchased by sukumo,in fact,sukumo,wolfson,and grateful were to receive of the proceeds from the boiler room sales.
at request,marple also drafted for the fiscal year ending march.that filing discussed the sukumo arrangement and included some of the information that was omitted from the prior.for example,the disclosed that the wolfson entities received of the proceeds from sukumo sales of stock,and that marple received a finder fee.it did not,however,disclose that sukumo was under no obligation to purchase any stock,despite the fact that marple had agreed with independent auditors to present that information in the filing the draft was again certified as accurate by ceo and cfo prior to filing with the commission.
at the time he prepared the prior to the filing date of the was aware of sukumo sales of stock to overseas investors.as early as january,he was the primary recipient of emails from the designated escrow agent detailing the distribution of funds received by sukumo from its sales of stock.
in addition to preparing the company financial statements and related sec filings,marple took on other responsibilities at.for example,marple assisted in the company bookkeeping and prepared draft press releases and corporate resolutions,which marple,and blake would review and approve.he further participated in the analysis of potential oil and gas investments,despite having no prior experience in the oil and gas industry.after marple,suffered a massive heart attack in november,marple also stepped into his father role and negotiated with several noteholders to either settle or restructure their ventures with.
once it learned of sukumo offshore operation,the commission division of enforcement launched an investigation into sukumo and wolfson.that investigation ultimately led the commission to and several other companies,and on october,the commission brought a civil enforcement action against numerous defendants,including marple and grateful in its complaint,the commission alleged that marple and grateful committed fraud in violation b and rule employed a device,scheme,or artifice to defraud in violation of a and committed fraud in the offer and sale of securities in violation of a and 
following discovery,the commission and marple filed a joint stipulation of facts with the district court,which generally included the facts recounted above.thereafter,on april,the commission moved for summary judgment against marple and grateful on each cause of action,relying principally on the stipulated facts.marple responded with his own motion for summary judgment a month later,arguing that neither he nor grateful could be held liable,as a matter of law,for the alleged violations of the federal securities laws.in august,with the for summary judgment pending before the district court,marple and grateful also filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,or in the alternative,a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.
in november,the district court granted the commission motion for summary judgment and denied marple motions for summary judgment and for judgment on the pleadings.as to the merits of the commission claims,the court concluded that the undisputed facts establish that marple and grateful knowingly committed fraud in connection with the offer,purchase,or sale of stock.it found that marple had prepared drafts of filings with the commission and that these filings contained untrue statements or omitted material facts with regard to agreements with sukumo,the wolfson entities,and marple.it further found that marple himself made the relevant untrue statements and omissions,and that he did so knowingly and in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.the district court thus determined that marple and grateful were liable for misstatements and omissions under b,rule,and a.in light of its conclusion that the commission was entitled to summary judgment,the district court also concluded that marple motion for judgment on the pleadings was moot.
as a result of these violations,the court entered a permanent injunction against marple and grateful,barring them from future violations of b,rule,and a.it also ordered defendants to disgorge in gains,to pay prejudgment interest in the amount of,and to pay a civil penalty of.this timely appeal followed.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.sec cochran,cir.viewing the evidence,as well as all reasonable inferences derived therefrom,in the light most favorable to defendants,we must ascertain whether there is any genuine issue of material fact and whether the commission is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c sec pros int l,cir.
marple and grateful do not dispute any of the relevant material facts.rather,they argue that under these facts,they can not be held primarily liable under b and rule because they did not directly or indirectly engage in any manipulative or deceptive acts.specifically,they claim that the commission showed only that made the material misstatements or omissions,not that they as individuals made such misstatements or omissions.marple and grateful were,according to their theory,mere secondary actors subject at most to liability as aidors and abettors.alternatively,they argue that,even if they were responsible for the misstatements or omissions in and,those misstatements or omissions lacked the requisite nexus to any securities transactions.in other words,they urge that the sec failed to prove that the misstatements or omissions occurred in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,as required by b,or in the offer or sale of securities,as mandated by a.finally,as to the claim pursued under a,defendants maintain that the commission failed to show that they obtain ed money or property by means of a material misstatement or omission because the commission failed to show that defendants made any such statement or omission.as we will explain,each of these arguments lacks merit.
we begin with the question of primary liability under b and rule.under b,congress has made it 
unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails,or of any facility of any national securities exchange b to use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
b.acting in accordance with its authority under this statute,the commission has promulgated rule,which makes it 
unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,
a to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,
b to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading,or 
c to engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
emphasis added.in an sec enforcement action such as this one,based on alleged misstatements or omissions contained in public filings,a defendant is liable under b if the commission establishes that he made a misrepresentation or omission of material fact,with scienter,in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,and by virtue of the requisite jurisdictional means.see geman sec,cir.unlike private litigants proceeding under b,t he sec is not required to prove reliance or injury in enforcement actions.id.at.
section a requires substantially similar proof.see sec first jersey,cir.under that statute,it is 
unlawful for any person in the offer or sale of any securities by the use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or by use of the mails,directly or indirectly 
to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,or 
to obtain money or property by means of any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading or 
to engage in any transaction,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser.
a.the principal difference between a and b lies in the element of scienter,which the sec must establish under a,but not under a or a aaron sec,d.by contrast,b always requires a showing of scienter.
the purpose of both b and a is protection of investors from fraudulent practices.sec int l chem.dev,cir.in cases of alleged misstatements in public filings submitted to the commission,the scope of the two sections is essentially coextensive because the fraudulent conduct touches upon both purchases and sales of securities.see,sec power,d.we address defendants arguments against primary liability under both b and a together because their contentions under those statutes are essentially the same neither marple nor grateful can be held liable for securities fraud because it was,rather than themselves,that made actionable misstatements or omissions.
at issue in this appeal are only the first and fourth elements of the antifraud statutes.we therefore consider only whether defendants made the relevant misrepresentations or omissions,and whether those misrepresentations or omissions had the required nexus to a securities transaction.
the modern concept of primary liability for violations of the federal antifraud securities well as the debate surrounding be traced back to the supreme court decision in central bank of denver,first interstate bank of denver,d.there,the court held that private civil liability under b did not extend to those who merely aid and abet the commission of a manipulative or deceptive act,or the making of a material misstatement or omission,in connection with the purchase or sale of securities id.at.instead,liability under b was limited in its reach to only the making of a material misstatement or omission or the commission of a manipulative act.id.at.in foreclosing liability for aidors and abettors under b,the court hewed to the statutory text.it reasoned that because the text did not reach aidors and abettors,private litigants could not pursue such a cause of action under the auspices of the statute.id.the court emphasized,however,that primary liability could reach secondary actors,such as accountants,lawyers,or bankers,in certain cases 
the absence of b aiding and abetting liability does not mean that secondary actors in the securities markets are always free from liability under the securities acts.any person or entity,including a lawyer,accountant,or bank,who employs a manipulative device or makes a material misstatement or omission on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable as a primary violator under,assuming all of the requirements for primary liability under rule are met.
id.at.in other words,the court recognized that secondary actors could be held liable under the statute so long as they themselves made a material misstatement or omission or committed some other fraudulent act,and each of the remaining elements of liability under b are satisfied.see also anixter prod,cir.
recognizing the dichotomy between primary liability and aiding and abetting liability created by central bank,the commission alleges that marple and grateful are primary violators of b.thus,the question we confront today is whether the acts committed by marple and grateful are sufficient to show that they made the material misstatements and omissions contained within sec filings,such that they can be held primarily liable.
we previously faced a similar question in anixter,one of the first circuit court decisions to grapple with the impact of central bank in the context of a private,as opposed to public,securities lawsuit in anixter,we considered whether a secondary actor,an accountant,could be held primarily liable under b for his participation in preparing several documents disseminated to the public.those documents,including registration statements filed with the commission,program books,prospectuses,and certifications and opinion letters,all falsely verified his client financial.id.at.we concluded,in accordance with central bank,that the accountant could be held liable for a primary violation of b under those facts.id.at.we held that in order for accountants to be primarily liable under b,they must themselves make a false or misleading statement or omission that they know or should know will reach potential investors.id.at.we reasoned that because the accountant,as the company auditor,had prepared many of the offending documents,and because he knew or should have known that the documents would reach investors who would in turn rely upon them,a jury could deem him a primary violator of the antifraud provisions at issue.id.at.
but our holding in anixter has not been universally adopted.several other federal courts have embraced distinct tests for determining whether a secondary actor,such as marple,can be held primarily liable in the wake of central bank.because the parties refer us to these other tests for judging primary liability,we briefly set forth two tests that are relevant to our analysis today.
first,at least two circuits have adopted the inquiry largely similar to the one adopted by this court in anixter,except that it includes an additional element.under the test,a secondary actor is primarily liable for securities fraud if the actor makes a material misrepresentation or omission,and the relevant misrepresentation is attributed to the secondary actor at the time it is disseminated to investors.see,ziemba cascade int l,cir wright ernst young,llp,cir.attribution is required under this theory because a plaintiff in a private securities action must prove reliance on the misrepresentations or omissions at issue.see wright,at reasoning that without an attribution requirement,the court would be forced to circumvent the reliance requirements of the act,as r eliance only on misrepresentations made by others can not itself form the basis of liability quoting anixter,at 
in contrast with the theory of primary liability,at least one circuit has adopted the substantial participation test.under this inquiry,a secondary actor can be held liable as a primary violator of b if the actor substantially participates or is intricately involved in making the material misstatement or omission.see,in re software toolworks.sec,cir holding accountants primarily liable under b as a result of their significant role in drafting and editing letters sent to the commission see also howard everex,cir w e have held that substantial participation or intricate involvement in the preparation of fraudulent statements is grounds for primary liability even though that participation might not lead to the actor actual making of the statements.we explicitly rejected the substantial participation test in anixter as inconsistent with the supreme court holding in central bank.see anixter,at to the extent these cases allow liability to attach without requiring a representation to be made by defendant,and reformulate the substantial assistance element of aiding and abetting liability into primary liability,they do not comport with central bank of denver.
according to marple and grateful,we should extend the test from the realm of private securities litigation to sec enforcement actions.because any misstatements or omissions in and were not specifically attributed to marple,defendants argue that they can not be held liable under b and a.under this theory of the case,because the filings were attributed to,it is the only actor who may be held liable.because this argument fails to accord with applicable precedent as well as the logical underpinnings of the test attribution requirement,we reject it.
to begin with,defendants argument is without support in the caselaw of this circuit.we have never adopted an attribution requirement in a private securities case,let alone in a commission enforcement action.more to the point,the attribution requirement of the test stems directly from the need for private litigants to prove reliance on an alleged fraud to succeed on a private cause of action.see wright,at a secondary actor can not incur primary liability under the act for a statement not attributed to that actor at the time of its dissemination.such a holding would circumvent the reliance requirements of the act.requiring the government to prove attribution in a public enforcement action thus directly conflicts with our jurisprudence recognizing that the sec need not plead and prove reliance in a b case.see geman,at.thus,given the unambiguous connection between reliance and attribution,and the fact that the sec need not prove reliance,we decline to impose an attribution element in an sec enforcement action see sec collins aikman,d,sec kpmg,llp,d,but see sec lucent,d,extending the test to an sec enforcement action because it more clearly delineates which types of behavior will give rise to primary liability versus secondary liability.
given our conclusion that the sec need not establish attribution in an enforcement action under either b or a,the mere fact that the misstatements and omissions present in and were not publicly attributable to marple does not mean that marple and grateful can not be held primarily liable.we must instead decide whether defendants made the misstatements or omissions at issue,notwithstanding the lack of attribution.on this score,we find a recent opinion of the seventh circuit,as well as several similar decisions from the southern district of new york,persuasive.
in mcconville sec,cir,the seventh circuit reviewed the commission administrative determination that the former chief financial officer of a company was liable under rule.there,the company failed to disclose the substantial impairment of its accounts receivable in its filing with the commission,and it was shown that the chief financial officer was involved in preparing the filing.id.at.according to the court,the relevant question in determining the cfo liability was whether she caused the company to make material misstatements to the investing public.id.at emphasis added.because the defendant had drafted and reviewed the core financial statement that overestimated the company profits,reviewed and approved a draft of the that consisted of the inaccurate core financial statements,and represented that the financial statements were accurate to the company independent auditor,she could properly be held liable under b for false statements present in the filing.id.at.
similarly,in kpmg,a district court considered whether the engagement partners of an independent auditing firm made misstatements contained within an audit opinion issued in the name of their firm,such that primary liability could attach.d at.like the seventh circuit,the district court held that so long as the sec is able to show that the defendant s were sufficiently responsible for the effect,caused the statement to be knew or had reason to know that the statement would be disseminated to investors,they could be held primarily liable under b and a.id.at emphasis added.it then reasoned that in light of the engagement partners central role in preparing the audit opinions and their authority to issue those opinions,primary liability under b and a was proper.id.at see also sec power,d,collins aikman,d at.
like the defendants in kpmg and mcconville,marple played an integral role in preparing those filings that contained the misstatements and omissions at issue here.not only did he prepare the drafts of both the and,the draft of the the more misleading of the two filings was not modified by either ceo or cfo,at least insofar as the sukumo arrangement was portrayed.it was filed as marple drafted it.additionally,hired marple for the very purpose of preparing the relevant sec filings,based on his prior financial reporting experience,and he well knew that those documents would be distributed to the public and available to investors.that the filings were issued in name,and that marple himself did not sign,certify,or physically file the documents,is not dispositive.the relevant question is only whether he can fairly be said to have caused to make the relevant statements,and whether he knew or should have known that the statements would reach investors.see mcconville,at see also anixter,at there is no requirement that the alleged violator directly communicate misrepresentations to plaintiffs for primary liability to attach.under the facts discussed,this standard was satisfied.we thus hold that because marple caused the misstatements and omissions to be made,and knew that the statements were calculated to reach investors,defendants can properly be held liable under b and a for those misstatements and omissions see mcconville,at power,d at collins aikman,d at kpmg,d at.
defendants next contend that they can not be held liable under b because there is no evidence that the fraud was committed in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.b.similarly,they argue that the sec failed to present any evidence that the fraud was perpetrated in the offer or sale of any securities,as required by a.a.they essentially urge that the relevant evidence points toward sukumo and david wolfson committing a fraud on investors in relation to the sale of stock,but that filings had no effect on investors decisions to transact in stock.again,we are not persuaded by their reasoning.
the supreme court has consistently embraced an expansive reading of b in connection with requirement.most recently,in merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,dabit,d,the court recognized that it has espoused a broad interpretation of this element of b liability,and stated that it is enough that the fraud alleged coincide with a securities transaction.id.at.see also zandford,at.in its role enforcing the act,the sec has consistently adopted a broad reading of the phrase in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.the court has also indicated that the statute should be construed not technically and restrictively,but flexibly to effectuate its remedial purposes.zandford,at.quotation omitted.in this circuit,we have held that this element requires only that there be a causal connection between the allegedly deceptive act or omission and the alleged injury.arst stifel,nicolaus,cir citations omitted.nevertheless,we have not yet had occasion to address how the in connection with element applies when the allegations of fraud stem from misrepresentations contained within documents publicly available to investors.
in this context,several of our sister circuits have recognized that w here the fraud alleged involves public dissemination in a document such as a press release,annual report,investment prospectus or other such document on which an investor would presumably rely,the in connection with requirement is generally met by proof of the means of dissemination and the materiality of the misrepresentation or omission.sec rana research,cir see also semerenko cendant,cir sec savoy,sec texas gulf sulphur,cir en banc.these courts reason that because such documents are designed to reach investors and to influence their decisions to transact in a security,any misrepresentations contained within the documents are made in connection with the purchase or sale of that security.see,texas gulf sulphur,at mcgann ernst young,cir.
in such cases,the sec need only show that the documents are reasonably calculated to influence investors,and that the misrepresentations are material to an investor decision to buy or sell the security.see rana research,at.a misstatement or omission is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider the information significant when making an investment decision.basic levinson,d.because this interpretation of the in connection with element is consistent with the supreme court relatively broad construction and our circuit own requirement that there be a causal connection between the fraud and the injury,we join those circuits that have adopted this analysis.see also united int l holdings,wharf holdings,cir holding that misrepresentations made to induce a party to purchase a security or to influence an investment decision are made in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.
turning to the record before us,we conclude that the alleged misrepresentations and omissions contained within the and filed by are statements made in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.first,these documents,like all periodic financial reports filed with the commission,were plainly designed to reach investors.as a consultant experienced in preparing sec filings,marple very well knew that the statements contained in the and would be communicated to all,they were public documents meant to provide investors with a periodic report on financial affairs.second,the filings were unquestionably material to investors decisions to transact in stock.a potential investor,weighing the decision to purchase a particular security,would have considered the amount of capital that would receive,as well the distribution of proceeds amongst the participating entities,significant to making an informed investment decision related to stock.the information omitted from the the investors from fully appreciating that the bulk of the proceeds from sukumo sales of stock would go to entities other than,or understanding what suk
