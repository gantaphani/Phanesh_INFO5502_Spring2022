stephen horning,the former president and director of rocky mountain securities investments,petitions for review of an order of the securities and exchange commission sec.the commission found that horning failed to exercise reasonable supervision over two employees who violated the securities laws,and that he caused his firm to commit numerous statutory and regulatory violations.the commission permanently barred horning from associating with any broker or dealer in a supervisory capacity and suspended him for twelve months from associating with any broker or dealer in any capacity.horning contends that these sanctions were arbitrary and capricious,that he was denied due process in his administrative hearing,and that a provision of the securities investor protection act of under which he was sanctioned is unconstitutionally vague.because we conclude that the commission order was reasonable and supported by substantial evidence,and because horning other challenges are without merit,we deny the petition.
in,horning founded rocky mountain as a firm in denver,colorado.by the turn of the century,rocky mountain had grown into a,with approximately fifty registered representatives and more than customer accounts.from to,horning served as president,director,financial and operations principal,compliance officer,and registered representative at rocky mountain.he was also the largest equity owner,holding nearly of the shares at the time the firm closed.
horning exercised substantial control over virtually every aspect of rocky mountain.he managed the firm,set policy,and oversaw daily operations.he had authority to hire and fire employees.he bore primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with the sec net capital,customer reserve,and reporting requirements.he established the firm supervisory procedures and oversaw their implementation,and he alone supervised the operations and trading departments.
the first unmistakable sign that something was amiss at rocky mountain appeared in early,when a routine sec staff examination revealed that,from may to february,the firm head trader,judy clarke,had failed to document trades as required and the firm had suffered over in unreported losses.each time clarke bought and sold stocks in rocky mountain accounts and executed trades on behalf of its customers,she was supposed to chronicle the transaction on a trade ticket and submit it to horning for approval and to the accounting department for recordkeeping.the examination disclosed that clarke had ignored these procedures for more than in purchases.two other rocky mountain andrade,the head of operations,and tammy steffen,the assistant director of about clarke unrecorded trades but did not tell horning.andrade was responsible for keeping the firm books and records,working with its auditor,and preparing the financial and operational combined uniform single reports focus reports that must file regularly with the sec.see.andrade reported to steffen until the latter left the firm in the spring of from that time on,both andrade and clarke reported exclusively to horning.
in march,following the staff examination,the sec central regional office sent horning,in his capacity as president of rocky mountain,a deficiency letter outlining numerous concerns that required immediate corrective action or response,without regard to any other actions that the commission may take or require to be taken as a result of the examination.among other material deficiencies,the letter stated that rocky mountain had failed to calculate properly its net capital and customer reserves maintain accurate records of its assets and liabilities file accurate net capital computations in its annual audit reports and establish and employ adequate supervisory procedures for the preparation of its financial statements.in light of these failures,the letter indicated,rocky mountain had violated the federal securities laws.
the deficiency letter also pointed to troubling language in the annual evaluations prepared by rocky mountain auditor,mortland,a company run by horning college friend,herbert mortland.every year since the early,mortland reports had highlighted weaknesses in rocky mountain internal controls and warned that they result in more than a relatively low risk that errors or irregularities in amounts that would be material may occur and not be detected within a timely period.the deficiency letter advised that,notwithstanding these warnings,mortland audits had been inadequate in scope to detect the firm many net capital and reserve requirement failings.this,too,violated sec rules.
horning responded to the deficiency letter approximately one month later.his brief missive to the sec struck a defiant tone.in response to the alleged violations regarding the rules discussed in the deficiency letter,horning began,we can only say,that,after years in business,we are obviously aware of the above referenced rules and how such things as firm related trading errors,improperly classified securities positions,and the resultant inaccurate clearing account reconciliations can impact all of them in a negative way.horning continued 
the only comment that we would like to make at this time is that these items certainly did not go undetected,as you say in your letter,and also that we would disagree with your statement that we do not have adequate written supervisory procedures to detect any inaccuracies in our clearing account reconciliations.in reality,the exact opposite was and is true.
id.the letter concluded by assuring the sec that t he people at rocky mountain responsible for these actions have been spoken to and dealt with,and that t he deficiencies and concerns addressed in your letter have all been remedied.id.at.
horning did take some remedial measures in response to the deficiency letter.for example,he reduced the percentage return that clarke received on profitable trades.and he instructed andrade to prepare daily reconciliation reports documenting that all executed trades were properly recorded and balanced in rocky mountain books,along with daily trade error reports documenting any trading irregularities or unreconciled trades that had occurred.
for the most part,however,horning preserved the operational status quo.although he later testified that the conduct of andrade and clarke had been b asically dishonest,he declined to fire them,fine them,or restrict their activities.clarke continued to execute trades in the firm proprietary account at her discretion,just as before.andrade continued to manage all of the firm books and records,just as before.horning did not establish any procedures to monitor clarke trading or to check the accuracy of andrade recordkeeping.nor did he put in place any kind of operations manual.similarly,although horning testified that he was very angry at mortland for failing to identify the problems flagged in the deficiency letter and that mortland was partially at fault,id.at,horning declined to fire mortland or to demand new procedures for his subsequent audits.and he continued to take no action in response to mortland warnings about inadequate internal controls.
moreover,horning implementation of those supervisory procedures that did exist was often perfunctory.horning testified that he spent only two minutes reviewing each focus report he signed,and that he reviewed the reconciliation reports one day a week,for just ten seconds.rocky mountain kept some customers funds in an omnibus money market account managed by a brokerage firm named reich tang services,which sent daily reports of transactions in the account.horning never checked whether the figures in andrade daily reports or the firm books matched the figures sent by reich tang.nor did he review executed trades,seek to verify the trade error reports,or inquire into whether the errors identified in the reports had been corrected.
this approach to supervision turned out to be a costly mistake,as andrade and clarke soon began to commit serious fraud.from april through january,the two conspired to conceal approximately million in losses that clarke accrued in unreported,unauthorized trading in rocky mountain accounts.they did this by entering fictitious profitable trades into the rocky mountain record system,omitting unprofitable trades,and then plundering million in customer funds from the reich tang account as well as a substantial amount of firm funds to pay for the losses.the firm books,records,and reports became increasingly unmoored from reality.for more than six months in,the reconciliation reports and financial statements prepared by andrade never matched the daily reports sent by reich tang.in the months immediately preceding january,rocky mountain records listed the reich tang account as having a value of greater than million,while the reich tang reports themselves showed that the account was in fact worth less than.
horning testified that he was entirely ignorant of this scheme until january,when rocky mountain bank informed him that the firm account was overdrawn.according to horning,no one at rocky mountain apart from andrade and clarke had noticed the discrepancy between the firm records and the reich tang reports.he further testified that,upon learning of andrade and clarke scheme,he immediately connected it to the basically dishonest activities revealed by the sec staff examination.i guess we back to,horning remarked to the two of them.
in february,the sec and the securities investor protection corporation sipc sued rocky mountain for violating provisions of the securities exchange act of,et exchange act.a trustee was appointed the firm was liquidated and sipc advanced more than million to the estate to compensate customers for their losses.andrade and clarke were ultimately convicted of wire fraud and sentenced to prison.
just days before rocky mountain ceased doing business,another college friend of horning,edward moloney,hired horning and other individuals associated with rocky mountain to join his,moloney securities.horning became a director and regional vice president of moloney securities.at the time the commission issued the decision challenged here,horning was responsible for supervising representatives,among them mark depew and buzz massee,who had also worked for horning at rocky mountain.
in february,horning learned that depew and massee had loaned clarke money the previous year without notifying him,and that clarke had repaid them in part with firm funds generated by fictitious trades.at his administrative hearing,horning acknowledged that depew and massee should have realized that some of those trades were fictitious because they were made at outlandish prices,and that the conduct of depew and massee in accepting clarke repayments without telling him had been p robably dishonest.although horning withheld from depew and massee the trading profits they had purportedly earned in january,he did not investigate their dealings with clarke or place them under any form of heightened supervision at moloney securities.
in january,the sec instituted proceedings against horning.an administrative law judge alj held a hearing for three days.horning own expert witness,larry hayden,testified that he was unaware of any other instance in which employees who caused an unauthorized loss to a andrade and clarke did in not been fired,that heightened supervision of andrade and clarke would probably have been appropriate after march,that reconciliation reports initialed by horning contained obvious mistakes,id.at and that it was improper for rocky mountain not to have a procedure in place to verify that the reich tang reports matched the firm internal records,id.at.hayden testimony on culminated in the following exchange regarding horning oversight of the reich tang account 
counsel for sec a nd yet you still conclude that horning supervision was reasonable is that right 
hayden it was reasonable when i wrote my report.
counsel for sec is it still reasonable today 
hayden i would alter my opinion in that regard.
counsel for sec and you agree,therefore,that the supervision was inadequate 
hayden i would agree,based on this information,that it probably was adequate.
section b of the exchange act authorizes the commission to sanction a person associated with a broker or dealer who has failed reasonably to supervise,with a view to preventing violations of the provisions of the securities laws and rules and regulations thereunder,another person who commits such a violation,if such other person is subject to his supervision.b e see id.b a.the alj found that andrade and clarke violated exchange act b and sec rule,and that horning failed reasonably to supervise andrade and clarke as required by exchange act b.stephen horning,initial decision release,docket,wl,hereinafter initial decision.
exchange act c requires that brokers and dealers observe sec rules prescribed to provide safeguards for the broker or dealer financial responsibility when effecting the purchase or sale of securities,c a section a provides that brokers and dealers must make and keep records and reports required by sec rules for the protection of investors,id.a and section e requires that brokers and dealers file annual statements certified by independent public accountants,id.e a.the alj found that rocky mountain violated sections c,a,and e,and sec rules thereunder,regarding net capital,customer reserve,and recordkeeping and reporting requirements.under exchange act a,a person can be found to have caused such violations if he was responsible for an act or omission that he knew or should have known would contribute to such violations.id.a.the alj determined that horning was a cause of rocky mountain violations pursuant to that provision.
finally,exchange act b specifically authorizes the commission to suspend for a period not exceeding months,or bar from being associated with a broker or dealer,a person who has failed reasonably to supervise another person as required by that section,if the commission finds that such sanction is in the public interest.b a,b e.section b of the securities investor protection act of sipa authorizes the commission to bar or suspend for any period any officer of any broker or dealer for which a trustee has been appointed from being associated with a broker or dealer if the commission determine s such bar or suspension to be in the public interest.id.b.pursuant to these sections,the alj permanently barred horning from associating with any broker or dealer in a supervisory capacity and suspended him for twelve months from associating with any broker or dealer in any capacity.however,the alj rejected the enforcement division recommendation of a civil penalty as unnecessary and punitive.
in the order now on review,the commission affirmed all of the alj key factual and legal findings and sustained her choice of sanctions.stephen horning,exchange act release,investor protection act release,docket,wl,hereinafter commission opinion.
horning challenges the commission order on three principal grounds that the sanctions it applied to him were arbitrary and capricious that the enforcement division change to its sanctions request violated his due process and statutory rights and that section b of sipa is unconstitutionally vague.we consider these challenges in turn.
an appellate court must uphold the commission findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence.a graham sec.we must uphold its other determinations unless they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a graham,at.and we may not disturb the commission choice of sanction unless it is either unwarranted in law or without justification in fact.wonsover sec,quoting butz glover livestock comm,d ellipsis in original.we therefore accord great deference to the sec remedial decisions.whx sec.
horning does not contest any of the commission relevant factual findings,its legal conclusion that he was a cause under exchange act a of rocky mountain various securities violations,or its legal authority to impose the sanctions it chose.nevertheless,he argues that the sec sanctions decision was arbitrary and capricious because the commission failed to address evidence of his character and experience,misconstrued the auditor annual reports and the sec deficiency letter,and impos
