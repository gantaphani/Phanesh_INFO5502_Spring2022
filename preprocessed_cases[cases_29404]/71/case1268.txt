this case revolves around the business dealings of steven bolla,robert radano,and their company,washington investment network win.win was,at relevant times,a registered investment advisor.bolla was not actually a legal owner of,radano and bolla wife were the the evidence indicates bolla was the principal figure directing win activities,and bolla wife played a relatively minor role.moreover,ownership of win had little practical significance.win had no capital assets it was essentially an empty shell radano and bolla used to do business under a corporate name.when money came into win,it was distributed to bolla,radano,and others with whom bolla and radano had agreements.according to the securities and exchange commission sec,bolla designated his wife as of win rather than himself,because bolla was under sec investigation.
radano and bolla business involved locating investors and referring them to lockwood financial services.lockwood is a administrator serving several money managers.lockwood acts as the intermediary between the money managers and investors.specifically,lockwood offers investors a service called a wrap account,which allows several investors to combine their funds to meet the high requirements of the money managers.lockwood administers these accounts,but to attract investors,it relies primarily on referrals from investment advisers like win.
according to lockwood business model,the investment adviser determines the individual investor specific investment priorities and directs the investor to the lockwood money managers best suited to the investor objectives.the investor then enters into a direct contractual relationship with lockwood,and lockwood begins paying fees to the investment adviser.fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the total assets the investor places in lockwood control,and they are deducted directly from the investor investment account.investment advisers are also obligated to remain in regular contact with the investor and to monitor the investor account,ensuring the investor portfolio remains consistent with his or her investment objectives.lockwood continues paying quarterly fees to the investment adviser from the investor account as long as the investor has assets under lockwood management.
bolla and radano received fees attributable to the assets each respectively had brought to lockwood,though it appears radano trusted bolla to make the division.over the course of several years,bolla channeled million in assets to lockwood,and by the summer of,he was receiving about per year in fees.radano had brought much less money to lockwood,and his arrangements with third parties were not as favorable to him.therefore,he received only about per year in fees.
bolla personally handled most of win financial affairs.for example,though win was listed as the investment adviser in lockwood records,when lockwood paid fees to win,it mailed the check to bolla,and bolla deposited the fees in an account under his exclusive control,opened under the name steve bolla dba washington investment network.bolla would then disburse funds from this personal account to pay radano his portion of the fees,with bolla making the determination unilaterally.bolla used the same account to pay many of his personal obligations including his mortgage and his wife credit card.
on march,bolla entered into a settlement with the sec in regard to the ongoing investigation,not related to win or radano he signed a consent to entry of a judgment against him.on june,the federal district court entered a judgment in that unrelated case,enjoining bolla from violating certain securities laws.the next day,the sec issued an order barring bolla from the investment advisory business.during the months leading up to this bar order,radano knew it was likely and did nothing to disassociate himself and win from bolla.
when the bar order issued in june of,radano learned of it almost immediately and contacted lockwood within a month or two to report the change in circumstances and to establish himself as the new recipient of win fee payments for both his own and bolla clients at win.radano apparently hoped to take over some if not all of bolla lucrative book of business,but because lockwood had bolla listed as the rep for all win accounts,it refused to accept radano as the new win representative without written letters of authorization from each individual investor.radano testified this impasse with lockwood came as a complete surprise to him.he expected lockwood to switch the win accounts to his name on the basis of a simple telephone call,and he thought little more was necessary to disassociate both himself and win from bolla.
radano got letters of authorization from his own clients,but he had a much harder time getting letters from bolla clients,in part because he lacked the necessary contact information.eventually he succeeded,at least with some of bolla clients,and he established himself as the rep for win accounts.because of the delay,lockwood continued to send win quarterly fee payments to bolla for at least two quarters after the june,bar order.bolla did not forward these fee payments unopened to radano,thereby distancing himself from win and the investment advisory business instead,bolla continued to manage win financial affairs,depositing the fee payments in his personal account,paying win expenses,and disbursing a portion of the fees to radano.in addition,bolla refused to transfer control over the bank account to radano,and he continued to give investment advice to win clients.
during this period,radano continued to consult bolla about win affairs.for example,radano sought bolla assistance in persuading lockwood to transfer the win accounts to radano control.in addition,when bolla clients continued to call bolla seeking investment advice,bolla contacted radano and in some cases gave instructions as to the needs of these clients.bolla characterized these contacts as merely a matter of handing off these calls to radano,but bolla also instructed radano about the payment of certain win expenses,instructions radano then followed.most important,when radano began receiving win fee payments from lockwood,he forwarded a portion of one of the fee payments roughly to bolla wife.this payment,which radano made eight months after the bar order,was exactly fifty percent of the investment adviser fees attributable to each of several clients during the previous quarter,many of whom were formerly bolla clients.radano characterized this payment as an appropriate payment of investment adviser fees to bolla wife who was herself an investment advisor,but he conceded she performed only clerical duties for win and had not previously received fee payments for her services.bolla did not suggest the payment was for services his wife had provided rather,he asserted it was a reimbursement to him for accumulated expenses he had incurred over several years,including moving expenses.bolla also said the payment was a fair cleaning up of what was owing to him i built a company i think that win owed me that.
during the months after the bar order,radano was evasive in some conversations with bolla clients,avoiding specific descriptions of bolla situation.radano did not always make clear the sec had barred bolla from the investment advisory business,instead making vague comments that bolla was no longer with win,was out of the business,or was going to pursue more of the insurance angle.when one of these clients specifically asked about the bar order having learned of it from an independent source,radano downplayed the significance of the order,saying it related to a bankrupt company in california and had nothing to do with win.
the sec brought this action against bolla,bolla wife,radano,and win,asserting bolla continued to act as an investment adviser after he was barred from the investment advisory business and did so in association with win and radano.bolla and his wife settled,and the matter proceeded to a bench trial against win and radano.the sec asserted win violated sections f,and of the act by allowing bolla to continue to associate with the firm and failing to disclose bolla bar,and it asserted radano aided and abetted those violations.section f of the act prohibits investment advisers from associating with parties they know to have been barred from the investment advisory business.f.sections and prohibit investment advisers from defraud ing any client or prospective client,id,or engag ing in any practice which operates as a fraud or deceit,id.
the district court made findings of fact substantially consistent with the summary of evidence related above however,the court expressly found radano testimony lacked credibility,and the court even found radano fabricated evidence in support of his claim he severed ties between win and bolla wife in july.the district court sustained the sec charges and issued an injunction barring win and radano from future violations of sections f,and of the act.it also imposed a penalty of against radano and against win.sec bolla,d.

appellants first argue win was not an investment adviser as that term is defined in section a of the act.as relevant here,section a defines i nvestment adviser as any person who,for compensation,engages in the business of advising others as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in,purchasing,or selling securities,or who,for compensation and as part of a regular business,issues or promulgates analyses or reports concerning securities.a.appellants contend win acted primarily as a referral service for lockwood,receiving what amounted to a finder fee,and they minimize any role win played in giving investment advice.this claim,however,is refuted by the evidence,including radano own testimony,which shows win had an obligation to advise new clients regarding various investment options and a continuing obligation to monitor each client investment account.for example,radano testified win continuing duties after a client had set up an account with lockwood included e nsuring that the integrity of the account remained,ensur ing that the account was still consistent with risk parameters,goals and objectives,and mak ing sure the account was on track and consistent.radano further testified the quarterly fee payments win received were in exchange for these ongoing account monitoring obligations.at his deposition,which the district court also considered in making its findings,radano specified that,if a client account ceased to be consistent with the client needs,c hanges would be made in terms of management,in terms of allocation between stock and bond.moreover,radano executed win march,application to the state of connecticut for an investment adviser registration.in that application,win stated it reviewed client statements monthly for accuracy and completed client profiles annually to allow account objectives to adjust to any changes in client goals or risk tolerances.win also stated its fee was f or overall portfolio management,portfolio allocation,manager selection and personalized account services.finally,win described its business as follows 
applicant offers advice to clients about other outside unaffil i ated investment advisors through a wrap account program.applicant develops a detailed investment profile about each client prior to manager selection.applicant advice to clients consists of asset allocation and assistance in the selection of investment managers for account assets applicant monitors all selected investment managers on an ongoing basis for investment returns,sector analysis,investment process and investment objectives.
all of this evidence leaves no doubt win had an ongoing obligation to give investment advice and did not merely act as a referral service.
because win business entailed advising clients in choosing among different investment managers who had distinct investment styles,and because it also advised clients in regard to asset allocation,we think win activities easily fall within the act definition of investment adviser.as the district court found,win business of selecting particular investment managers in lieu of others had the effect of channeling client funds to particular security investments.indeed,if this were not so,then there would have been no point in making c hanges in terms of management and allocation when an account ceased to be consistent with a client needs.in short,we can not say the district court factual conclusions were clearly erroneous,fed.civ.a,and we agree with the district court that win service constituted advising others as to the advisability of investing in,purchasing,or selling securities,a,making win an investment adviser.
appellants deny win violated section f of the act.as noted,that section prohibits investment advisers from associating with parties they know have been barred from the investment advisory business.id.f.specifically,section f provides i t shall be unlawful for any investment adviser to permit any person as to whom a bar order is in effect to become,or remain,a person associated with him if such investment adviser knew,or in the exercise of reasonable care,should have known,of such order.id.emphasis added.section a provides in relevant part the term person associated with an investment adviser means any partner,officer,or director of such investment adviser or any person performing similar functions,or any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by such investment adviser,including any employee of such investment adviser id.a emphasis added.
the record makes clear,as the district court found,that bolla continued to manage win finances after the bar order.when bolla received fee checks from that belonged to did not forward those checks unopened to radano instead,he deposited the fees in his personal account,paid win expenses,and disbursed a portion of the fees to radano.he even claimed,according to radano testimony,that september,three months after the bar order was a good break point a good time,that is,for radano to take over the finances at win.in addition,bolla refused to transfer control over win bank account to radano,and bolla continued to receive inquiries from win clients and direct radano as to the needs of these clients.radano,for example,testified bolla was calling me and saying client a,b,c call,client so and so call he would call me and say tim riordan called daniel davon needs an ira distribution,call him.bolla also specifically instructed radano concerning the payment of win obligations in accordance with certain agreements.at trial,radano was asked y ou still on november,taking instructions from bolla on how to subdivide fees to which,radano replied on some level,yes,because he received this check directly from lockwood,so what i trying to do is make sure that the fees are properly processed through the system.similarly,radano testified about a check he had received from bolla after the bar order 
this was a check that was sent out to me so that i could send a client i do have a direct recollection as to why bolla sent it to me to send out to other people,but there a deposit into the win 
t hen i paid whatever reason,he wanted me to pay out,or requested that i pay someone else out fees at that time.
to clarify that response,counsel asked bolla directed you to make payments to third parties to which,radano replied yes.
furthermore,the evidence easily supports the district court finding that the payment win made to bolla wife in february was a division of fees between radano and bolla for the previous quarter,and this division of fees was made at the direction of bolla himself.this payment was exactly fifty percent of the fees attributable to several win clients,most of whom were bolla former clients,and bolla testimony indicated the payment was really to him,and not to his wife.if the payment were merely a reimbursement of expenses bolla incurred before the bar order,as bolla suggested,it would probably not constitute associat ion in violation of section f,but the evidence supports the district court finding that the payment was actually a division of fees for a quarter that the bar order.moreover,radano characterization of this payment as a fee payment to bolla wife has no credibility at all in light of her limited duties at win and the fact that she had never previously received payment.
this evidence makes very clear bolla continued to be a person directly or indirectly controlling win after the bar order,id.a,and therefore the district court conclusion that bolla remained associated with win is not clearly erroneous,fed.civ.a.
however,evidence showing bolla continued his activities after the june,bar order is insufficient,by itself,to warrant a judgment against win and radano.if,for example,bolla stole fee checks that properly belonged to win and disbursed funds from those checks in contravention of win wishes and despite win active efforts to prevent bolla actions,then win could not be held liable for violating section f,because win would not in that case have permit ted bolla to remain associated with win.f.win would then be a victim of bolla,not an associate.therefore,to establish a violation of section f,the sec needed to prove win took some affirmative step to permit bolla to associate with win,or at least that it acquiesced in bolla ongoing management of win finances such that its passivity can be deemed a violation of section f.the latter possibility is significant here.appellants argue the term permit in section f means authorize,which suggests an affirmative giving of permission,as when a regulatory agency issues a license allowing a private party to engage in a regulated activity.the sec rejects this narrow reading of the word permit,interpreting the word to mean,in effect,acquiesce.we think the sec reading of the statute is correct.if congress in adopting section f used the word permit to mean authorize,the statute would be so narrow in scope as to be almost silly.it is hard to imagine an investment adviser ever actively authorizing a barred individual to take control of the firm.the much more natural reading of the statute is that it prohibits investment advisers from standing aside passively while a barred individual takes control of the firm,and this is the reading we adopt.in sum,we need to consider whether win acquiesced in bolla continuing control over its finances to a degree sufficient to hold it liable under section f.
as a corporation,win could only act through its officers,and with the exception of bolla himself,win only corporate officers were radano and bolla wife.because bolla wife did not act in an executive capacity at win as all parties concede,the focus is on radano actions as managing director of win during the months leading up to and immediately following the bar order.
radano testified in essence that he was by the june,bar order,and he immediately took action to sever ties between win and bolla,but he did not gain full control of win finances for several months.bolla,however,settled with the sec in march,and radano knew of bolla problems with the sec long before that settlement.moreover,radano conceded he knew in february of that bolla was likely to be barred soon he just did not know precisely when the bar would take effect.radano further claims that,in his ignorance,he thought a mere telephone call to lockwood would cause lockwood to change the address on the win accounts to radano address,and with that change of address,the necessary transition would be complete.but even if we assume radano was completely ignorant of win contractual relationship with lockwood,radano could not very well expect to take over bolla win clients with neither a formal introduction to these clients nor records of their investment history or objectives,which remained in bolla possession.moreover,assuming radano could convince these clients to remain with win,he could not hope to take over bolla side of the business without knowledge of bolla arrangements with third parties.therefore,even if we accept radano claim,radano had no basis for expecting to take over control of win without bolla cooperation.under these circumstances,radano casual,wait and see approach was simply inadequate.as soon as radano knew the bar order was imminent,radano,as win managing director,should have actively sought bolla cooperation with the transition of bolla win clients to radano oversight,and if that cooperation was not forthcoming,radano should have taken steps to protect win and its clients.
radano failure in this regard might be dismissed as mere managerial incompetence.it rose to the level of a violation of section f once the bar order took effect and radano still took no steps on behalf of win to prevent bolla continuing control over win and its finances.because bolla had,prior to the bar order,held himself out as one of win managing directors,win needed to take immediate steps to terminate its relationship with bolla.radano actions as the managing director of win make clear win did not.radano failed to notify the sec that bolla was insisting on continuing his role as manager of win finances despite the bar order.radano also did not bring any legal action against bolla on behalf of win,and in fact,radano did not even formally protest to bolla in writing concerning bolla continuing involvement with win.rather,radano was complicit in the arrangement,treating it as part of a necessary transition,and even going so far as to make a fee payment to bolla on behalf of win.
finally,radano did not take formal steps on behalf of win to inform win clients of the bar order,along with an explanation of how the bar order might affect their interests and a neutral discussion of the options these clients might have.such a formal notification would likely have caused win clients either to terminate their relationship with win,or to execute letters of authorization making radano their selected representative at lockwood.in either case,notification would have made clear win was not complicit in bolla ongoing involvement with win financial affairs,and it would have satisfied win fiduciary obligations to its clients.radano testified he could not contact bolla win clients because bolla possessed the contact information for these clients.but this assertion does not excuse radano failure to take immediate action,as win managing director,to protect win interests.if bolla was refusing to release win client files and related records,then radano needed to initiate legal proceedings on win behalf to obtain those files.by not doing so,he signaled that win was content to allow bolla to continue in his traditional role as win principal.moreover,even when bolla former clients contacted radano,he still did not make clear the sec had barred bolla from the investment advisory business.instead,he resorted to dodgy statements that obscured the truth.win failure to notify its clients indicates,as the district court found,that radano chose the lure of potential profit from bolla book of clients over his obligations under section f.
in sum,the district court found radano took no significant actions on behalf of win to sever ties with bolla during the months following the bar or
