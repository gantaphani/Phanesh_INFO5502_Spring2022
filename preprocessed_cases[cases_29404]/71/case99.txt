in early the cross corporation,a venerable new england maker of fine pens and pencils,entered the personal electronic devices market by offering computing products through its pen computing group pcg.the stars of its new line were the crosspad and its smaller cousin,the crosspad xp.cross had high hopes for its new product line and expressed those hopes publicly in september by saying it expected to report a minimum of million in profitable sales for pcg in.indeed,one of cross officers compared its fledgling product to the highly successful palm pilot.
reality did not keep pace with these projections.by late cross had discontinued the product line and suffered losses that year of million,which essentially eliminated profits from the million in sales on the pcg products in.
michael aldridge brought this securities action in april as a putative class action on behalf of those who purchased cross common stock between september,and april,the class period.an amended complaint asserts claims against the company,four officers of the company,and certain trusts which own part of cross.the complaint alleges violations of section b of the securities and exchange act of,b,and rule under that act,against the company,the individual defendants,and the trusts.it also alleges a section a claim against the individual and trust defendants as controlling person s.a.

we reverse the dismissal of the claims against the individual defendants and the company.we find that there is sufficient factual support for the allegations of fraud and a strong inference of scienter to survive a motion to dismiss under the private securities litigation reform act pslra.we affirm the dismissal of the section a claim against the trust defendants on different grounds on these pleadings,the trust defendants can not be considered controlling persons for the purpose of section a liability.

cross is a publicly traded company on the american stock exchange.for over a century,cross has been producing traditional writing instruments.by the mid,sales of these products were dropping off,and the company stock price had decreased significantly since.in july,cross established a new division it called the pen computing group pcg in an effort to bridge the worlds of traditional and electronic paper,to expand the company traditional product base,and to return cross to acceptable margins and earnings.
one of these pcg products was the crosspad,unveiled in november,and first shipped in march.the crosspad xp,a smaller model,was introduced to the market in october.the crosspads were electronic note pads with digital pens,with which a user wrote on a note pad atop a battery powered unit.the pens wrote on the paper in the traditional way and also recorded the pen strokes for later connection to a computer.once the information was stored in a computer,it could be viewed,searched,and otherwise used.
there was a great deal of optimism about the crosspads and their positive impact on cross as a whole.on september,even before unveiling the crosspad,cross issued a press release announcing that the company expected at least million in profitable sales from pcg in.on march,cross filed a report with the sec for the fiscal year,which stated we look at as a year where our pen computing group will provide its first year of significant sales and earnings.the bulk of pcg business was the crosspad product line.in an april article in value line,an investment publication,cross management said that sales of the crosspad would drive pcg growth,and predicted sales of million in the year.in a june article in barron,another investment publication,management predicted that crosspad could triple the size of the company.on june,the cross share price peaked for the class period at.
in cross filings with the sec,the company continued to report significant sales growth for pcg products.in a business article dated february,the providence journal quoted brian mullins,the director of marketing for pcg,as saying that pcg sales for all of did meet the company goal of million in sales.
despite the earlier optimism,cross began to lower the market expectations beginning in early.the same february providence journal article discusses mullins comments on the recently announced price reductions for both the crosspad and the crosspad xp.he stated that the price cuts were not related to the sales of the products but were planned from the get go and were expected by the retailers.the article paraphrases mullins as saying that even with the price cuts,the company will still make a profit.he also said that more price cuts were expected later in the year.on march,the company filed its report with the sec.the report stated the success of the crosspad sales in,but it also acknowledged the price reductions and greater marketing support and technical development than planned,which resulted in a loss for pen computing operations.
on april,cross announced in a press release that the company sales had dropped dramatically from million in the first quarter of to million in the first quarter of.it also expressed its expectation that revenues from pcg would be a great deal lower in than they were in.
on the same day,cross management held a conference call with securities analysts and investors to discuss the company results for the first quarter of.during the call,russell boss,president and ceo of cross,explained that pcg sales had decreased in the first quarter because of price protections.he also mentioned take backs from customers.robert byrnes,president and ceo of pcg also spoke about price protection,and said that the price reductions were part of the company original sales strategy.john buckley,cross executive vice president and chief operating officer,also acknowledged the company price protection practices.cross did not disclose any price protection plans or take back agreements in its public financial disclosures in.
also on april,russell boss and bradford boss announced that they were stepping down from their positions as ceo and executive chairman respectively,and stepping into the positions of chairman,and chairman emeritus.immediately after the end of the class period,on april,the share price for cross fell below.
pcg sales continued to decline in.on may,the company filed a report for the first quarter of the year,and revealed for the first time in a sec filing a rebate program it had with its customers.in a report issued on august,the company reported over million in losses for pcg in the second quarter of,and an decline in pcg sales compared to the same quarter the previous year.the company pointed to the excess inventory its customers had as a reason for the decrease in sales.
finally,the crosspad product line was discontinued at the end of because of poor performance in the market.in a form filed on march,cross new president and ceo discussed pcg decline in.he stated 
early in the year it became clear that our investment in the pen computing group w as a significant drain on the company financial and human resources.as a result,in the fourth quarter,the company discontinued the crosspad product line 
the company also described a revenue recognition policy not disclosed earlier,which stated revenue from sales is recognized upon shipment or delivery of goods.provision is made at the time the related revenue is recognized for estimated product returns,term discounts and rebates.
aldridge,the plaintiff,brought a claim under section b of the securities and exchange act of,b,and rule,for fraud against cross,members of its top management team,and three trusts that own a large number of shares in the company.he argues that the statements made by the company and its management during the class period were misleading in light of the company sales and accounting practices.specifically,aldridge says that the company employed sales strategies,such as price protection,take backs,and channel stuffing,without disclosing them to the shareholders,or reserving for them in financial statements,as they were obligated to do.aldridge also brought a claim under section a of the securities and exchange act of,a,against the individual defendants and the trust defendants as controlling persons of the corporation.aldridge argues that the trust defendants,b y reason of their ownership and ability to select of the board,and the individual defendants influenced and steered the company to engage in fraudulent conduct.
the district court dismissed the action on a rule b motion under the standards of the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,finding aldridge had neither provided sufficient factual support for the allegations of fraud nor raised a strong inference of scienter.aldridge cross,slip.op.at june.the district court,without reaching the details of the controlling person issue,also dismissed the section a claim against the individual defendants and the trust defendants because it was derivative of the dismissed section b claim.id.at.the court did not reach the question of whether to certify a class.

fraud allegations 
the district court correctly found that aldridge had met the specificity requirements as to time,place and content of the statements said to be misleading.aldridge,slip.op.at.the district court faulted the complaint,however,for failing to provide factual support for the allegations of fraud.id.at.the district court concluded that even if cross made false statements or material omissions,there is no support for the proposition that the defendants knew these statements or omissions were misleading at the time they were made.it also relied on the absence of specific figures regarding which transactions were misstated and by what amounts.it was here that the court erred.the district court did not giv e plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable inferences as it should have on a motion to dismiss,greebel,at,but appears to have drawn its inferences in the defendants favor.we take the plaintiff allegations to be true and draw inferences in the plaintiff favor.
aldridge core claim is that the reported revenues and earnings in cross financial statements were artificially inflated,and that the statements contained omissions of material facts.aldridge alleges that under generally accepted accounting principles gaap,with which cross purported to comply,cross was required to estimate a loss or range of loss and set a reserve with respect to all contingent sales that were made,including sales for which the buyer had the right to receive a credit or allowance if the price of the crosspad declined before the buyer could resell the product,price protection.if cross was unable to establish a reserve or estimate the loss,it was required to disclose the practices that gave rise to the contingent revenues and earnings.aldridge alleges that the defendants knew that cross had not sufficiently reserved for the losses that inevitably would occur when cross was forced to honor its price protection commitments,and that their failure to disclose this to the public violated federal regulations specifically item of the sec regulation and accounting standards.see a requiring that sec filings provide information that the registrant believes to be necessary to an understanding of its financial condition accounting for contingencies,statement of financial accounting standards,financial accounting standards bd revenue recognition when right of return exists,statement of financial accounting standards,financial accounting standards bd fas.cross has not argued that the information that was not provided in the financial statements was not material.
the district court holding hinged on a key issue whether,from the statements made by company officials in,it could be reasonably inferred that cross had engaged in undisclosed price protection earlier,in.the district court thought not.if there was no price protection or similar practice in,the district court concluded,then the company financial statements did not contain misleading omissions.our view is to the contrary it is an extremely reasonable inference,from the defendants statements in,that the company had offered its customers price protection guarantees in,likely to induce them to carry the new crosspad product lines.from this,it may easily be inferred that the statements were misleading and that the defendants knew that they were misleading.
there were several statements in that support the inferences.first,in february,the prices of the crosspad products were discounted by up to.a february business article in the providence journal reported the price reductions and cited mullins,the director of marketing,as saying that the company would make a profit on the crosspads even with the price cuts the article also reported obviously relying on company sources and most likely on mullins that price cuts had been planned since the products were introduced.mullins was quoted as saying that the price cuts were not related to how well the units were selling.mullins said w e actually had planned it from the get go.we told the retailers to expect it.
in this context,from the get go is easily read to mean from the introduction of the new product to the market in.if the price cuts were planned from early,it is entirely reasonable to think that price protection for the stores selling the product was also discussed and agreed on at that time,to insulate the retailers from the inevitable price reductions.
the price reductions were also discussed at cross april,conference call with analysts and investors.during that conference call byrnes,the head of pcg,said that the price reductions were in line with the company original strategy,but were not put into place until february.president russell boss said that pcg business was down in the first quarter of because of price protections cross gave retailers.two other corporate officers,including byrnes,mentioned that there was a price protection program.
there is a possibility that the cross officers used the term price protection in some specialized narrow sense for a right to reimbursement offered by the company to the retailers once the crosspads had already been on the store shelves for some months.however,on this record it is just as likely,if not more likely,that aldridge more common definition of price protection is what was meant price protection is a retailer or distributor right to reimbursement in the event of price reductions.as aldridge argues,t hat price protection is a right implies that it is bargained for at the time the contracts to buy product from the manufacturer,not once the product has been on the shelves for several months.
aldridge also argues that under accounting rules,booking sales subject to price protection requires adequate accounting reserves at the time of sale to offset the effects of such price protection.otherwise,such sales should not be recognized as revenue.if a reserve is not set,for example,the size of the contingencies was impossible to should be made.see greebel,at discussing fas.
in dismissing the case,the district court referred to a statement in greebel that the absence of specific identifying information as to the amount and nature of contingent sales transactions was indicative of the generality of the allegations of violations of gaap standards such as fas,and thus insufficient by itself to infer scienter.aldridge,slip op.at citing greebel,at.however,in greebel,there was no evidence of statements by management indicating material undisclosed contingencies,while here there was such evidence.further,it is reasonable to infer that in this case all customers were offered price protection as a matter of company policy.cross itself attributed losses in early in part to its price protection program.there was therefore little need for the type of specificity discussed in greebel.in greebel,the argument that contingent sales were not properly accounted for under fas was made largely in service of more direct claims of warehousing and whiting out,claims which,even after discovery,lacked any factual support.here,in contrast,there is a reasonable inference of a pattern of price protection.further,the evidence that contingent sales were not accounted for as they should have been under fas was offered in greebel as indirect evidence of scienter,and there was discounted,in the absence of particulars and other evidence of scienter.greebel did not hold that a plaintiff,before discovery,must in every case allege the amount of overstatement of revenues and earnings in order to state a claim that undisclosed price protection schemes were fraudulent.at relying on complete absence of particulars but refusing to hold that such information must appear in a complaint.
aldridge also attempts to support the inference that a price protection program was entered into in but not disclosed at the time with allegations of two corollary practices take backs and channel stuffing.a take back is a promise to take back goods from customers who have been unable to sell them.in the april,conference call,russell boss specifically used the phrase take back.again,it is reasonable to infer that a take back guarantee for the retailers of crosspads was agreed to in,because a take back agreement,just like price protection,is likely to have been part of the original bargain between cross and its customers.no take back agreements were disclosed in the company public statements and filings.the take back allegations therefore support aldridge claim that cross engaged in undisclosed price protection.
channel stuffing,in turn,was defined in greebel 
channel stuffing means inducing purchasers to increase substantially their purchases before they would,in the normal course,otherwise purchase products from the company.it has the result of shifting earnings into earlier quarters,quite likely to the detriment of earnings in later quarters.
at.aldridge allegation is that of the store placements for the crosspad took place in the last four months of and that of pcg sales occurred in the last three months of.these figures might well be explained by holiday season sales.beyond that,the second quarter form report stated that the reduction in sales from the prior year was attributable to retailers having significantly reduced their purchases as they reduced their current inventory levels.also,the company expenses were higher as it administered a rebate promotion to reduce channel inventory at the retail level.this information may or may not suggest that more inventory was in the hands of the retailers than commercially warranted.there is nothing inherently improper in pressing for sales to be made earlier than in the normal course,id.at,and in this case,the channel stuffing allegations at present are neutral.after discovery,however,they may play a supporting role in buttressing the price protection inferences.
the company says this is a garden variety fraud by hindsight case,occasioned by the large drop in sales of crosspad products after.that characterization is off the mark.fraud by hindsight occurs when a plaintiff simply contrast s a defendant past optimism with less favorable actual results,and then contend s that the difference must be attributable to fraud.shaw digital equip,cir quoting dileo ernst young,cir.in this case,on the other hand,aldridge complains that the company failed to disclose certain known material information as to the contingent nature of the sales,and that cross essentially admitted to the contingencies in.
the allegations of fraud in the complaint have sufficient factual support to survive a motion to dismiss.a closer question is whether the allegations of scienter are sufficient.
scienter,which is a requirement for liability under section b and rule,is a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.ernst ernst hochfelder,d.to win a section b case,the plaintiff must show either that the defendants consciously intended to defraud,or that they acted with a high degree of recklessness.greebel,at.
in greebel,we held that the pslra did not mandate a particular test to determine scienter and that this court would continue to use its case by case approach we analyze the particular facts alleged in each individual case to determine whether the allegations were sufficient to support scienter.at accord city of philadelphia fleming,cir adopting greebel approach helwig,at same.thus,the plaintiff may combine various facts and circumstances indicating fraudulent intent to show a strong inference of scienter.as part of the mix of facts,the plaintiff may allege that the defendants had the motive concrete benefits that could be realized by the false statements and wrongful nondisclosures and opportunity the means and likely prospect of achieving concrete benefits by the means alleged to commit the fraud.novak kasaks,cir.quoting shields citytrust bancorp,cir,cert denied,d.however,as we stated in greebel,while mere allegations of motive and opportunity alone may be insufficient,together with additional factual support,evidence of motive and opportunity may establish a strong inference of scienter.at.
in evaluating whether the inferences of scienter are strong,we agree with the sixth circuit language that inferences must be reasonable and not irrefutable plaintiffs need not foreclose all other characterizations of fact,as the task of weighing contrary accounts is reserved for the fact finder.helwig,at.the plaintiff must show that his characterization of the events and circumstances as showing scienter is highly likely.
taking all the facts and circumstances into consideration,the complaint survives the requirement that its pleadings raise a strong inference of scienter.first,strong inferences can be made that the company offered price protection and take back arrangements in these arrangements,if they existed,were not disclosed,and that nondisclosure could hardly have been inadvertent.the company only disclosed the price protection and take back agreements in an april conference call with industry analysts and investors.full public disclosure of the agreements only occurred in the form report filed on may.although the company officials referred to price protection during the conference call,the report used the term rebates,which may suggest an attempt to recharacterize the events.of course,more than mere proof that the defendants made a particular false or misleading statement is required to show scienter.geffon micrion,cir.however,the fact that the defendants published statements when they knew facts suggesting the statements were inaccurate or misleadingly incomplete is classic evidence of scienter.fl.state bd.of admin.green tree fin,cir collecting cases from
