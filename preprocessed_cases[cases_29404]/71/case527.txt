opinion of the court 
paul polishan appeals his conviction on charges of conspiracy,securities fraud and other related offenses.he argues that the district court erred in rulings relating to discovery procedures and to the admission of evidence at trial.we hold that polishan waived his right to appeal the rulings on discovery procedures by failing to comply with the procedural requirements of a local rule and we find no error in the admission of evidence to which polishan objects.thus we affirm.
factual background 
in,polishan became the senior vice president of finance,chief financial officer and chief accounting officer of leslie fay companies lfc.polishan ran leslie fay hanover,pennsylvania facility,supervising its financial operations and the employees involved in those operations.in january,accounting irregularities at lfc came to light,for which lfc corporate controller and polishan direct subordinate,donald kenia,initially claimed full responsibility.the lfc board of directors audit committee began an investigation.two weeks later,during interviews conducted by attorneys and accountants retained by the audit committee,kenia stated that polishan had directed the illegal conduct.kenia similarly implicated polishan in subsequent interviews with federal law enforcement authorities.
in september,the audit committee issued a report concluding that,because of unsupported entries in its ledgers,lfc had overstated by more than million its net income for the years.as part of the investigation resulting in the issuance of that report,lfc president babcock asked roger vallecorse,former of human resources,to interview polishan,kenia,and the divisional controllers who worked under polishan and kenia.the audit committee report did not conclude formally that polishan participated in the fraud,but did detail the evidence that supported such a conclusion including kenia statements.in october,kenia pleaded guilty to charges relating to the making of false statements in financial statements submitted to the securities and exchange commission sec.
ii.procedural history 
in october,a grand jury returned an indictment charging polishan with,inter alia,conspiracy to falsify the books and records of lfc,the making of false statements in documents submitted to the sec,securities fraud,bank fraud and wire fraud.polishan was arraigned shortly thereafter.
on november,the district court appointed a magistrate judge to supervise discovery.the government adopted an open file policy,whereby it made available to defense counsel all material in the government possession,with the exception of privileged items and attorney.defense counsel had access to the room in the federal building where the file was located and permission to bring in a photocopier.discovery was completed on december.
on january,polishan filed motions arguing,inter alia,that the open file policy of the government had proved impractical.he requested relief in the form of continuing access to the discovery file and,to facilitate access,requested that the court establish a supervised document depository where documents would be stored until trial.the magistrate judge rejected this request,concluding that polishan was given adequate opportunities to conduct discovery.
polishan also requested identification by the prosecution of material under brady maryland,d.the magistrate judge concluded that the government has complied with its brady obligations by providing a complete open file to the defendant for more than two years.
while polishan bench trial was initially scheduled for january,it began over three years later on march.it continued for days over four months.on july,the district court found polishan guilty of of the substantive counts.he filed motions in august and september.in those motions,he contended,for the first time,that the magistrate judge had erred in his rulings on polishan motions.on july,the district court denied those motions.thereafter polishan was sentenced to nine years imprisonment,to be followed by three years of supervised release.this appeal followed 
iii.discussion 
discovery procedures 
polishan argues that,by holding the government satisfied its obligation to produce documents,the district court violated his rights under brady and federal rule of criminal procedure.the district court held that polishan had waived his right to object to discovery procedures by failing to seek reconsideration of the discovery rulings of the magistrate judge prior to trial we agree.
authorizes a district court to appoint a magistrate judge to hear and decide both dispositive and matters.for the former,the statute mandates a specific time within which objections are to be filed.b c authorizing any party to serve and file written objections within ten days of service of the findings and recommendations on dispositive motions.in contrast,b a,which authorizes a magistrate judge to hear and decide pretrial matters,provides only that the district court judge may reconsider any pretrial matter where it has been shown that the magistrate judge order is clearly erroneous or contrary to law,without specifying particular procedures for that reconsideration.
in all federal civil cases,federal rule of civil procedure a requires a party to serve and file objections to a magistrate judge ruling on a pretrial matter not dispositive of a claim or defense of any party w ithin days after being served with a copy of the magistrate judge order,and that a party may not thereafter assign as error a defect in the magistrate judge order to which objection was not timely made.there is no analogue to this rule in the federal rules of criminal procedure,but we have noted the legislative history indicates that procedures are to be established by local rules.united steelworkers of am.new jersey zinc,cir citing.at,reprinted in.in the middle district of pennsylvania,local rule provides that in a civil or criminal case any party aggrieved by the order of a magistrate judge may seek review by appealing to the district court within ten days.thus,in keeping with our conclusion in united steelworkers,we follow the procedure prescribed by this local rule.
jurisdictional defect waiver 
we reject the government contention that polishan failure to seek reconsideration under the procedures specified by the local rule means that we lack jurisdiction to review the magistrate judge holdings.we have always treated the defect as by allowing for review when exceptional circumstances exist.continental cas.dominick,cir citing tabron grace,cir.if the defect were jurisdictional,of course,we would be unable to review the order even in the most exceptional of circumstances.see united states brown,cir although brown argues for an equitable exception,the rule is jurisdictional and therefore is not subject to equitable exceptions.citations omitted.while we hold that we shall not review the magistrate judge rulings because of polishan failure to seek reconsideration under the procedures specified by the local rule,we do so because he has waived his right to appellate review,not because our court lacks jurisdiction to review his claims.accord united states brown,cir holding that waiver is not jurisdictional charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure ed.even where the waiver rule applies,it is not jurisdictional.
because polishan did not seek reconsideration of the magistrate judge discovery ruling under the procedures specified by the local rule,he has waived the right to appeal that ruling.it is undisputed that,in civil cases,the right to appeal the ruling of a magistrate judge is waived if reconsideration before the district court is not sought in a timely fashion.united steelworkers,at w e hold that by failing to object in the district court to the magistrate order striking its jury demand,steelworkers has waived its ability to challenge that order on appeal.we have not considered whether the right to appeal is similarly waived in criminal cases.
polishan urges us to follow the ninth circuit,the only court to hold that the waiver rule does not apply in criminal cases.united states,cir the ninth circuit relied on the fact that there is no time for objections set out in b a,and no provided in the federal rules of criminal procedure,at.the supervisory powers of the courts to form procedural rules are limited and while federal rule of civil procedure a provided a clear basis in fact and law justifying a waiver rule in civil cases,there is no clear basis in the criminal context.id.at.the court therefore held that had not waived his right to appeal the magistrate judge discovery rulings.
this reasoning is simply not applicable to polishan.unlike,here there is a clear basis in law and fact to apply a waiver rule to this criminal case.the local rules for the middle district of pennsylvania provide a time within which objections must be filed to a magistrate judge rulings and that rule applies in both civil and criminal cases.local rule for the middle district of pennsylvania any party may appeal from a magistrate judge order determining a pretrial motion or matter in any civil or criminal case.emphasis added.
we note also that,by not timely seeking reconsideration by the district court of the magistrate judge discovery rulings instead waiting until after the trial,polishan deprived the district court of the opportunity effectively to review that decision and to correct any errors.renfro,at.in the civil context,we have concluded that seeking review of rulings of magistrate judges for the first time after a trial would impermissibly allow a litigant a second bite at the apple.united steelworkers,at we can not escape drawing the inference that steelworkers,which never once suggested to the district court that it preferred a jury trial to the bench trial given it,wished to have two bites to the proverbial apple,and awaited that court decision on the merits before raising the jury trial issue we can not condone such trial tactics.when objections are not raised until after the trial,even if the district court disagrees with the magistrate judge discovery rulings,there is very little opportunity to correct those problems.as the district court here noted,t o allow polishan to now raise a issue as a basis for a new trial would be manifestly unfair to the government and wasteful of scarce judicial resources.united states polishan,wl,at,see also united steelworkers,at b y failing to file timely objections to the magistrate discovery order,appellants not only stripped the district court of its function of effectively reviewing the magistrate order,but also frustrated the policy behind the magistrate act,to relieve courts of unnecessary work and to improve access to the courts.quoting niehaus kansas bar ass n,cir 
we conclude that polishan has waived his right to appeal the rulings of the magistrate judge.he failed to comply with local rule,which provides a specific time within which to seek reconsideration of the rulings of a magistrate judge.and we find no extraordinary circumstances that would justify exercising our discretion to ignore his lack of compliance.united steelworkers,at.
admission of evidence 
polishan argues that the district court abused its discretion by admitting certain evidence in violation of the federal rules of evidence.we reject these contentions because polishan failed to raise objections to any objectionable evidence,and the admission of any potentially objectionable evidence did not constitute plain error.
admission of testimony in violation of expert witness rule 
polishan contends that government witnesses presented inadmissible evidence by testifying about the corporate culture at lfc and by giving opinions regarding polishan mental state in violation of federal rules of evidence b and b.the government retorts that the testimony was admissible under federal rule of evidence as lay opinion evidence.we review decisions of the district court to admit opinion evidence for abuse of discretion.united states leo,cir.when contemporaneous objections are not made,we review the admission of evidence for plain error.d.
we reject polishan argument that the testimony of the government witnesses violated federal rule of evidence b.testimony about an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact is generally admissible.a.it is only inadmissible if the testimony comes from an expert witness testifying with respect to the mental state or condition of a defendant in a criminal case,in which case that witness may not state an opinion or inference as to whether the defendant did or did not have the mental state or condition constituting an element of the crime charged or of a defense thereto.b.the ultimate issue at trial was whether polishan knew of and directed the accounting irregularities at lfc.he claims that the government witnesses impermissibly gave their opinion on this issue,thus violating rule b.because none of the witnesses to whom polishan objects was an expert,that their testimony may have covered the issue of knowledge does not make it inadmissible.
we reject polishan contentions of error under federal rule of evidence.any testimony that is arguably inadmissible under rule was not contemporaneously objected to,and its admission was not plain error.
under rule,lay opinion is admissible so long as it is a rationally based on the perception of the witness,and b helpful to a clear understanding of the witness testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.a witness testifying about business operations may testify about inferences that he could draw from his perception of a business records,or facts or data perceived by him in his corporate capacity,kimball int l,cir.lay opinion testimony may be based on the witness own perceptions and knowledge and participation in the affairs of the business.lightning lube,witco,cir.
while we have never held that lay opinion evidence concerning the knowledge of a third party is per se inadmissible,we have certainly made this kind of evidence difficult to admit.if the witness fails to describe the opinion basis,in the form of descriptions of specific incidents,the opinion testimony will be rejected on the ground that it is not based on the witness perceptions.united states anderskow,cir noting that opinion evidence must be rationally based on witness perceptions.to the extent the witness describes the basis of his or her opinion,that testimony will be rejected on the ground that it is not helpful because the fact finder is able to reach his or her own conclusion,making the opinion testimony irrelevant anderskow,at we do not understand how a witness subjective belief that a defendant must have known is helpful to a fact finder that has before it the very circumstantial evidence upon which the subjective opinion is based.citing united states rea,cir.
there is a fine line between statements that permissibly offer a witness testimony about his or her own perceptions while supporting inferences about knowledge,and statements that constitute opinions on a witness knowledge.in anderskow,at,we found no error in the admission of testimony where the witness never explicitly opined on direct examination that defendant possessed guilty knowledge but provided several reasons to support the unstated conclusion that he did.examples of such testimony included statements that defendants were working toward a common goal and that someone had told the witness that the defendant would do anything they asked.id.statements that furnished the basis for an inference,based on circumstantial evidence,that defendant had guilty knowledge which the government was free to suggest during its closing argument did not implicate federal rule of evidence.id.
most of the statements to which polishan objected are analogous to the admissible statements in anderskow.for example 
vallecorse kenia was totally committed to,and would do anything to please,polishan.polishan was the puppet master and kenia was subservient.polishan had the dominant personality and kenia walked on egg shells because he was afraid.
