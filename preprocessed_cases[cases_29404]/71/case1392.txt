a successful plaintiff in a minority shareholder derivative action appeals the trial court denial of his motion for attorney fees.he contends the court judgment created a common fund and substantial benefit for defendant corporation,and thus the court should have awarded him fees.the trial court did not believe it could apply the common fund or substantial benefit doctrine in a derivative suit involving a close corporation with a small number of shareholders.the corporation argues the trial court was correct on that issue and even if it erred in refusing to apply these equitable doctrines,the court properly denied the motion because plaintiff failed to present competent evidence enabling the court to determine the amount of a reasonable fee award.
we conclude the trial court erred in failing to apply the common fund and substantial benefit doctrines.in an unpublished portion of the opinion,however,we find appellant counsel failed to produce sufficient evidence as to the amount of the fees properly attributable to the successful derivative claim as opposed to his individual causes of action.accordingly,we reverse the order as it pertains to the application of the common fund and substantial benefit doctrines and remand the matter for a determination of a reasonable attorney fees award.
facts and proceedings below 
in september,imre cziraki appellant,lawrence phillis,and eugene van den berg ii held the first incorporators and board of directors meeting of thunder cats,respondent,their small business or close corporation.phillis and van den berg had recently applied for patents on their design for cylinder heads used in recreational watercraft engines.they also had approached cziraki,who owned a machining company,about forming a corporation to manufacture and sell parts based on their design.in discussions prior to the meeting,phillis and van den berg offered to assign their patent interests to thunder cats with the understanding cziraki would oversee the manufacture of the parts.the parties memorialized this commitment to assign the patents to thunder cats in the minutes of the first board of directors meeting.the minutes do not mention any corresponding obligation by cziraki.
the minutes also contain the parties confirmation each of them would invest in thunder cats in exchange for shares of common stock per shareholder,in effect creating a ownership stake in the company.after formalizing their officer roles,the parties deferred any discussion of officers salary or other compensation until such time as the company generated enough revenue to warrant this discussion.the minutes do not mention any other or similar shareholder distribution strategies.
shortly after they formed thunder cats with cziraki,phillis and van den berg formed vanlar,a separate company in which they held the only shareholder interests.phillis and van den berg never assigned their patent interests to thunder cats and instead exploited the patents on vanlar behalf.as a minority shareholder,cziraki had limited power to enforce the original promise to assign the patents to thunder cats.cziraki relationship with phillis and van den berg deteriorated.
in december,cziraki filed derivative and individual claims against thunder cats,phillis,and van den berg.in his first amended complaint,cziraki asserted derivative claims against phillis and van den berg for breach of fiduciary duty and usurpation of corporate opportunity,and prayed for assignment of the patents to thunder cats plus the imposition of a constructive trust to account for the company lost profits and related business opportunities.cziraki asserted individual claims against phillis and van den berg for breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,and negligent misrepresentation.
the trial court found phillis and van den berg had breached their fiduciary duties to thunder cats and ordered them to assign their patents to thunder cats and to make payments of and,respectively,to compensate the company for economic damages attributable to their failure to assign the patents as originally promised.the court also found phillis and van den berg had breached their fiduciary duties to cziraki,as majority stockholders to a minority stockholder,but the court did not enter any damage award in favor of cziraki as an individual stockholder.
postjudgment,cziraki filed a motion to recover attorney fees incurred in the prosecution of his successful derivative claim,invoking the common fund and substantial benefit doctrines.because the trial judge had transferred to another court,a different judge heard the motion for attorney fees.the new judge pointed to portions of the record indicating the trial judge believed cziraki successful cause of action might justify an award of attorney fees.
at the hearing on the motion,the trial court commented it had never heard of applying either the common fund or substantial benefit doctrine to a suit concerning a close corporation.the court expressed doubt it had latitude to invoke either doctrine under circumstances in which all three of the shareholders had participated in the litigation.the court indicated it was relying on what little precedent was available to guide it.
in considering cziraki motion,the trial court also evaluated the feasibility of granting an award which would compensate cziraki for the attorney fees incurred in the prosecution of the successful derivative claim,without including the fees associated with the individual claims.the court expressed concern over its ability to make such a distinction absent any direct observation of counsel efforts.the court stated its reluctance to rely exclusively on the motion and supporting declaration of cziraki counsel.
the trial court requested supplemental briefing further addressing application of the equitable doctrines at issue and the apportionment of legal fees.the court specifically instructed cziraki counsel to provide more helpful and competent evidence to facilitate the court determination of the total time and effort spent in pursuit of the successful derivative claim,and the amount of a reasonable fee award,should the court decide to grant the motion.after a second hearing,the court denied the motion.
the minute order does not reflect the trial court rationale for denying the motion.the record supports the inference the court believed neither equitable doctrine applied and,even if the court had decided to award fees,cziraki and his counsel had not provided competent evidence to support a determination of a reasonable fee award.
discussion 
i.the trial court erred in concluding the common fund and substantial benefit doctrines do not apply.
cziraki contends the trial court should have applied the common fund and substantial benefit doctrines to award him legal fees incurred in the prosecution of the successful derivative claim on the corporation behalf.he argues the facts in this matter are different from those in the case law upon which the trial court relied.
in deciding cziraki motion,the trial court relied primarily on baker a case we discuss below to support its determination the common fund and substantial benefit doctrines do not permit an award of attorney fees in a derivative suit involving a close corporation with a small number of shareholders.both cziraki and thunder cats also focus primarily on the baker case in their appellate briefs.we note there is a surprising dearth of california cases factually similar to the one currently before this court.therefore,we expand the scope of our inquiry and consider the application of the equitable doctrines at issue in both california and decisions.
courts historically have applied the common fund and substantial benefit doctrines to shareholder derivative suits.
under the american rule,which is embodied in code of civil procedure section in california,as a general proposition each party to a litigation must pay his or her own attorneys fees.there are statutory exceptions to this rule,and the courts have created several exceptions pursuant to their inherent equitable powers.exceptions to the american rule created under the courts equitable powers include the common fund and substantial benefit doctrines 
i f the litigation has succeeded in creating or preserving a common fund for the benefit of a number of persons,the plaintiff may be awarded attorney fees out of that fund.citation.likewise,if a judgment confers a substantial benefit on a defendant,such as in a corporate derivative action,the defendant may be required to pay the attorney fees incurred by the plaintiff.in fletcher industries a california appellate court concluded a substantial benefit warranting an award of attorney fees to a successful plaintiff in a shareholder derivative action exists where the results of the action maintain the health of the corporation and raise the standards of fiduciary relationships and other economic behavior,or prevent s sic an abuse which would be prejudicial to the rights and interests of the corporation or affect the enjoyment or protection of an essential right to the stockholder interest.we agree with cziraki position the present case created for thunder cats both a common fund in the form of the monetary judgment against the majority shareholders and a substantial benefit in the form of the patent assignment,which preserved the corporation main asset.
courts generally apply the common fund and substantial benefit theories to cases involving a distinct class of beneficiaries among whom the costs of litigation can be fairly spread to prevent the unjust enrichment of class members at the expense of the successful litigant in a derivative action,the corporation represents the class of beneficiary shareholders.when the corporation pays attorney fees to the successful plaintiff,all shareholders indirectly share the cost of the beneficial litigation with the shareholder who brought the action.in contrast,when a shareholder brings a derivative suit for the true purpose of advancing his or her personal adverse interests,neither equitable doctrine allows an award of attorney fees 
as set forth above,many california cases discuss the common fund and substantial benefit doctrines in general we have found no california case,however,which has considered the application of these doctrines in a situation involving a representative or nonindividual judgment in favor of a close and extant corporation which is even remotely similar to the situation involved in the present action.
cziraki pursued a proper derivative claim and the litigation did not confer any individual benefit to him.
cziraki argues there is no legal or doctrinal restriction on applying the common fund or substantial benefit doctrine to recover legal fees incurred in pursuit of a derivative claim against a close corporation.cziraki urges this court to rule the doctrines apply whenever a shareholder derivative suit results in a substantial benefit to the corporation on whose behalf the plaintiff has brought suit,and the judgment confers upon the plaintiff no individual benefit separate from that received by all of the shareholders.for the reasons discussed below,we are inclined to agree.
as a starting point in our analysis,we discuss baker and our view this decision represents a more narrow holding than the trial court and thunder cats interpretations would suggest.baker and pratt were the only two shareholders of two construction companies and they also other business entities.after a falling out between them,they agreed to sever all of their business relationships and form separate construction companies.the agreement the parties reached which was later determined to be legally improper broke down,and baker was thereafter effectively shut out of the corporate enterprises.the dispute resulted in the filing of six separate lawsuits which the trial court consolidated.the lawsuits involved claims by baker against pratt,claims by baker solely owned construction company against one of the companies the parties jointly owned,and claims by baker for involuntary dissolution of the two jointly owned construction companies.the litigation also involved various.
the trial court entered a monetary judgment against pratt in favor of baker and each of the jointly owned construction companies.applying the common fund and substantial benefit doctrines,the court ordered one of the jointly owned companies to pay baker attorney fees the court of appeal reversed the award of attorney fees on the ground a class of passive beneficiaries must exist to justify an award of attorney fees under a common fund or substantial benefit theory the appellate court indicated a successful representative plaintiff could not invoke either doctrine to recover fees when all of the shareholders,in this instance only two,were parties to the litigation at issue and one shareholder benefited to the other detriment 
in avikian wtc financial corporation the court of appeal interpreted the passive beneficiary or identifiable class requirement in baker as a way to assist the court determination of whether the representative litigation in reality concerned a direct individual claim,which would rightfully bar recovery of attorney fees thus,baker makes clear that if corporate shareholders are seeking to advance their individual interests,rather than the interests of the corporation generally,no fees should be awarded on a common fund or substantial benefit theory.consequently,to the extent appellants in this case were seeking to vindicate individual as opposed to derivative rights they could not recover fees as a matter of law.
cziraki convincingly argues his derivative claims served a discernible interest separate from any individual adverse interest he may otherwise have sought to benefit.he pursued his personal adverse interests through separate individual claims rather than through his derivative claims,and judgment at trial conferred no benefit on cziraki as an individual claimant cziraki concedes he brought individual claims,which proved unsuccessful,alongside his successful derivative claim,but insists thunder cats was the only party to benefit from the litigation the benefits resulting from the litigation were thunder cats acquisition of the promised patent interests,the potential to exploit those interests,the preservation of the company wherewithal,and an interest in any future profits should they equally shared among the other shareholders.in no sense did cziraki derive any individual benefit from the litigation.neither the trial court nor thunder cats identified any evidence to suggest cziraki pursued his derivative claims in the hopes of receiving an individual benefit or adverse personal interest.
cziraki litigation conferred a substantial benefit on thunder cats,and the class of as a result of cziraki action.unlike the ultimate outcome in baker,any award to thunder cats would not be immediately passed on to individual shareholders through a dissolution proceeding.the judgment in the present case reveals a clear distinction between the derivative interests of the shareholders and their individual adverse interests.
like baker,all of the shareholders in thunder cats participated in the litigation.unlike baker,however,the judgment in the present case did not award cziraki any individual award or benefit,nor did the present case involve the dissolution of the corporate entity because the baker court conflated the ultimate interests of individual shareholders with those of the dissolved corporations,its holding does not provide any guidance for distinguishing an individual adverse interest from a generalized shareholder interest where a derivative suit involves a surviving close corporation and all of its shareholders.absent a trial court finding cziraki in reality was pursuing a personal adverse interest through his derivative claims,we see no reason to apply baker to the present case.
c.the weight of authority militates against applying baker in this case.
we have found a number of decisions which involve derivative shareholder suits concerning close corporations with two or three total shareholders these cases were decided in five different states over three decades,and every one of the courts directly or indirectly invoked the common fund or substantial benefit doctrine in support of its order the corporation p
