appellant richard schoon is a director,but not a stockholder,of troy corporation,a privately held delaware corporation.he filed a derivative action in the court of chancery on behalf of troy,alleging breaches of fiduciary duties by his fellow directors.schoon argued below that his role as a fiduciary to the corporation should permit him to have the same standing a stockholder has to bring a derivative action.the court of chancery dismissed his complaint.
schoon argues on appeal that this court should hold that a director has the right to bring a derivative action for the same reasons that equity has traditionally granted stockholders the right to do so.he contends that an extension of standing to a director will promote delaware public policy.in this opinion,we examine the traditional common law of standing and equity historic role in granting standing to stockholders to bring a derivative action on behalf of a corporation to prevent a complete failure of justice.although the delaware general assembly has the prerogative to confer standing upon directors by statute,it has not chosen to do so.because a stockholder derivative action is available to redress any breach of fiduciary duty,we decline to extend the doctrine of equitable standing to allow a director to bring a similar action.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the court of chancery.
facts and procedural background 
troy corporation is a privately held delaware corporation whose capital structure consists of three series of common stock.series a shares are entitled to elect four of the five troy directors.daryl smith,the ceo and chairman of troy,owns a majority of the series a shares,which he voted to elect himself and three others to the board of directors.series b stockholders have the right to elect the final member of the board.another privately held delaware corporation,steel,owns a majority of series b shares,which it voted to elect schoon,who owns no stock in troy,to the troy board of directors.series c shares have no voting rights.
schoon alleges that shortly after he became a director of troy,he discovered that the other three board members were beholden to smith,which enabled smith to dominate and control the board.schoon alleges that smith has taken actions on several occasions that were designed to entrench himself in power and,in turn,thwart potential transactions for the benefit of troy and its stockholders.
schoon claims in his complaint that none of the directors,other than he,is able to exercise independent judgment regarding smith or troy.he alleges that troy is being injured by the actions of his fellow directors and that his boardroom attempts to save the corporation from their breaches of fiduciary duties have been thwarted by smith dominance.in response to schoon complaint,the defendants moved to dismiss his complaint for lack of standing.
the court of chancery,relying on,court of chancery rule,and moran household international,concluded that delaware law does not recognize the right of a director,acting in that capacity,to sue on behalf of the corporation he or she serves or on behalf of its stockholders.the vice chancellor noted that t here are powerful policy interests embodied in both section of the delaware general corporation law and court of chancery rule that militate against recognizing the standing of an individual director to bring such litigation.any decision to alter those arrangements is properly left to the collective judgment of the general assembly.consequently,the vice chancellor dismissed schoon complaint for lack of standing.this appeal followed.
schoon contentions and our standard of review 
schoon argues that as a matter of equity and public policy,a director should be entitled to assert a derivative claim on behalf of the corporation for the same reasons that stockholders are permitted to do so.he urges that equipping directors with standing to sue derivatively is consistent with the fiduciary duties of directors and promotes the core delaware public policy of protecting against misconduct by faithless fiduciaries.because the court of chancery decision on director standing implicates rulings of law,we review it de novo 
standing and the rationale for equitable standing of stockholders 
standing is the requisite interest that must exist in the outcome of the litigation at the time the action is commenced.we have previously explained the concept 
the concept of standing,in its procedural sense,refers to the right of a party to invoke the jurisdiction of a court to enforce a claim or redress a grievance.it is concerned only with the question of who is entitled to mount a legal challenge and not with the merits of the subject matter of the controversy.in order to achieve standing,the plaintiff interest in the controversy must be distinguishable from the interest shared by other members of a class or the public in general.unlike the federal courts,where standing may be subject to stated constitutional limits,state courts apply the concept of standing as a matter of to avoid the rendering of advisory opinions at the behest of parties who are mere intermeddlers.
the traditional concept of standing confers upon the corporation the right to bring a cause of action for its own injury.
the equitable standing of a stockholder to bring a derivative action on behalf of a corporation has long been grounded upon the interests of justice.in england,the possibility of abuse of the corporation concentration of managerial power had been recognized and corrective efforts of a legal nature had appeared as early as by the time of the english industrial revolution,t he multiplication and dispersion of membership made impossible obstacles of ordinary rules relating to parties.likewise,by the time of the american industrial revolution,the individual stockholder was in need of a means of invoking judicial power to curb managerial abuse.
to prevent a failure of justice,courts of equity granted equitable standing to stockholders to sue on behalf of the corporation for managerial abuse in economic units which by their nature deprived some participants of an effective voice in their administration.the courts reasoned that without equitable standing,stockholders would be without any immediate and certain remedy,there would have been a complete failure of justice,and the general principles of equity and fairness would have been defeated today,the result of this doctrine is known as the stockholder derivative action.
as a creature of equity,the derivative action has generally served as a vehicle to enforce a corporate right there has been a singular purpose for this grant of equitable standing to a stockholder 
the stockholder does not bring such a suit because his rights have been directly violated,or because the cause of action is his,or because he is entitled to the relief sought he is permitted to sue in this manner simply in order to set in motion the judicial machinery of the court in fact,the plaintiff has no such direct interest the defendant corporation alone has a direct interest the plaintiff is permitted,notwithstanding his want of interest,to maintain the action solely to prevent an otherwise complete failure of justice 
our courts have consistently recognized this nature of the derivative suit as we have acknowledged,t he right of a stockholder to file a bill to litigate corporate rights is,therefore,solely for the purpose of preventing injustice where it is apparent that material corporate rights would not otherwise be protected.similarly,the court of chancery has noted 
the derivative action was developed by equity to enable stockholders to sue in the corporation name where those in control of the corporation refused to assert a claim belonging to the corporation.the nature of the derivative suit is first,it is the equivalent of a suit by the stockholders to compel the corporation to sue and second,it is a suit by the corporation,asserted by the stockholders in its behalf,against those liable to it 
statutory restrictions upon equitable standing of stockholders 
over time,the stockholder derivative action became stigmatized as a refuge of strike suit artists specializing in corporate extortion.in response,statutes to authorize and regulate this type of action were passed in delaware,the general assembly enacted,of the delaware general corporation law dgcl,titled stockholder derivative action allegation of stock ownership.section provides 
in any derivative suit instituted by a stockholder of a corporation,it shall be averred in the complaint that the plaintiff was a stockholder of the corporation at the time of the transaction of which such stockholder complains or that such stockholder stock thereafter devolved upon such stockholder by operation of law 
as explained by former chancellor seitz,this provision and its predecessor were enacted solely to prevent what has been considered an evil,namely,the purchasing of shares in order to maintain a derivative action designed to attack a transaction which occurred prior to the purchase of the stock.further,while the statute should be construed so as to reasonably effectuate its primary discourage a type of strike should not be construed so as to unduly encourage the camouflaging of transactions and thus prevent reasonable opportunities to rectify corporate aberrations.
section does not create the right to sue derivatively,but rather restricts that right.the equitable standing of a stockholder to bring a derivative action was judicially created but later restricted by a statutory requirement that a stockholder plaintiff must either have been a stockholder at the time of the transaction of which she complains or her stock must have devolved upon her thereafter by operation of law.the judicial creation of equitable standing for a stockholder to bring a derivative action demonstrates that equitable doctrine can be judicially extended to address new circumstances.accordingly,we can not agree with the court of chancery categorical conclusion that any decision to extend equitable standing to a director is for the general assembly to make.that decision is one the judiciary is empowered to make as well.we conclude,however,that there is no reason to do so at this time.
the extension of equitable doctrine 
historically,equity jurisdiction has taken its shape and its substance from the perceived inadequacies of the common law and the changing demands of a developing nation.as pomeroy equity jurisprudence states,that is the very nature of equity 
the true function of precedents is that of illustrating principles they are examples of the manner and extent to which principles have been applied they are the landmarks by which the court determines the course and direction in which principles have been carried.but with all this guiding,limiting,and restraining efficacy of prior decisions,the chancellor always has had,and always must have,a certain power and freedom of action,not possessed by the courts of law,of adapting the doctrines which he administers.he can extend those doctrines to new relations,and shape his remedies to new circumstances,if the relations and circumstances come within the principles of equity,where a court of law in analogous cases would be powerless to give any relief 
professor pomeroy continues although equity is and long has been in every sense of the word a system,and although it is impossible that any new general principles should be added to it,the truth stands,and always must stand,that the final object of equity is to do right and justice.
as this court has noted,it is well settled law that the judiciary has the power to overturn doctrine,so long as that doctrine has not been codified in statute.in discussing common law principles,we have recognized that t he law should be an ever developing body of doctrines,precepts,and rules designed to meet the evolving needs of society.here,we are dealing with equitable doctrine that also has been embodied in a statute we are asked to exercise our inherent authority to extend the doctrine of equitable standing to include a director at a time when the general assembly has not spoken on the subject.equitable doctrines may be extended so long as the extension is consistent with the principles of equity as woolley delaware practice explains 
it may safely be affirmed that the whole body of equity principles,both of right and remedy,was brought hither by our ancestors,together with the common law,on their emigration from england,as a part of their heritage of liberty.much of it,no doubt,lay dormant for a long period,no occasion or demand for a resort to portions of it for many purposes having arisen,but gradually as the increasing population of the new country begot new relations,there arose controversies and contests growing out of business,and the necessities for the redress of injuries which resulted from the breach of duties or the of obligations,that called for the use of the means to enforce observance through ancient remedies 
likewise,story equity jurisprudence explains that equity has an expansive power,to meet new exigencies and the sole question,applicable to the point of jurisdiction,must from time to time be whether such rights and wrongs do exist,and whether the remedies therefore in other courts,and especially in the courts of common law,are full,and adequate to redress.
having these principles and the rationale for the original grant of equitable standing to stockholders in mind,we examine the role of corporate directors and whether new exigencies require extending the doctrine of equitable standing to allow a director to bring a derivative action.
director independence 
we begin with the bedrock statutory principle that t he business and affairs of every corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors in discharging their management function,directors owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the corporation and its shareholders.these duties stem in part from the and agency relationship directors have to the corporation and stockholders that they serve our exposition of the duty of loyalty is traceable to guth loft,where we held that c orporate officers and directors are not permitted to use their position of trust and confidence to further their private interests 
while technically not trustees,they stand in a fiduciary relation to the corporation and its stockholders.a public policy,existing through the years,and derived from a profound knowledge of human characteristics and motives,has established a rule that demands of a corporate officer or director,peremptorily and inexorably,the most scrupulous observance of his duty he does this affirmatively to protect the interests of the corporation committed to his charge 
since guth,we have repeatedly emphasized the important role of independent directors aronson explains why director independence inheres in the rationale for the business judgment rule 
the requirement of director independence inheres in the conception and rationale of the business judgment rule.the presumption of propriety that flows from an exercise of business judgment is based in part on this unyielding precept.independence means that a director decision is based on the corporate merits of the subject before the board rather than extraneous considerations or influences.while directors may confer,debate,and resolve their differences through compromise,or by reasonable reliance upon the expertise of their colleagues and other qualified persons,the end result,nonetheless,must be that each director has brought his or her own informed business judgment to bear with specificity upon the corporate merits of the issues without regard for or succumbing to influences which convert an otherwise valid business decision into a faithless act 
we reiterated in beam that t he primary basis upon which a director independence must be measured is whether the director decision is based on the corporate merits of the subject before the board,rather than extraneous considerations or influences.as aronson and beam demonstrate,director independence does not require that a director remove the debate from the boardroom to the courtroom to resolve his or her differences with the board.nor have we defined independence to enlarge a director fundamental fiduciary duties so as to include a duty to sue on behalf of the corporation in his or her capacity as a director 
notwithstanding these considerations,schoon advances a practical argument for his standing to sue.he contends that to protect the interests of the corporation and the stockholders,a director should be permitted to sue derivatively because the director is in a better position to know and to make his allegations against the board without waiting for a stockholder to do so.this proposed efficiency overlooks the reason why the equitable standing doctrine was adopted which to reiterate is to prevent a complete failure of justice on behalf of the corporation 
no such complete failure is presented in this case.here,the stockholder who elected schoon steel is not only aligned with him,but also is actively litigating other matters involving troy before the court of chancery.we take judicial notice that steel has already begun using the tools at hand to obtain books and records information from troy given the duties of a director and the ability and the right of steel,as a stockholder,to bring a derivative action if steel deems it necessary,we perceive no new exigencies that require an extension of equitable standing to schoon,as a director 
the ali proposal for director standing 
in arguing that a grant of standing to directors will further the policy of protecting against misconduct by fiduciaries,schoon urges us to adopt the proposal of the american law institute ali that relates to director standing 
section c of the ali principles provides a director of a corporation has standing to commence and maintain a derivative action unless the court finds that the director is unable to represent fairly and adequately the interests of the shareholders.the commentary to this provision recognizes that this is a special right because most directors will already have standing to sue as shareholders.the ali principles also acknowledge that normally a director will bring his or her concerns regarding illegal or fraudulent conduct to the board and that the preference is for the entire board to provide a collegial response to a director concerns regarding potential misconduct the ali principles justify the creation of director derivative standing only for those occasions when the board is dominated by a controlling shareholder,in which the board will fail to act even when clear evidence of misbehavior or illegality has been presented to it the ali principles further reason that procedural requirements for maintaining a shareholder derivative suit,such as contemporaneous ownership and continuing ownership,do not apply to directors because the director fiduciary obligation entitles the director to seek to rectify wrongs to the corporation that do not directly injure the director.
to date,there is little,if any,case law adopting,or legal commentary approving,this particular ali proposal.except for the supreme court of pennsylvania blanket adoption of and no other state supreme court has expressly adopted the ali principles relating to standing.apart from one proposal reference of an intermediate appellate court to director standing schoon cites no case permitting a director,who does not own stock,to sue derivatively.we recognize,as did the ali,that new york provides by statute that a director can sue other directors on behalf of the corporation derivatively we regard the new york statute as confirming the prerogative of a legislature to confer standing upon a director by statute.to date,the delaware general assembly has not chosen to do so.
given the absence of statutory authority for his standing to sue as a director,schoon argument must succeed or fail on the merits of extending the doctrine of equitable standing judicially.we have explained the rationale for this equitable doctrine and decline to enlarge it by embracing a policy that will divert the doctrine from its original purpose to prevent a complete failure of justice.schoon has not shown that a complete failure of justice will occur unless he is granted standing to sue as a director.a stockholder derivative action would fully and adequately redress any injuries to troy resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty by its board.accordingly,we decline to extend equitable standing to schoon to sue derivatively in his capacity as a director.
conclusion 
the judgment of the court of the chancery dismissing schoon complaint for lack of standing is affirmed.
