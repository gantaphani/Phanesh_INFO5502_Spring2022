steven thorn,derrick mckinney and rick malizia the defendants appeal the district court entry of summary judgment against them in this case.they argue that numerous material fact disputes prohibited the district court from imposing liability on them under several and provisions of the federal securities laws and from imposing a disgorgement remedy and several civil penalties on them.durietha dziorny,allen george,carl jackson and frederick harris the relief defendants,so named because they profited from the defendants scheme but did not facilitate it also challenge the district court entry of summary judgment,arguing that they should not be required to remit the entirety of their gains.we affirm.
in this action,the securities exchange commission sec alleged that the defendants ran a ponzi scheme.with the assistance of malizia and mckinney,thorn raised million from individuals in the united states and abroad that purportedly would be invested in a secretive european securities market.as advertised by the defendants,the investment opportunity had all of the hallmarks of a free lunch the investments would be virtually and would generate lucrative returns.they also represented that the federal reserve bank was involved in the investments and that the investments would benefit humanitarian projects.as it turned out,the sec alleged,the european market was not secretive none of the money was ever invested in this market or any other neither the federal reserve bank nor any humanitarian project was involved in the programs the only returns came from other individuals initial investments and the defendants took much of the other money that was not used to pay fictitious returns for their own use.
the sec showed that the defendants used two investment programs to commit the fraud.the defendants started the first program,referred to as the global or gig program,in february and raised about million under it through march.they started the second program,referred to as the financial ventures or fv program,in november and raised about million under it through november.in both programs,the defendants told potential investors that their funds would be used to invest in,or finance the trading of,european securities,including medium term notes.thorn represented that these securities,traded in secretive markets,could be bought at discounts by unidentified traders.all three defendants represented that the investors money would be pooled together to reach threshold levels for preferred rates of return.and all three defendants represented that the investments would be risk free and that they would generate significant monthly returns.thorn and mckinney also represented that the federal reserve board was involved in the programs,and thorn added that a humanitarian project would benefit from the trading.in the fv program,thorn also told investors that the funds would remain in a united states bank,that the investors would retain control of the funds and that the funds would be used to mirror money at a european bank that would serve as collateral for the trader line of credit.
the sec also established that each of the defendants was more than a casual participant in the scheme.thorn testified that he was the sole owner and managing director of global investors,a company he formed in,and the namesake of the gig program.he also created new entities to further the investment scheme,including first financial ventures in,second financial ventures in and third financial ventures in,the namesakes of the fv program.thorn personally communicated with investors about the investment programs,and he received approximately million from investors including those recruited by malizia and mckinney.for their parts,malizia raised million from investors between september and march,and mckinney raised million from investors between february and april.
as it turns out and as the undisputed evidence showed,the defendants never used the investors money to finance or trade in any security instrument.instead,the fv investors money,which was to remain segregated in individual investors accounts,was swept from the deposit account into accounts in the name of financial ventures,which thorn and his associate stuart rose controlled,and commingled with other investors money.and the defendants used money invested in both the gig and fv programs to pay purported profits to other investors or to make extravagant personal purchases.for example,as detailed in the declaration of luz aguillar,a senior sec investigator 
o n november,one global investors account had a negative balance of approximately.from november,to december,thorn deposited from two i nvestors into that account.thorn used those funds as follows a from november,to december,he paid to seven investors b from december,to february,he paid to fifteen investors c on december,he paid to cartier,to purchase a diamond ring and d from december,to february,a total of was used by thorn for his benefit,including in legal expenses,transferred to his personal account at key bank,and the purchase of a cashier check to close the account this cashier check was cashed by relief defendant durietha dziorney thorn fiancee.
ja.altogether,thorn spent million on personal expenses,including on a diamond ring,toward a million home,on automobile lease payments,on home furniture and on legal expenses.
malizia took a similar path.from september to march,malizia and rmaz,a corporate entity through which he operated,raised million from investors and sent million of that money to thorn.from june to march,malizia and rmaz received about million from thorn and used of that money to pay purported profits to various investors.he used of the remaining as follows for a check to himself and his then fiancee in gifts to his two brothers to an individual who had not invested in the scheme to a third financial ventures account and for personal expenses including loan repayments.
so did mckinney.through itp,a corporate entity through which he operated,mckinney raised over million from investors between february and april,million of which he sent to thorn.mckinney used the remaining well as over in unidentified follows in cash withdrawals in payments to himself in various debit card purchases,mortgage payments and bank fees in payments to entities in checks to itp and in transfers to unrelated itp brokerage accounts,which was subsequently lost in domestic trading.
the sec also introduced the expert testimony of leonard zawistowski,a senior special investigator for the federal reserve,who explained that the defendants investment programs contained many of the features of a ponzi scheme 
t he d efendants claim to invest in offshore jurisdictions the investments are allegedly made through the purchase of bank instruments with blocked funds the instruments are alleged to be traded at deep discounts to generate high yields the d efendants promise extraordinary returns to investors the d efendants claim involvement by the federal reserve in the purported trades and the d efendant s claim that the programs may involve some humanitarian project or goal.
op.at summarizing sec exhibit.
all three of the defendants,the evidence also showed,were not neophytes.thorn was a stockbroker at merrill lynch and morgan stanley dean witter from march to november.sec exhibit.malizia was a registered representative at merrill lynch from october to may when he met thorn and a morgan stanley branch office manager from to.mckinney worked as a registered representative at merrill lynch from november to august when he met thorn and as an insurance agent and stockbroker for hamilton investments,linsco private ledger and mutual service corporation from february to december.
despite this experience,thorn never received any documents confirming that trading had occurred in the investment programs,and he never witnessed any trading.instead of verifying the validity of the trading program,thorn stated that he relied on information from associates and third parties to satisfy himself that the purported investment scheme was sound.malizia and mckinney likewise concede that they never received any documents confirming purported trades.and while they both claimed to have made inquiries regarding the veracity of thorn investments,neither of them could provide details of those discussions.
on april,the sec filed its civil complaint against the three defendants,alleging fraud under the federal securities laws,see a,b c,and,as well as unregistered trading under a.the district court granted the sec request to freeze the defendants assets that same day.on october,the district court granted the sec motion for summary judgment,holding the three defendants liable under the and provisions.
the district court also granted a permanent injunction against future trading,finding that the defendants had not acknowledged wrongdoing in their egregious conduct and that thorn had violated the district court orders on multiple occasions.op.at.the district court ordered that thorn disgorge in misappropriated funds and pay in prejudgment interest.the district court ordered malizia to disgorge an amount to be determined after the receiver final report,plus prejudgment interest.and it ordered mckinney to disgorge in misappropriated funds and pay in prejudgment interest.id.at.finally,the court found that third tier civil penalties in the amount of each were appropriate for all three defendants,as the violations involved fraud,deceit,manipulation,or deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement and directly or indirectly resulted in substantial losses or created a significant risk of substantial losses to other persons,see.op.at.
roughly people invested in the programs.many investors lost substantial amounts of money,but of them reported gains,amounting to approximately million in overpayments from the defendants.after calculating the amount of money available to return to defrauded investors,the receiver projected that the money remaining after the end of the program sufficed to permit investors to receive percent of their original investments.to consolidate the remaining funds,the district court granted summary judgment to the sec against a number of investors who received improper profits from thorn and ordered them to disgorge their gains to the receiver.these investors,otherwise known as the relief defendants,included durietha dziorney,carl jackson,frederick harris and allen george.op.at.
with respect to dziorney,who is now thorn wife,the district court determined that thorn spent investor funds when he bought her a carat diamond engagement ring worth and when he gave her to lease a saab automobile and for unspecified purposes.id.at.since she received these items from thorn gains and since she otherwise had no legitimate claim to them,the district court ordered that she disgorge both the ring and.id.jackson,who invested with thorn,received back from thorn,but the sec traced those funds to contributions from other investors.jackson did not dispute that the sec had traced the to the contributions of other investors,and accordingly the district court ordered jackson to disgorge the gains plus in prejudgment interest.id.at.harris invested with thorn and received from him.because the sec traced the to other investors contributions and because harris conceded that he did not know the source of the funds he received,id.at,the district court ordered that he disgorge plus in prejudgment interest,id.at.in a default judgment order,the district court similarly ordered another relief defendant,allen george,to disgorge money.op,at.george had invested with the defendants and had received in return,but george also presented no evidence identifying the source of the funds he received and admitted that the money could have come from other investors.concluding that the had been obtained illegally from other investors and that george had no legitimate claim to the money,the district court ordered him to disgorge plus in prejudgment interest.id.
we review de novo the district court entry of summary judgment.dicarlo potter,cir.section a of the securities act of makes it unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly in the offer or sale of any securities 
to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,or

c to engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
to establish violations of these provisions,the sec must show that the defendants engaged in misrepresentations or omissions of material facts made in connection with the offer,sale or purchase of securities with scienter on the part of the defendants.ernst ernst hochfelder,d.a fact is material if a substantial likelihood exists that a reasonable shareholder would consider the fact important in making his investment decision and a reasonable shareholder would view the information as having significantly altered the total mix of information.basic,levinson,d.scienter may be established by proof of recklessness highly unreasonable conduct which is an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care.mansbach prescott,ball turben,cir.
section c of the exchange act,c,prohibits a broker or dealer from using any manipulative or deceptive device,as defined in rule,to induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of any security.the elements of a c violation are the same as those for a violation of the provisions described above,with a similar scienter requirement that a statement be made with knowledge or reasonable grounds to believe that it is untrue or misleading.b.
section a of the exchange act,a,makes it unlawful for any broker or dealer to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to effect any transactions in,or to induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of,any security unless such broker or dealer is registered with the commission.id.
on appeal,the three defendants first challenge the district court conclusions that the sec produced sufficient evidence to establish as a matter of law each defendant liability under the and unregistered trading provisions.those arguments are best viewed in the context of the district court reasoning with respect to each defendant and each violation.
as to thorn,the district court reasoned 
it is undisputed that thorn represented to investors that their money would be used to purchase and trade in securities.no evidence has been adduced to support thorn position.the evidence of record shows that thorn used investors money to pay other investors as well as to support a seemingly lavish lifestyle for himself and his friends.thorn representation as to how investors money would be used was clearly false and obviously material because it related to the very substance of the act of investing.in addition,the court finds no genuine issue of material fact as to whether thorn acted with the requisite scienter to establish violation of the provisions of the securities laws.thorn representations and actions were,at a minimum,reckless.thorn and the other named d efendants worked for prominent brokerage firms,yet they represented to investors that incredible returns could be made,risk free,in a secretive european market thorn failed to tell investors that a substantial portion of the investments would finance the extravagant living expenses of thorn,his fiancee,and others.
op.at.the district court also found thorn liable under a and c,as thorn solicited numerous investors to purchase securities in his offerings and held himself out as an intermediary between the investors and the purported trading programs.id.at.also,thorn received compensation in the form of investors money.id.given that it was uncontested that thorn was not registered with the sec,id.at,the district court found thorn liable under a.finally,the district court repeated its finding that thorn acted at least recklessly in his role in the scheme.id.at.
as to malizia,the district court reasoned 
in his testimony before the sec,malizia stated that thorn told him that there would be no risk to principal on the investments and that profits could be expected.malizia did not know where the money would be invested,other than it was to be in a foreign market,nor did he know why information about the purported investments was not available.furthermore,malizia received no documentation regarding the purported investments other than those which thorn had him sign to participate in the program.nevertheless,malizia contributed money toward the investments and he solicited others to join in the purported investments offered by thorn.malizia also relayed any information thorn gave him to others who put money into the programs through rmaz.in addition,malizia testified that he paid purported profits to investors,knowing that the same were not profits.malizia paid investors with money from his account 
while malizia contends that he truly believed thorn and that he himself lost money in the purported trades,these facts do not controvert the evidence that malizia encouraged people to invest in a program,the details of which he knew virtually nothing.in view of malizia former employment at several brokerage firms,this court has little trouble concluding that malizia knew,or should have known,that thorn scheme was fraudulent.the court therefore concludes that malizia acted with the requisite scienter to establish liability under the provisions of the securities laws.malizia conduct in encouraging others to invest in thorn purported programs was,at a minimum,reckless for one with his past professional experience.
id.at citations omitted.with respect to a,the court concluded that malizia solicited investors to purchase securities even though he was not registered with the sec.with respect to c,the court concluded that malizia at least acted recklessly regardless of whether he believed what thorn told him about the scheme or whether malizia himself invested money.id.at.
as to mckinney,the district court reasoned 
mckinney concedes that he received money from investors,that he had no personal knowledge about the source of the payments he received from thorn,and that he actually paid investors with other investors money.furthermore,mckinney testified on deposition that he informed investors that there was little or no risk to their principal because thorn would invest the money in exempt european securities,united states treasury securities or overseas bonds i t is also undisputed that mckinney and his company,itp,used at least million of money they received from investors for their own purposes 
further,given mckinney prior professional experience as a stockbroker and employment at a brokerage firm,there is no genuine issue of material fact that mckinney conduct was at least reckless,so as to satisfy the scienter requirement.
id.at citation omitted.as with the two other defendants,the district court also concluded that mckinney had acted as a broker or dealer while unregistered with the sec,id.at,in violation of a,and acted at least recklessly,id.at,establishing liability under c.
in response to the district court analysis of his claim,thorn generally complains that the district court repeatedly used language in its facts section that the sec allege d certain facts in the case,then argues that the district court relied only on the sec amended complaint to establish these facts.more specifically,he contends that the record contains no evidence to support the district court statement that thorn told gig program investors that their funds would be transferred to an overseas bank where the money would serve as collateral for a line of credit.see id.at.but this statement is found within a series of introductory paragraphs laying out a summary of the sec allegations against the defendants.the district court supported this summary with pages of detailed factual development,citing documents admitted into evidence and testimony of experts,investigators and the defendants themselves.as to this particular fact,at any rate,thorn liability for securities fraud in this scheme does not turn on where he told gig investors their money would be kept.in like manner,thorn alleges that the district court relied on nothing more than the sec complaint when it stated that thorn told investors that the investment was risk free and would generate significant monthly returns.not true.the district court cited thorn own testimony and malizia and mckinney depositions in which each of the defendants repeated these representations under oath.see id.at.
second,thorn alleges that the district court failed to examine his second accounting disclosure before granting summary judgment,alleging that the document proves that he was engaged in a legitimate investment program.but thorn does not dispute,nor make any reference to,the district court november,order explaining that thorn first made reference to the document in a reply filing that improperly gave thorn the last word on the sec motion for summary judgment,that was filed just hours before the court granted summary judgment and that the district court did in fact examine before issuing its decision.nor does thorn offer any substantive explanation as to what it is within this document that proves he properly invested the money he received.
third,thorn relatedly takes issue with the district court conclusion that he produced no evidence of actual trading involving medium term notes.thorn br.at citing.op.at.he again claims that his second accounting disclosure provides such evidence but again without any explanation as to how.thorn adds that the district court found no similarity between the common situation in which,for example,share owners in mutual funds never receive confirmation slips of specific trades the f und makes,as opposed to a f und m anager quarterly summaries of the members profits and losses,by category.thorn br.at.we,too,are unmoved by thorn analogy.as between a simple share owner and a fund manager,it is clear that thorn more closely played the role of a fund manager.and a mutual fund manager assuredly could be expected to produce documentary records of the trades that the fund made in a given quarter.
fourth,thorn argues that the district court erred in finding no genuine issue of material fact as to the scienter element of these offenses.he asserts that he had no knowledge of any unauthorized investments in either the gig program or the fv program,that he was simply one of several partners in the programs who had invested his own money.we have little difficulty deciding that no rational trier of fact would agree.thorn admitted that he created and led the gig program and the fv program.he alone authored several venture updates informing investors of the status of their investments based on information he had received from third parties yet had not verified.he knew that malizia and mckinney were collecting investments from others for the fv program,he received money from them,and he gave them purported profits to distribute within their groups.even if we were to accept thorn position that he was not aware of any unauthorized investors,moreover,thorn does not deny that he induced investments from authorized investors.nor does he cite any authority for the proposition that one can not victimize a business partner through securities fraud.and the district court correctly concluded that he acted at least therefore with the requisite he failed to witness or receive any documentation confirming that securities had been traded and when he failed to verify the legitimacy of the investment programs he advertised.see sec jakubowski,cir deliberate ignorance is a form of knowledge.in re kidder peabody sec,d,r eckless disregard of the truth satisfies the scienter requirements of the provisions when the defendant deliberately failed to acquire the information that would have indicated to her that her statements were false or misleading.neither does thorn deny that he spent investor funds on personal expenses,a fact that itself establishes the requisite state of mind for committing securities fraud.see lowry sec,cir sec infinity group,cir.
fifth,thorn points to evidence that a market for european bank notes exists and that it bears similarities to the investment scheme he promoted.but even if everything thorn says in this respect is true,it does not contradict the sec evidence that thorn never invested the money he received in any market.that thorn spent millions of investor dollars on personal expenses and that he has failed to establish any documentary evidence of trading in this market suffices to establish that,regardless of the reality of the underlying market,thorn failed to invest money that he said he would invest.
sixth,thorn challenges the credibility of expert witness leonard zawistowski,who testified that the defendants scheme matched the characteristics of a ponzi scheme.most of the specifics of the challenge,however,deal with details irrelevant to zawistowski ultimate conclusion,to say nothing of the ultimate outcome of the case against thorn.chief among these challenges is the contention that european note markets do exist.again,however,thorn fails to prove that his advertised investment scheme existed and that he made any sort of investment at all.what is more,as the district court concluded,thorn challenges to the expert testimony do not determine the outcome of the case.op.at.even in the absence of this testimony,sufficient evidence establishes all of the elements of securities fraud.
seventh,thorn argues that the venture updates authored by him can not constitute fraud because he distributed them only to authorized investors who had already invested.even if true,however,this contention does not affect the disposition of the summary judgment motion.as detailed above,the sec produced sufficient evidence of the required elements without resorting to the language of the updates.the updates merely serve to bolster this evidence by showing the evasive method thorn used to delay paying out profits and by showing that thorn either knowingly made false statements or acted with recklessness in passing on false statements without independently checking them.what thorn told the investors after they invested in this scheme,in other words,merely bolsters the sec evidence of what thorn told them before they invested.
eighth,thorn argues that fv program investors could indeed control their own funds as they were swept into accounts only for the purpose of verifying the consolidated funds to initiate the credit verifications that would permit the transactions they intended.thorn br.at.to support this assertion,thorn cites his own deposition testimony that these funds could be used as collateral for a line of credit in europe without removing them from the american bank or from the control of individual investors.but as aguillar declaration sufficiently establishes through bank record analysis,this statement by thorn was part of the fraudulent device.other than one unexplained reference to rose testimony,thorn offers nothing more to contest aguillar analysis of the bank records.in the face of this testimony and the other undisputed evidence in the record,thorn has not created a material fact dispute.
for his part,malizia first argues,without citing any record evidence,that he formed rmaz only to pool money from close family members and friends and that he did not know that these people in turn were recruiting other investors.but malizia produces no evidence to support this position.and,of course,malizia could have produced testimony along these lines from these individuals but apparently chose not to do so.his own denial of the allegation does not suffice by itself to create a material fact dispute.
second,malizia takes on the district court conclusions that no money was invested and that he spent some of the money on personal expenses.after purporting to recount the details of his own nary a single citation to the states that he never knew that thorn was not investing the money,that thorn told him that the million malizia received was legitimate investment profit and that malizia personally suffered a net deficit in the scheme.yet none of these defenses,whether factually accurately or not,makes a difference to malizia appeal.as the district court correctly concluded and as malizia nowhere contests,his scienter was established through his failure independently to verify the legitimacy of the scheme.malizia further claims that he did not pass on illegitimate profits to rmaz investors but rather bought out those investors.but the only record evidence he cites to support this position is a list of rmaz payees,a list that does not counter the charge of illegitimate profit payments and does not explain why some investors were receiving money traceable to others investments.malizia also asserts that he used his own salary to pay for the personal expenses.but again he offers no record evidence to contest the sec proof that he used funds traceable to other peoples investments to pay for these personal expenses.
third,malizia makes a general argument that the sec lumped the defendants together without specific evidence as to the liability of each of them individually.but as detailed above,the sec provided sufficient evidence to establish all of the elements for each of the defendants individually.that the district court summarized this evidence at times by referring to the defendants collectively does not undermine the sufficiency of the evidence as to each of them individually.
finally,malizia contends that he was not a broker under a.a broker,however,is defined as any person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the accounts of others.a a.and the district court correctly referred to several factors that may qualify an individual as a broker none of which malizia contests,including regular participation in securities transactions,employment with the issuer of the securities,payment by commission as opposed to salary,history of selling the securities of other issuers,involvement in advice to investors and active recruitment of investors.op.at citing sec hansen,civ,wl,at,and sec national executive planners.malizia argues only that he was not employed by the issuer of the securities and that,because he ultimately suffered a net loss in the scheme,he did not receive compensation for his work.even if we accept both arguments,they do not suffice to counter the sec proof that malizia was regularly involved in communications with and recruitment of investors for the purchase of securities.see,sec kenton capital,d,finding defendants acted as brokers when they together solicited investors and received a total of million in investments.
in addition to raising many of the same challenges raised by thorn and rejected above,mckinney repeatedly asserts that he was unaware that the scheme was illegitimate and that he believed that the money thorn distributed to him amounted to legitimate profits from investments.but like malizia,mckinney cites no record evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact on this score,and he does not contest the district court conclusion that his failure to investigate the veracity of the program sufficed to establish scienter.
second,mckinney challenges his li
