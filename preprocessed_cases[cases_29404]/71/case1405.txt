discussion 
plaintiffs contend that each defendant willfully participated in violating section,as that term is used in section.they maintain that in sustaining the defendants demurrers the trial court effectively read the word participates out of section,requiring instead that each defendant be alleged to have independently violated section by personally making a false or misleading statement and by selling stock.accordingly,they assert that the demurrers were improperly sustained.although our supreme court has yet to address this issue see stormedia,superior court cal th,fn,d,we disagree with plaintiffs position.
