this is an interlocutory appeal from an order by the court of chancery that granted the plaintiff motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.at issue is the legal meaning and effect of a court of chancery order dismissing a derivative suit without prejudice on rule demand required grounds.this appeal also requires our analysis of the court of chancery holding in harris that a plaintiff does not need to make a demand before amending a derivative complaint where a new board of directors comes into power,if the amended derivative claims were validly in litigation before the new board assumed control.
in this proceeding,we conclude the ambiguous record permitted the filing of an amended complaint.we hold prospectively,however,that a dismissal without prejudice and without explicit leave to amend operates as a final judgment.we approve the court of chancery rationale in harris carter we further hold that,for purposes of determining whether demand is required before filing an amended derivative complaint,the term validly in litigation means a proceeding that can or has survived a motion to dismiss.this latter holding requires us to reverse the interlocutory order of the court of chancery and to remand this matter for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
procedural history 
the plaintiff,mark zimmerman the plaintiff alleges,in this derivative action,that the defendants,richard braddock,jay walker,and nicholas,collectively,the selling defendants,all directors of the nominal defendant,priceline or the company,engaged in insider trading of the company stock and misappropriated the company confidential information.the other defendants,who with the selling defendants constituted priceline board of directors are daniel schulman,paul allaire,ralph bahna,paul blackney,william ford,marshall loeb,nancy peretsman,and heidi miller collectively,the individual defendants.
the plaintiff filed his original complaint on november.after the defendants moved to dismiss that complaint,the plaintiff filed an amended complaint on june,the first amended complaint.the defendants again moved to dismiss.on december,the court of chancery entered an order dismissing the first amended complaint in its entirety for failure to comply with the demand requirement of court of chancery rule the dismissal order.the dismissal order was without prejudice.the plaintiff did not seek to appeal the dismissal order.
on april,the plaintiff filed a second amended complaint the second amended complaint.the defendants took the position that the plaintiff must file a new complaint because the first amended complaint had been dismissed in its entirety and the dismissal order was final.the plaintiff then filed a motion pursuant to court of chancery rule for leave to file the second amended complaint.the defendants opposed that motion.
when the plaintiff filed his original complaint on november,priceline had an board of directors the old board.between november,and april,five members of the old board were replaced by new directors.two additional board seats were also created and filled with new directors.by the time the plaintiff filed his second amended complaint on april,priceline had a board of directors the new board that included only six members of the old board.accordingly,it had a majority of new directors.
following oral argument,the court of chancery issued a bench ruling that dismissed three of the four counts in the second amended complaint for failure to make a demand upon the new board.it reserved decision on the remaining count,count i.the court of chancery subsequently issued a letter opinion granting the plaintiff motion for leave to file the second amended complaint as to count i.the court of chancery held that demand as to count i was properly excused with respect to the old board,the priceline board of directors in place at the time the original complaint was filed.
issues on appeal 
the defendants contend the court of chancery erred when it granted the plaintiff leave to file the second amended complaint after the dismissal without prejudice of the plaintiff first amended complaint.the defendants submit that the entry of the dismissal order and the expiration of the reargument period,rendered the dismissal order a final order that extinguished the court of chancery authority to entertain any amendment of the dismissed complaint.because amendment was improper,the defendants argue that the plaintiff was required to file a new complaint to reassert any claims.
alternatively,the defendants argue that the court of chancery erred when it based its demand futility analysis of count i of the second amended complaint on the composition of the priceline board of directors as it existed when the original complaint was filed.the defendants contend that,if an amendment of the dismissed complaint was permissible,demand futility should have been assessed with respect to the priceline board in place at the time the plaintiff filed the second amended complaint.because it is undisputed that a majority of the directors in office at the time the second amended complaint was filed were disinterested and capable of exercising independent judgment with respect to the plaintiff claims,the defendants submit that the plaintiff can not satisfy the demand requirement of rule.
the court of chancery rejected both of the defendants arguments.first,it ruled that the dismissal order did not operate as a final judgment of dismissal and was understood,at least implicitly,to allow an amendment of the first amended complaint.second,it ruled that because count i was part of the first amended complaint,it was validly in litigation at the time the second amended complaint was filed.therefore,it assessed demand futility based on the old board in place when that complaint was filed rather than on the new board in place when the second amended complaint was filed.
final judgment dispute 
under delaware law,the court of chancery retains jurisdiction over an action until it enters a final judgment a final judgment is generally defined as one that determines the merits of the controversy or defines the rights of the parties and leaves nothing for future determination or consideration.in short,a final judgment is one that determines all the claims as to all the parties.the test for whether an order is final is whether the trial court has clearly declared its intention that the order be the court final act in a case.
the defendants argue that the court of chancery dismissal of the first amended complaint comports with the definition of a final judgment because the court of chancery held that the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts with particularity to excuse demand and,therefore,this action must be dismissed under rule.the defendants contend that that the dismissal order plainly dismissed the action in its entirety.the defendants submit that a dismissal of a complaint in its entirety,even though without prejudice,is nevertheless a dismissal,except that the plaintiff right to file a new complaint is not precluded by res judicata 
the plaintiff responds that permitting a second amendment was proper because the court of chancery order dismissing the first amended complaint clearly was not a final judgment.the plaintiff relies upon the fact that the order dismissing the first amended complaint was without prejudice.therefore,the plaintiff asserts,a dismissal without prejudice afforded him the opportunity to submit a motion for leave to file the second amended complaint.
rule aaa confusion 
the confusion in the record of this proceeding about the finality of the dismissal order is attributable to the fact that the amendment to the original complaint was filed immediately after the court of chancery adopted a new rule of procedure.effective june,the court of chancery adopted rule aaa governing amendments to pleadings.three weeks later,on june,and in response to a motion to dismiss,the plaintiff filed the first amended complaint in this proceeding.
the defendants moved to dismiss the first amended complaint.at the april,hearing on that motion,the plaintiff counsel raised the issue of whether,pursuant to rule aaa,the plaintiff should be allowed an opportunity to amend the first amended complaint if the court of chancery would deem that plaintiff allegations are insufficient in some way now either on demand or on the claims.the court of chancery replied 
my recollection is that rule aaa went into effect before the first amended complaint was filed,but that still does mean i do have discretion to allow an amendment.
i am going to defer any formal consideration of the rule application,in part because i think i first need to figure out what i going to do with the motion to dismiss.it may or may not become an issue,but if the case is dismissed,i sure i hear from plaintiff counsel seeking leave to amend and we deal with it on that basis as to whether i should provide relief or not.
i do know any better way of doing it.i do certainly feel competent or qualified at this point to exercise my discretion as to what i ought to do.i want to hear more about it if i have to,and i think we have spent enough time on this today.
the foregoing comments demonstrate that the court of chancery did not contemplate that an order dismissing the first amended complaint would necessarily preclude another motion to amend,notwithstanding the recent adoption of rule aaa.the court of chancery specifically stated,i want to hear more about plaintiff request for leave to amend pursuant to rule aaa,and if the first amended complaint were dismissed,i hear from plaintiff counsel seeking leave to amend and we deal with it on that basis as to whether i should provide relief or not.
eight months later,the court of chancery subsequently dismissed the first amended complaint without prejudice.citing rule aaa,the court held that dismissal with prejudice would not be just under the circumstances because of the complex and intertwined relationships among priceline,the individual defendants,and the various entities with which they are associated and because of the apparently status of certain facts,the absence of which may have materially affected the outcome.thereafter,when considering the plaintiff motion to file the second amended complaint,the court of chancery stated in an effort to deal with rule aaa,i dismissed plaintiffs first amended complaint without prejudice.
confusion precludes finality 
the third circuit court of appeals has held that a dismissal without prejudice amounts to an implicit invitation to the plaintiff to amend the complaint consistent with the third circuit holding in borelli city of reading,the record reflects that the court of chancery thought its dismissal of the first amended complaint without prejudice pursuant to rule aaa would allow the plaintiff to submit a motion for leave to file the second amended complaint.in ruling on the motion for leave to file a second amendment,the court of chancery also concluded that all parties understood that the plaintiff would seek to amend his pleading 
as to count i,i am going to allow plaintiff to seek to amend his amended complaint i do that on the basis that it was the understanding of the parties that the plaintiff would be filing a motion to amend.the plaintiff and his counsel obviously believed that he would be able to amend the complaint in the same action.based on communication that occurred between counsel after my dismissal of the amended complaint,i satisfied that it was the defendants understanding as well.
the court of chancery correctly concluded that rule aaa permits it to grant leave to amend after a complaint is dismissed without prejudice.to accomplish that result,however,the order of dismissal without prejudice should have expressly authorized the plaintiff to file an amended complaint by a date certain.the following language is a good example of the proper expression 
i n accordance with rule aaa of the court of chancery rules,the dismissal will be without prejudice,as good cause has been shown to support a finding that dismissal with prejudice would not be just under the circumstances.therefore,the court grants the plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint within days of the date hereof 
in borelli,the third circuit stated 
since it may be difficult to determine whether the district court thought an amendment was possible and whether the plaintiff is willing or able to amend,we suggest that district judges expressly state,where appropriate,that the plaintiff has leave to amend within a specified period of time,and that application for dismissal of the action may be made if a timely amendment is not forthcoming within that time 
unfortunately,in this proceeding,the court of chancery order of dismissal without prejudice did not expressly authorize the plaintiff to seek leave to file another amended complaint by a date certain.an ambiguous record was created by the court of chancery good faith effort to comply with the then new rule aaa,by following the third circuit practice of implicitly inviting an amendment after a dismissal without prejudice.that ambiguity leads us to conclude that the dismissal order in this case must be construed as if it had expressly granted the plaintiff leave to file another amended complaint.that construction means the court of chancery order dismissing the first amended complaint without prejudice was not a final judgment 
therefore,the court of chancery retained jurisdiction to consider the plaintiff motion for leave to file the second amended complaint.under the circumstances in the record,this court can not conclude that the court of chancery abused its discretion in granting the plaintiff leave to file the second amended complaint.before we address the court of chancery decision not to dismiss count i of the second amended complaint,however,it is important to provide some guidance for the future about the operation of rule aaa.
finality construed prospectively 
the purpose of rule aaa was to curtail the number of times that the court of chancery was required to adjudicate multiple motions to dismiss the same action.rule aaa was written to accomplish that objective by requiring plaintiffs,when confronted with a motion to dismiss pursuant to any of ch.b,c or,to elect to either stand on the complaint and answer the motion or,to amend or seek leave to amend the complaint before the response to the motion was due.rule aaa makes this election extremely significant by providing that,if a plaintiff chooses to file an answering brief in opposition to a motion to dismiss rather than amend the complaint,any subsequent dismissal pursuant to the motion is with prejudice,unless the court finds for good cause that dismissal with prejudice would not be just under all the circumstances 
contrary to the third circuit holding in borelli,it appears every other federal appellate court has rejected the view that a dismissal without prejudice implicitly means with leave to amend.we are persuaded by the rationale of the majority view.we hold that a final judgment results,for purposes of appeal in delaware,whenever a complaint is dismissed without prejudice unless the plaintiff is expressly granted leave to amend within a time certain 
accordingly,we hold that dismissals with and without prejudice are equally appealable as final judgments the phrase without prejudice in an order of dismissal by a delaware judge is not to be construed as an implicit invitation to file an amended complaint.instead,the phrase without prejudice will mean only that the otherwise final judgment does not operate as a res judicata bar to preclude a subsequent lawsuit on the same cause of action if leave to amend a complaint is contemplated by a delaware judge following a dismissal without prejudice,there must be an express statement to that effect in the order,in which case the order will be an interlocutory decree.our holdings are intended to avoid future confusion and provide certainty regarding the ability to file an amendment,the finality of a judgment of dismissal without prejudice,and the time in which to file an appeal.
