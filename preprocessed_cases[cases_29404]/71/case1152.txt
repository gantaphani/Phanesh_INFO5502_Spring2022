following the breakup of in the,the williams companies wmb,an energy group,devised a plan to run cables through some of its decommissioned pipelines.subsequently,wmb used a subsidiary known as the williams communications group wcg to develop a large network.wmb sold most of this network to a competitor in.rapid growth in the telecommunications index in the late,however,spurred wmb to reenter the network communications market through its wcg subsidiary.indeed,wmb stated its intention to invest vast sums in creating a national network.but the telecommunications index experienced a major downturn in the spring of.wmb subsequently spun off its wcg subsidiary.less than two years later,wcg stock was practically worthless and the company filed for chapter bankruptcy.
as a result,some thirty securities fraud class action suits were filed seeking billion against three defendant groups the wmb defendants the wcg defendants and ernst young,the outside auditor to both wmb and wcg.the district court consolidated these actions under the caption in re williams securities,bifurcated the litigation into two subclasses of wmb subclass and the wcg ordered coordinated discovery.while the wmb subclass action settled,defendants in the wcg subclass action filed a motion for summary judgment,which the district court granted.plaintiffs appealed the district court ruling,which we affirmed in in re williams securities subclass,wl cir.
pursuant to and.d,the district court awarded the wcg subclass defendants costs.plaintiffs now challenge the district court costs awards on three separate grounds.first,plaintiffs allege defendants failed to prove that the transcripts and copies for which the district court awarded costs were necessarily obtained for use in the case.second,plaintiffs maintain that many of the costs for which defendants seek reimbursement are equally attributable to the wmb subclass action.hence,plaintiffs argue the district court abused its discretion in taxing them for the full amount of these costs.third,plaintiffs suggest that the district court awards of costs are substantively unreasonable,even assuming these costs are taxable under.we have jurisdiction under.satisfied that the district court acted within the broad confines of its discretion,we affirm.
after the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants,each defendant group filed a timely bill of costs with the district court.the district court clerk held a joint hearing on defendants bills of costs.see furr,cir recognizing that a bill of costs is initially filed with the clerk rather than with the court.shortly thereafter,the clerk issued three orders taxing plaintiffs in favor of the wcg defendants,in favor of the wmb defendants,and in favor of ernst young.ultimately,the clerk reduced defendants requested costs awards by wcg defendants,wmb defendants,and ernst young respectively.defendants voluntarily withdrew their request for transcript costs related to one deposition witness and the wmb defendants agreed to drop their request for approximately in copying costs.
plaintiffs moved the district court to review the clerk awards under.d,raising substantially the same arguments they now press on appeal.see id.should the party seeking costs be dissatisfied with the clerk actions,or should the party against whom they are to be taxed object,on motion served within days thereafter,the action of the clerk may be reviewed by the court.such review by the court is a de novo determination.the district court referred this motion to a united states magistrate judge,who held another hearing on the matter.subsequently,the magistrate judge issued a page report and recommendation,substantially affirming the clerk awards of costs.the magistrate judge did exclude,however,costs related to four depositions for which the clerk awarded costs to the wmb defendants and ernst young.this reduced defendants costs awards by the wmb defendants and ernst young respectively.in total,the magistrate judge recommended the district court tax plaintiffs in favor of the wcg defendants,in favor of the wmb defendants,and in favor of ernst young.
plaintiffs also objected to the magistrate judge report and recommendation on essentially the same grounds they now raise on appeal.in a page order,the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommended awards of costs,with several notable exceptions.the district court independently reviewed the record and excluded transcription costs related to seven deposition witnesses because it was not satisfied that these depositions were necessarily obtained for use in the case.further,the district court reduced the wcg defendants award for copy costs by over.all together,the district court reduced the costs awards recommended by the magistrate judge by the wcg defendants,the wmb defendants,and ernst young respectively.accordingly,the district court taxed plaintiffs in favor of the wcg defendants,in favor of the wmb defendants,and in favor of ernst young.
rule d provides that costs,other than attorney fees,should generally be allowed to the prevailing party.we have recognized that the district court discretion in taxing costs is limited in two ways.see cantrell int l of workers,cir en banc.first,rule creates a presumption that the district court will award costs to the prevailing party.id.at.second,the district court must provide a valid reason for denying such costs.see also klein grynberg,cir stating that denying costs to a prevailing party is a severe penalty and explaining that there must be some apparent reason to penalize the prevailing party if costs are to be denied.
items proposed by prevailing parties as costs should always be given careful scrutiny,touche ross,cir,overruled on other grounds as recognized by anixter prod,cir.the costs statute allows a judge or clerk of any court of the united states to tax costs for transcripts and copies necessarily obtained for use in the case.both parties agree that this standard governs the costs at issue in this appeal.
the necessarily obtained for use in the case standard does not allow a prevailing party to recover costs for materials that merely added to the convenience of counsel or the district court.touche ross,at.to be recoverable,a prevailing party transcription and copy costs must be reasonably necessary to the litigation of the case.mitchell city of moore,cir.materials produced solely for discovery do not meet this threshold.furr,at.at the same time,we have acknowledged that materials may be taxable even if they are not strictly essential to the district court resolution of the case.id.the realities of litigation occasionally dispense with the need of much of the discovery already taken by the parties when,for instance,a dispositive motion is granted by the trial court.callicrate farmland,cir.our cases establish that if deposition transcripts or copies were offered into evidence,were not frivolous,and were within the bounds of vigorous advocacy,costs may be taxed.id.citing furr,at.this standard recognizes that caution and proper advocacy may make it incumbent on counsel to prepare for all contingencies which may arise during the course of litigation,including the possibility of trial.id.
thus,we do not employ the benefit of hindsight in determining whether materials for which a prevailing party requests costs are reasonably necessary to the litigation of the case.id.we base this determination,instead,solely on the particular facts and circumstances at the time the expense was incurred.see also allison bank,cir recognizing that as long as the expense appeared to be reasonably necessary at the time it was incurred,the taxing of such costs should be approved.the standard is one of reasonableness.see mitchell,at.if materials or services are reasonably necessary for use in the case,even if they are ultimately not used to dispose of the matter,the district court can find necessity and award the recovery of costs.callicrate,at.thus,we will not penalize a party who happens to prevail on a dispositive motion by not awarding costs associated with that portion of discovery which had no bearing on the dispositive motion,but which a
