respondents filed this securities fraud class action,alleging that petitioners hereinafter matrixx violated b of the securities exchange act of and securities and exchange commission rule by failing to disclose reports of a possible link between matrixx leading product,zicam cold remedy,and loss of smell anosmia,rendering statements made by matrixx misleading.matrixx moved to dismiss the complaint,arguing that respondents had not pleaded the element of a material misstatement or omission and the element of scienter.the district court granted the motion,but the ninth circuit reversed.it held that the district court erred in requiring an allegation of statistical significance to establish materiality,concluding instead that the complaint adequately alleged information linking zicam and anosmia that would have been significant to a reasonable investor.it also held that matrixx withholding of information about reports of adverse effects and about pending lawsuits by zicam users gave rise to a strong inference of scienter.
held respondents have stated a claim under b and rule.
a to prevail on their claim,respondents must prove,as relevant here,a material misrepresentation or omission by matrixx and scienter.see stoneridge investment partners,llc.matrixx contends that they failed to plead these required elements because they did not allege that the reports matrixx received reflected statistically significant evidence that zicam caused anosmia.
b respondents have adequately pleaded materiality.
under basic levinson,b materiality requirement is satisfied when there is a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.at.the court declined to adopt a rule for determining materiality in basic,observing that a ny approach that designates a single fact or occurrence as always determinative of an inherently finding such as materiality,must necessarily be overinclusive or underinclusive.at.here,matrixx rule that adverse event reports regarding a pharmaceutical company products are not material absent a sufficient number of such reports to establish a statistically significant risk that the product is causing the events would artificially exclud e information that would otherwise be considered significant to a reasonable investor trading decision.ibid.matrixx premise that statistical significance is the only reliable indication of causation is flawed.both medical experts and the food and drug administration rely on evidence other than statistically significant data to establish an inference of causation.it thus stands to reason that reasonable investors would act on such evidence.because adverse reports can take many forms,assessing their materiality is a inquiry,requiring consideration of their source,content,and context.the question is whether a reasonable investor would have viewed the nondisclosed information as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.at.something more than the mere existence of adverse event reports is needed to satisfy that standard,but that something more is not limited to statistical significance and can come from the source,content,and context of the reports.
applying basic total mix standard here,respondents adequately pleaded materiality.the complaint allegations suffice to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence satisfying the materiality requirement,bell atlantic twombly,and to allo w the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable,ashcroft iqbal.assuming the complaint allegations to be true,matrixx received reports from medical experts and researchers that plausibly indicated a reliable causal link between zicam and anosmia.consumers likely would have viewed zicam risk as substantially outweighing its benefit.viewing the complaint allegations as a whole,the complaint alleges facts suggesting a significant risk to the commercial viability of matrixx leading product.it is substantially likely that a reasonable investor would have viewed this information as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.basic,supra,at.assuming the complaint allegations to be true,matrixx told the market that revenues were going to rise and then percent when it had information indicating a significant risk to its leading product.it also publicly dismissed reports linking zicam and anosmia and stated that zinc gluconate safety was well established,when it had evidence of a biological link between zicam key ingredient and anosmia and had conducted no studies to disprove that link.
c respondents have also adequately pleaded scienter,a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud,tellabs,makor issues rights.this court assumes,without deciding,that the scienter requirement may be satisfied by a showing of deliberate recklessness.under the private securities litigation reform act of,a complaint adequately pleads scienter only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.at.matrixx proposed rule requiring an allegation of statistical significance to establish a strong inference of scienter is once again flawed.the complaint allegations,taken collectively,give rise to a cogent and compelling inference that matrixx elected not to disclose adverse event reports not because it believed they were meaningless but because it understood their likely effect on the market,at.a reasonable person would deem the inference that matrixx acted with deliberate recklessness at least as compelling as any plausible opposing inference.at.
sotomayor,delivered the opinion for a unanimous court.
matrixx initiatives,et,petitioners james siracusano et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
this case presents the question whether a plaintiff can state a claim for securities fraud under b of the securities exchange act of,stat,as amended,b,and securities and exchange commission sec rule,cfr,based on a pharmaceutical company failure to disclose reports of adverse events associated with a product if the reports do not disclose a statistically significant number of adverse events.respondents,plaintiffs in a securities fraud class action,allege that petitioners,matrixx initiatives,and three of its executives collectively matrixx,failed to disclose reports of a possible link between its leading product,a cold remedy,and loss of smell,rendering statements made by matrixx misleading.matrixx contends that respondents complaint does not adequately allege that matrixx made a material representation or omission or that it acted with scienter because the complaint does not allege that matrixx knew of a statistically significant number of adverse events requiring disclosure.we conclude that the materiality of adverse event reports can not be reduced to a rule.although in many cases reasonable investors would not consider reports of adverse events to be material information,respondents have alleged facts plausibly suggesting that reasonable investors would have viewed these particular reports as material.respondents have also alleged facts giving rise to a strong inference that matrixx acted with the required state of mind.b a supp.we therefore hold,in agreement with the court of appeals for the ninth circuit,that respondents have stated a claim under b and rule.
through a wholly owned subsidiary,matrixx develops,manufactures,and markets pharmaceutical products.its core brand of products is called zicam.all of the products sold under the name zicam are used to treat the common cold and associated symptoms.at the time of the events in question,one of matrixx products was zicam cold remedy,which came in several forms including nasal spray and gel.the active ingredient in zicam cold remedy was zinc gluconate.respondents allege that zicam cold remedy accounted for approximately percent of matrixx sales.
respondents initiated this securities fraud class action against matrixx on behalf of individuals who purchased matrixx securities between october,and february,the action principally arises out of statements that matrixx made during the class period relating to revenues and product safety.respondents claim that matrixx statements were misleading in light of reports that matrixx had received,but did not disclose,about consumers who had lost their sense of smell a condition called anosmia after using zicam cold remedy.respondents consolidated amended complaint alleges the following facts,which the courts below properly assumed to be true.see ashcroft iqbal,slip,at.
in,alan hirsch,neurological director of the smell taste treatment and research foundation,called matrixx customer service line after discovering a possible link between zicam nasal gel and a loss of smell in a cluster of his patients.app.hirsch told a matrixx employee that previous studies had demonstrated that intranasal application of zinc could be problematic.at.he also told the employee about at least one of his patients who did not have a cold and who developed anosmia after using zicam.
in september,timothy clarot,matrixx vice president for research and development,called miriam linschoten,at the university of colorado health sciences center after receiving a complaint from a person linschoten was treating who had lost her sense of smell after using zicam.clarot informed linschoten that matrixx had received similar complaints from other customers.linschoten drew clarot attention to previous studies linking zinc sulfate to loss of smell.ibid.clarot gave her the impression that he had not heard of the studies.she asked clarot whether matrixx had done any studies of its own he responded that it had not but that it had hired a consultant to review the product.soon thereafter,linschoten sent clarot abstracts of the studies she had mentioned.research from the and had confirmed z inc toxicity.at.clarot called linschoten to ask whether she would be willing to participate in animal studies that matrixx was planning,but she declined because her focus was human research.
by september,one of linschoten colleagues at the university of colorado,bruce jafek,had observed patients suffering from anosmia after zicam use.linschoten and jafek planned to present their findings at a meeting of the american rhinologic society in a poster presentation entitled zicam induced anosmia.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.the american rhinologic society posted their abstract in advance of the meeting.the presentation described in detail a man with previously normal taste and smell who experienced severe burning in his nose,followed immediately by a loss of smell,after using zicam.it also reported other zicam users with similar symptoms.
matrixx learned of the doctors planned presentation.clarot sent a letter to jafek warning him that he did not have permission to use matrixx name or the names of its products.jafek deleted the references to zicam in the poster before presenting it to the american rhinologic society.
the following month,two plaintiffs commenced a product liability lawsuit against matrixx alleging that zicam had damaged their sense of smell.by the end of the class period on february,nine plaintiffs had filed four lawsuits.
respondents allege that matrixx made a series of public statements that were misleading in light of the foregoing information.in october,after they had learned of jafek study and after jafek had presented his findings to the american rhinologic society,matrixx stated that zicam was poised for growth in the upcoming cough and cold season and that the company had very strong momentum.at.matrixx further expressed its expectation that revenues would be up in excess of and that earnings,per share for the full year would be in the to cent range.at.in january,matrixx raised its revenue guidance,predicting an increase in revenues of percent and earnings per share in the range.
in its form filed with the sec in november,zicam warned of the potential material adverse effect that could result from product liability claims,whether or not proven to be valid.at.it stated that product liability actions could materially affect matrixx product branding and goodwill,leading to reduced customer acceptance,at.it did not disclose,however,that two plaintiffs had already sued matrixx for allegedly causing them to lose their sense of smell.
on january,dow jones newswires reported that the food and drug administration fda was looking into complaints that an medicine manufactured by a unit of matrixx initiatives,mtxx may be causing some users to lose their sense of smell in light of at least three product liability lawsuits,at.matrixx stock fell from to per share after the report.in response,on february,matrixx issued a press release that stated 
all zicam products are manufactured and marketed according to fda guidelines for homeopathic medicine.our primary concern is the health and safety of our customers and the distribution of factual information about our products.matrixx believes statements alleging that intranasal zicam products caused anosmia loss of smell are completely unfounded and misleading.in no clinical trial of intranasal zinc gluconate gel products has there been a single report of lost or diminished olfactory function sense of smell.rather,the safety and efficacy of zinc gluconate for the treatment of symptoms related to the common cold have been well established in two,randomized clinical trials.in fact,in neither study were there any reports of anosmia related to the use of this compound.the overall incidence of adverse events associated with zinc gluconate was extremely low,with no statistically significant difference between the adverse event rates for the treated and placebo subsets.a multitude of environmental and biologic influences are known to affect the sense of smell.chief among them is the common cold.as a result,the population most likely to use cold remedy products is already at increased risk of developing anosmia.other common causes of olfactory dysfunction include age,nasal and sinus infections,head trauma,anatomical obstructions,and environmental irritants.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the day after matrixx issued this press release,its stock price bounced back to per share.
on february,the end of the class period,good morning america,a nationally broadcast morning news program,highlighted jafek findings.the complaint does not allege that matrixx learned of the news story before its broadcast.the program reported that jafek had discovered more than a dozen patients suffering from anosmia after using zicam.it also noted that four lawsuits had been filed against matrixx.the price of matrixx stock plummeted to per share that same day.zicam again issued a press release largely repeating its february statement.
on february,matrixx filed a form with the sec stating that it had convened a meeting of physicians and scientists to review current information on smell disorders in response to jafek presentation,at.according to the form,in the opinion of the panel,there is insufficient scientific evidence at this time to determine if zinc gluconate,when used as recommended,affects a person ability to smell.ibid.a few weeks later,a reporter quoted matrixx as stating that it would begin conducting animal and human studies to further characterize these complaints.at.
on the basis of these allegations,respondents claimed that matrixx violated b of the securities exchange act and sec rule by making untrue statements of fact and failing to disclose material facts necessary to make the statements not misleading in an effort to maintain artificially high prices for matrixx securities.
matrixx moved to dismiss respondents complaint,arguing that they had failed to plead the elements of a material misstatement or omission and scienter.the district court granted the motion to dismiss.relying on in re,securities litigation,it held that respondents had not alleged a statistically significant correlation between the use of zicam and anosmia so as to make failure to public ly disclose complaints and the university of colorado study a material omission.app.to pet.for cert.the district court similarly agreed that respondents had not stated with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter.see b a supp.it noted that the complaint failed to allege that matrixx disbelieved its statements about zicam safety or that any of the defendants profited or attempted to profit from matrixx public statements.app.to pet.for cert.
the court of appeals reversed.noting that t he determination of materiality requires delicate assessments of the inferences a reasonable shareholder would draw from a given set of facts and the significance of those inferences to him,at quoting basic levinson,some internal quotation marks omitted alterations in original,the court of appeals held that the district court had erred in requiring an allegation of statistical significance to establish materiality.it concluded,to the contrary,that the complaint adequately alleged information regarding the possible link between zicam and anosmia that would have been significant to a reasonable investor,at.turning to scienter,the court of appeals concluded that w ithholding reports of adverse effects of and lawsuits concerning the product responsible for the company remarkable sales increase is an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,giving rise to a strong inference of scienter,at.
we granted certiorari,and we now affirm.
section b of the securities exchange act makes it unlawful for any person to use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.b.sec rule implements this provision by making it unlawful to,among other things,make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.cfr b.we have implied a private cause of action from the text and purpose of b.see tellabs,makor issues rights.
to prevail on their claim that matrixx made material misrepresentations or omissions in violation of b and rule,respondents must prove a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant scienter a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission economic loss and loss causation.stoneridge investment partners,llc.matrixx contends that respondents have failed to plead both the element of a material misrepresentation or omission and the element of scienter because they have not alleged that the reports received by matrixx reflected statistically significant evidence that zicam caused anosmia.we disagree.
we first consider matrixx argument that adverse event reports that do not reveal a statistically significant increased risk of adverse events from product use are not material information.brief for petitioners capitalization omitted.
to prevail on a b claim,a plaintiff must show that the defendant made a statement that was misleading as to a material fact.basic,at.in basic,we held that this materiality requirement is satisfied when there is a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.at quoting tsc industries,northway.we were careful not to set too low a standard of materiality,for fear that management would bury the shareholders in an avalanche of trivial information.at quoting tsc industries,at.
basic involved a claim that the defendant had made misleading statements denying that it was engaged in merger negotiations when it was,in fact,conducting preliminary negotiations.see,at.the defendant urged a rule that preliminary merger negotiations are material only once the parties to the negotiations reach an agreement in principle,at.we observed that a ny approach that designates a single fact or occurrence as always determinative of an inherently finding such as materiality,must necessarily be overinclusive or underinclusive.at.we thus rejected the defendant proposed rule,explaining that it would artificially exclud e from the definition of materiality information concerning merger discussions,which would otherwise be considered significant to the trading decision of a reasonable investor.ibid.
like the defendant in basic,matrixx urges us to adopt a rule that reports of adverse associated with a pharmaceutical company products can not be material absent a sufficient number of such reports to establish a statistically significant risk that the product is in fact causing the events absent statistical significance,matrixx argues,adverse event reports provide only anecdotal evidence that the user of a drug experienced an adverse event at some point during or following the use of that drug.brief for petitioners.accordingly,it contends,reasonable investors would not consider such reports relevant unless they are statistically significant because only then do they reflect a scientifically reliable basis for inferring a potential causal link between product use and the adverse event.at.
as in basic,matrixx categorical rule would artificially exclud e information that would otherwise be considered significant to the trading decision of a reasonable investor.at.matrixx argument rests on the premise that statistical significance is the only reliable indication of causation.this premise is flawed as the sec points out,medical researchers consider multiple factors in assessing causation.brief for united states as amicus curiae.statistically significant data are not always available.for example,when an adverse event is subtle or rare,an inability to obtain a data set of appropriate quality or quantity may preclude a finding of statistical significance.at see also brief for medical researchers as amici curiae.moreover,ethical considerations may prohibit researchers from conducting randomized clinical trials to confirm a suspected causal link for the purpose of obtaining statistically significant data.see,at.
a lack of statistically significant data does not mean that medical experts have no reliable basis for inferring a causal link between a drug and adverse events.as matrixx itself concedes,medical experts rely on other evidence to establish an inference of causation.see brief for petitioners,we note that courts frequently permit expert testimony on causation based on evidence other than statistical significance.see,best lowe home centers,westberry gislaved gummi ab,citing cases wells ortho pharmaceutical.we need not consider whether the expert testimony was properly admitted in those cases,and we do not attempt to define here what constitutes reliable evidence of causation.it suffices to note that,as these courts have recognized,medical professionals and researchers do not limit the data they consider to the results of randomized clinical trials or to statistically significant evidence.brief for medical researchers as amici curiae.
the fda similarly does not limit the evidence it considers for purposes of assessing causation and taking regulatory action to statistically significant data.in assessing the safety risk posed by a product,the fda considers factors such as strength of the association,temporal relationship of product use and the event,consistency of findings across available data sources,evidence of a for the effect,biologic plausibility,seriousness of the event relative to the disease being treated,potential to mitigate the risk in the population,feasibility of further study using observational or controlled clinical study designs,and degree of benefit the product provides,including availability of other therapies.fda,guidance for industry good pharmacovigilance practices and pharmacoepidemiologic assessment capitalization omitted,all internet materials as visited,and available in clerk of court case file see also brief for united states as amicus curiae same fda,the clinical impact of adverse event reporting similar.it does not apply any single metric for determining when additional inquiry or action is necessary,and it certainly does not insist upon statistical significance.brief for united states as amicus curiae.
not only does the fda rely on a wide range of evidence of causation,it sometimes acts on the basis of evidence that suggests,but does not prove,causation.for example,the fda requires manufacturers of drugs to revise their labeling to include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with a drug a causal relationship need not have been proved.cfr e.more generally,the fda may make regulatory decisions against drugs based on postmarketing evidence that gives rise to only a suspicion of causation.see fda,the clinical impact of adverse event reporting,supra,at a chieving certain proof of causality through postmarketing surveillance is unusual.attaining a prominent degree of suspicion is much more likely,and may be considered a sufficient basis for regulatory decisions footnote omitted 
this case proves the point.in,the fda issued a warning letter to matrixx stating that a significant and growing body of evidence substantiates that the zicam cold remedy intranasal products may pose a serious risk to consumers who use them.app.the letter cited as evidence reports of anosmia the fda had received,the fact that the fda had received few reports of anosmia associated with other intranasal cold remedies,and evidence in the published scientific literature that various salts of zinc can damage olfactory function in animals and humans.ibid.it did not cite statistically significant data.
given that medical professionals and regulators act on the basis of evidence of causation that is not statistically significant,it stands to reason that in certain cases reasonable investors would as well.as matrixx acknowledges,adverse event reports appear in many forms,including direct complaints by users to manufacturers,reports by doctors about reported or observed patient reactions,more detailed case reports published by doctors in medical journals,or larger scale published clinical studies.brief for petitioners.as a result,assessing the materiality of adverse event reports is a inquiry,basic,at,that requires consideration of the source,content,and context of the reports.this is not to say that statistical significance or the lack thereof is irrelevant only that it is not dispositive of every case.
application of basic total mix standard does not mean that pharmaceutical manufacturers must disclose all reports of adverse events.adverse event reports are daily events in the pharmaceutical industry in,the fda entered nearly such reports into its reporting system,see fda,reports received and reports entered in aers by year as of.htm.the fact that a user of a drug has suffered an adverse event,standing alone,does not mean that the drug caused that event.see fda,annual adverse drug experience report.the question remains whether a reasonable investor would have viewed the nondisclosed information as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.basic,at quoting tsc industries,at emphasis added.for the reasons just stated,the mere existence of reports of adverse events which says nothing in and of itself about whether the drug is causing the adverse events will not satisfy this standard.something more is needed,but that something more is not limited to statistical significance and can come from the source,content,and context of the reports,supra,at.this contextual inquiry may reveal in some cases that reasonable investors would have viewed reports of adverse events as material even though the reports did not provide statistically significant evidence of a causal link 
moreover,it bears emphasis that b and rule b do not create an affirmative duty to disclose any and all material information.disclosure is required under these provisions only when necessary to make statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.cfr b see also basic,at,silence,absent a duty to disclose,is not misleading under rule even with respect to information that a reasonable investor might consider material,companies can control what they have to disclose under these provisions by controlling what they say to the market.
applying basic total mix standard in this case,we conclude that respondents have adequately pleaded materiality.this is not a case about a handful of anecdotal reports,as matrixx suggests.assuming the complaint allegations to be true,as we must,matrixx received information that plausibly indicated a reliable causal link between zicam and anosmia.that information included reports from three medical professionals and researchers about more than patients who had lost their sense of smell after using zicam.clarot told linschoten that matrixx had received additional reports of anosmia.in addition,during the class period,nine plaintiffs commenced four product liability lawsuits against matrixx alleging a causal link between zicam use and anosmia.further,matrixx knew that linschoten and jafek had presented their findings about a causal link between zicam and anosmia to a national medical conference devoted to treatment of diseases of the nose their presentation described a patient who experienced severe burning in his nose,followed immediately by a loss of smell,after using zicam suggesting a temporal relationship between zicam use and anosmia.
critically,both hirsch and linschoten had also drawn matrixx attention to previous studies that had demonstrated a biological causal link between intranasal application of zinc and anosmia before his conversation with linschoten,clarot,matrixx vice president of research and development,was seemingly unaware of these studies,and the complaint suggests that,as of the class period,matrixx had not conducted any research of its own relating to anosmia.see,app.referencing a press report,issued after the end of the class period,noting that matrixx said it would begin conducting animal and human studies to further characterize these complaints accordingly,it can reasonably be inferred from the complaint that matrixx had no basis for rejecting jafek findings out of hand.
we believe that these allegations suffice to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence satisfying the materiality requirement,bell atlantic twombly,and to allo w the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged,iqbal,at slip,at.the information provided to matrixx by medical experts revealed a plausible causal relationship between zicam cold remedy and anosmia.consumers likely would have viewed the risk associated with zicam possible loss of smell as substantially outweighing the benefit of using the product alleviating cold symptoms,particularly in light of the existence of many alternative products on the market.importantly,zicam cold remedy allegedly accounted for percent of matrixx sales.viewing the allegations of the complaint as a whole,the complaint alleges facts suggesting a significant risk to the commercial viability of matrixx leading product.
it is substantially likely that a reasonable investor would have viewed this information as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.basic,at quoting tsc industries,at.matrixx told the market that revenues were going to rise and then percent.assuming the complaint allegations to be true,however,matrixx had information indicating a significant risk to its leading product.matrixx also stated that reports indicating that zicam caused anosmia were completely unfounded and misleading and that the safety and efficacy of zinc gluconate for the treatment of symptoms related to the common cold have been well established.app.importantly,however,matrixx had evidence of a biological link between zicam key ingredient and anosmia,and it had not conducted any studies of its own to disprove that link.in fact,as matrixx later revealed,the scientific evidence at th
