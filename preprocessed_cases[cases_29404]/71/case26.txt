this securities case involves allegations that corporate officials misled the public about the effect of one patient death on sales of tecfidera,a drug for multiple sclerosis ms and the company leading source of revenue.
gbr group,gbr is the lead plaintiff in a putative class action against biogen biogen and three biogen executives together,the defendants alleging violations under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of the exchange act.see b,a.the plaintiffs initial amended complaint alleged that,from december,to july,the class period,the defendants knowingly misled the investing public regarding the impact that the death of a patient taking tecfidera had on sales of tecfidera.
the district court dismissed the initial amended complaint with prejudice,for failure to meet the heightened pleading requirements of the private securities litigation reform act pslra.in re biogen.sec.litig.biogen,supp,see.the court then denied the plaintiffs subsequent motion under federal rules of civil procedure e and b to vacate the judgment and for leave to file a second amended complaint to include purportedly new evidence.gbr appeals the dismissal of the initial amended complaint and particularly emphasizes its appeal from the denial of the motion to vacate the judgment and for leave to amend the complaint.
we reject these claims and affirm on both issues.we agree,on de novo review,that the initial amended complaint fails to plead particularized facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter,as required by the pslra.and there was no error or abuse of discretion in the denial of the motion to vacate the judgment and for leave to file a second amended complaint.
biogen,whose stock trades on the nasdaq,is a biopharmaceutical company that develops,manufactures,and markets medication for the treatment of neurological disorders.during the relevant period,defendant george scangos was biogen chief executive officer,defendant paul clancy was its chief financial officer and executive vice president of finance,and defendant stuart kingsley was its executive vice president of global commercial operations.the class period is from december,to july.
one of the four principal drugs biogen markets for ms treatment is tecfidera,which the fda approved for use in march and which biogen began selling during the second fiscal quarter of.tecfidera has been a significant source of revenue for biogen,and it was regularly accounting for a third of biogen total quarterly revenues by the start of the class period.tecfidera revenue growth depended on three factors the number of patients recently diagnosed with ms who started their treatment on tecfidera new starts the number of patients who switched over to tecfidera from other drugs and the growth of the ms drug market.
biogen released its financial results on october.the company reported total revenues of billion,an increase of from the previous quarter,as well as revenue from tecfidera alone of million a increase from the previous quarter,but a lower growth rate than those of the previous four quarters growth rates of,and,respectively.on the same date,biogen held an earnings call to discuss the report and announced,for the first time,that an ms patient had died of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy the pml death or pml incident.the patient had taken tecfidera for more than four years in a clinical study.at the time this information was released,kingsley stated publicly that tecfidera growth was moderat ing.
the fda issued a warning to the public about the pml death on november,and tecfidera label in the united states was updated to describe the risk of pml death on december,one day after the beginning of the class period.on december,the first day of the class period,clancy told analysts that investors should be mindful of the fact that tecfidera discontinuation rates the rates at which patients discontinued use of tecfidera were higher than the company had hoped.
on january,biogen issued revenue guidance for,in which it stated that it expected overall revenue growth of to.the initial amended complaint alleges that the d efendants reiterated that tecfidera performance remained strong and stated that they had not seen any meaningful change in discontinuation rates,and that stock analysts accepted this characterization.at the time of this announcement,kingsley also stated that there was a moderation in new tecfidera starts and cited,among other things,the updated label describing the pml incident.he then made similar remarks during a conference on february,that is,about halfway through the first quarter of.
on april,biogen released its results for,announcing tecfidera revenue of million,below the market consensus estimates.scangos stated at that time that tecfidera had a more challenging quarter,due to a number of issues,including an overall slowing of the ms market,the recent launch of plegridy,the single pml case reported last year,and some financial dynamics he emphasized that our outlook for tecfidera,and for our entire ms portfolio,remains strong.from april to july,the defendants continued to express optimism about tecfidera,stating that its performance had stabilized since the announcement of the pml incident and that data suggested positive momentum.at four analyst conferences in may,biogen executives noted that tecfidera growth was slowing and named the pml incident as one factor in that slowed growth.
on july,the day after the end of the class period,biogen released its earnings report.biogen announced revenue of million from tecfidera,which was a increase from the first quarter but less than the million of tecfidera revenue from the last quarter of.also that day,the company revised its revenue guidance,lowering its estimate of overall revenue growth from to.the decrease in the guidance was based largely on revised expectations for the growth of tecfidera.biogen stock fell over in one day in response to the announcement.
nearly two months after the end of the class period,on september,kingsley stated at a health care conference that some kind of a downtick in the safety profile that would have some kind of an impact on physician behavior had been expected in the wake of the pml incident,but that we could tell,and that the pml incident was a pretty big change statement for a broad base of physicians.the plaintiffs characterize these as evidentiary admissions.on october,biogen announced that kingsley was leaving the company.on october,biogen announced cuts that would eliminate about of its workforce.
nicole tehrani filed the initial complaint alleging securities fraud on august.after a status conference on november,the district court appointed gbr as the lead plaintiff and granted the plaintiffs an additional sixty days,as they requested,to file an amended complaint.
the plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on january.the amended complaint alleges claims under section b of the exchange act and rule thereunder counts i ii,and under section a of the exchange act count iii.
the amended complaint alleges that throughout the class period,the defendants knowingly misled the investing public by never provid ing any indication that the pml death had materially impacted tecfidera sales,or caused physicians to stop prescribing tecfidera or to switch patients onto other therapies out of safety concerns.the complaint specifies over twenty allegedly misleading statements that the defendants made across ten dates during the class period.
as proof that the statements were misleading and made with scienter,the complaint makes several other allegations,many of which are based on statements from ten confidential witnesses cws.the confidential witness statements purportedly establish that biogen experienced a significant decline in tecfidera sales following the announcement of the pml incident and throughout the class period.the confidential witness statements also describe corporate events and policy changes that purportedly establish the defendants private acknowledgment of this decline in tecfidera sales and its connection to the pml death 
the complaint further alleges that tecfidera was biogen core product and that the defendants had access to sales data and physician feedback following the pml death.it alleges that kingsley,due to his proximity to the sales team,would have been aware of the significant impact the pml death had on tecfidera sales.finally,it alleges that scangos and clancy had motive and opportunity to make false statements concerning tecfidera sales because they had personal bonus targets based on revenue growth,which in turn depended on tecfidera sales.
the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint with prejudice.the plaintiffs conceded in their opposition to the motion to dismiss that count ii should be dismissed.
the district court granted the motion to dismiss in a careful and thoughtful opinion filed on june.biogen,supp.at.drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs,the court determined that,of the more than twenty statements alleged to be material misstatements or omissions,three were plausibly misleading or false id.at.but the court found that,although the complaint allegations,including the statements from the confidential witnesses,gave rise to a plausible inference of scienter,they did not give rise to the strong one required by the pslra.id.at.moreover,the court found that the record gave rise to compelling inferences in the defendants favor.id.at.
the district court dismissed count i allegations under section b with prejudice on june.id.at.given that the plaintiffs had not adequately pled an underlying violation of the exchange act,the district court also dismissed count iii allegations under section a with prejudice id.at.
on july,the plaintiffs filed a proposed second amended complaint and moved under federal rules of civil procedure e and b to vacate the dismissal based on newly discovered scienter evidence.the court found that the new evidence could have been discovered earlier with the exercise of reasonable diligence and denied the plaintiffs the extraordinary relief requested under rules e and b.gbr timely appeal followed.
allowance of motion to dismiss the initial amended complaint 
gbr argues that the district court erred by dismissing its claims under sections b and a of the exchange act.in particular,gbr contends that the district court wrongly held that two statements specified in the complaint were inadequately pled as misleading and that the complaint failed to give rise to a strong inference of scienter.we disagree.our review is de novo.see aca fin.guar.advest,cir.
plaintiffs alleging violations of section b must plead a material misrepresentation or omission scienter a connection with the purchase or sale of a security reliance economic loss and loss causation.fire police pension ass of abiomed,fire police pension,cir.a complaint alleging a violation of section b must also meet the heightened pleading standards of the pslra,which requires that the complaint specify each statement alleged to have been misleading as well as the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading.b.
as to scienter,the pslra requires that a complaint allege specific facts giving rise to a strong inference,id.b a,either of intentional or willful conduct designed to deceive or defraud investors by controlling or artificially affecting the price of securities,city of dearborn heights act police fire ret.waters,cir.quoting ernst ernst hochfelder,or of a high degree of recklessness,id.quoting aldridge cross,cir.recklessness,as used in this context,does not include ordinary negligence,but is closer to being a lesser form of intent.fire police pension,at quoting greebel ftp software,cir.for an inference of scienter to be strong,a reasonable person would have to deem it cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.tellabs,makor issues rights.
the complaint fails to meet this rigorous standard.the confidential witness statements are insufficiently particular,do not make misleading the defendants public disclosures,and do not speak with specificity as to why the defendants alleged misstatements were untrue or misleading.likewise,the complaint core operations allegations are consistent with the defendants statements to investors.and the most cogent inferences from the record favor the defendants.
confidential witness statements and evidentiary admissions 
the complaint allegations as to scienter rest substantially on the confidential witness statements and on the core operations allegations.the statements,very often made about events occurring after the defendants statements at issue,are so lacking in connecting detail that they can not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.at bottom,the majority of the confidential witness statements say merely that biogen sales regions experienced a serious decline in tecfidera sales after the pml incident and after the purportedly misleading statements were made,that corporate changes were discussed at company events in relation to the pml incident,and that the company changed the sales goals of at least some employees 
the statements do not even begin to quantify the magnitude of the sales decline at the company level.they do not explain with any precision whether the sales decline resulted from higher discontinuations,fewer new starts,changes in the market,or some combination of these factors nor do they purport to contradict any of the financial information released by biogen in its quarterly and yearly reports during the class period.
indeed,the confidential witness statements are consistent with the defendants public disclosures.see in re genzyme.sec,cir.noting that prompt disclosures by corporate defendants undercut any inference of fraudulent intent auto.indus.pension tr.fund textron,cir.declining to find a strong inference of scienter where confidential witness allegations and defendants public statements were not in conflict.as the district court observed,the defendants were cautious in projecting tecfidera growth,and they repeatedly warned investors about the downside risks,including moderating growth and the pml label change.biogen,supp.at.the defendants made such warnings on the first day of the class period and continued to make them throughout.see fire police pension,at the argument is undercut by the fact that defendant explicitly warned investors.
we emphasize that there is a significant timing problem.the later confidential witness statements do not go to how the defendants statements,which were earlier,were knowingly or recklessly misleading at the time they were made.the three statements found plausibly misleading by the district court concerned tecfidera discontinuation rates and were made in january and february.the confidential witness statements concerning drops in tecfidera sales after these months do not address what the defendants knew about discontinuation rates at the time they spoke to the public.and none of the earlier confidential witness statements go specifically to what the defendants knew at the time they made those three statements.
one example suffices.two of the statements that the district court found to be plausibly misleading were kingsley remark at a january,health care conference that the company had not seen a meaningful change in tecfidera discontinuation rates,and his remark at a february,health care conference that discontinuation rates were consistent with historical averages.clancy had told investors on december,the first day of the class period,that investors should be mindful of the fact that tecfidera discontinuation rates were tracking in the teens,higher than the company had hoped.so scienter allegations would have to suggest strongly that between clancy statement on december,and kingsley statements in january and february,kingsley came into possession of information that the tecfidera discontinuation rates had risen above the teens and were clearly inconsistent with historical averages.the confidential witness statements provide no such particularized allegations.
as in fire police pension,confidential witness statements are not described with sufficient particularity,at,to give rise to a strong inference of scienter as to senior management if none of the witnesses we
