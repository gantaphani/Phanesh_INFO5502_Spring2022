former employee sued employer and its parent corporation for claims including breach of stock options exchange agreement and conversion.after sustaining defendants demurrer to employee noncontract claims for misrepresentation,violation of securities laws,and breach of fiduciary duty,the superior court,san francisco county,james robertson,ii,denied defendants motion to stay proceedings pursuant to doctrine of forum non conveniens.defendants filed petition for peremptory writ of mandate to compel enforcement of exchange agreement forum selection clause.the court of appeal,stevens,held that based upon plain language of agreement,as a matter of law,forum selection clause designating hamburg,germany,as the place of jurisdiction was mandatory as a matter of law,no public policy of state was violated by enforcing forum selection clause and transferring action to germany for trial no basis existed for denying enforcement of forum selection clause because exchange agreement was a contract of adhesion and defendants did not waive rights under forum selection clause by demurring in state court to employee noncontract claims.
this petition arises from a lawsuit for breach of a stock options exchange agreement hereafter,exchange agreement.the plaintiff in the action,frank martinez,is a california resident who was an employee of intershop communications,the subsidiary of intershop communications ag.intershop the parent is a german corporation whose stock is publicly traded on the german stock exchange.by the terms of the exchange agreement,the employees of intershop the subsidiary were allowed to exchange their stock options in the subsidiary for shares of stock in the parent.after plaintiff employment was terminated,he sued intershop subsidiary and parent,alleging that pursuant to the exchange agreement he was due additional shares valued at more than million.
the exchange agreement contained a and forum selection clause the conclusion and the performance of this agreement is governed by and has to be construed in accordance with the laws of the federal republic of germany.to the extent permitted by the applicable laws the parties elect hamburg to be the place of jurisdiction.in accordance with that contractual provision,defendants intershop subsidiary and parent and defendant christof leiste,the contractually named fiduciary in the stock transfers moved to stay the proceedings pursuant to the doctrine of forum non conveniens.the trial court denied the motion,and defendants now petition this court to compel the trial court to enforce the forum selection clause.we conclude,for the reasons we explain,that the forum selection clause must be given effect on its terms.
discussion 
mandatory forum selection clause 
the california supreme court has held that contractual forum selection clauses are valid and should be given effect unless enforcement of the clause would be unreasonable.smith,valentino smith,superior court cal d,smith see also the bremen zapata,d.however,a distinction has been drawn between a mandatory and a permissive forum selection clause for purposes of analyzing whether the clause should be enforced.a mandatory clause will ordinarily be given effect without any analysis of convenience the only question is whether enforcement of the clause would be unreasonable.on the other hand,when the clause merely provides for submission to jurisdiction and does not expressly mandate litigation exclusively in a particular forum,then the traditional forum non conveniens analysis applies.berg mtc electronic technologies th,d berg.
plaintiff argues,as he did below,that the forum selection clause within the exchange agreement was merely permissive and was not a mandatory selection of hamburg as the place of trial.the trial court seems to have agreed we decide this threshold issue de novo,independent of the trial court ruling.an appellate court is not bound by the trial court construction of a contract when,as here,the interpretation is based solely upon the terms of the written instrument without any assessment of conflicting extrinsic evidence.gribaldo,jacobs,jones associates agrippina versicherunges cal d,parsons bristol development cal d.
the forum selection clause within the exchange agreement states to the extent permitted by the applicable laws the parties elect hamburg to be the place of jurisdiction.italics added.in our view,that language plainly reflects the parties agreement that hamburg,germany would be the forum.
we recognize that the language is not quite as emphatic as the language in other cases with mandatory clauses,lu of california,th,d a ny and all litigation that may arise as a result of this agreement shall be litigated in dade county,florida italics added cql original products,national hockey league players th,d any claims shall be prosecuted in the appropriate court of ontario canada italics added cql business products services,ricoh th,fn,d a ny appropriate state or federal district court located in the borough of manhattan,new york city,new york shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any case of controversy arising under or in connection with this agreement italics added business.
however,the language in the present case is obviously different from that in cases in which the courts found that the forum selection was merely permissive,that the parties had merely agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the named court but had not ruled out other jurisdictions,berg,supra,th at,d the company has expressly submitted to the jurisdiction of the state of california and united states federal courts sitting in the city of los angeles,california,for the purpose of any suit arising out of this offering italics added hunt wesson foods,supreme oil cir,the courts of california,county of orange,shall have jurisdiction over the parties in any action at law relating to the subject matter or the interpretation of this contract italics added.
here,in contrast,the parties expressed their election that hamburg,germany would be the place of jurisdiction.this clause is far more than an agreement to submit to the jurisdiction of hamburg courts as one of several possible forums.rather,the clause specifies hamburg as the place where litigation should be conducted,indicating a single place.in fact,the forum selection becomes even clearer when introductory modifier is placed at the end of the sentence so that the clause reads as follows the parties elect hamburg to be the place of jurisdiction to the extent permitted by the applicable laws.
furthermore,when the sentence is so inverted,the term applicable laws is revealed as a reference to the laws of hamburg,germany.the record contains undisputed evidence that under german law the forum selection clause would be mandatory.finally,we observe that the limiting phrase t o the extent permitted by the applicable laws would have no meaning unless hamburg was the mandatory site.it would make no sense to permit hamburg if it was already one of several permitted alternatives.see frietsch refco,cir.
in summary,based upon the plain language of the contract,we conclude as a matter of law that the forum selection clause was mandatory.
burden of proof and standard of review 
under a traditional forum non conveniens analysis,the trial court makes its determination on a motion to stay the action after balancing various factors related to the parties private interests as well as the interest of the public in retaining the action for trial in california.stangvik shiley cal d,d,stangvik.the defendant,as the moving party,has the burden of proof.id.at,d,century indemnity bank of america th,d century indemnity.
such a motion on traditional grounds of forum non conveniens is addressed to the discretion of the trial court to decline jurisdiction,and the trial court retains a flexible power to consider and weigh all the factors.archibald cinerama hotels cal d,see also stangvik,supra,at,d,century indemnity,supra,th at,d hansen fiberglas th,d.the trial court discretionary decision will be accorded substantial deference on appeal.stangvik,supra,at,d,century indemnity,supra,at,d.
