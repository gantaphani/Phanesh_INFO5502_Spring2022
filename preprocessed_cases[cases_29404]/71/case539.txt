opinion of the court 
the primary issue in this appeal raises important questions pertaining to the failure to disclose material corporate information as required by federal securities law in a corporation repurchase of its capital stock.the werner company the company,founded by three brothers,was the largest manufacturer and marketer of ladders and other climbing products in the united states.the plaintiffs are the anne werner estate,the elizabeth werner trust,and other members of the werner family and their representatives who,at all relevant times,were minority shareholders of the company.the ten individual defendants the management defendants are also members of the werner family and were officers of the werner company at all times relevant to this action 
in,the company redeemed shares held by two of the plaintiffs,the anne werner estate and the elizabeth werner trust,by purchase.the plaintiffs claim that,at the time of those redemptions,the management defendants fraudulently concealed from them material information which caused them to sell their shares at a price much lower than they would have accepted had they been fully informed.
the plaintiffs filed suit in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania,alleging violations of section b of the securities exchange act of rule promulgated thereunder,and numerous state laws.the district court dismissed the twenty count complaint,as amended,in its entirety for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.it also dismissed the pendent state law claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the plaintiffs timely appealed only on counts one and two.we will affirm in part and vacate in part.
to understand the issues on appeal,some background information on the werner company is necessary.in three brothers,werner,leo werner,and herbert werner went into the ladder business and gave their company the family name.over the years,the company became extremely successful.until november of,when most of the company was sold to a group of outside investors,all of the company stock was owned by members of the werner family.
a.the restricted stock plan 
in,the company adopted a restricted stock plan.the proclaimed purpose of the plan was to give senior management officials an incentive to stay with the company.it allowed the board of directors to award restricted class b shares to certain individuals who were identified in the disclosure documents as key employees and key executives.the disclosure documents did not reveal that only the ten management defendants would benefit from the plan.
under the restricted stock plan,the recipients of the shares were not permitted to sell them until the earliest of seven years from the date of the award attainment of age death or permanent disability.the plan also provided the company with a right of first refusal to acquire any awarded shares an employee wished to sell.pursuant to that right,the company could acquire the shares an employee wished to sell for an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time of the sale minus the fair market value of the shares on the date of their award.the plan was first disclosed to the shareholders in the annual report.a letter accompanying that report also alerted the shareholders to the existence of the plan,explaining its purpose and stating that it was more restrictive and less generous than many such plans.as of that time,no shares had yet been issued under the plan.
in count one of their amended complaint,the plaintiffs assert that the existence and details of the restricted stock plan were not adequately disclosed to them.the district court dismissed this claim,holding that the annual report and the letter accompanying it,as well as the annual reports for,provided adequate disclosure of the plan.
b.the redemptions and the sale of the company in 
in the anne werner estate and the elizabeth werner trust each sought to have the company redeem some of its shares.plaintiff timothy burke,in his capacity as executor of the anne werner estate,communicated with the company about the possibility of redeeming some of the estate stock.by a letter written by eric werner on december,the redemption letter,the company agreed to repurchase the stock at approximately per share,a price determined by management planning mpi,an independent valuation firm,in its most recent appraisal of the company stock the mpi appraisal.the mpi appraisal discounted the value of the plaintiffs minority interests in the company based on the assumption that the company would continue to remain in the werner family.the redemption letter disclosed that the company was continuing to investigate the possibility that it or someone else may offer to purchase shares from one or more shareholders in the future at prices which can not be determined at this time,but which may be less than or in excess of any price you may offer or accept.
on december,the anne werner estate sold its shares under the conditions set forth in the redemption letter.the elizabeth werner trust sold its shares in january under the same conditions.
on october,the company signed a recapitalization agreement with a group of outside investors known collectively as investcorp.this agreement,which was approved by of the werner company shareholders,amounted to a sale of most of the company.under the agreement,the company agreed to redeem approximately of the outstanding stock held by shareholders and of the stock held by management shareholders reclassify its remaining outstanding stock and issue additional stock to investcorp in return for million.in the redemptions following the recapitalization agreement,each shareholder received nearly per share redeemed.
count one of the plaintiffs amended complaint alleges that,at the time of the acquisitions from the anne werner estate and the elizabeth werner trust,the management defendants were seriously considering a sale of the company and fraudulently concealed that information from the plaintiffs.they claim that this omission caused them to sell their shares at a price much lower than what they would have accepted had they been informed of the contemplated sale.
the district court held that these allegations,as stated in the amended complaint,failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted.the crux of its holding was that the plaintiffs failed to allege that the decision to pursue a sale of the company had been made by december of.rather,the complaint alleges that,in,the board of directors had begun to consider various strategic alternatives,which included 
an initial public offering or a private placement of shares of werner capital stock,the incurrence of additional debt,the establishment of an employee stock ownership plan,a leveraged recapitalization or share repurchase,joint ventures with strategic or financial partners to partially divest various operations and the sale of werner or parts thereof.
compl.at.the district court held that the initial consideration of these strategic alternatives was immaterial as a matter of law.it stated 
no case has,to the court knowledge,found a potential sale material to a securities transaction where,as here,the company was considering offering itself for sale was considering other alternatives to a sale had not identified a specific buyer had not retained a financial advisor for the purposes of exploring a sale and had not conducted any discussions,preliminary or otherwise,with a potential buyer or buyers.
op.at.because it believed the allegations in the complaint to be insufficient to support a finding that the alleged misrepresentations and omissions were material to the plaintiffs decisions to sell their shares,the district court dismissed the case for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.
c.the proxy statement 
in october of,the werner company sent a proxy statement to each shareholder explaining the details of the proposed recapitalization.the statement clearly informed shareholders that management was going to amend the restricted stock plan prior to the recapitalization to delete the right of first refusal contained therein.it did not quantify the benefit that the deletion of the right of first refusal would confer upon the management defendants.the plaintiffs asserted that this omission constituted a violation of section b of the securities exchange act of and rule.the district court dismissed this claim,holding the omission was immaterial as a matter of law.
we begin with the portion of count one dealing with the redemptions by the company of the shares held by the anne werner estate and the elizabeth werner trust.the plaintiffs allege that the management defendants violated section b and rule by failing to inform them,prior to the redemptions,that the company was considering offering itself for sale.section b of the securities exchange act makes it illegal to 
use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors.
b.rule,promulgated under section b,makes it unlawful to 
make any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
the district court dismissed count i in its entirety,holding that the plaintiffs amended complaint failed to allege a material misrepresentation.on appeal,in their reply brief,appellants have alleged the recent discovery of evidence consisting of werner company meeting minutes found in a related action in the new york supreme court captioned pollack bonte new york supreme court index.appellants assert that the minutes reveal a plan by the board of directors of the werner company as early as february to sell the corporation.appellants also assert that the minutes show that the company retained goldman sachs to advise the board as to the feasibility of pursuing various financing transactions,and that goldman sachs greatly assisted the board of directors in deciding that a sale transaction was in the best interests of the company.appellants allege that those corporate minutes provide sufficient evidence of material misrepresentation to survive the motion to dismiss.appellants ask this court to judicially notice the contents of the newly discovered evidence and to vacate the district court dismissal.in the alternative,they move in their reply brief for leave to amend their complaint to enable them to present the newly discovered evidence before the district court.
the appellees correctly assert that,in most cases,a court of appeals may not consider material or purported evidence which was not brought upon the record in the trial court.united states ex rel.bradshaw alldredge,cir.however,appeals courts may take judicial notice of filings or developments in related proceedings which take place after the judgment appealed from.see federal insurance richard rubin,cir landy federal deposit insurance,cir.
a court may take judicial notice of an adjudicative fact if that fact is not subject to reasonable dispute.see.b a judicially noticed fact must either be generally known within the jurisdiction of the trial court,or be capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy can not reasonably be questioned.see see also in re warfarin sodium antitrust,cir kramer time warner,cir weinstein fed.evid.ed.while judicial notice based on general knowledge reflects the traditional approach notice of verifiable facts is a more modern development consistent with the approach of the uniform rules of evidence.
we will not judicially notice the truth of the contents of the meeting minutes.the minutes were filed in a separate action involving separate parties,in a different court,in a different state.taking judicial notice of the truth of the contents of a filing from a related action could reach,and perhaps breach,the boundaries of proper judicial notice.see united states jones,cir stating that the effect of judicially noticing a fact is to preclude the opposing party from introducing contrary evidence and essentially direct a verdict against him as to the noticed fact.see also,liberty mutual insurance rotches pork packers,cir.we will neither notice nor consider the substance of the board minutes in adjudicating this appeal.
judicially noticing the existence and the filing of the corporate minutes is a different matter.appellants counsel represent to us that subsequent to filing their opening brief,they discovered two documents produced by the werner company in a related action pending in the new york supreme court between pollack,an appellant herein,and the bontes,other company minority shareholders.they assert that the documents consist of june,werner company board meeting minutes referring to the board february,decision to consummate a sale transaction and a goldman sachs list of potential financial buyers for the werner company.appellants allege that they have been denied access to these documents in this action and also in related state actions.they further assert that the june board minutes will confirm that since,goldman sachs had performed various valuations of the werner company stock,which will conclusively prove that the appellees intentionally misrepresented the value of the appellants shares at the time of appellants stock redemption.
the determination of whether the werner company produced the meeting minutes during discovery in the new york action is capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy can not reasonably be questioned by the werner company itself,or by any of the management defendants.in short,the board meeting minutes exist,certainly were produced by the company in the new york supreme court,and amply justify the late effort by appellants to amend their complaint.we can and will judicially notice the existence and filing of these minutes under.b 
federal rule of civil procedure a states that 
a party may amend the party pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served otherwise a party may amend the party pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.
emphasis added.rule provides a flexible basic policy statement allowing courts freely to allow parties to amend their pleadings.charles alan wright,arthur miller,mary kay kane,federal practice procedure ed.courts of appeals may grant a party leave to amend its compliant.see,dunn trans world airlines,cir concerning amendment to allow pleadings to conform to evidence adduced at trial under fed.civ.proc.b moore federal practice,after final judgment and on appeal,amendments may be possible,but the pleader burden increases.subsequent leave to amend will be granted sparingly and only if justice requires.in the alternative,a court of appeals may remand an action with instructions to allow a party to amend a pleading.see,moore agency for intern.
in moore,the court remanded a pro se plaintiff action back to the district court with instructions to allow the plaintiff to plead facts sufficient to meet the heightened pleading standard for bivens actions.see moore,at.in pross katz,cir,the court remanded an action so that the plaintiff could amend his complaint to satisfy the heightened pleading requirement for fraud.the court decision to remand was based in large part on new information provided to the court for the first time at oral argument of the appeal.
the liberal standard announced in fed.civ.proc.a becomes less flexible after a final judgment is entered.see harris city of auburn,cir a fter judgment has been entered the party making a motion to amend a pleading had better provide the court with a good reason to grant his motion.first nat.bank continental illinois nat.bank,cir t he presumption in favor of liberality in granting motions to amend is reversed after judgment has been entered.the dartmouth review dartmouth college,cir a s the case passes through various litigatory stages,the pleader burden to obtain leave to amend grows progressively heavier a mendments will sometimes be allowed,but such instances comprise the exception,not the rule.however,in the dartmouth review,the court implied that the surfacing of some new concept making workable an action previously in the doldrums was a ground for granting leave to amend during the pendency of an appeal.see the dartmouth review,at citing pross,at.
although we are reluctant to allow amendment of a pleading at this stage of the proceedings,the plaintiffs were precluded from engaging in discovery in the district court.without discovery,plaintiffs had no way to obtain the meeting minutes other than by happenstance.we will not add to the strict discovery restrictions in the private securities litigation reform act pslra by narrowly construing rule in this case,even at this late stage in the litigation.given the high burdens the pslra placed on plaintiffs,justice and fairness require that the plaintiffs before us be allowed an opportunity to amend their complaint to include allegations relating to the newly discovered board meeting minutes.allowing the minutes and related evidence to be introduced in the district court will not unduly prejudice the defendants they have access to the minutes and they presumably know about the documents because they produced them in the first place.the company production supports the minutes authenticity.like all other evidentiary facts,any allegations in the amendment will be subject to authentication,and in the district court.
construing plaintiffs alternative request in their reply brief as a motion for leave to amend their amended complaint to aver facts consistent with recently discovered evidence,we will vacate the order of the district court dismissing the action as to the count i stock redemption and remand the action to the district court with directions to allow the plaintiff to file a second amended complaint based upon the existence of the aforesaid minutes.
we now turn to the allegations in count one dealing with the restricted stock plan.appellants assert that they were not adequately put on notice of the plan adoption because the information regarding the plan was buried in the various disclosure documents.the district court dismissed this claim,holding that the company adequately described the plan in the annual report and the letter accompanying it.we agree.
under the buried facts doctrine,a disclosure is deemed inadequate if it is presented in a way that conceals or obscures the information sought to be disclosed.the doctrine applies when the fact in question is hidden in a voluminous document or is disclosed in a piecemeal fashion which prevents a reasonable shareholder from realizing the correlation and overall import of the various facts interspersed throughout the document.kas financial general bankshares.having reviewed the relevant documents,we believe that the adoption and the details of the restricted stock plan were adequately disclosed.
the adoption of the plan was first revealed in a letter dated april,which was sent to all shareholders along with the annual report.the letter stated 
an appropriate program to insure the retention,financial reward and motivation of key executives is an important element in any business but even more critical in a family business.for several years this concern has been expressed by many shareholders and discussed by the board of directors.several outside consultants have addressed this matter and the directors authorized the establishment of a program in march.the restricted stock plan is designed as a pay for performance program which is keyed to future increases in the value of the company common stock values.the plan is quite similar to many such plans used by listed companies but it is more restrictive and less generous.
a more detailed description of the plan was set forth in the annual report at note,entitled subsequent events.the relevant section of the report,which accompanied the letter,stated 
in march,a restricted stock plan was established whereby the board of directors may grant awards of restricted class b shares to certain key employees of the company.the plan restricts the sale of these shares by the employee until the earlier of seven years of service from the date of the award,attainment of age,death,or permanent disability.if the employee terminates employment prior to the completion of the seven years of service,then such shares are forfeited.
the plan provides the company a permanent right of first refusal to acquire any awarded shares an employee wishes to sell.the company would acquire the shares from the employee for an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time of sale less the fair market value of the shares at the date of their award.to date no awards have been granted.
in addition,each annual report from through published details concerning the restricted stock plan,including the number of shares issued during the relevant time period.this information was printed in a single section entitled note stock and per share data.
the cases that have applied the buried facts doctrine have addressed situations where the manner of disclosure disguised or seriously distorted important information.see,blanchette providence worcester,prospectus stated at the outset that acceptance of the proposed tender offer would leave shareholders with similar voting rights,but information on the penultimate page indicated that acceptance of the offer would substantially dilute those rights national home products,gray,information regarding litigation between company and its former president inadequately disclosed because it was segmented into three different parts each presented in a different place in the documents provided shareholders kohn american metal climax,page statement explaining proposed merger buried crucial information regarding the directors conflicts of interests and the investment advisors lack of independence in appendices near the end of the document,but placed advisor opinion that the transaction was fair on page in type.here,on the other hand,the restricted stock plan was prominently addressed in a contiguous section of the letter accompanying the annual report,as well as in the report itself and in subsequent annual reports.accordingly,we hold that the buried facts doctrine does not apply.
appellants also assert,for the first time on appeal,that the descriptions of the restricted stock plan were misleading because they describe the plan beneficiaries as key executives and key employees rather than disclosing that the plan would only benefit the ten management defendants.appellants claim that,had they known that the plan was limited to the management defendants,they would have realized that the shares issued thereunder had been issued for less than fair consideration,giving rise to a cause of action for the wrongful dilution of their shares.these allegations do not state a claim under the federal securities laws.
claims grounded in breach of fiduciary duty or improper management are not actionable under section b or rule.see in re craftmatic securities litigation,cir citations omitted.moreover,a plaintiff may not bootstrap a claim of breach of fiduciary duty into a federal securities claim by alleging that directors failed to disclose the breach of fiduciary duty.kas,at.accord,lewis chrysler,cir.
appellants claim that the description of the plan beneficiaries that appeared in the disclosure documents was materially misleading because it failed to expose the management defendants breach of state law duties.when the incremental value of disclosure is solely to place potential investors on notice that management is culpable of a breach of faith or incompetence,the failure to disclose does not violate the securities laws.craftmatic,at.accord,lewis,at management failure to disclose motive for resisting corporate takeover was not actionable under federal securities laws.accordingly,we dismiss this claim without prejudice to appellants right to file an action in the state court.
finally,we consider the allegations appellants put forth in count two of their amende
