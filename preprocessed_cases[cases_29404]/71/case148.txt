named plaintiffs and class representatives thomas dalberth,robert roten,georgia stanley,and the international brotherhood of electrical workers local welfare fund collectively,plaintiffs appeal from an april,judgment and a march,ruling of the united states district court for the district of connecticut alvin thompson,granting summary judgment in favor of xerox corporation and executive officers barry romeril,paul allaire,and richard thoman collectively,xerox or defendants.in re xerox.sec,d xerox.
we consider here a situation where a corporation undertakes a,worldwide restructuring initiative,which was itself comprised of multiple smaller,and address whether there is a genuine dispute of material fact with respect to the sufficiency of the corporation disclosures regarding the progress of a single.plaintiffs filed this class action in alleging that xerox and executive officers romeril,allaire,and thoman violated federal securities law by materially misrepresenting that xerox worldwide restructuring initiative was financially beneficial to the corporation,when,in fact,one specific component of the restructuring the customer business organization reorganization was causing significant and ongoing economic distress to the company.because we conclude that there is no genuine dispute of material fact with respect to the sufficiency of xerox disclosures about the successes and failures of this component of its worldwide restructuring,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants.
background 
this is a lawsuit brought on behalf of all persons who purchased common stock from xerox during the period from october,through october,alleging violations of the securities exchange act of the exchange act.plaintiffs bring their claims under sections b and a of the exchange act b and a,and rule,b,promulgated by the securities and exchange commission sec pursuant to section b of the exchange act.
the actions giving rise to this lawsuit commenced as a result of xerox taking on several initiatives in and,when xerox was attempting to make itself more competitive in the global market.during some or all of this time,romeril was xerox chief financial officer cfo allaire was xerox chief executive officer ceo and thoman was xerox president and chief operating officer coo.thoman also served temporarily as ceo from to.the three initiatives relevant to this lawsuit are 
the worldwide restructuring wwr,announced on april,which included specific projects and was intended to be fully implemented in 
the customer business organization reorganization cbo reorganization,which was one of the wwr initiatives and was focused primarily on improving and centralizing the support to xerox sales force,known as the north american solutions group nasg and 
the sales force realignment sfr,announced on january,which was distinct from the wwr,and had a goal of realigning sales force territories from to selling.
as discussed in greater detail below,plaintiffs contend that the problems that arose from the cbo reorganization which involved the closure of one of xerox four customer administrative centers cacs and the reorganization of the three remaining centers into customer business centers cbcs were insufficiently disclosed to the market.
the district court opinion sets out in commendable detail the factual background in this case,with which we assume the parties familiarity.see xerox,d at.we set forth below primarily facts which are pertinent to the question of sufficient disclosure.this evidence is taken from the sizable summary judgment record,and is undisputed unless otherwise noted.
i.the worldwide restructuring program 
on april,xerox announced the wwr,a restructuring program that had the goal of enhancing its competitive position and lowering costs overall.in xerox form k submission to the sec,xerox identified and described the following three k ey initiatives of the wwr 
consolidation of european customer support centers into one facility and implementing a shared services organization for order entry,invoicing,and other and sales operations.
streamlining manufacturing logistics,distribution and service operations.this will include centralizing parts depots and outsourcing storage and distribution.
overhauling our internal processes and associated resources,including closing one of four customer administrative centers with the remaining three refocused by customer segment,enabling improved customer support at lower cost.the cbo reorganization 
app x at.the wwr also anticipated the elimination of an estimated positions worldwide,to be accomplished through voluntary reductions and layoffs.app x at.xerox estimated that once fully implemented,the savings from the wwr would amount to approximately billion annually.
the cbo reorganization,listed as the third key initiative above,involved the elimination of approximately positions,and was anticipated to cost about million to implement and ultimately produce million in annual savings.it primarily involved the closure of one of xerox four cacs,and the reorganization of the three remaining cacs into cbcs,located in illinois,texas,and florida.as part of the cbo reorganization,xerox transferred the order entry function originally performed by customer business representatives cbrs in its regional sales offices around the to the three cbcs.employees at the cbcs required substantial training in order to take on these shifted responsibilities.
on october,xerox issued a release reporting strong third quarter earnings for,attributing the earnings per share increase in part to the initial benefits from the worldwide restructuring program.app x at.xerox also reported that in connection with the wwr,employees had left the company during the third quarter,bringing the total number of positions eliminated thus far to.the release reminded the public that a pproximately jobs will be eliminated under the program,which is designed to enhance the company competitive position and further align its cost structure with the demands of the digital world.app x at.
internal communications about the cbo reorganization 
as memorialized in xerox internal communications,the wwr,and also the cbo reorganization specifically,contemplated and caused significant changes in staffing levels.to put it in xerox terms,roughly heads were captured as a result of the cbo reorganization.app x at.these shifts in staffing had effects on xerox operations throughout the united states.
by way of example,the accounting firm kpmg visited the texas cac on october and,and reported several issues with the cbc transition,including that s ales representatives are very unhappy with the lack of face to face interaction with the cbrs.app x at.challenges with staffing changes and reductions,due to the disruption created by the reduction in resources and the restructuring transition changes,app x at,were further described in an internal memorandum prepared by kpmg on the subject of billing quality dated november.
the november kpmg memorandum specifically described the effects of the cbo reorganization on bill processing,which included moving eighty percent of xerox accounts to new support locations c oincident with the closing and reorganization,very few tenured order processing administrators relocated to the new cbcs,and experienced collection and billing administrators were to order entry positions.app x at.the result of all of these shifts was that aproximately twenty percent of the billing support staff was comprised of completely new hires.the memorandum projected further deterioration in billing and invoicing prior to any significant improvements in those areas.app x at.in another internal memorandum sent to the operations committee on the same day,accounts receivable fund usage was described as worse than the prior year,with the deterioration largely driven by the reorganization of the customer administration centers in the app x at.
internal communications about the cbo reorganization 
in its internal communications throughout,xerox attempted to deal with the cbo reorganization and its effects on operations.in april,the president of the nasg,thomas dolan,submitted a memorandum to romeril on the subject of second half in response to romeril request for key messages to the investment community.app x at.dolan noted that the profit plan shortfall was attributable to poor sale activity level,a sale gross margin shortfall,weaker than expected post sale,and above plan costs.app x at.he also noted that w e are currently addressing several cost related issues including admin resource and bad debt flow through impact on our aging receivable.app x at.
on july,an internal memorandum from patrick fulford,the vice president of the nasg finance,described a s tate of e mergency for the nasg.app x at.this correspondence did not reference or identify the cbo reorganization specifically,although the attached chart revealed low sales productivity and bad debt.app x at.a july,internal presentation on the cbo reorganization noted the massive backlog related to aged accounts receivable and billing errors,and noted that it was t oo far too fast.app x at.a subsequent slide stated that w e have a five alarm fire,and noted major impact on customers and sales productivity.app x at.the presentation also cited problems with customer satisfaction billing accuracy and timeliness as well as employees under severe duress.app x at.
an internal memorandum dated july sent from a newly hired senior vice president of the nasg to cbo employees,acknowledged that there were some serious issues with which to contend.the memorandum stated that we obviously have gone through a massive change in the last months.we took a significant reduction in resources and lost substantial experience and tenure senior management has acknowledged we went too far,too fast.app x at.
in a document titled cbo background summary created for a meeting in september,the cbo reorganization was described as having caused problems at the service level immediately.id.at.specifically,it identified accounts receivable and days sale outstanding dso numbers as having increased,which meant that xerox was not collecting on its bills as rapidly as it had in the past.see xerox.at.the r oot c auses of the problems were described as lack of resources,loss of skills,and disruption,as well as the fact that xerox had lost hundreds of of experience when we redeployed the highly experienced cbrs into other assignments and hired many completely new people in the cbcs.app x at.
later in,thoman and romeril grappled with the effects of the cbo reorganization within the larger context of the wwr.for example,a september internal memorandum from thoman to operations committee members,with the subject headcount approval,warned that the company must be better in control of manpower given the company expenditures,and he noted that a s a result of our failure to strictly control resources,we have,in essence,spent much of the benefit of the restructuring action.app x at.on october,romeril sent thoman an internal memorandum with talking points in preparation for the meeting for preliminary third quarter results,and at point of the memorandum romeril asked w hat happened to restructuring benefits if they were real,they must have been spent,delayed or offset by deterioration elsewhere.app x at.
ii.xerox public disclosures during the class period october through october 
while xerox officers were drafting internal memoranda,presentations,and emails discussing how to fix the billing issues and the increased and dso numbers as a result of the cbo reorganization,xerox was also issuing public statements about how its wwr was progressing.we provide a small representative portion of those statements in the following two subsections.
october december disclosures 
in xerox third quarter form q filing with the sec dated november xerox stated that there were higher accounts receivable due to stronger equipment sales growth and some increase in days sales outstanding due to the temporary effects from the reorganization and consolidation of customer administrative centers.app x at.
romeril,xerox cfo at the time,met with several different securities analysts in november and december.on november,in a meeting with an analyst at putnam securities,contemporaneous notes taken by leslie varon,xerox controller,reflected that romeril acknowledged that xerox had not done well on inven and receiv mgt,but assured that we all over it,and predicted that i n,we go back to ratios we had in then move forward from there.app x at.at a december,meeting with wellington management,romeril noted that there was a temporary disruption with due to admin,but that it s hould be fixed by end.app x at.at another december meeting,romeril told a merrill lynch company analyst that xerox receivables issue was attributed to its consolidation of customer administration centers and changes in collection processes in the united states.
following this last meeting,a merrill lynch analyst report dated december described r evenue growth as its concern.app x at.the report announced that xerox planned to improve cash flow management,and noted that operating cash flows had been negatively affected by increases in receivables and inventories.finally,the report noted that t he company estimates that it can reduce inventories by million no and improve dsos through faster collections.app x at.
january october disclosures 
at an earnings release teleconference for the fourth quarter of,held on january,romeril announced and income increases,which he primarily attributed to outstanding growth in digital product revenues,improved operating margins,and the ongoing benefits from our worldwide restructuring program.app x at.he also noted that dso had increased because of the cbo reorganization,stating that s ome of the restructuring that we did in the united states gave us a dislocation so that our day sales outstanding went out a bit.and on a mechanistic basis alone,that gives you a bit more in the bad debts.app x at.at a meeting with a morgan stanley dean witter analyst also held that day,romeril commented that xerox cost cutting measures and restructuring had been t oo ambitious.app x at see also app x at.romeril also mentioned that if he was right about the r eceiv ables,they wo see bad debts repeated.app x at.
the following day,morgan stanley dean witter issued a report describing this information to investors,noting that we raise a cautionary eyebrow at xerox working capital performance in,and that w hile full details have yet to be disclosed,management stated that both inventory and sales outstanding proved disappointments in.app x at.
on february,morgan stanley dean witter released a preliminary update on year end balance sheet and cash flow items stating 
accounts receivable also expanded xerox balance increased,to billion.the receivables ballooned as xerox attempted to restructure several operations in the us.the reorganization and reorientation of business units from geographical to customer focused led to the disruption in billing cycle productivity.once again,management remains committed to reducing receivable levels back to those found in by.
in april,the center for financial research and analysis cfra released a report detailing s igns of possible operational deterioration for xerox during,and reporting that xerox receivables grew much faster than revenue during.app x at.the report quantified comparative growth in receivables and dsos from the fourth quarter of through,and reported that xerox attributed the december to december dso increase to temporary effects from the reorganization and consolidation of customer administrative centers.id.
the next month,at an investor conference held on may,romeril stated that 
cash generation was clearly unsatisfactory.and it was principally caused by a deterioration in receivables,in day sales outstanding and our inventory performance.the growth in was primarily the result of the reorganization and restructuring in our administrative support activities.we closed one customer admin center and we reorganized the remaining three admin centers from a geographic to a customer segment basis.much along the lines of what we doing for the business as a whole.and frankly,we reduced the headcount as we did that at too fast a rate.and it was too much change,too fast.
app x at.later on at the same meeting,romeril explained further 
w e had,as we rolled out our g a programs,individual areas where we caused some lack of focus on our sales force because of our g a activities.for example,we talked about our chicago center i,one of the three cbcs that remained reorganization.unquestionably that had some impact on our sales force.they had to worry about the billing being done correctly.
a subsequent painewebber research note dated june stated that 
it appears that xerox restructuring program in the had quite an adverse effect on the company receivables in and sic.in the second half of,xerox reduced its administrative centers to from previously,reducing administration headcount by in the process.the administrative centers were reorganized to specialize on general markets channel,agent,concessionaire and sales,the public sector and other direct sales force included.as a result of the significant disruption from moving and layoffs,the company order and invoicing processes experienced significant delays and even errors,pushing up receivables.in fact,xerox is now in the process of some laid off personnel in an effort to improve the order process at the new administration centers.improvements are already underway and xerox expects significant improvement in receivables by second half.
on august,salomon smith barney reported that the figure rose by and sequentially from.app x at.the report also commented that 
while this news is disappointing,this should not have come as too much of a surprise,since management has indicated repeatedly that receivables would start to come down more in the second half than the first.the company is adding over people back to its cacs,in part to help bolster collections efforts,which were damaged by headcount reductions during the restructuring.this will be an important issue to monitor for improvement in and.
in a september announcement,romeril acknowledged that i t is also very clear that we significantly underestimated the revenue impact in the first quarter of this year of all the customer administration changes we made in the usa last year.app x at.then,on october,xerox announced that it would not make its third quarter earnings projections.xerox press release provided,in pertinent part 
xerox corporation announced today that it expects to report essentially flat revenues for the third quarter and about a percent decline in diluted earnings per share from cents in the third quarter.overall,revenue was weaker than anticipated both in the united states and europe,particularly in september.the earnings shortfall is a combination of weaker revenues together with unfavorable product mix and increased competitive pressures,which significantly impacted operating margins.sales productivity was affected by the continued realignment to an approach and in the by the ongoing impact of the customer administration restructuring.in addition,results in brazil were hurt by the continuing effects of the currency devaluation and economic weakness.fuji xerox results were lower than anticipated.
today announcement is clearly disappointing,said xerox president and chief executive officer rick thoman.however,we are convinced that our strategy of focusing on industry solutions,a broader array of distribution channels and an expanding product and services portfolio is correct and over time will achieve the revenue and earnings benefits it is intended to produce.
public disclosures about the sales force realignment 
on january,xerox had also announced another initiative,the sfr.the sfr focused on realigning xerox document processing business under four operations industry solutions,general markets,developing sfr was ultimately to realign the sales force territories from selling to selling.the sfr was distinct from the wwr or the cbo reorganization,though there was some overlap in its focus on the sales force.
related to the sfr,on september,a prudential securities analyst issued a report with a heading xerox to implement another round of salesforce realignments in lowers revenue visibility and likely to pressure xerox until impact can be determined.app x at.the report continued 
our field contacts are indicating that xerox is readying another round of salesforce account realignment similar to the program which disrupted the first half revenue performance.we confronted xerox management and they acknowledged that another round is planned for and indicated the number of people involved and accounts involved would be larger than the realignment which was cited as a large portion of the cause for the revenue shortfall.xerox management must be cognizant of the painful experience they had last year,and they are indicating they are taking every possible step to minimize any disruption from this move.
app x at.later that same day,reuters reported that shares of xerox fell more than ten percent amid fresh growth concerns.app x at.
the prudential securities report was based on a misunderstanding that there was a new realignment program,rather than a mere continuation of the sfr.romeril corrected this misunderstanding in a subsequent announcement held on september there seems to have been some misconception that we announced a new restructuring of the sales organization,last week.no such announcement occurred in fact,we simply took another step implementing the direction we announced last january i,the sfr.app x at.
alleged corrective disclosures 
plaintiffs loss causation expert professor anthony saunders opined that there were two corrective disclosures,which revealed the problems with the cbo reorganization to the market,each of which has been already described above.first,plaintiffs claim that the september,prudential securities report describing xerox as readying another round of salesforce account realignment,app x at,after which xerox shares dropped,was a corrective disclosure.second,plaintiffs point to the october,press release announcing that xerox would be missing its projected earnings for the third quarter of,and reporting that s ales productivity was affected by the continued realignment to an approach and in the by the ongoing impact of the customer administration restructuring,app x at,as having a corrective effect on xerox stock price.
iii.proceedings before the district court 
plaintiffs filed suit in this case in,alleging violations of section b of the exchange act and rule and section a of the exchange act against the individual defendants.in,the district court denied xerox motion to dismiss.see in re xerox.sec,d.the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification in.over the course of and,the court ruled on multiple motions to exclude the testimony of experts proffered by both sides.see in re xerox.sec,d saunders ruling in re xerox.sec,d denis ruling in re xerox.sec,wl,civil action cv awt,gompers ruling.
in march,the district court granted xerox motion for summary judgment in its entirety,holding that the statements about the overall of the wwr did not preclude the entry of summary judgment in favor of xerox.xerox,d at.the court also held that while xerox had not met its burden of proving that it did not have a duty to disclose that the cbo reorganization offset some of the of the wwr,id.at,and even assuming that xerox had a duty to disclose,there was no genuine dispute that the company had sufficiently disclosed the challenges that it was experiencing with the cbo reorganization,id.at.as to the corrective disclosures,the district court concluded that those two disclosures did not add any new information to the market,and as a result,plaintiffs had not established a genuine dispute of material fact as to loss causation.id.at.finally,in light of its conclusion that there was no underlying violation of federal securities law,the court also granted summary judgment on plaintiffs control person liability claim against the individual defendants.id.at.
discussion 
on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants because,viewing the record evidence in plaintiffs favor xerox misrepresented that the wwr resulted in financial benefits to the corporation xerox public disclosures about the challenges resulting from the cbo reorganization including the increases in and dsos omitted the extent of the cbo reorganization xerox falsely attributed its decreased sales activity to the sfr,rather than the cbo reorganization and the district court september saunders ruling,which found admissible plaintiffs witness anthony saunders expert report on loss causation,precluded the district court from granting summary judgment.

ii.analysis 
in essence,this case is about plaintiffs wish to have known more about xerox wwr and cbo reorganization.however,a corporation is not required to disclose a fact merely because a reasonable investor would very much like to know that fact.rather,an omission is actionable under the securities laws only when the corporation is subject to a duty to disclose the omitted facts.in re time warner.sec,cir see also matrixx initiatives.at the question remains whether a reasonable investor would have viewed the nondisclosed information as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available t he mere existence of reports of adverse events will not satisfy this standard.something more is needed internal quotation marks omitted.
in light of xerox public statements about its restructuring and realignment initiatives,we conclude that there is no genuine dispute as to whether a reasonable investor would have viewed the undisclosed facts about the cbo reorganization as having significantly altered the total mix of information that was already disclosed by xerox or otherwise available.below,we first address plaintiffs contention that xerox statements about the financial benefits of the wwr to the corporation were actionably false.next,we address plaintiffs contention that,viewing the evidence in their favor,summary judgment was improper because of the dispute regarding whether xerox partial disclosures and overly tepid language describing the cbo reorganization were materially misleading.finally,we address briefly plaintiffs remaining assertions challenging the district court conclusions on loss causation and the saunders ruling.
a.there is no genuine dispute regarding the statements about the wwr 
in ruling on xerox motion for summary judgment,the district court considered both plaintiffs expert charles drott report and xerox expense chart,prepared by nasg finance vice president fulford,and concluded that approximately million in expense was incurred during the class period as a result of the cbo reorganization.xerox,d at.after correcting for double counting across both documents,the court determined that the drott report and fulford chart showed a total expense of million to xerox.id.at.taking into account xerox million in cost savings as a result of the wwr,the court decided that xerox had a net cost savings from the worldwide restructuring of at least million.id.at.
we conclude that the record on summary judgment creates no genuine dispute regarding the truthfulness of xerox statements about the overall benefits of the wwr.as an initial matter,plaintiffs provide no public statements actually quantifying the amount of savings xerox claimed resulted from the wwr,and contemporaneous records from xerox show million in savings in the fourth quarter of million in the first quarter of million in the second quarter of and million in the third quarter of.plaintiffs do not dispute xerox claimed figures,and they acknowledge that the elimination of jobs worldwide necessarily reduced costs.at most,the record supports an inference that the additional costs created by the cbo reorganization offset savings created by the restructuring as a whole.
plaintiffs attempt to create a genuine factual dispute by quarreling with the extent of the benefits accrued as a result of the wwr,rather than with the fact that benefits did accrue,which is not an argument they raised below.we decline to exercise our discretion to consider this argument for the first time on appeal see in re nortel networks sec,cir allianz ins.lerner,cir norton sam club,cir.
further,though plaintiffs rely on two contemporaneous internal documents to argue that there is a genuine dispute as to whether the stated benefits of the wwr were illusory,these documents,even when viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,do not reasonably permit the inference plaintiffs seek to draw.the first document,a september internal memorandum from thoman to operations committee members,notes that a s a result of our failure to strictly control resources,we have,in essence,spent much of the benefit of the restructuring action.app x at.second,plaintiffs point to an october internal memorandum from romeril to thoman,prepared in advance of the meeting for preliminary third quarter results for.in particular,plaintiffs emphasize romeril question w hat happened to restructuring benefits if they were real,they must have been spent,delayed or offset by deterioration elsewhere.app x at.
since there is no reading of the actual numbers that supports these statements,they are evidently exaggerations intended to inject urgency into the company efforts.more importantly,they would be misleading if publicly disclosed as the company assessment.further,while these two internal documents show that xerox had significant costs to contend with,they also reveal that there were undisputed benefits that had accrued from the wwr for xerox to put to use.thus,these two documents do not support the reasonable conclusion that xerox made any misstatements as to the benefits of the wwr.
plaintiffs also assert that these statements about the wwr benefits were merely that required a more thorough explanation to not be deceptive.however,as discussed above,plaintiffs did not actually show a genuine dispute as to whether xerox accrued financial benefits as a result of the wwr.on this record,it would be conjecture to conclude that xerox sta
