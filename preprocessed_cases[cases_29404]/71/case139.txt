these interlocutory appeals require us to resolve two questions that have recurred in recent cases involving residential securities rmbs,but that this court has not yet had occasion to address.the first question is whether,under our decision in neca ibew health welfare fund goldman sachs,cir,cert.denied,a named plaintiff in a putative class action has class standing to assert,on absent class members behalf,claims against the trustee of an rmbs trust in which the named plaintiff did not invest.the second question is whether the provisions of the trust indenture act of tia,impose obligations on the trustees of rmbs trusts governed by pooling and servicing agreements psas.we answer both questions in the negative,and we therefore affirm in part and reverse in part the decision of the district court.
background 
since the collapse of financial markets in the latter part of the last decade,the rmbs trust has become a familiar subject of litigation in this circuit.see,city of pontiac policemen firemen ret.ubs ag,cir am.int l,bank of am,cir.we have described in the past how an rmbs trust operates 
to raise funds for new mortgages,a mortgage lender sells pools of mortgages into trusts created to receive the stream of interest and principal payments from the mortgage borrowers.the right to receive trust income is parceled into certificates and sold to investors,called certificateholders.the trustee hires a mortgage servicer to administer the mortgages by enforcing the mortgage terms and administering the payments.the terms of the securitization trusts as well as the rights,duties,and obligations of the trustee,seller,and servicer are set forth in governing agreements,frequently styled as psas.

at issue in this case are rmbs trusts created between and for which defendant the bank of new york mellon bnym acts as trustee.the majority of these trusts are governed by psas,although some are governed by sale and servicing agreements ssas paired with indentures.the trusts are organized under new york law,and the ssa and trusts are organized under delaware law.are pension funds that invested in certain of the trusts for which bnym serves as trustee specifically,they hold certificates issued by of the new york trusts and one of the ssa and delaware trusts.plaintiffs assert claims on behalf of a putative class comprising investors who purchased certificates from any one of the trusts.
countrywide home loans,and its affiliates countrywide,now owned by bank of america corporation,originated the residential mortgage loans underlying the trusts at issue and sold them to the trusts.countywide also acted as master servicer for the trusts,meaning that it was charged with collecting payments from the mortgage loans and remitting them to the trusts.in connection with these loan sales,countrywide made numerous representations and warranties about the characteristics,credit quality,and underwriting of the mortgage loans.if countrywide received notice that particular loans breached these representations and warranties in a way that materially and adversely affected the certificateholders,it was obligated to cure the defect or repurchase the defective loans from the trust.plaintiffs allege that defects among the loans sold to the trusts were systemic and pervasive as a result of countrywide failure to adhere to prudent underwriting standards,leading to widespread breaches of its representations and warranties.these defects allegedly caused significant losses to certificateholders because the loans underlying the trusts defaulted at rates.
plaintiffs seek to hold bnym responsible for the losses allegedly caused by countrywide breaches of its representations and warranties.they claim that bnym owed to certificateholders fiduciary duties of care and loyalty,contractual duties under the trusts governing agreements,and statutory duties imposed by the tia.for instance,the psas provided that bnym was required to provide notice to countrywide if it became aware of a material breach of the representations and warranties if countrywide did not act to remedy the breach within days,bnym was required to exercise its powers under the psa with such care and skill as a prudent person would use under the circumstances.plaintiffs contend that bnym had a similar duty under the tia.see c the indenture trustee shall exercise in case of default such of the rights and powers vested in it by such indenture,and to use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise,as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.according to plaintiffs,bnym knew of the widespread defects among the trusts loans,and it therefore had a duty to enforce countrywide repurchase obligation and,pursuant to the tia,to inform certificateholders of countrywide breaches.see id.b.
plaintiffs further claim that bnym failed to meet its contractual obligation to ensure that the loans held by the trusts were properly documented.under the psas,bnym had a duty to examine the mortgage loan files at the closing of each securitization and prepare an exception report informing countrywide of any missing or incomplete documents.countrywide was then required to cure any deficiencies within days of the closing date.according to plaintiffs,the deficiencies that bnym identified remained uncured beyond that period,thereby triggering bnym duty to act on certificateholders behalf to ensure that countrywide cured the deficiencies.these persisting document deficiencies allegedly made it more difficult to foreclose on delinquent loans,causing losses to certificateholders.
plaintiffs filed a complaint against bnym in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on august,and filed a verified class action and derivative complaint the amended complaint on august.on december,bnym moved to dismiss the amended complaint,arguing,among other things,that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring claims on behalf of investors in the hundreds of trusts in which plaintiffs themselves did not invest,and that certificates issued by the new york trusts are not subject to the tia.
on april,the district court william pauley iii,judge granted in part and denied in part bnym motion to dismiss.ret.bd.of policemen annuity benefit fund bank of mellon,d bnym i.the court determined that plaintiffs did not have standing to bring claims pertaining to rmbs trusts in which no named plaintiff had invested,and accordingly dismissed those claims.id.at.plaintiffs challenge this dismissal on appeal.
the district court also determined that the tia applies to certificates issued by the new york trusts.looking to a of the tia,a,the provision that bnym relied upon as exempting the certificates at issue from the tia reach the district court asserted that the tia covers only debt securities,and does not apply to equity securities.d at.the court then rejected bnym argument that the certificates in question were equity securities,instead finding that the certificates were similar in form and function to bonds issued under an indenture,and also that they resemble debt,as defined by federal tax law.id.at,quoting ellington credit fund,select portfolio servicing,d,internal quotation marks omitted.the court also declined to assign any persuasive force to interpretive guidance on the sec website,which indicated that rmbs certificates are exempt from the tia pursuant to a thereof,which exempts certificate s of interest or participation in two or more securities having substantially different rights and privileges.a.the sec position,in the court view,was unsupported,contrary to the case law,and unpersuasive.id.at.
on april,bnym moved for reconsideration of the district court tia holding or,in the alternative,to certify the issue for interlocutory appeal.for the first time,bnym cited a of the tia as a basis for arguing that the statute did not apply to certificates issued by the new york trusts the district court rejected this new argument and denied reconsideration of its earlier holding,but it agreed to certify the question for interlocutory appeal.ret.bd.of policemen annuity benefit fund bank of mellon,cv,wl,at,bnym ii.bnym petitioned this court for leave to appeal pursuant to b,and plaintiffs filed their own petition seeking review of the district court decision on standing.see ex rel.attica cent,cir w e have the discretion to consider any aspect of the order from which the appeal is taken.we granted both petitions on may.
after we accepted the appeals,plaintiffs filed,with the district court permission,a second amended complaint in order to make additional factual allegations supporting their remaining claims,delete certain claims and theories that had proven unnecessary as the case progressed,and clarify the basis for the court diversity jurisdiction.plaintiffs later filed a motion under federal rules of civil procedure a and seeking an indicative ruling that the district court would permit them to file a third amended complaint containing new allegations if this court were to remand for that purpose the district court denied that motion on september.ret.bd.of policemen annuity benefit fund bank of mellon,bnym iii.because our decision does not turn on any allegations present in the second amended complaint but not in the first,we need not decide which complaint is operative.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court decision on a rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,accepting the complaint factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor.rothstein ubs ag,cir.the same standards apply to dismissals for lack of standing pursuant to rule b where,as here,the district court based its decision solely on the complaint allegations.see rajamin deutsche bank trust,cir.
we first address whether plaintiffs have standing to assert claims related to certificates issued by trusts in which no plaintiff ever invested.plaintiffs point out that our decision in neca,which was issued after the district court rendered its decision,permits named plaintiffs in putative class actions to assert claims related to rmbs certificates that they do not own.neca,however,involved misrepresentation claims under the securities act of,and we have not addressed its application to claims against rmbs trustees.district courts have divided on the issue.compare.police pension ret.bank ass n,with policemen annuity benefit fund bank of,na,d.we conclude that plaintiffs lack standing to assert claims against bnym related to trusts in which they did not invest,and we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of those claims.
article iii of the constitution limits federal courts jurisdiction to cases and controversies.const.art.iii.one component of this requirement is the doctrine of standing,which requires every federal plaintiff to establish,for each claim he seeks to press,daimlerchrysler cuno,a personal injury that is fairly traceable to the defendant conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief,see lujan defenders of wildlife.in addition to preventing the judiciary from adjudicating generalized grievances better directed to the political branches,see,id.at,standing doctrine requirements ensure that a plaintiff has a sufficiently personal stake in the outcome of the suit so that the parties are adverse,huff asset mgmt.deloitte touche llp,cir.
in neca,we addressed the murky line between traditional article iii standing and class standing.there,the named plaintiff had purchased rmbs certificates from the defendants.it asserted claims under,a,and of the securities act,a,on behalf of a putative class that included purchasers of all certificates that were issued under the same allegedly false and misleading sec shelf registration statement.those certificates,however,had been sold in seventeen separate offerings with unique offering documents,and because the named plaintiff had purchased certificates in only two of the seventeen offerings,the named plaintiff was asserting claims related to certificates from the fifteen other offerings that only absent class members owned.see neca,at.as we noted,the named plaintiff clearly lack ed standing to assert such claims on its behalf because it did not purchase those certificates and so was not injured by any misstatements the defendants might have made about them id.at emphasis added.
we nonetheless considered whether the named plaintiff had class standing to bring claims related to the certificates that it had not purchased on behalf of the absent class members who had purchased them.we began our analysis by recognizing a tension in the supreme court case law as to whether variation between a named plaintiff claims and the claims of putative class members is a matter of article iii standing or whether it goes to the propriety of class certification under rule.id.at second alteration in original quoting gratz bollinger.despite this tension,we ultimately rejected the plaintiff argument that standing law had nothing to say about the plaintiff ability to assert absent class members claims once the plaintiff had established standing to assert its own claims.id.at.in several cases,we recognized,the supreme court has addressed whether class action plaintiffs who indisputably had standing to bring claims based on their own injuries also had standing to bring other claims,unrelated to those injuries,on behalf of absent class members.compare slum yaretsky,nursing home residents challenging their transfers to lower levels of care lacked standing to challenge other residents transfers to higher levels of care,and lewis casey,court could not grant broad injunction against prison system to remedy injuries beyond those suffered by the named plaintiff,with gratz,at transfer applicant to the university of michigan had standing to challenge the university freshman admissions policy because the use of race in transfer admissions did not implicate a significantly different set of concerns than the use of race in freshman admissions.
from this line of cases,our neca decision distilled a test for class standing,which we must apply in this case 
i n a putative class action,a plaintiff has class standing if he plausibly alleges that he personally has suffered some actual injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant,and that such conduct implicates the same set of concerns as the conduct alleged to have caused injury to other members of the putative class by the same defendants.
neca,at alterations,internal quotation marks,and citations omitted.when this standard is satisfied,the named plaintiff litigation incentives are sufficiently aligned with those of the absent class members that the named plaintiff may properly assert claims on their behalf.see plumbers union local pension fund nomura asset acceptance,cir noting that class standing is based on the incentives of the named plaintiffs to adequately litigate issues of importance to them citing baker carr.neca test,which derives from constitutional standing principles,is thus distinct from the criteria that govern whether a named plaintiff is an adequate class representative under rule a.see neca,at.
in this case,there is no dispute that plaintiffs have satisfied the first part of neca test that is,they have adequately pled that they have personally suffered an actual injury as a result of bnym putatively illegal conduct.that injury is the result of bnym alleged failure as trustee to take appropriate action when faced with defaults on mortgage loans held by the trusts.the critical issue,then,is whether this conduct implicates the same set of concerns as bnym alleged failure to take action with respect to defaults in other trusts in which plaintiffs did not invest.we conclude that it does not.
in neca,the plaintiff alleged that the defendants had violated the securities act by making material misrepresentations about the underwriting guidelines followed by the originators who originated the mortgage loans underlying the rmbs offerings at issue.see neca,at.this court held that the named plaintiff claims implicated the same set of concerns as absent class members claims insofar as the named plaintiff investments and the absent class members investments were backed by loans from the same originators.see id.at t o the extent certain offerings were backed by loans originated by originators common to those backing offerings bought by neca,neca claims raise a sufficiently similar set of concerns to permit it to purport to represent from those offerings.
in so holding,we were careful to explain how the absent class members claims were similar to those of the named plaintiff in all essential respects the offering documents contained similar if not identical statements about the originators underwriting guidelines,and the defendants issued,underwrote,and sponsored every certificate from each of the trusts at issue.id.at.the confluence of these similarities led us to conclude that the named plaintiff had the right incentives,largely because the proof contemplated for all of the claims would be sufficiently similar.id.at see also dimuro clinique,llc,app x,cir summary order holding that class standing was lacking because unique evidence will be required to prove that the some advertising statements for each of the seven different products are false and misleading.in other words,because the stated underwriting guidelines for each originator were essentially the same across all of the offering documents,proving that those guidelines were materially misleading as to loans held by one trust would tend to prove that those same guidelines were similarly misleading as to loans held by other trusts.see neca,at reasoning that the location of the representations,which document they were in has no effect on a given purchaser assertion that the representation was misleading.
by contrast,with respect to offerings backed by loans that were not made by the same originators who made the loans underlying the named plaintiff investments,neca held that the named plaintiff claims did not raise the same set of concerns as the absent class members claims,and that the named plaintiff therefore lacked class standing.for those offerings,each of the alleged injuries has the potential to be very different and could turn on very different proof.id.at.more concretely,the question whether one originator,wells fargo followed the underwriting guidelines that defendants ascribed to it might well have had nothing to do with whether another originator,washington mutual followed the guidelines that the defendants represented that it had followed.see id.at.if the named plaintiff investments were backed by loans originated by wells fargo but not washington mutual,why should the not just its lawyers,nomura,at have any stake in proving that washington mutual failed to follow the underwriting guidelines described in the offering documents 
the claims in this case based on alleged violations of the tia,breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith,and breach of fiduciary duty are very different from the claims in neca.plaintiffs allege that bnym violated its duties when it failed to notify certificateholders of countrywide breaches of the governing agreements,failed to force countrywide to repurchase defaulted mortgage loans,and failed to ensure that the mortgage loans held by the trusts were correctly documented.in contrast to neca,where the defendants alleged securities act violations inhered in making the same misstatements across multiple offerings,bnym alleged misconduct must be proved and.for example,whether countrywide breached its obligations under the governing agreements thus triggering bnym duty to act requires examining its conduct with respect to each trust.whether it was obligated to repurchase a given loan requires examining which loans,in which trusts,were in breach of the representations and warranties.and whether a loan documentation was deficient requires looking at individual loans and documents.we see no way in which answering these questions for the trusts in which plaintiffs invested will answer the same questions for the numerous trusts in which they did not invest.
we are not persuaded by plaintiffs arguments to the contrary.plaintiffs claim that evidence of bnym policy of inaction in the face of widespread defaults will be applicable to all of the trusts at issue.but as plaintiffs recognize,even proof that bnym always failed to act when it was required to do so would not prove their case,because they would still have to show which trusts actually had deficiencies that required bnym to act in the first place.
plaintiffs propose to do this by using statistical sampling to show that loans in all of the trusts were defective.whether or not that method of proof could appropriately be used to establish that bnym breached its duties to certificateholders plaintiffs sampling proposal fundamentally misses the point of the class standing inquiry that neca envisions.the core question is whether a plaintiff who has a personal stake in proving her own claims against the defendant has a sufficiently personal and concrete stake in proving other,related claims against the defendant.plaintiffs undertake to explain how,in the interest of proving absent class members claims,plaintiffs could augment the evidence that they would otherwise rely upon to prove their own claims,such as by expanding their sample to include loans from more trusts.but such an expanded evidentiary showing does nothing to reassure us that plaintiffs themselves have any real interest in litigating the absent class members claims.the plaintiff in neca also could have offered evidence concerning whether other trusts offering documents misstated the underwriting guidelines for originators who made the loans underlying only those trusts,but that had no bearing on its standing.the fact that it would be possible for a plaintiff to litigate a given claim plainly does not imply that she should be the one to litigate it.see raines byrd,the standing inquiry focuses on whether the plaintiff is the proper party to bring this suit warth seldin,describing a plaintiff responsibility to allege facts demonstrating that he is a proper party to invoke judicial resolution of the dispute.
in short,the nature of the claims in this case unavoidably generates significant differences in the proof that will be offered for each trust.given these differences,plaintiffs quest to show bnym wrongdoing with respect to their own certificates does not encompass proving claims related to certificates from other trusts.neca,at e ach within an offering or group backed by loans originated by similar lenders has the same necessary stake in litigating whether those lenders in fact abandoned their underwriting guidelines.quoting blum,at.as a result,plaintiffs claims do not implicate the same set of concerns as those of absent class members who purchased certificates issued by trusts in which no named plaintiff invested.we affirm the district court dismissal of those claims for lack of standing.
we next address whether the district court correctly held that the tia applies to the certificates purchased by plaintiffs that were issued by new york trusts the new york certificates.this issue,too,has divided the district courts.compare bnym i,d at tia applies,and policemen annuity benefit fund bank of,d,same,with.police pension ret.bank ass n,s.tia does not apply.because we conclude that the tia does not apply to the new york certificates,we reverse the district court denial of bnym motion to dismiss plaintiffs tia claims pertaining to those certificates.
congress enacted the tia in to address perceived abuses in the bond market.before the statute was passed,companies that issued bonds to the public frequently failed to provide trustees to represent bondholders interests,and even where trustees were provided,they sometimes had conflicts of interest,were not obligated contractually to take action on bondholders behalf,lacked the power and information necessary to do so.see morris cantor,thomas lee hazen,treatise on the law of securities regulation,at ed.to help prevent these sorts of problems,the tia provides that instruments to which it applies must be issued under an indenture that has been qualified by the.for an indenture to be so qualified,it must generally speaking provide for an independent trustee,require the trustee to provide information to investors and to take certain action on their behalf,and require the obligor to supply the trustee with information about the instrument performance.id.
the tia,however,applies only to certain kinds of instruments,which are defined by the statute list of exemptions in other words,only instruments that do not fall within at least one of these exemptions are subject to the tia.see id.bnym contends that the new york certificates at issue in this case fall within two of these exemptions.first,bnym argues that the new york certificates are exempt under a of the tia,id.a,because they are equity securities,not debt securities.second,bnym argues that the certificates are exempt under a of the tia,id.a,which provides that the tia does not apply to any certificate of interest or participation in two or more securities having substantially different rights and privileges.
section a exempts from the tia reach any security other than a a note,bond,debenture,or evidence of indebtedness,whether or not secured,or b a certificate of interest or participation in any such note,bond,debenture,or evidence of indebtedness,or c a temporary certificate for,or guarantee of,any such note,bond,debenture,evidence of indebtedness,or certificate.a.the parties,like the district court,assume that a security is exempt from the tia under a if it is an equity security,but not if it is a debt security.accordingly,pointing to language in the psas that governs the payments to which certificateholders are entitled,bnym argues that the new york certificates lack the fundamental characteristics of debt,which bnym identifies as including the obligation to pay a sum certain at a fixed maturity date.see gilbert comm r of internal revenue,cir comm r of internal revenue holding,cir.bnym also cites a number of industry commentators who have concluded that certificates like those at issue here are exempt from the tia because the certificates are equity instruments,john arnholz edward gainor,offerings of asset backed securities a nn.for their part,plaintiffs primarily point out that courts often describe rmbs in terms evocative of debt although we note that these references are typically made in passing,and not in contexts involving the scope of tia a.see,greenwich fin.servs.distressed mortg.fund llc countrywide fin,cir referring to psas as trust agreements similar to bond indentures in many respects lasalle bank ass nomura asset capital,cir referring to commercial securities as bonds.
we need not decide,however,whether the new york certificates qualify as debt,because this question,on analysis,is not dispositive.even assuming arguendo that the new york certificates do not qualify as debt instruments,instruments fall outside the a exemption if they constitute certificate s of interest or participation in a debt instrument.a b.in fact,by creating distinct exemptions for certain debt instruments and certificates of interest or participation in those debt instruments,a necessarily presumes that at least some certificates of interest or participation subject to the tia will not be debt instruments.at the same time,however,and contrary to plaintiffs position,this does not logically imply that a certificate of interest or participation can not be a debt instrument.for this reason,we are not required to conclude that the new york certificates at issue are not debt in order to hold that they are exempt from the tia under a.and,for the reasons stated below,we agree with bnym and,as it happens,the sec that the new york certificates are certificate s of interest or participation in two or more securities having substantially different rights and privileges,namely,the numerous mortgage loans held by each trust.id.a.therefore,assuming arguendo that these certificates are not exempt from the tia under a,we hold that they are nonetheless exempt under a.
the scope of a is an issue of first impression.t he starting point in any case of interpretation must always be the language itself,giving effect to the plain meaning thereof.kuhne cohen slamowitz,llp,cir quoting tom rice buick pontiac motors,cir internal quotation mark omitted.for a given instrument to be exempt from the tia under a,the instrument must be a certificate of interest or participation in two or more securities that hav e substantially different rights and privileges.a.we address these requirements in turn.
first,we conclude that the new york certificates are certificates of interest or participation.there is little case law interpreting this statutory language,but the supreme court has provided helpful guidance in tcherepnin knight.there,the court concluded that withdrawable capital shares in an illinois bank qualified as securities under the securities exchange act of,because among other things they could be viewed as certificate s of interest or participation in a agreement.at internal quotation marks omitted.it reached this conclusion because the shares were evidenced by a certificate,and the payment of dividends to the certificateholders was contingent upon an apportionment of profits.id.here,too,the new york certificates are evidenced by a certificate as opposed to a note the psas refer to them as mortgage certificates and to the holders of the instruments as certificateholders.additionally,payments on the certificates are contingent on the cash flows generated by the underlying mortgage loans payments on the loans are collected in a certificate account,which is the source of available funds that are distributed to certificateholders according to the terms of the psa see am.int l,bank of am,cir the trust collects the principal and interest payments made by borrowers under the mortgages,and pays those amounts out to the holders of the rmbss in accordance with the terms established for division of the trust revenues and assets.
it is irrelevant that the contingent payments distributed to certificateholders are not profits,as in tcherepnin.that case happened to involve a arrangement,but the tia itself,in a,contemplates the existence of certificates of interest or participation in notes and loans,whose cash flows are not generally referred to as profits.see also hibernia bank fdic,cir describing certificates of participation in bank loans.what matters,and what makes the certificates here analogous to the ones that the supreme court considered in tcherepnin,is that payments to certificateholders are contingent on the proceeds generated by the underlying those instruments may be.
we also disagree with the district court conclusion that the master servicer entitlement to retain certain payments from the mortgage loans means that certificateholders interests are not contingent on the loans performance see bnym i,d at.we do not think investors must literally receive all of the cash flows generated by the underlying instruments in order for their investment to qualify as a certificate of interest or participation.
it is an arguably more difficult question whether the new york certificates remain certificates of interest or participation despite the fact that payments on the underlying loans are not simply passed through directly to certificateholders,but instead are to the various classes of certificates at the time and in the priorities and amounts prescribed by the psas.indeed,it is this property of rmbs the intricate allocation and layering of the underlying mortgage loans cash flows that permits different tranches or groups of certificates issued by the same trust to have different credit ratings and investment profiles.see,in re lehman.sec,cir.although authority cited by bnym suggests that courts at the time of the tia enactment recognized the possibility of creating certificate s of interest or participation in residential mortgage loans,these cases did not appear to involve the structural nuances that mark the new york certificates at issue in this case and,as far as we are aware,most modern rmbs.see,e,lawyers mortg.anderson,cir describing mortgage participation certificates that evidenced undivided shares in a pool of notes secured by mortgages on real estate.likewise,while bnym points to legisla
