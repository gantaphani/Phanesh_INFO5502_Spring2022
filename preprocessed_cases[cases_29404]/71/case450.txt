this appeal presents important issues relating to trading under b of the securities exchange act of exchange act,b because defendant peter stolz concededly does not own in his name ten percent or more of the stock in which he,as an insider,is alleged to have traded,our discussion necessarily focuses on whether defendant owns ten percent as a beneficial owner.the exchange act did not at the time of its enactment define the term beneficial owner.that obvious gap was filled in over many years by case law which,as it now turns out,incorrectly defined the term.although the statute and regulations in existence prior to the decisional law failed to give even a few faint hints as to the meaning of beneficial owner,the securities and exchange commission commission in its regulations defining the phrase nonetheless rejected existing case law.we construe those regulations on this appeal.
plaintiff richard morales appeals a judgment entered on october,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york conner,granting summary judgment to defendants stolz and quintel entertainment,quintel.morales claims stolz realized illegal profits on trades in shares of quintel common stock,in violation of b of the exchange act.he contends the district court erred in finding stolz exempt from b on the ground that,as a matter of law,he was not a beneficial owner of ten percent or more of quintel stock.because in our view a trier of fact could find that stolz concerted activities with two other quintel shareholders rendered him a beneficial owner of their quintel stock,thereby placing him above the threshold,we vacate the judgment appealed from,in part,and remand.
background 
although the events leading up to this lawsuit are generally not in dispute,they are somewhat complex.hence,as a guide to the reader,we set forth the principal corporations and individuals who figure in this litigation.four corporations are involved,one of which,quintel,is the issuer of the stock that is the subject of this litigation.quintel,a nominal in the appeal before us,is a delaware corporation.the other three corporations are psychic reader network psychic,new lauderdale,llc,and calling card,each of which at one time played a more minor role.psychic is a florida corporation providing psychic consultations to persons calling in by telephone.new lauderdale is a limited liability florida corporation formed by psychic and quintel,which develops and markets clubs and telephone entertainment services.calling card is a subsidiary owned by quintel.quintel,through calling card,and psychic each held percent of the stock of new lauderdale.psychic and quintel had joined forces to form new lauderdale in.
we turn now to the actors in the suit thomas lindsey and steven feder each owned in equal proportion a total of percent of the stock of psychic.feder was the chief executive officer ceo of psychic.stolz owned the remaining percent of the common stock of psychic.quintel ceo,jeffrey schwartz,proposed to feder in that quintel buy psychic interest in new lauderdale in exchange for quintel stock.feder agreed.
in september psychic and quintel executed a sales agreement sales agreement to sell psychic interest in new lauderdale to quintel in exchange for the issuance of new shares of quintel common stock to psychic shareholders.pursuant to the sales agreement,stolz received shares of quintel common stock in proportion to his percent interest in psychic,and feder and lindsey each received shares which combined were in proportion to their percent interest in psychic.while stolz owned less than percent of the outstanding quintel common stock,his stock holdings when added to those of feder and lindsey totaled over percent.
the sales agreement included several provisions restricting the ability of stolz,feder,and lindsey to dispose of their new quintel shares.aside from formally consenting to these specific provisions,stolz and lindsey are said to have played no role in negotiating the sales agreement,which was handled by schwartz for quintel and by feder for psychic,with the help of psychic counsel,donn beloff.according to feder,the provisions were included at quintel request because of its concern subsequent to its purchase of psychic interest in new lauderdale that rapid sales of large blocks of quintel stock could depress its price.pursuant to of the sales agreement,therefore,the former psychic shareholders were barred for two years from selling their quintel stock,except to pay taxes or if a principal of quintel sold shares.in addition,of the sales agreement limited the number of shares that could be sold in any period and treated the three psychic shareholders,within certain bounds,as affiliates within the meaning of commission rule a.
psychic and quintel also executed a number of ancillary agreements including a registration agreement,an escrow agreement governing the newly issued shares of quintel common stock,and a covenant not to compete.calling card and feder entered into an agreement by which feder would perform managerial services for calling card and be able to serve as a director of either calling card or quintel,if elected.in addition,psychic,quintel,and calling card executed a service agreement,pursuant to which psychic would provide live operator services to calling card.the service agreement further acknowledged that feder continuing control of psychic he later bought out lindsey interest in that corporation was an essential condition to quintel purchase of psychic interest in new lauderdale.
in december stolz,feder,and lindsey jointly executed and filed a schedule with the commission reporting their acquisition of quintel stock pursuant to the sales agreement.the schedule reflected,by a check in the appropriate box,that stolz was a member of a group under d of the exchange act.the schedule also indicated that a d group may be formed which may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the percent of quintel stock owned in the aggregate by the three joint filers.the schedule stated that the sole purpose of the acquisition of quintel stock was for investment,and the schedule explicitly disclaimed any beneficial ownership by stolz,feder,and lindsey of each other quintel stock,except for certain shares owned by feder and lindsey as joint tenants.four subsequent amendments to the schedule contained similar disclaimers.
further,between february and september,stolz filed one form and six form with the commission.each form stated that the relationship of the reporting person to the issuer was that of a member of a d group owning more than.the cover letter accompanying each form similarly stated that stolz was a member of a d group owning more than ten percent of quintel stock.according to stolz,the schedule and the forms and were prepared by his attorney,and he signed them without taking note of these particular statements.
between november and august,stolz made purchases and sales of quintel common stock.these transactions ranged anywhere from to shares,and averaged slightly less than shares per transaction,which equals percent of stolz personal holdings in quintel.the other two psychic shareholders,feder and lindsey,also sold small percentages of their quintel stock on the open market,but made no purchases.on december,stolz,feder,and lindsey transferred their respective quintel shares to a trust each trust had the same terms and the same trustee.in april or may,quintel offered to redeem the quintel stock it had issued to stolz,feder,and lindsey.they accepted,and the redemption of their remaining quintel stock took place on june.
on october,richard morales,a quintel shareholder,brought this shareholder derivative suit pursuant to b of the exchange act,b,to recover profits realized by stolz through his trades in shares of quintel common stock.following limited discovery,the district court denied morales motion for summary judgment,and granted stolz for the same relief on october.the trial court reasoned that since stolz individually owned less than percent of quintel stock and was not a beneficial owner of the stock held by feder and lindsey,he fell below the threshold required to trigger liability under b.see morales quintel entm t,d.morales appealed.the commission filed an amicus curiae brief.
discussion 
i standard of review 
on appeal from a grant of summary judgment we review the record de novo to determine whether genuine issues of material fact exist requiring a trial.bryant maffucci,cir.a grant of summary judgment will be affirmed only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.a dispute regarding a material fact is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby,d.
the same standard applies where,as here,the parties filed for summary judgment and the district court granted one motion,but denied the other.terwilliger terwilliger,cir.moreover,even when both parties move for summary judgment,asserting the absence of any genuine issues of material fact,a court need not enter judgment for either party.heublein,united states,cir.rather,each party motion must be examined on its own merits,and in each case all reasonable inferences must be drawn against the party whose motion is under consideration.schwabenbauer bd.of,cir.
ii section b 
with that standard in mind,we turn to the merits.section b of the exchange act requires that any profits derived from trading be disgorged to the issuer of stock.trading is defined as the purchase and sale or vice versa of a company stock within a period by persons deemed to be insiders,who are presumed to have access to confidential corporate information not generally available to other participants in the public market.gwozdzinsky fund,cir.an insider is defined in the statute as a beneficial owner of more than ten percent of any class of the company,registered equity securities,or a director or officer of the company issuing the stock.a,b.
the statute creates strict liability for insiders engaging in trading without regard to the trader intent and regardless also of whether the trading results in a profit or a loss.gwozdzinsky,at.the statute aims to deter insiders from taking unfair advantage of confidential company information to realize profits on trades in the company stock.magma power dow chem,cir.
in the present case it is undisputed that stolz sold and purchased quintel common stock within a period.and,it is also undisputed that he is neither an officer nor a director of quintel,and that he never personally owned more than ten percent of quintel common stock.thus,the only issue we must resolve is whether stolz was a beneficial owner of ten percent or more of quintel common stock by reason of his association with feder and lindsey.
the exchange act does not define the term beneficial owner as it is used in b.absent a statutory definition,a substantial body of case law developed over the years that filled in the deficiency,defining beneficial ownership by reference to whether the insider trading in company stock obtained a direct pecuniary benefit from the purchase and sale of the securities in question.see generally mayer chesapeake ins,cir reviewing cases.under this view,indirect pecuniary benefit,even when accompanied by voting control,generally was considered insufficient to cast an insider as a beneficial owner of the securities for purposes of b.id.at.in the commission promulgated rule,which substantially altered this body of case law by creating a analysis of beneficial ownership.see generally feder frost,cir citing ownership reports and trading by officers,directors and principal security holders,exchange act release,fed.reg.
first,solely for purposes of determining insider status as a holder,the regulations state that the term beneficial owner shall mean any person who is deemed a beneficial owner pursuant to section d of the exchange act and the rules thereunder.a.second,for purposes of determining what transactions must be reported under,the regulations specify that the term beneficial owner shall mean any person who,directly or indirectly,has or shares a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the equity securities so traded.id.a.
in the case at hand,stolz has conceded the question of pecuniary interest.morales,d at.as a result,our analysis is confined to beneficial ownership under d of the exchange act.although we have upheld rule a as an exercise of the commission rulemaking authority,the new reference to d represents a significant departure from prior decisional law because d focuses on control,not on pecuniary benefits.feder,at discussing change from prior law under mayer.because this new definition of beneficial ownership has not been fully tested in the circuit courts,it is appropriate for us to examine d in some detail.
iii section d 
in response to hostile corporate takeovers in the,congress in enacted d as part of the williams act.see act of july,pub,stat.its purpose was to alert the marketplace to every large,rapid aggregation or accumulation of securities,regardless of technique employed,which might represent a potential shift in corporate control.gaf milstein,cir accord sec savoy.by requiring the disclosure of information by a potential takeover bidder,the act strikes a careful balance among the interests of the bidder,the incumbent management in defending against such bid by explaining its position,and the shareholders so that they can evaluate the bidders intentions in deciding whether to throw in their lot with them.see rondeau mosinee paper,d hanson trust plc scm,cir.
specifically,d requires any person acquiring beneficial ownership of five percent or more of a corporation common stock to disclose within ten days of the acquisition certain information to the corporation,the commission,and the exchanges on which the stock is traded.d d mayer,at.that information includes the issuer and class of the securities acquired,the identity and background of the acquiring persons,the source and amount of funds used to make the purchases,the purpose of the acquisition,including any purpose to gain control of the issuer,the number of shares beneficially owned,and the nature of the relationship between any persons acquiring securities as a group.d a e d schedule.
section d group 
as this last item suggests,d encompasses not only the isolated shareholder who accumulates shares of a corporation common stock,but also a group of shareholders who undertake the same activity as part of a collective effort.in this vein,subsection d states that w hen two or more persons act as a group for the purpose of acquiring,holding,or disposing of securities of an issuer,such group shall be deemed a person for the purposes of this subsection.d.the legislative history confirms that the purpose of the provision was to prevent evasion of the disclosure requirement 
this provision would prevent a group of persons who seek to pool their voting or other interests in the securities of an issuer from evading the provisions of the statute because no one individual owns more than percent of a class of securities at the time they agreed to act in concert this provision is designed to obtain full disclosure of the identity of any person or group obtaining the benefits of ownership by reason of any contract,understanding,relationship,agreement or other arrangement.
wellman dickinson,cir quoting,at,at,reprinted in,emphasis removed alteration in original.
to implement d,the commission promulgated rule,which defines beneficial ownership by a group as follows 
when two or more persons agree to act together for the purpose of acquiring,holding,voting or disposing of equity securities of an issuer,the group formed thereby shall be deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership,for purposes of sections d and g of the exchange act,as of the date of such agreement,of all equity securities of that issuer beneficially owned by any such persons.
b id.defining beneficial ownership by individuals outside the group context.thus,the key inquiry in the present case is whether stolz,feder,and lindsey agree d to act together for the purpose of acquiring,holding,voting or disposing of quintel common stock.b see corenco schiavone sons,cir a bsent an agreement between them a group would not exist.only if the answer is in the affirmative may stolz be deemed a beneficial owner of more than ten percent of quintel common stock for purposes of b liability.
whether the requisite agreement exists is a question of fact.see savoy,at corenco,at bath,blot,cir.the agreement may be formal or informal and may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.wellman,at savoy,at.moreover,the alleged group members need not be committed to acquiring,holding,voting,or disposing of equity securities on certain specified terms,but rather they need only have combined to further a common objective regarding one of the activities.morales freund,cir wellman,at bath,at.in short,we must examine the record to determine whether sufficient evidence supports an inference that such an agreement or understanding exists.wellman,at savoy,at.
existence of an agreement 
in ruling on stolz summary judgment motion,the district court found the evidence insufficient to infer the existence of any such agreement among stolz,feder,and lindsey.the court reasoned in large part that there was no evidence the three psychic shareholders agreed to seek corporate control or to exert influence over quintel that the purpose of the sales agreement was not to acquire quintel common stock but instead to sell psychic holdings in new lauderdale and that the provisions were included in the sales agreement solely on the insistence of quintel for the protection of its own shareholders.morales,d at.with respect for the experienced district court judge,we nonetheless believe a rational trier of fact could conclude otherwise based upon the record evidence.
control purpose 
as an initial matter,the sec as amicus points out that t he district court extensive reliance on the absence of a control purpose has caused its opinion to be interpreted as holding that a section d group may exist only where the group seeks corporate control or to influence corporate control,and therefore urges us to clarify that a control purpose is not necessary to trigger section d.however,we read the district court comments on this point as observations about trends in the cases,rather than as a holding that a control purpose is essential.the district court discussed only cases involving some kind of control objective,but did not state that it had identified the universe of cases in which group formation could be found.
in any event,we agree with the sec that the agreement required by d need not be an agreement to gain corporate control or to influence corporate affairs.see mosinee paper rondeau,cir,rev on other grounds,d.the plain language of d demands only an agreement for the purpose of acquiring,holding,or disposing of securities,d,and rule is similarly satisfied by that sort of agreement,b.neither provision mandates that the narrow object of acquiring,holding,voting,or disposing of securities must itself serve a broader purpose of seeking corporate control or otherwise exerting influence over corporate affairs.
to the contrary,d c requires the disclosure of any purpose to acquire corporate control,d c,and d d empowers the commission to grant exemptions for acquisitions of securities not entered into for the purpose of,and not having the effect of,changing or influencing the control of the issuer,id.d d.if a purpose to acquire corporate control were a precondition to the existence of a d group,these other provisions would be largely superfluous.again,as noted above,the function of d is to alert the market to large acquisitions that threaten potential shift s in corporate control.gaf,at emphasis added.requiring an actual control purpose would disserve this function insofar as it would prevent shareholders from revaluing their holdings,and hinder incumbent management from adopting an appropriate strategy,in advance of an actual takeover attempt.mosinee paper,at.
the sales agreement 
we part ways from the district court in evaluating the existence of the sales agreement as a basis for inferring an agreed purpose to acquire securities.in this context,the district court observed that the purpose of the sales a greement was not to acquire control of quintel,but rather t he only common objective that stolz,feder and lindsey shared was to sell psychic holdings in new lauderdale llc.morales,d at.
but reasoning in this fashion is like insisting that the purpose of the agreement is six of one,rather than of the other.except for a gift,virtually any acquisition of securities involves the exchange of some consideration in return for the receipt of securities.hence,in the ordinary case,the existence of such an exchange supports the inference that the acquisition of the not simply the sale of the the intended purpose of the exchange.see a a person who becomes a beneficial owner of securities shall be deemed to have acquired such securities for purposes of section d of the act,whether such acquisition was through purchase or otherwise.emphasis added.
stolz argues that this is not an ordinary case.in particular,he points to his status as a minority shareholder in psychic and to his lack of any role in negotiating the sales agreement,as well as to his own sworn statement and one by feder that the psychic shareholders never agreed among themselves to acquire quintel common stock.but stolz status as a minority shareholder must be viewed in light of psychic status as a corporation,with only feder and lindsey as.similarly,stolz lack of any negotiating role must be viewed in light of the formal,signed agreement of all three psychic shareholders to the provisions.and a finder of fact may attach significance to the fact that,at the time of the closing of the agreement,feder executed an employment agreement providing that he may serve as a director of quintel,a role he later in fact performed.taking these facts in context,a reasonable trier of fact could discredit the two cited sworn statements and infer instead that stolz,feder,and lindsey were in communication with one another,were aware of the provisions of the sales agreement,and entered into the sales agreement with an agreed purpose to acquire quintel common stock.thus,this is not a case in which the assertion of existing shareholder rights or a mere business relationship is alleged as a basis for group membership.see portsmouth square,protective,cir shareholder litigation to void issuance of new stock transcon lines becker,investment consulting relationship.
as a consequence,we conclude that,looking at all the facts and circumstances in the light most favorable to morales as the nonmoving party on stolz,a rational trier of fact could find that stolz,feder,and lindsey agree d to act together for the purpose of acquiring quintel common stock.b see morales new valley,granting summary judgment to plaintiff where existence of written agreement evidenced agreed purposes to hold and to dispose of securities,aff sub nom.morales freund,cir.
the provisions 
stolz nonetheless contends he may not be held liable under b unless the alleged agreement to a common purpose continued to exist and thus continued to render him a beneficial owner at the time of his subsequent purchases and sales of quintel stock.although the sales agreement was executed in september,stolz first such purchase of quintel common stock took place on november,and his first sale was not executed until june.under stolz theory,liability would not attach unless an agreement to engage in concerted activity could be found to exist at least as late as june.
this theory of liability finds support in the plain language of b stating that t his subsection shall not be construed to cover any transaction where such beneficial owner was not such both at the time of the purchase and sale,or the sale and purchase,of the security involved b accord c a ten percent beneficial owner not otherwise subject to section of the act must report only those transactions conducted while the beneficial owner of more than ten percent of a class of equity securities of the issuer.see also,provident sec,d no b liability for purchase that took defendant above threshold,unless defendant already ten percent ow
