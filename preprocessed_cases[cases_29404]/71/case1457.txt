in this appeal,defendants argue that,pursuant to section of the uniform disposition of unclaimed property act ilcs west,the state is entitled to retain dividends issued on shares of stock which were presumed abandoned and delivered to the state.plaintiff argues the dividends are private property which must be returned to the property owner along with the shares of stock.the appellate court determined that the dividends were the private property of plaintiff,and remanded to the circuit court of cook county for a determination of just compensation.d.this appeal followed.
background 
plaintiff,james canel,was the owner of shares of stock of patrick industries.harris bank was the holder of the stock,as defined in the uniform disposition of unclaimed property act act ilcs et west,now ilcs et west.in december,harris bank delivered the stock to defendant mitchell murdock,the director of financial institutions,as property presumed abandoned under the act.see ilcs west defendant murdock is presently the director of the unclaimed property division of the office of the treasurer of the state of illinois.
plaintiff learned of the remittance of the stock to the department of financial institutions in january.thereafter,on april,plaintiff submitted a claim to defendant murdock for the return of the stock along with any dividends or other accruals that had been issued during the time the department of financial institutions held the stock.on august,plaintiff completed a form prescribed by the state treasurer,defendant judy baar topinka,for the return of his property.the treasurer returned the stock,but refused to return the dividends issued on the stock 
on september,plaintiff filed a class action on behalf of himself and others similarly situated.in the complaint,plaintiff described defendant topinka as being charged with supervising and administering the unclaimed property division of the office of the illinois treasurer.plaintiff alleged that defendant murdock is charged with administering the unclaimed property division,including disposition of all property that is remitted to the division and payment of all approved claims for return of such property.all counts of the complaint pertained to both defendants.
plaintiff alleged that numerous persons and entities own private property deemed abandoned and held by the treasurer as custodian.plaintiff further alleged that it is defendants policy and practice not to return dividends,interest and accruals earned on the property to the property owners upon application.instead,defendants retain the dividends,interest and accruals earned on the property for use by the state.in count i of the complaint,plaintiff maintained that by retaining the dividends,interest and other accruals earned on the property and using them for state purposes,defendants violate article i,section,of the constitution of.const,art.i,which prohibits the taking of private property without payment of just compensation.in count ii of the complaint,plaintiff maintained that defendants policy and practice of retaining the accruals earned on the property violate the prohibition of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution,made applicable to the states by the fourteenth amendment,that private property may not be taken for public use without just compensation.const.amends.v,xiv.plaintiff also claimed a violation of.
on november,defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west.in this combined motion to dismiss,defendants stated grounds for dismissal under both section ilcs west and section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west.as grounds for dismissal pursuant to section,defendants maintained that plaintiff failed to meet the necessary prerequisites for a class action that plaintiff failed to state a claim for violation of his constitutional rights and that plaintiff,having failed to exhaust the state administrative review process,could not show a violation of.in support of the claim that plaintiff failed to show a constitutional violation,defendants argued that,pursuant to section of the act,a property owner is not entitled to receive income or other increments accruing after the property is delivered to the state.ilcs west.as grounds for dismissal under section,defendants maintained that plaintiff failed to show the existence of a present case or controversy because the shares of stock had been returned to him and that plaintiff claims were barred pursuant to the doctrine of sovereign immunity.in reply,plaintiff argued,inter alia,that there was a justiciable controversy because defendants refused to return the earnings on the shares of stock.plaintiff also argued that two exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine applied first,a party need not exhaust his administrative remedies when he attacks the constitutionality of a statute on its face and second,a party need not exhaust his administrative remedies where it is patently futile to do so.
the circuit court found the motion to dismiss to be well founded and granted the motion.the court reasoned 
i think you needed to pursue administrative review,and you did.you were deprived of the remedy.and any residual claims that you address in your complaint appears to be claims that would have to be pursued in a court of claims.you have been deprived of the process in the face of things.

after defendants petition for appeal was allowed,we also took under advisement plaintiff motion for judicial notice of a pamphlet published by the treasurer,interpreting the act.we deny the motion because the material offered reiterates information already available to the court.we now turn to a discussion of the issues at bar.
as noted above,the circuit court granted defendants hybrid motion for dismissal on the section grounds that plaintiff had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.a motion under section of the code of civil procedure attacks the legal sufficiency of the complaint.illinois graphics nickum.such a motion does not raise affirmative factual defenses,but alleges only defects appearing on the face of the complaint.illinois graphics,at,kolegas heftel broadcasting.thus,the question presented by a section motion is whether the allegations of the complaint,when viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff,are sufficient to state a cause of action upon which relief can be granted.vernon schuster,bryson news america publications.in ruling on a section motion,a trial court is to consider only the allegations of the pleadings.illinois graphics,at,urbaitis commonwealth edison.further,the trial court should dismiss the cause of action only if it is clearly apparent that no set of facts can be proven which will entitle the plaintiff to recovery.bryson,at,illinois graphics,at.a court of review determines de novo whether the trial court should have granted dismissal.beahringer page.
the appellate court believed that plaintiff failure to exhaust his administrative remedies limited the court to confine its analysis solely to the question of whether section was facially unconstitutional in its entirety.we do not agree that the analysis must be limited in this fashion because,as we will explain,two other exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine are also present in this case.in order to facilitate an understanding of our holding with respect to the exhaustion issue,we believe it helpful to set out a brief overview of the procedures involved in both the reporting and the claiming of abandoned property under the act.
persons in possession of property belonging to another are required,pursuant to the act,to timely report and to remit to the director of financial institutions now to the treasurer property presumed abandoned.ilcs et west.generally,property is presumed abandoned if it is unclaimed by the owner for a period of five years.see ilcs west.the property holder responsibility to the owner for the return of the property terminates once the property is delivered to the state.ilcs west.
upon payment or delivery of the property to the director,the state assumes custody and is responsible for the safekeeping of the property ilcs west.within days of delivery of the property,for property valued at more than,the director is required to cause notice to be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county encompassing the last known address of the property owner.ilcs west.the notice advises the property owner that all claims regarding the property must be directed to the state.after a reasonable lapse of time,the director may sell the property at public sale to the highest bidder.ilcs west.if the probable cost of the sale exceeds the value of the property,the director may destroy or otherwise dispose of the property.ilcs west.the proceeds of the sale as well as other funds received under the act are transferred to the treasurer,who is then required to set aside in a separate trust fund an amount not exceeding million for payments of claims allowed by the director.the balance of the funds is deposited in the state pensions fund.
any person claiming an interest in property delivered to the state may file a claim to the property or to the proceeds from the sale of the property.ilcs west.the director shall consider the claim and may,in his discretion,hold a hearing,to be conducted by the director or a hearing officer,and receive evidence concerning the claim.the director issues a final written decision allowing or denying the claim.if the claim is allowed,and after deducting an amount not to exceed to cover the cost of notice publication and related clerical expenses,the treasurer is required to pay the claim promptly.ilcs west.
when the claim is allowed,the state returns the property or proceeds from the sale of the property.the state,however,does not return the income earned on the property during the time that the state serves as custodian of the property.section of the act provides 
when property is paid or delivered to the director under this act,the owner is not entitled to receive income or other increments accruing thereafter,except that income accruing on unliquidated stock and mutual funds after july,may be paid to the owner.ilcs west.
it is by virtue of section that the state in this case insists that plaintiff is not entitled to the dividends at issue.we note that the shares of stock were unliquidated and were returned to plaintiff.
in the case at bar,plaintiff submitted a claim to defendants for the return of the stock and dividends.plaintiff also completed a form prescribed by defendants for the return of his property,now recodified at.however,plaintiff did not specifically request a hearing by the treasurer see ilcs west or seek judicial review of the final administrative decision of the treasurer pursuant to the provisions of the administrative review law.see ilcs west.
the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies holds that a party aggrieved by an administrative decision can not seek judicial review without first pursuing all available administrative remedies.county of knox ex rel.masterson v.the highlands,castaneda illinois human rights comm n.the reasons for the exhaustion requirement are to allow the administrative agency to fully develop and consider the facts of the case before it,to allow the agency to utilize its expertise,and to allow the aggrieved party to obtain relief from the agency,thus making judicial review unnecessary.castaneda,at,citing illinois bell telephone allphin.
the exhaustion doctrine includes administrative review in the circuit court.arvia madigan.where the administrative review law ilcs et west is applicable and provides a remedy,a circuit court may not redress a party grievance through any other type of action.dubin personnel board.the circuit court power to resolve factual and legal issues arising from an agency decision must be exercised within its review of the agency decision and not in a separate proceeding.county of knox,at,dubin,at.
this court has,however,recognized several exceptions to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.castaneda,at.an aggrieved party may seek judicial review of an administrative decision without complying with the exhaustion of remedies doctrine where a statute,ordinance or rule is attacked as unconstitutional on its face.arvia,at.a party may also seek review where issues of fact are not presented and agency expertise is not involved.landfill,pollution control board.moreover,exhaustion is not required if the administrative remedy is inadequate or futile or in instances where the litigant will be subjected to irreparable injury due to lengthy administrative procedures that fail to provide interim relief.castaneda,at.
we note that,in this case,plaintiff specifically alleged that although section of the act allows the state discretion in returning the dividends of unliquidated stock to owners,it is the policy and practice of the treasurer office not to return to the property owner any income on securities held in custody pursuant to the act.plaintiff further alleged that in no case has such income ever been returned to the owner.in their motion to dismiss,defendants did not dispute plaintiff allegations on this point.indeed,one of defendants bases for dismissal was that plaintiff was not entitled to the dividends under the act.in light of the parties positions,this is not a case where facts need to have been developed before the agency nor does the question presented constitute a matter for agency expertise.rather,the issue revolves around the construction and meaning of section of the act.moreover,the pleadings reveal that it would have been futile for plaintiff,or any other similarly situated claimant for that matter,to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to asserting a claim for dividends on stock held by defendants pursuant to the act because the defendants position in these types of cases is that the act transforms into state property dividends earned on shares of stock presumed abandoned under the act.defendants argue that because of that fact they need not return dividends to the previous owner.section,however,clearly contains an exception that provides that claimants may in fact be entitled to dividends on unliquidated stock.given that defendants,as alleged by plaintiff,have never chosen to exercise their discretion in favor of a the permissive language of the hold that exhaustion,under these circumstances,was unnecessary and that our review of section is not limited solely to its facial validity.with this procedural matter settled,we now turn the merits.
plaintiff views defendants taking of his dividends as a constitutionally improper taking of private property.he notes that the act at issue gives to the state only custodial rights to the property that is presumed abandoned.defendants dispute this,maintaining that the act bestows to the state ownership rights to the future income that accrues on the abandoned property.accordingly,defendants claim that owners who abandon property no longer retain a property interest in the income accruing on the abandoned property once the property is transferred to the state and that,as a result,no taking occurs.plaintiff responds that the state does not take title to presumptively abandoned property and any earnings on the property,while in the state custody,belong to the owner of the property.because this case involves dividends accruing on unliquidated stock,we confine our analysis of section to only dividends earned on shares of unliquidated stock held by the state pursuant to the act.
as noted,the property presumed abandoned in this case consisted of shares of stock in a corporation.the shares of a corporation are the units into which the proprietary interests in a corporation are divided.ilcs west.the proprietary interests represented by the shares of stock consist of management or control rights,rights to earnings,and rights to assets.stroh blackhawk holding,fletcher cyclopedia of private corporations.
once a dividend is declared,it becomes a corporate debt owed to the shareholders in proportion to their shares in the corporation,and,if the corporation refuses to pay,the shareholders may sue to recover the unpaid dividend.fletcher cyclopedia of private corporations.a lawfully declared dividend is the separate property of the shareholders,wholly disconnected from their shares.ford ford manufacturing.stated simply,a dividend belongs to the owner of the shares.in this case that owner remained,at all times,the plaintiff,james canel.
defendants maintain that the state is entitled to retain dividends issued on shares of stock during the time the state holds the stock in its custody.in response,plaintiff argues that defendants appropriation of the dividends by the convenience of labeling the property abandoned and the forced turnover of the property from the bank to the state is inconsistent with the custodial nature and purpose of the act and constitutes an unconstitutional taking of private property 
in,our general assembly enacted,with some modifications,the uniform disposition of unclaimed property act,which had been promulgated by the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws see country mutual insurance knight,bishop,the new illinois unclaimed property act.the purpose of the act is to give custody of certain enumerated property to the state when the property owner does not appear to be aware of its existence and can not be located.bishop,the new illinois unclaimed property act.various courts and commentators have stressed the custodial nature of this type of act.see insurance of north america knight,d,recognizing theory of the legislation is that it is custodial in character and that the state takes custody for the owner commonwealth edison vega,cir noting that under the illinois act provisions,t he state does not acquire title to the property.it is merely a custodian prefatory note to the act,emphasizing that the state does not take title to unclaimed property,but takes custody only,and holds the property in perpetuity for the owner bishop,the new illinois unclaimed property act.noting that u nder the illinois act,the state does not gain title to unclaimed property,but merely perpetual custody.we agree with the seventh circuit description of the state role under the act 
n ot only does the state have free use of the property unless and until the owner reclaims it the state is not required to and illinois does not pay any interest to a reclaiming owner.citations.in effect,the property is an loan to the perpetuity if the owner never shows up to claim it.vega,at.

in this case,we have already explained why,under corporate law,dividends issued on plaintiff shares of corporate stock are the property of plaintiff.defendants contend that section works to divest plaintiff of his ownership rights to the dividends and transforms those ownership rights to the state.defendants maintain that,because the shares of stock were presumed abandoned under the uniform disposition of unclaimed property act,the state became entitled to the dividends by operation of the act as interpreted in light of the common law doctrines of escheat and bona vacantia and that,as a result,no taking occurred.we disagree with the state position for several reasons.
section,as originally enacted by our general assembly,did not include the exception pertaining to unliquidated stock that appears in the current version of the statute.this was consistent with the original uniform act upon which it was based.however,in,the uniform act was amended to allow owners to receive any dividends,interest,or other increments realized or accruing on the property at or before liquidation or conversion thereof into money.see also,comment noting that the model uniform act changed section of the act,which had provided that the owner was not entitled to receive any income or other increment accruing after the delivery of unclaimed property to the state.the current version of section of the act went into effect on august,see pub.act,eff.august,and now provides that owners may receive income accruing on unliquidated stock.except in very unusual circumstances affecting the public interest,the legislature use of the word may indicates that the statute is permissive as opposed to mandatory.in re marriage of freeman.we agree with defendants that the plain language of the statute indicates that the state may return dividends to owners in addition to the actual shares of the stock at issue.however,we do not agree with defendants view that the common law principles of escheat and bona vacantia transform the presumed abandoned property into state property such that a taking does not occur.
as we have endeavored to show,the act is custodial in nature.this custodial nature is simply incompatible with the doctrines of escheat and bona vacantia.the animating factor behind these doctrines is that the state,as sovereign,is entitled to property abandoned or otherwise ownerless.at common law,property is considered abandoned when the owner,intending to relinquish all rights to the property,leaves it free to be appropriated by any other person.hendle stevens,d.clearly,property that is presumptively abandoned under the act is not necessarily abandoned at common law.as explained in corpus juris secundum 
the uniform disposition of unclaimed property act and other similar unclaimed property acts are not true escheat statutes.the dual objectives of this type of statute are to reunite owner with unclaimed funds or property and to give the state,rather than the holder,the benefit of the use of the unclaimed funds or property.the custodial nature of the uniform disposition of unclaimed property act serves to establish that the rights of the state are merely derivative from the rights of the owners of the abandoned property.the presumption of abandonment under the uniform disposition of unclaimed property act is statutory and independent from common law principles of abandonment.emphasis added.escheat b,at.
and,in presley memphis,the court explained 
although uniform disposition of unclaimed property act cases are often cited under the heading escheat,delivery of uniform disposition of unclaimed property act property is not escheat.see,travelers express,state of minnesota.even though experience shows that abandoned property is seldom claimed,title to the property remains in the owner and never vests in the state.douglas aircraft cranston,cal d.the owner may recover at any time no matter how remote.south carolina tax commission york electric cooperative.presley,at.
based on the record,we conclude the stock at issue in this case was not abandoned at common law.
an examination of the doctrine of escheat supports this conclusion.at common law,escheat applied to the determination of real property to the state as sovereign.see escheat a,at defining escheat as a procedure with ancient origins whereby the sovereign may acquire title to abandoned property if after a number of years no rightful owner appears.escheat signifies a reversion of property to the state in consequence of a want of any individual competent to inherit,with the state being deemed to occupy the place and hold the rights of the feudal lord.the right of the state to take property by escheat is
