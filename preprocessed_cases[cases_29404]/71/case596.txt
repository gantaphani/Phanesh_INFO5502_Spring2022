norman ottmann,david chopko,and gary backous collectively,appellants appeal a district court order dismissing their securities fraud suit against hanger orthopedic group,hanger and two of its senior officers,ivan sabel and richard stein pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b and provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,see b,west.finding no reversible error,we affirm.
hanger provides services to patients who require orthotic and prosthetic devices,such as artificial limbs.on july,hanger acquired novacare orthotics prosthetics novacare,another provider of orthotic and prosthetic devices.through this acquisition,hanger acquired patient care facilities operated by novacare,and it hired former novacare personnel,including certified practitioners qualified to fit orthotic and prosthetic devices.the novacare acquisition more than doubled the size of hanger united states operations,bringing hanger total number of patient care facilities to,with a total of certified practitioners in states and the district of columbia.
on november,hanger issued a press release reporting financial results for the third quarter of,which had ended on september.this was the first quarter in which hanger financial results included the results of the new novacare division.the november press release reported third quarter revenue of million and net income of million,or per share.
also on november,sabel,stein,and another hanger officer held a conference call with securities analysts and investors the november call.during this call,the officers reiterated the financial results set forth in the press release and discussed in detail the integration of novacare into hanger.while the officers made mostly positive comments regarding the integration,they explained that revenue had been reduced by the departure of some former novacare practitioners in connection with the acquisition.
on january,appellees announced in another press release that they expected revenue and earnings for the fourth quarter of and the year to fall substantially below analysts expectations,with estimated fourth quarter revenue of million and a in earnings per share.the next morning,sabel and stein participated in another conference call with analysts and investors to discuss these results the january call.during this call,stein explained that hanger disappointing results were attributable to three factors additional losses of former novacare practitioners,a decision to conform the revenue recognition practices of the novacare division to hanger practices,and a reduction in referral business from rehabilitation clinics due to the novacare acquisition.that same day the first trading day after hanger negative financial news was released,the price of hanger common stock dropped from the previous day closing price of per share to as low as decline of closing at.
appellants subsequently brought this proposed class action on behalf of investors who purchased hanger stock between november,and january.appellants claimed that appellees made a series of oral and written misrepresentations and omissions of fact in violation of section b of the securities exchange act of,see b west supp,and rule,see appellants later amended their complaint.
appellees moved to dismiss,arguing that appellants had failed to plead with particularity any false or misleading statements by appellees,the materiality of such statements,or scienter.the district court agreed and dismissed the amended complaint.the court expressed serious doubts as to whether appellants would be able to meet the threshold requirements for pleading with particularity in a securities class action suit,but nevertheless granted appellants an opportunity to amend their complaint.further,the district court gave appellants specific guidance regarding how to redraft their complaint.
appellants subsequently filed a second amended complaint,and appellees again moved to dismiss based on essentially the same grounds asserted in their earlier motion.emphasizing that it had previously given appellants an opportunity to plead their claims with greater particularity,the district court determined that appellants new complaint contained the same defects as the earlier one.thus,based on its conclusion that appellants had not met the threshold requirements for pleading with particularity in a securities class action suit,id.at,the district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice.
to state a claim under section b and rule,a plaintiff must allege that the defendant made a false statement or omission of material fact with scienter upon which the plaintiff justifiably relied that proximately caused the plaintiff damages.phillips lci int l,cir internal quotation marks omitted.at issue here is whether appellants adequately pleaded the first two elements.we review the dismissal of a complaint pursuant to rule b de novo.see baird ex rel.baird rose,cir.
standards for material misrepresentation or omission 
to allege a false statement or omission of material fact,a plaintiff must point to a factual statement or is,one that is demonstrable as being true or false.longman food lion,cir.additionally,the plaintiff must allege that the statement is false or that the omitted fact renders a public statement misleading.see id.and,any statement or omission of fact must be material,there must be a substantial likelihood that a reasonable purchaser or seller of a security would consider the fact important in deciding whether to buy or sell the security or would have viewed the total mix of information made available to be significantly altered by disclosure of the fact.id.at.under the pslra,the complaint must specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.b.
standards for scienter 
substantive standard 
in a securities fraud action,the term scienter refers to a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.ernst ernst hochfelder,d see malone microdyne,cir.mere negligence will not suffice.see phillips,at.additionally,every circuit that has considered the issue has held that scienter may also be established by a showing of recklessness see hudson phillips petroleum in re phillips petroleum sec.litig,cir van dyke coburn,cir mcdonald alan bush brokerage,cir hackbart holmes,cir broad rockwell int l,cir.en banc mansbach prescott,ball turben,cir sundstrand sun chem,cir rolf blyth,eastman dillon,cir concluding that scienter may be established by recklessness in appropriate circumstances.however,neither this circuit nor the supreme court has addressed this particular question.see ernst ernst,at.phillips,at noting that scienter may perhaps be shown by recklessness emphasis added.
in phillips,we defined recklessness as an act so highly unreasonable and such an extreme departure from the standard of ordinary care as to present a danger of misleading the plaintiff to the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.phillips,at internal quotation marks omitted see,nathenson zonagen,cir articulating same definition of recklessness city of philadelphia fleming,cir same in re advanta.sec,cir same.such severe recklessness is,in essence,a slightly lesser species of intentional misconduct.nathenson,at internal quotation marks omitted.this definition of recklessness comports with the observation of the supreme court that t he words manipulative or deceptive used in conjunction with device or contrivance strongly suggest that b was intended to proscribe knowing or intentional misconduct.ernst ernst,at.we therefore agree with our sister circuits that a securities fraud plaintiff may allege scienter by pleading not only intentional misconduct,but also recklessness.
pleading standard 
with this substantive standard in mind,we turn to the requirements for pleading scienter in securities fraud cases.the pslra requires that the complaint shall,with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter,state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b.congress enacted this more stringent pleading standard to curtail the filing of meritless lawsuits and to create a uniform pleading standard among the circuits.conf,at,reprinted in.
the pslra thus seek s to heighten the standard for pleading scienter,and so changes what a plaintiff must plead in his complaint in order to survive a motion to dismiss.phillips,at internal quotation marks alteration omitted see id.noting that the pslra indisputably seeks to make pleading scienter more difficult for plaintiffs.other circuits have reached differing conclusions regarding the proper interpretation of the requirements for pleading scienter under the pslra.however,we have not yet determined which pleading standard best effectuates congress intent.id.at.
prior to the enactment of the pslra,the second circuit required securities fraud plaintiffs to allege facts that give rise to a strong inference of scienter.shields citytrust bancorp,cir.a strong inference could be demonstrated either a by alleging facts to show that defendants had both motive and opportunity to commit fraud,or b by alleging facts that constitute strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.id.
in enacting the pslra,congress adopted the strong inference language used by the second circuit,which it regarded as the most stringent pleading standard in the country.see,at,reprinted in.however,it is not clear whether congress also intended to adopt the second circuit rule permitting plaintiffs to show a strong inference by alleging facts demonstrating motive and opportunity.following enactment of the pslra,the second circuit reaffirmed its standard.see press chem.inv.servs,cir stating that the pslra heightened the requirement for pleading scienter to the level used by the second circuit.and,the third circuit has held that the pleading standard of the pslra is essentially that of the second circuit.see advanta,at.the ninth circuit,however,has concluded that congress rejected the second circuit motive and opportunity standard and therefore that facts showing motive and opportunity can not alone establish a strong inference of scienter.see janas mccracken in re silicon graphics.sec.litig,cir.similarly,the eleventh circuit has held that the pslra did not codify the motive and opportunity standard,and thus,allegations of motive and opportunity,without more,are insufficient to plead scienter.see bryant avado brands,cir.
however,a number of other circuits have concluded that,in enacting the pslra,congress chose neither to adopt nor reject particular methods of pleading as alleging facts showing motive and instead only required plaintiffs to plead facts that together establish a strong inference of scienter.see.state bd.of admin.green tree fin,cir nathenson,at fleming,at helwig vencor,cir en banc greebel ftp software,cir.in addition to noting the absence of any language in the pslra addressing particular methods of pleading,some of these courts have observed that the legislative history regarding whether congress intended to adopt or reject the motive and opportunity standard is conflicting and inconclusive.see green tree fin,at nathenson,at greebel,at.these courts have therefore adopted a approach that examines the particular allegations in their entirety to determine whether they provide the requisite strong inference,without regard to whether those allegations fall into defined,formalistic categories such as motive and opportunity.fleming,at.still,these circuits generally agree that specific facts showing a motive and opportunity to commit fraud or the absence of such facts may be relevant in determining whether a plaintiff complaint demonstrates a strong inference of scienter.see,helwig,at greebel,at.
we agree that a flexible,analysis is appropriate in examining scienter pleadings.both the absence of any statutory language addressing particular methods of pleading and the inconclusive legislative history regarding the adoption of second circuit pleading standards indicate that congress ultimately chose not to specify particular types of facts that would or would not show a strong inference of scienter.see helwig,at in enacting the pslra,congress was concerned with the quantum,not type,of proof.greebel,at the history and text of the pslra show no agreement to restrict the types of evidence which may be used to show a strong inference of scienter.we therefore conclude that courts should not restrict their scienter inquiry by focusing on specific categories of facts,such as those relating to motive and opportunity,but instead should examine all of the allegations in each case to determine whether they collectively establish a strong inference of scienter.and,while particular facts demonstrating a motive and opportunity to commit fraud or lack of such facts may be relevant to the scienter inquiry,the weight accorded to those facts should depend on the circumstances of each case.
application to present facts 
having set forth the applicable legal standards,we now examine the allegations in appellants complaint to determine whether appellants have pleaded the disputed elements of their claims with sufficient particularity.appellants allege that appellees misrepresented the number of novacare practitioners that departed after the novacare acquisition and the reason for their departures,failed to promptly disclose novacare different revenue recognition method,and failed to promptly disclose the reduction in referral business due to the acquisition.appellants also make a series of allegations that purportedly demonstrate appellees motives to misrepresent or conceal these facts.we consider each of these allegations in turn.
practitioner departures 
number of departures 
appellants claim that during the november call,appellees misrepresented the number of novacare practitioners that had left the company after the acquisition closed on july.during that call,stein made the following statement regarding practitioner departures 
as a result of the acquisition and studying the historical numbers of novacare and along with the merging of these offices,we have realized that there were some practitioners that left novacare before the transaction took folks.and there were about folks that left the organization.some were terminated because they were producing.and there were a few that resigned.so as a resulting total of practitioners leaving the organization,there was a loss of business totaling about million.
stein also stated that as a result of eliminating some of these branches that were not profitable businesses and the loss of some of these in some cases we terminated the margins are running better than expected,but our top line is a little bit less than what we initially forecasted.id.at.further,in response to an analyst question regarding the departures,sabel stated 
i think we very confident that there are certainly no indications of any kind of major defection.keep in mind that out of the number of practitioner s that we lost the current number that we currently employ are practitioners.and that a pretty formidable number of practitioners.and,in fact,pre and post we lost about practitioners out of that group.so it certainly not any kind of a trend that we see.
appellants contend that the actual net number of practitioners that departed after the july closing but before the november call was at least and possibly,not this allegation is based on comments by stein during the january call 
i want to explain to you or share with you the trend that has taken place over the last six months since we owned novacare.the net resignations in the company on a practitioner basis was seven in july.in august it was one.in september it was seven.in october it dropped to three.and in november it dropped to one,and then in december it dropped to it went back up to seven.
and so you can see as of the end of november this was trending down.we thought this phenomenon was over.it bounced back in december,and we realized that we were starting to see this problem occur again.
when you translate the loss of these practitioners into revenues,we experienced a shortfall here in the fourth quarter of million in revenue,or cents per share,and on an annualized basis,just for the loss of the practitioners,it was million or cents per share for year.
id.at.later in the call,sabel explained that what we had is a small number of practitioners that have defected and have inflicted serious damage.i not trying to diminish the damage that they inflicted,but we have almost practitioners still within this system.id.at.
appellants further claim that appellees misrepresentations regarding the number of practitioner departures were material,based on a statement by stein during the january call that a practitioner referral business could be a half a million dollars and that a good portion of that just drops through to earnings.id.at.appellants also point to sabel statement during the january call that the practitioner departures had inflicted serious damage.id.at.
appellees statements during the november call regarding the number of practitioner departures were factual statements that were demonstrably true or false,and appellants have adequately alleged that they were false.appellees claim that these statements were not material because although appellees may have misstated the number of practitioners that had departed,they disclosed the financial effect of those departures by explaining that the departures had caused a loss of business totaling about million.id.at.appellants acknowledge that this million figure accurately represented the revenue that had been lost during the third quarter of as a result of the pre and post acquisition practitioner departures appellants contend,however,that this figure did not include much of the lost revenue attributable to the eight or nine departures that appellants failed to disclose because the financial impact of those departures would be primarily felt in later quarters.
we believe there is at least a factual issue regarding whether appellees disclosure of the million in third quarter revenue losses due to practitioner departures adequately remedied the misstatement of the number of departures.viewing the alleged facts in the light most favorable to appellants,a reasonable investor could have been misled by the misstatement of the number of departures,despite the disclosure of the million in third quarter lost revenue.although most of the undisclosed departures apparently took place during the third quarter,many of those departures could have occurred during the latter part of that quarter and thus would have had a relatively modest effect on third quarter revenue and a correspondingly greater effect on fourth quarter revenue.thus,despite knowing that the departures had collectively caused million in revenue losses during the third quarter,a reasonable investor could have underestimated the continuing future effects of the departures,based on the false understanding that there had only been departures,as opposed to or.we therefore conclude that appellants have sufficiently pleaded that appellees misstatements concerning the number of practitioner departures were material.
regarding scienter,appellants claim that appellees statements during the january call demonstrate that they viewed the retention of practitioners as the most important factor in revenue growth,they had been monitoring the departure numbers on a monthly basis,and they had recognized prior to the november call that the departures reflected a negative trend.these allegations do provide some indication that appellees misstated the number of practitioner departures at least recklessly.on balance,however,other factors show that the requisite strong inference of scienter is lacking.
first,although appellees clearly understated the number of departures during the november call,their statements indicate that they were attempting to give a rough approximation of the number of departures,rather than a precise number.see id.stating that approximately practitioners left before the acquisition id.indicating that about practitioners left after the acquisition id.at stating that pre and post acquisition we lost about practitioners.second,although the lost revenue attributable to each departure was substantial,the absolute number of the undisclosed net departures or was small in comparison to the overall number of practitioners employed by hanger given that hanger was in the midst of a complex nationwide integration of novacare,there is a distinct possibility that,at the time of the november call,appellees had simply undercounted the number of practitioners across the country who had departed.third,while the disclosure of the million in third quarter revenue losses due to the departures may not have been adequate to correct the misstatement of the number of departures,it nonetheless militates against a finding that appellees acted with a culpable state of mind.fourth,appellants do not allege a effort by appellees to conceal the number of practitioner departures to the contrary,only two months after the alleged misstatements,appellees clearly disclosed the correct number of departures.fifth,appellants do not allege that appellees had any personal motives to misrepresent the number of departures for a total of two months,such as to facilitate personal sales of hanger stock see phillips,at.finally,although appellees characterization of the practitioner departures was more positive during the november call,see id.at stating that it certainly not any kind of a trend that we see,appellees plausibly explained during the january call that,around the time of the november call,they believed the departures were abating.
given these circumstances,appellees misstatement of the number of departures is more consistent with negligence than with recklessness or intent.we therefore conclude that appellants allegations regarding the number of practitioner departures do not establish the strong inference of scienter required by the pslra.
reason for departures 
appellants also claim that during the november call,appellees misrepresented the reason for the practitioner departures by stating that s ome of the former practitioners were terminated because they were producing,a nd there were a few that resigned.id.at see id.at stating that in some cases we terminated the practitioners.by contrast,during the january call,appellees described the departures as net resignations,id.at,never specifically stating that any practitioners had been terminated.appellants further allege that the reason for the practitioners departures was material because the firing of unprofitable practitioners would be viewed by investors as a positive financial move for the company,while practitioner resignations would be viewed as a negative development.
we question whether appellants have adequately pleaded that appellees november statements regarding practitioner terminations were false.to begin with,appellees discussion of practitioner departures during the january call was limited to departures,while the discussion during the november call also included departures.although appellees statements during the november call are not clear on this point,it is possible that at least some of the terminations appellees referred to during that call took place before the acquisition.further,even assuming that all of the terminations appellees mentioned during the november call purportedly occurred after the acquisition,it seems unlikely that appellees would completely fabricate this fact during the november call and then retreat from it during the january call.an equally likely explanation is that during the january call,appellees were describing the loss of practitioners generally as net resignations and did not specifically repeat that some of the former practitioners had been terminated.and,to the extent appellants claim that stein statement during the november call that a few practitioners had resigned was false,the word few in this context is subjective,particularly given appellees other indefinite statements that some of the practitioners were terminated.nonetheless,
