this is an appeal from a final judgment of the court of chancery,dismissing the amended complaint of the,aspen advisors llc,heartland capital,and heartland capital.purchase pension plan and trust.the plaintiffs are holders of warrants to purchase common stock of united artists theatre company for per share warrants.the amended complaint asserts three counts for breaches of the express and implied terms of the warrants against the defendant,united artists theatre company united artists,and for tortious interference with the warrants against philip anschutz and various entities he controlled.the other defendants in this action are philip anschutz and several entities controlled directly or indirectly by him.
for identification purposes,the court of chancery divided anschutz entities into two basic groups.the first group,the ua holders,comprises those companies that were the original entities through which anschutz held his interests in united artists.the second group,the other theatre companies,consists of those entities through which anschutz held his interests in regal cinemas,and certain other theatre companies.we have adhered to those designations in this opinion.
in the amended complaint,the plaintiffs attempted to plead claims relating to the merger in which the minority stockholders of united artists were cashed out,pursuant to ann.tit,the merger.first,plaintiffs allege that united artists violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the warrants by failing to allow them to participate in a separate exchange agreement that predated the merger,an agreement to which united artists was not a party.second,plaintiffs allege that united artists breached the express terms of an provision in section c of the warrants by providing them with only the same merger consideration received by the minority stockholders of united artists in the merger,but failing to provide them with an independent right to seek a determination of the fair value of their warrants.third,plaintiffs allege that the artists defendants tortiously interfered with plaintiffs contractual rights under the warrants.
we have decided that the court of chancery properly dismissed plaintiffs first claim that united artists breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by failing to allow plaintiffs to sell their warrants under an exchange agreement to which united artists was not even a party.the court of chancery correctly concluded that the warrants held by the plaintiffs gave them no explicit or interstitial right to participate in these exchanges.the court of chancery also properly dismissed plaintiffs second claim that united artists breached the clause in section c of the warrants by providing them with only the same merger consideration paid to the minority stockholders of united artists in the merger,without also providing them an independent right to seek a determination of the fair value of their warrants.
the court of chancery dismissed plaintiffs third claim that alleged tortious interference with section c of the warrant agreement.it did so based on its prior determination that the plaintiffs second claim had failed to state a cause of action for breach of the warrants,a necessary element of a claim for tortious interference with a contract under delaware law.in view of our holding affirming the court of chancery conclusion that the plaintiffs second claim is without merit,the dismissal of the plaintiffs third claim must also be affirmed.
ua holders investment in united artists 
in,united artists became unable to service its debt.the next year,its senior creditors under a million loan facility declared a default and blocked united artists from making payments to holders of the company subordinated notes.negotiations then ensued between united artists and the senior creditors.in that process,the ua holders acquired nearly million worth of the claims under the loan facility.that process also resulted in an agreement between united artists and the senior creditors on a restructuring of united artists.
following that development,the ua holders took the lead in negotiating with the subordinated noteholders and other subordinated creditors.these negotiations were not successful,and the subordinated noteholders filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition on behalf of united artists.the bankruptcy filing inspired further negotiations which resulted in an agreement to allocate to the subordinated creditors of the fully diluted equity of united artists in the form of warrants exercisable into united artists common stock.the warrants had a term and a strike price of per share,and were covered by an clause that is the focal point of the present litigation.
under the overall restructuring plan as implemented,united artists capital structure consisted of the following classes of securities 
common stock shares of common stock 
preferred stock shares of preferred stock convertible into common shares at a conversion price of per share 
warrants warrants to acquire common stock at a strike price of per share 
stock options options to be distributed according to the management stock option plan.
of this allocation,the ua holders received of the common stock million shares,of the preferred shares million shares,and of the warrants million warrants.the remainder of the common stock went to other former senior lenders of united artists.
the remainder of the warrants went to former subordinated lenders including noteholders of united artists,a class that included the plaintiffs in this action.according to the plaintiffs,they and other subordinated creditors took comfort in the fact that the warrants they received were identical to those received by the ua holders,thereby guaranteeing that the plaintiffs warrants would receive the same protection as anschutz had secured for himself.
warrantholders key protections 
before exercising their warrants,the plaintiffs and other warrantholders,as a matter of law,did not possess nor could they exercise any rights as stockholders of united artists.although the warrants had a term,the equity element of the warrants could lapse before the expiration of that term in certain circumstances,such as the occurrence of a merger.in such circumstances,the warrantholders were protected by a standard provision,which states in pertinent part 
in case of any reclassification or change of the outstanding securities of the company or of any reorganization of the company or any other corporation the stock or securities of which are at the time receivable upon the exercise of this warrant or any similar corporate reorganization on or after the date hereof,then and in each such case,the registered holder of this warrant,upon the exercise hereof at any time after the consummation of such reclassification,change,reorganization,merger or conveyance,shall be entitled to receive,in lieu of the shares or other securities and property receivable upon the exercise hereof prior to such consummation,the shares or other securities or property to which such holder would have been entitled upon such consummation if such holder had exercised this warrant immediately prior thereto 
in connection with the restructuring,the in the restructured united artists were required to enter into a stockholders agreement,to which the warrantholders would become bound in the event they exercised the warrants under that stockholders agreement,the stockholders had the right and the obligation to participate in any change of control transaction.the term change of control was defined as 
any transaction whether by merger,consolidation,sale of assets or otherwise,or series of related transactions within a six month period,pursuant to which the particular entity that was then the controlling stockholder of united artists and its affiliates as a group cease to beneficially own at least of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the company having the right to vote in the aggregate.
the term affiliate was broadly defined in the stockholders agreement and encompassed any of the ua holders,or any other entity controlled,directly or indirectly,by the ua holders or anschutz himself.
anschutz theatre holdings consolidated 
in and,anschutz acquired controlling positions in three other companies in the same general business as united artists regal cinemas,edward theatres,and new generation network.each of these companies was financially troubled and anschutz gained his stake as part of their restructurings.anschutz later exchanged his controlling stake in new generation network for of the equity of regal cinemedia.the court of chancery defined these entities,which anschutz used to hold the equity positions he acquired in these transactions as the other theatre companies.
by,anschutz decided to consolidate the other theatre companies with his holdings in united artists and have them held by a single holding company,regal entertainment group,which would become a public company with other investors.to accomplish this consolidation,regal entertainment,the ua holders,the other theatre companies,and certain others entered into an exchange agreement.united artists was not a party to the exchange agreement.
under the exchange agreement,united artists equity and warrants held by the ua holders and a key officer of united artists craig slater,as well as the united artists management options held by certain holders,were exchanged for equity,warrants and options in regal entertainment at the rate of regal entertainment shares,warrants,or options for each united artists share,warrant,or option.the exchange agreement also provided for the exchange of additional united artists equity or warrants if the ua holders or slater acquired any such equity or warrants before the initial public offering ipo of regal entertainment stock.
in april and may,regal entertainment had acquired all of the united artists equity held by the ua holders and slater,thereby gaining an equity position that had been enhanced by purchases of additional equity made by the ua holders.these purchases left regal entertainment owning slightly over of united artists common stock,because the ua holders by that time had acquired control of million shares of united artists common stock and had already owned and converted into common stock all of the preferred stock of united artists.in addition,regal entertainment had acquired all of the ua holders million warrants.
the exchange agreement also contemplated that regal entertainment would exchange equity in itself for equity of the other theatre companies,so that regal entertainment would own a controlling block in not only united artists,but also regal cinemas,regal cinemedia,and edwards theatres.these exchanges were also consummated by may.
by exchanging all of his movie theatre holdings with regal entertainment in return for equity in that new entity,anschutz was able to retain a majority interest in regal entertainment.therefore,as the plaintiffs state in their complaint,by virtue of his control of regal entertainment,anschutz continued at all relevant times to control united artists.
the regal entertainment ipo proceeded contemporaneously with the transactions contemplated by the exchange agreement.in may,million regal entertainment shares were sold at per share in the ipo.the amended complaint quotes the ipo prospectus as telling prospective investors that,among other things 
our nationwide theatre circuit,comprising regal cinemas corporation,united artists theatre company and edwards theatres,operates screens in theaters in states.
we believe that significant opportunities exist for us to generate economies of scale from the integration of regal cinemas,united artists and edwards theatres.we expect to enhance our operating results through the application of best practices from across our combined company.
a portion of the net proceeds of this offering will be used to repay million of outstanding senior indebtedness of united artists 
regal cinemas,united artists and edwards theatres operated as separate motion picture exhibitors until we acquired them 
w e are recording the combination of regal cinemas,united artists and edwards theatres in accordance with the purchase method of accounting 
we have combined three independent motion picture exhibitors and regal cinemedia into a new company 
the court of chancery summarized the ipo prospectus as indicating that regal entertainment would operate the formerly separate movie theatre businesses of united artists,regal cinemas,regal cinemedia,and edwards theatres as an integrated business under common management and with a shared strategic focus.
merger under section 
in august,regal entertainment,through a wholly owned subsidiary,used its ownership of over of united artists shares to effect a merger under ann.tit,the aforementioned merger.in the merger,each outstanding publicly owned share of united artists stock was converted into the right to receive in cash.common stockholders were also afforded notice of their opportunity to seek appraisal under ann.tit.
within days of the merger,the plaintiffs and other warrantholders were informed that the merger had occurred and the plaintiffs were advised by letter that 
accordingly,pursuant to section c of each warrant,each warrant held by you immediately prior to the effective time is no longer exercisable into shares,but is now only exercisable into the difference between the merger consideration and the purchase price set forth in such warrant multiplied by the number of shares represented by such warrant.at such time as you elect to exercise your warrant s,please follow the instructions for exercise set forth in section of your warrant certificate s.
procedural background 
the plaintiffs filed their original complaint in this action against united artists,regal,aig,tac,uams,and certain present or former directors of united artists,including anschutz.the original complaint attempted to plead a claim for damages arising from the merger on the grounds that united artists purportedly breached section c of the warrants united artists purportedly breached an implied covenant of good faith that inhered in the warrants and certain defendants breached fiduciary duties purportedly owed to the warrantholders.thereafter,the defendants moved to dismiss the original complaint,pursuant to court of chancery rule b.
in response to the defendants motion to dismiss,the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint as well as an answering brief in opposition to the defendants motion to dismiss.the amended complaint named as defendants united artists,regal,aig,tac,aif,uams,and anschutz.the other present or former united artists directors were dropped from the action.like the original complaint,the amended complaint attempted to plead claims for damages in connection with the merger on the grounds that united artists purportedly breached section c of the warrants and an implied covenant of good faith that inhered in the warrants.the amended complaint also alleged that the defendants,excluding united artists,had tortiously interfered with plaintiffs contractual rights under the warrants.the plaintiffs,however,abandoned their fiduciary duty claims.
plaintiffs amended complaint 
the plaintiffs asserted two basic claims in the amended complaint.the first is that united artists violated the covenant of good faith and fair dealing that inhered in the warrants as contracts by engaging in a merger structured effectively to reclassify identical interests in united artists equity according to whether the interests were owned by favored insiders and to arrogate the true value of united artists to selected owners of the identical equity interests.the plaintiffs contend that the exchange offer in which the ua holders exchanged their equity interests in united artists including their warrants for equity interests in regal entertainment,was a de facto merger in which all warrantholders should have had the opportunity to participate.in essence,the plaintiffs,as warrantholders,contend that they should have had the same opportunity as the ua holders to exchange their warrants for regal entertainment warrants.
the plaintiffs first claim is not predicated on any explicit term of the warrants,but rather,as noted by the court of chancery,on the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.in a separate count,the plaintiffs allege that the remaining defendants,anschutz and certain other companies he controls tortiously interfered with the warrants by excluding the plaintiffs from participating in the exchange agreement on equal terms with the ua holders.
the plaintiffs second claim is a variation of the first.the plaintiffs argue that the warrantholders should have received consideration in the merger equivalent to fair value under section.the plaintiffs submit that this right flows from section c of the warrant agreement.the plaintiffs contend it is obvious that section c was breached,because the per share that united artists offered the warrantholders in the merger is worth substantially less than what the ua holders received from regal entertainment for their warrants under the exchange agreement.this second contract claim is pled directly against united artists,and the remaining defendants are accused of having tortiously induced the breach of section c.
implied covenant not breached 
in this court,as in the court of chancery,the plaintiffs argue that united artists violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the warrant contract by failing to permit the plaintiffs to sell their warrants under the exchange agreement.the plaintiffs acknowledge that this court has held that implying obligations based on the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is a cautious enterprise,and those cases should be rare nevertheless,in this appeal,the plaintiffs continue to argue that the defendants violated the implied covenant in the warrants.
the plaintiffs contend that the discriminatory combination of the exchange agreement and the merger frustrated p laintiffs reasonable expectations under the warrants while preserving the expectations of anschutz with respect to identical warrants.the theory of the plaintiffs first claim on appeal is that the court of chancery erred in viewing the exchange agreement and the subsequent merger as two separate and distinct transactions.as a result of that error,the plaintiffs submit that the court of chancery did not give due consideration to their claim that the purportedly discriminatory scheme violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
the court of chancery concluded that there was neither a factual nor a legal basis to support the plaintiffs thesis that the exchange agreement was the front end of the merger.the court of chancery determined that the exchange agreement was not an essential step towards consummation of a merger involving united artists.that determination is supported by record evidence that the exchange agreement was consummated more than five months before the merger.
as the court of chancery noted,plaintiffs admit that anschutz indirectly controlled united artists before and after the exchange agreement.the court of chancery recognized that the exchange agreement was the vehicle by which the ultimate owner of a majority of the equity of united artists and the other theatre place his control blocks in those companies in a single holding company that he intended to take public imminently.however,as the court of chancery astutely observed,t here is no reason to believe that anschutz could not have come into control of over of united artists equity through a vehicle other than regal entertainment in the absence of the exchange agreement.
the court of chancery correctly held that b y their plain terms,the warrants gave the plaintiffs no right to participate in the exchange agreement.the court of chancery also properly concluded that the exchange agreement did not trigger any of the warrantholders rights under the specific language of the clause in c 
the transactions effected under that agreement did not reclassify or change the outstanding securities of united artists,events that would have triggered c of the warrants.nor was the exchange agreement a reorganization within the meaning of c.as a result of the exchange agreement itself and the transactions it contemplated,there was no change in the capital structure of united artists that resulted in the substitution of other securities or property for the common stock of the company.put otherwise,there was,no shares or other securities or which warrantholders would have become entitled if they had exercised their warrants and become common stockholders of united artists immediately before the consummation of the exchange agreement.all that happened was that the ua holders holdings in united artists including their warrants were exchanged to regal entity that anschutz also controlled 
the exchange agreement permitted regal entertainment to announce that it had consolidated control of united artists and the other theatre companies,and to begin using that common control to achieve operating efficiencies.as the court of chancery noted,however,that agreement left the plaintiffs in the same position as they were in before as warrantholders in a company that was ultimately controlled by anschutz who possessed the right to convert each of their warrants into united artists common stock at per share for the remainder of the contract term subject only to the possibility of a merger or other transaction covered by c.that determination is supported by the record and is the product of a logical deductive process 
the court of chancery concluded that b ecause the stockholders agreement and the warrants both contain provisions designed to protect the warrantholders in the event of certain as an actual merger or certain changes of do not contain provisions that were implicated by the exchange agreement,plaintiffs implied covenant claims lacks merit.the court of chancery reasoned as follows 
the implied covenant is only breached when the defendant has engaged in arbitrary or unreasonable conduct which has the effect of preventing the other party to the contract from receiving the fruits of the contract.when,as is the case here,the relevant contracts expressly grant the plaintiffs certain rights in the event of particular transactions such as mergers and,if they had exercised their warrants,certain changes in control,the court can not read the contracts as also including an implied covenant to grant the plaintiff additional unspecified rights in the event that other transactions are undertaken.to do so would be to grant the plaintiffs,by judicial fiat,contractual provisions that they failed to secure for themselves at the bargaining table.by specific words,the parties to the stockholders agreement and the warrants identified particular transactions that would provide the warrantholders with the right to receive the same consideration paid to common stockholders,in mergers involving united artists and the right if they had exercised their warrants to tag along,in certain change of control transactions.similarly,the parties also by omission defined the freedom of action other parties to those contracts had to engage in transactions without triggering rights of that nature 
the court of chancery recognized that the plaintiffs claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing can only be sustained by narrowing the contractual freedom left to the other parties to the stockholders agreement and the warrants.the court of chancery concluded that the exchange agreement was not the front end of the merger the exchange agreement did not trigger section c of the warrants and the exchange agreement did not implicate any implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing to the warrantholders.therefore,we hold that the court of chancery properly granted the motion to dismiss count i of the amended complaint.
warrants clause 
in count ii of the amended complaint,the plaintiffs assert that the clause in section c of the warrants affords them the right to receive fair value in connection with the merger.the resolution of this claim turns on the meaning of section c in the warrants,which provides 
in case of any reclassification or change of the outstanding securities of the company or any reorganization of the company or any similar corporate reorganization on or after the date
