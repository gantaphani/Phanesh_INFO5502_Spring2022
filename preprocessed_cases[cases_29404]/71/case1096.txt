introduction 
pursuant to,we have jurisdiction over appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states.this appeal presents the question of whether a district court order determining the rights and liabilities of some,but not all,claimants with claims to receivership assets is a final decision under we conclude that,unless the district court certifies the order and directs entry of judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,such an order is not a final decision.thus,we lack jurisdiction over the appeal of one set of,benson and brix,llc benson and brix,but we have jurisdiction over the appeal of the other set,the american funeral and cemetery trust services,mudd,and the mudd revocable trust.we address the merits of the second set of claimants appeal in a memorandum disposition issued with this opinion.
ii.background 
these consolidated appeals arise from a civil suit against an investment advisor,capital consultants,llc ccl,by the sec the sec litigation.the appellants were all clients of ccl and are thus claimants in the sec litigation.to understand their appeal,one must not only understand the appellants position in the sec litigation,but also in another suit.
the appellants are part of a group known as the american funeral plaintiffs.along with other clients of ccl,the american funeral plaintiffs sued ccl and third parties directly the direct action when ccl fraud became known.when settlement talks with the third party defendants in the direct action stalled due to differences of opinion between the american funeral plaintiffs and the other plaintiffs,a settlement agreement among the plaintiffs was reached.the american funeral plaintiffs agreed to exchange their rights to certain claims against the third party defendants in the direct therefore their ability to block exchange for million,plus interest.because ccl was,at the time of the settlement in the direct action,under receivership in the sec litigation,the district court in the sec litigation had to approve the settlement agreement among the plaintiffs in the direct action.it did so.thus,the american funeral plaintiffs ended their involvement in the direct action.
meanwhile,the sec litigation continued.eventually,the court adopted a second amended distribution plan.it interpreted that plan to allow claimants,including the appellants,to receive a set distribution or to trace their investments if they wished.however,in an order dated august,the court held that american funeral plaintiffs had to remit any funds they had received pursuant to the settlement agreement among the plaintiffs in the direct action,if they elected to trace their investments.both sets of appellants elected to trace,and now challenge this remittance requirement,arguing that it is neither true to the terms of the distribution plan nor to the terms of the settlement agreement.
the receiver did not object to the tracing claims of the american funeral and cemetery trust services,mudd,and the mudd revocable trust.thus,the august,order provided the method by which the receiver ultimately determined the sums this first set of claimants would receive.the claimants sought rule b certification of,and entry of judgment on,the district court august,order as it applied to them.the district court granted their request.accordingly,they appeal from a judgment the district court certified as final.
the receiver did object to the tracing claims of benson and brix.however,in an order dated february,the district court approved their claims.thus,the august,order provided the method by which the receiver ultimately determined the sums benson and brix would receive,but the court february,order allowed the award of those sums over the receiver objection.without seeking rule b certification,benson and brix appealed the district court february,order.
in the appellants initial briefing,they argued that this court has jurisdiction over benson and brix appeal because the district court february order was a final order or judgment pursuant to.they argued for a liberal interpretation of finality,drawing analogies to bankruptcy.at oral argument,they supplemented their briefing with two citations to cases that held similar orders appealable under the collateral order doctrine.they argued for jurisdiction over the american funeral and cemetery trust services,mudd,and the mudd revocable trust appeal pursuant to rule b and.
iii.discussion 
generally,a final decision under ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.however,in certain circumstances,a decision that does not end the litigation may be considered final under the statute.the collateral order doctrine defines one such circumstance rule b,another.
no one contends that either the august order or the february order ends the litigation.accordingly,neither order is a final decision in the usual sense.to determine if we nonetheless have jurisdiction under,then,we must determine whether the collateral order doctrine or rule b applies to those orders 
a.the collateral order doctrine 
the collateral order doctrine was designed to allow appeal from a narrow class of decisions that do not terminate the litigation,but must,in the interest of achieving a healthy legal system,nonetheless be treated as final.requirements of the doctrine are often described as.orders that do not dispose of the entire litigation are appealable as collateral orders if they conclusively determine the disputed question,resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and are effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.the supreme court has emphasized that these requirements are to be applied strictly and that only a narrow class of decisions satisfy them 
strict application of the requirements is particularly important because,when a court identifies an order as an appealable,collateral one,it determines the appealability of all such orders if courts did not apply the requirements strictly,then,the doctrine would no longer govern a narrow class of decisions,but a broad class.thus,we are not to consider the chance that the litigation at hand might be speeded,or a particular injustic e averted,by a prompt appellate court decision when we determine whether a particular order is an appealable,collateral one.we must take a broader view and determine if resolution of the kind of claim in question must always be immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.
we conclude that orders such as the district court february and august orders involve the merits of the litigation.thus,they are not collateral to the merits and are not appealable under the collateral order doctrine to be truly collateral to the merits of the litigation,a claim or right must not be an ingredient of the cause of action and must therefore not require consideration with that cause of action the disposition of the issue should not affect,or be affected by,decision of the merits.to determine if the claims in question are collateral to the merits of the litigation,we must determine what the merits are and what the claims are.then,we must determine if resolution of the claims affects the merits.
defining the merits of the litigation is not particularly difficult.the litigation in question is a receivership proceeding instituted by the sec,an agency charged with protecting the national public interest and the interest of investors.in accord with its charge,the sec sought to place ccl into receivership after determining that it and its principals,the defendants,had violated securities laws and harmed their clients.a review of the stipulated court order reveals that the receivership had several purposes and the receiver,several different duties.in addition to investigating and pursuing claims arising from legal violations,the receiver was to locate,take control of,and preserve the company assets.the receiver was then charged with disbursing those assets in accordance with the court orders.because rightful claims to assets exceed the assets available,the court,with the help of the receiver,must determine how to distribute the
