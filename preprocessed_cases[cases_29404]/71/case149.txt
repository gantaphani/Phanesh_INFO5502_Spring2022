background 
we relate here only those facts pertinent to the disposition of the issues before us.certain documents and facts are considered more fully in the discussion section,infra.
a the lehman bankruptcy 
on september,lehman brothers holdings lbhi and together with lbi,lehman filed for bankruptcy.the sipa liquidation of lbi,lbhi north american subsidiary,followed.
both government regulators and lehman alike desired,and achieved,an emergency sale of lbi to barclays capital barclays pursuant to section of the bankruptcy code,the sale or asset sale.the sale was the largest,most expedited and probably the most dramatic asset sale that has ever occurred in bankruptcy history in re lehman.holding.the sale of lehman businesses as a going concern saved thousands of jobs and avoided losses estimated to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars.
the sale was also understood as a tremendous risk for barclays.however,as the bankruptcy court later stated,the overall transaction with barclays provided the means for the most favorable disposition of these assets with the least amount of risk.id.at.it was the best,and perhaps the only,alternative to a huge economic loss.
on september,the day after the bankruptcy filing,lehman and barclays executed an asset purchase agreement apa,that defined the assets that would be purchased by barclays and those that would be excluded from that purchase.the assets that were to be purchased under the apa included,among other things,retained cash,all deposits and prepaid charges and expenses,and exchange traded derivatives.the assets that were to be excluded from the purchase were set forth in section of the apa,and encompassed all cash,cash equivalents,bank deposits or similar cash items of lbi,as well as all assets primarily related to derivative contracts.
although unknown to the bankruptcy court at the time,barclays board of directors was prepared to approve the deal only if it was capital accretive,included a buffer of assets in excess of liabilities in the amount of million.the parties agreed to achieve such a buffer by means of a repurchase agreement.on september,the day before the bankruptcy court was to hold the sale hearing to consider the asset sale,barclays provided lbi with billion in cash so that lbi could repay a loan it had received from the new york federal reserve.in exchange,lbi was expected to provide barclays with collateral previously pledged to the new york federal reserve.however,the collateral lbi transferred was worth far less than billion.
in addition,lbi notified barclays on the morning of september,the day of the sale hearing,that it could no longer deliver billions of dollars in assets that had been promised in the apa.as a result,barclays demanded that lbi identify assets that lbi could still transfer,in order for barclays to decide whether to close the deal.the bankruptcy court dubbed what ensued thereafter as the asset scramble,in which lbi sought to identify assets that could be transferred to barclays in order to close the deal.at.this scramble produced the two groups of assets that are the subject of the current appeal the margin assets and the cbas 
at the sale hearing later that day,the parties represented that a deal had been reached in principle but that there were still several moving parts.the sale involved,inter alia,the transfer of financial assets,liabilities,and customer accounts.it was presented in the form of the apa.because lbi was unable to deliver assets previously promised to barclays in the apa,however,amendments and clarifications to the apa were required.
a relevant change discussed at the sale hearing related to the treatment of cash.the apa had initially provided that barclays would acquire billion in retained cash,and excluded cash in excess of that amount.that amount was later reduced to million and was completely eliminated from the sale by the date of the sale hearing.it was made clear at the sale hearing that no cash from lehman would be transferred to barclays.
counsel for barclays represented at the sale hearing that all material changes had been disclosed.the bankruptcy court admonished that any change to the deal in excess of million would be material.given the urgency caused by the economic crisis and the lack of time for ordinary negotiation and drafting,lehman,the bankruptcy court,the trustee,barclays,the securities investor protection corporation sipc,and the government all supported the sale despite the lack of complete documentation regarding the assets to be transferred.the parties told the court that a clarification letter would be forthcoming,memorializing any necessary changes.
after the sale hearing,the bankruptcy court entered an order the sale order,approving the transaction as presented at the sale hearing.the sale order approved the asset purchase agreement,as modified,clarified,amended by the first amendment,and a letter agreement,dated as of september,clarifying and supplementing the apa.at.given the many moving parts,the complexity of the acquisition,and the extreme time pressure,the bankruptcy court knew that the sale order needed to be flexible enough to accommodate changes to the apa.this concept was reflected in the sale order,which contemplated final documentation materially consistent with its terms.at.in that vein,the sale order authorized and directed the parties to take all other and further actions as may be reasonably necessary to implement the transactions contemplated by the purchase agreement.
over the weekend,the parties crafted the clarification letter cl,which was intended to record changes to the apa consistent with representations made at the sale hearing.the cl revised portions of the definitions of purchased and excluded assets.on monday morning,september,the letter was filed with the bankruptcy court,giving broad notice of its terms.at.the letter was also served on all interested parties who had appeared in the case.the parties,however,did not seek court approval of the cl,representing that it did not alter the apa but only documented changes discussed at the sale hearing.the deal formally closed later that morning.id.at.
for nearly a year,both barclays and the trustee relied on the cl,referencing its validity while jointly,and successfully,defending an appeal of the sale order.then,however,the parties returned to the bankruptcy court barclays moved for delivery of certain assets it claimed at the same time,the trustee,lbhi,and the official committee of unsecured creditors brought adversary proceedings and motions pursuant to.b,seeking relief from the sale order specifically regarding the transfer of the margin assets to barclays.at.these motions led to a day trial in the bankruptcy court.
b bankruptcy and district court opinions 
on february,the bankruptcy court issued its decision,followed by a final judgment in july,which i awarded the margin assets to the trustee with prejudgment interest ii awarded the cbas to barclays and iii found barclays claim to the rule assets contingent upon the trustee having sufficient customer property to satisfy all allowed customer claims filed in the sipa liquidation.
each party appealed to the district court barclays with respect to the margin assets and the rule assets,and the trustee with respect to the cbas.on july,the district court i reversed the bankruptcy court and awarded barclays the margin assets ii affirmed that barclays was entitled to the cbas and iii affirmed that barclays did not have an unconditional right to the rule assets.an appeal and followed,but,as noted above,the relating to the rule assets has been settled.we thus consider the trustee appeal as to the margin assets and cbas.

a the margin assets 
the margin assets consist of approximately billion that had been maintained by lbi in accounts at various financial institutions as collateral in connection with its derivative etd business.the assets in dispute were lbi property and pledged by lbi to support its own and customer trading.the etd business included all of lbi etd positions,such as options and futures.to protect against default,clearinghouses and carrying brokers through which etds are settled require account owners to pledge margin collateral to secure etd obligations.the positions consisted of rights with potential value but also potential losses when they included an obligation to buy or sell assets at a price in the future.it is undisputed that barclays purchased lbi etd business.the dispute is over whether the margin assets supporting the etd business,in the form of cash or cash equivalents,were transferred along with the etd business by operation of the various documents at issue.
relevant contractual provisions 
several contractual provisions are relevant to the margin assets.as noted,the apa defines purchased and excluded assets.the etd business is listed as a purchased asset under the apa.the apa provides further that barclays would acquire all of the assets that were used in connection with the business excluding the excluded assets.additionally,the apa contains a seller warranty stating that all of the necessary assets and services used by seller and its affiliates to operate the business as it is currently operated would be transferred.
section of the apa provided nothing herein contained shall be deemed to sell,transfer,assign or convey the excluded assets to purchaser,and seller directly and indirectly shall retain all right,title and interest to,in and under the excluded assets.excluded assets,as defined in the apa,included all cash,cash equivalents,bank deposits,or similar cash items of lbi and its subsidiaries the retained cash other than billion in cash,cash equivalents,bank deposits,or similar cash items.further,exclusion n excluded the transfer of assets primarily related to the investment management business and derivatives contracts.the term derivatives contracts was not specially defined in the apa nor was the term derivatives.
section a of the cl clarified the definition of purchased assets as all of the assets of seller used primarily in the business or necessary for the operation of the business in each case,excluding the excluded assets.the cl also provided more detail regarding specific assets that were included as purchased assets,including derivatives and any property that may be held to secure obligations under such derivatives 
section c of the cl revised the apa definition of excluded assets.it eliminated subsection b,pertaining to the exclusion of retained cash other than billion in cash,cash equivalents,bank deposits or similar cash items.that section further provided except as otherwise specified in the definition of purchased assets,excluded assets shall include any cash,cash equivalents,bank deposits or similar cash items of seller and its subsidiaries.in addition to eliminating exclusion b,the section carried over exclusion n,which pertained to all assets primarily related to derivatives contracts.
bankruptcy and district court decisions 
the bankruptcy court found that the apa exclusion of all assets primarily related to derivatives contracts and its general exclusion of cash exempted the margin assets from transfer.judge peck also based his ruling,in part,on his own recollection of the sale hearing.
regarding the cl and provisions pertaining to the margin assets,the bankruptcy court first determined that it would treat the cl as enforceable because the parties had relied on it for nearly a year,but that the cl would be valid only to the extent that its provisions are not inconsistent with the record of the sale hearing and the language of the sale order.the bankruptcy court also found ambiguity in the cl parenthetical that transferred any property that may be held to secure obligations under such derivatives in the etd business.after a review of extrinsic evidence,it found that such property did not include the margin assets.
the district court disagreed,based on the various agreements language.central to its holding was the conclusion that the bankruptcy court unequivocally approved the cl in its decision described supra,and that none of the parties appealed that approval.thus,the language of the cl controlled,and the no cash representations at the sale hearing along with judge peck own understanding of the representations made at that hearing,and his construal of the cl in accordance with that understanding were deemed inadmissible extrinsic evidence by the district court.the district court concluded that,despite exclusion n,the cl parenthetical unambiguously transferred the margin assets to barclays.
resolution 
we begin by noting the urgency under which this deal was executed,as discussed supra.ambiguities and loose ends were inevitable.indeed,the bankruptcy court admitted the existence of certain aspects of the sale,potentially significant aspects,of which it was not aware.nor could it have been under the circumstances.
while noting these circumstances,we conclude that transfer of the margin assets to barclays was contemplated in the apa and confirmed in the cl the inclusion of the margin assets in the cl is,therefore,not a material change to the apa and we deem the dispute over whether the bankruptcy court approved the cl to be irrelevant 
in the apa,derivatives are clearly included in the definition of purchased assets.further,the cl,amending and clarifying the sale as contemplated in the sale order,specifically defined purchased assets to include derivatives and any property that may be held to secure obligations under such derivatives.the unambiguous meaning of those terms conveys the margin assets to barclays.
the trustee claims that exclusions in the apa pertaining to cash and derivatives contracts exclusions b and n,respectively bar the transfer.we disagree.
first,exclusion b,pertaining to cash,explicitly does not apply to those assets that are deemed purchased,and the margin assets fall under that term plain meaning in the agreements.we are also not troubled by the
