these consolidated appeals arise out of a civil enforcement action brought by the securities and exchange commission sec against numerous defendants allegedly involved in a scheme to sell unregistered securities of cmkm diamonds,cmkm.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the sec,ruling that global stock transfer,llc global,helen bagley,and brian dvorak collectively,defendants participated in an unregistered distribution of securities in violation of section of the securities act of securities act.the district court ordered defendants to disgorge proceeds from the illegal sales,plus prejudgment interest.prior to the district court ruling on summary judgment,dvorak brought a motion to stay the civil proceedings until the conclusion of his criminal proceedings involving the same conduct,which a magistrate judge denied.
global and bagley appeal the district court entry of summary judgment and the disgorgement order dvorak appeals the magistrate judge order denying his motion to stay and the district court disgorgement order.we conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against global and bagley because a material issue of fact remains regarding whether global and bagley were necessary participants and substantial factors in the distribution of cmkm stock sufficient to impose liability under section.we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court as to global and bagley and remand for further proceedings.we affirm the magistrate judge denial of dvorak motion to stay the proceedings and the district court disgorgement order as to dvorak.
background 
a.the scheme 
cmkm is a publicly held nevada corporation.during the relevant time period,cmkm common stock was not registered with the sec under the securities act,et.cmkm stock was registered,however,under section g of the securities exchange act of exchange act,l g,and was traded on the pink sheets,now known as otc pink,an electronic quotation and trading marketplace for both registered and unregistered securities.
between january and march,at least eleven individuals and three entities allegedly participated in a scheme to issue billions of shares of unrestricted cmkm stock and then sell the stock to the public without filing a registration statement.cmkm,holding itself out as a gold and diamond mining company,increased its number of shares to billion.urban casavant and john edwards,respectively cmkm ceo and director of matters,then began issuing and selling shares of unrestricted stock.cmkm in fact had no legitimate operations.the company issued false press releases,operated a promotional racing team that traveled around the country,and provided investors with fake maps and videos of mineral operations in north and south america.the proceeds of the stock sales were used primarily to finance the personal lifestyles of casavant and edwards.as a result of the scheme,approximately investors lost at least million.
in an attempt to appear to comply with securities regulations,edwards received false opinion letters supporting the issuance of unrestricted cmkm stock from defendant dvorak.based upon these letters,cmkm transfer agent,defendant global and its owner bagley,issued unrestricted shares of cmkm stock.using these certificates,edwards sold billion shares of stock through daryl anderson,kathleen tomasso,and anthony tomasso.anderson was edwards registered representative at nevwest securities corporation nevwest and sold over billion shares.edwards also issued billion shares of stock to companies owned by the tomassos,which in turn sold the shares to the public.
dvorak role 
dvorak acted as cmkm attorney during the course of the scheme.casavant told dvorak that numerous investors had already paid for shares of stock in cmkm when the company was in its initial stages,but stock certificates had never been issued to those investors.casavant also told dvorak that new certificates needed to be issued to certain investors whose shares were the subject of an earlier for one stock split.casavant then began issuing those certificates.after receiving the newly issued cmkm stock certificates,dvorak would write an opinion letter stating that the stocks referred to in the certificates should be issued without a restrictive legend 
dvorak opinion letters indicated that the stocks issued by cmkm met the safe harbor of rule k,and therefore were exempt from registration under the securities act.see a k dvorak letters concluded that the stocks satisfied the holding period of rule k because,perhaps implausibly,the investors had paid for the stock or performed services for cmkm more than two years prior to issuance of the stock certificates or because a for one stock split had occurred more than two years earlier.therefore dvorak letters concluded that the shares should be issued without a restrictive legend.
during the course of the scheme,dvorak drafted opinion letters regarding at least billion shares of stock,issued to individuals,that cmkm claimed could have been issued more than two years earlier.dvorak received from other participants in the scheme,including approximately per opinion letter.
global and bagley role 
defendant global is a nevada corporation owned and operated by bagley.in october,global registered with the sec as a transfer pursuant to c and in began serving as cmkm transfer agent.during the course of the scheme,cmkm approved several increases in its number of authorized shares,until the number of authorized shares approached billion.global and bagley were notified of these authorizations,and between and global issued up to billion shares of unrestricted cmkm stock based on attorney opinion letters.
during most of and the first half of,bagley relied upon opinion letters written by dvorak.bagley testified that,relying on dvorak letters she understood that the stock was to be issued without a restrictive legend because payment for the stock had been made,or the stock split had occurred,at least two years earlier.bagley also testified that she may have wondered whether all of the shares claimed by cmkm should actually have been issued two years earlier,that it seemed strange to her that cmkm had so many shares,and that nothing cmkm did as a company made sense to her.bagley further testified that global is only the transfer agency.that all we do.if we get proper paperwork,we do what needs to be done.
in june,bagley requested that dvorak opinions be confirmed by edwards angell llp angell,another law firm representing cmkm,because she was not comfortable with dvorak letters in their opinion letters,the angell attorneys stated that we have relied upon opinions of dvorak associates,for each of the shareholders to the effect that the shares as to which the shares are being issued as dividends were issued more than two years ago and that the issuance of the shares as dividends has been duly authorized.the angell opinion letter also stated that w e have examined such certificates,certified copies of organizational and governance documents,certificates of good standing,certifications of factual matters,company resolutions and other records,pertinent documents and instruments,and have investigated such other matters of law and fact,as we have deemed necessary for the purpose of rendering the opinions set forth herein.finally,the angell opinion letter concluded that the shares may be issued to the shareholders and that the certificates evidencing the shares need bear no restrictive legend.an angell attorney testified that he felt it was reasonable to rely upon the opinions expressed by dvorak in writing angell opinion letters.the attorney testified that he believed dvorak opinion letters to be valid,and had no reason to believe the issuance of shares in reliance on the dvorak opinion letters was wrongful.
procedural history 
on april,the sec filed a complaint against dvorak,global,bagley,and eleven other defendants in the united states district court for the district of nevada.the complaint alleged violations of section of the securities act,a,which creates liability for the distribution of unregistered securities.
on march,an indictment was issued in the united states district court for the district of nevada based on the same set of facts that gave rise to the civil proceedings.the indictment named dvorak,as well as five other defendants who are not parties to this appeal.
on december,the sec filed a motion for summary judgment against dvorak,global,and bagley.global and bagley,but not dvorak,opposed the sec motion.on july,the district court granted summary judgment against all three defendants,holding that there was no genuine issue of material fact that each defendant was both a necessary participant and a substantial factor in the unregistered distribution of cmkm stock,and was therefore liable for violating section of the securities act.as to global and bagley,the district court concluded that they had played more than a de minimis role in the scheme,and that but for their participation in removing the restrictive legends on the cmkm stock certificates there would not have been a sale of unregistered securities.the district court rejected global and bagley contention that summary judgment was inappropriate because a material issue of fact remained regarding whether they knew or had reason to know that the distribution of stock was illegal,concluding that section is a strict liability statute.
the district court entered final judgment on august.the court permanently enjoined defendants from violating section and ordered disgorgement of profits gained as a result of violations of the securities act plus prejudgment interest.specifically,the court ordered dvorak to disgorge and bagley and global,jointly and severally,to disgorge 
on january,while the sec motion for summary judgment was pending,dvorak filed a motion to stay the civil proceedings until the criminal proceedings concluded,arguing that a stay was necessary to protect his fifth amendment rights.in the alternative,dvorak requested that the court grant him additional time to respond to the sec motion for summary judgment.specifically,dvorak referenced the sec evidence related to the criminal proceedings,stating that w ith boxes of discovery waiting to be scanned and delivered to defense counsel in the criminal case,there may be more dvorak will be able to present to defeat summary judgment.
united states magistrate judge robert johnston denied dvorak motion for a stay on april,rejecting dvorak argument that a stay was required by the fifth amendment.the magistrate judge also stated that dvorak had not sought any particular discovery and had not referred in his moving papers to federal rule of civil procedure d,suggesting that dvorak ability to respond to the sec motion for summary judgment would not be altered if the court did not stay the case.
global and bagley appeal the district court grant of summary judgment and disgorgement order.dvorak appeals the denial of his motion to stay the proceedings as well as the district court disgorgement order.
ii.discussion 
liability under section 
global and bagley argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether global and bagley actions as a transfer agent satisfied the standard for liability under section of the securities act.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,sec platforms wireless int l,cir,and view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party to determine whether there are genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law,oak harbor freight lines,sears roebuck,cir.
sections a and c of the securities act,a,c,make it unlawful to offer or sell a security in interstate commerce if a registration statement has not been filed as to that security,unless the transaction qualifies for an exemption from registration.platforms wireless,at.section a broadly prohibits sales of securities irrespective of the character of the person making them.sec chinese consol.benevolent ass n,cir.to establish a prima facie case for violation of section,the sec must show that no registration statement was in effect as to the securities the defendant directly or indirectly sold or offered to sell securities and the sale or offer was made through interstate commerce.see sec phan,cir see also sec calvo,cir per curiam.once the sec introduces evidence that a defendant has violated the registration provisions,the defendant then has the burden of proof in showing entitlement to an exemption.sec murphy,cir citing sec ralston purina.global and bagley challenge only the first element of the sec prima facie case,arguing that they did not sell or offer to sell securities within the meaning of section.
although section provides that it is unlawful for any person to sell or offer to sell an unregistered security,a,c,liability under section is not limited to the person or entity who ultimately passes title to the security.see murphy,at.instead,courts have established the concept of participant liability to bring within the confines of persons other than sellers who are responsible for the distribution of unregistered securities.id.with respect to section,a defendant role in the transaction must be a significant one before liability will attach.id.at.defendants play a significant role when they are both a necessary participant and substantial factor in the sales transaction.phan,at quoting murphy,at.we have previously stressed that the substantial factor test requires more than a finding of but for causation,explaining 
prior to the issuance of a security,numerous persons perform mechanical acts without which there could be no sale.for example,a printer may prepare key documents or a bank may advance cash to a customer upon the customer presentation of an instrument and then pass the instrument to another person.both would satisfy a but for causation test,but these acts nonetheless do not render the defendants sellers.before a person acts can be considered the proximate cause of a sale,his acts must also be a substantial factor in bringing about the transaction.
murphy,at citations omitted see also sec seaboard,cir.the proximate cause analysis required by murphy usually involves a question of fact for the jury.anderson aurotek,cir per curiam,overruled in part on other grounds by pinter dahl,d 
global and bagley first argue that the district court erred when it determined that section is a strict liability statute and failed to consider whether global and bagley knew or should have known that their conduct violated the securities act.global and bagley argue that,as transfer agents,they occupy a unique role in a securities transaction in which they perform largely ministerial tasks in reliance upon attorney opinion letters.therefore,global and bagley argue,they can be liable under section only if they acted unreasonably in issuing the cmkm shares without a restrictive legend.
we have previously suggested that scienter is not an element of section liability.see phan,at.this is in accord with the majority of circuit courts that have considered the question.see calvo,at sec holschuh,cir swenson engelstad,cir.but see kane sec,cir holding that section liability extends to those persons who are uniquely positioned to ask relevant questions,acquire material information,or disclose their findings.we conclude that a transfer agent role in a securities distribution is not inherently unique and therefore does not justify subjecting transfer agents to a different standard for section liability than any other participant in the distribution of unregistered securities.transfer agents are not,for example,the only potential participants in a securities distribution that may rely on the opinions of attorneys.nor are transfer agents the only participants in a securities distribution that may play a ministerial or de minimis role.a transfer agent,like any other participant in a securities scheme,does not play precisely the same role in every transaction.therefore,we decline to create an exception to strict liability for transfer agents,and we reaffirm that scienter is not an element of section liability as explained more fully below,the necessary participant and su
