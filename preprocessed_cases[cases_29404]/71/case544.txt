opinion of the court 
the appellants in this case are a number of conservative,investors who purchased securities from kidder peabody,and the henry miller organization.they claim that kidder and miller fraudulently misrepresented the securities as vehicles similar to municipal bonds.ultimately,the securities failed and the appellants brought civil rico claims.after extensive discovery,the district court granted summary judgment to kidder and miller and held that the appellants claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations.on appeal,the appellants contend that the court erred in three major respects it incorrectly concluded that the appellants were injured at the time they purchased the securities it erred in holding that the appellants were on inquiry notice of their injuries no later than early and,finally,it erred in refusing to equitably toll the statute of limitations.we will affirm.
this case involves a securities class action brought against kidder,a retail brokerage house,and miller,a management,appraisal,and investment organization.app.at.in the early,brokerage houses began working with real estate companies,such as miller,to offer investment opportunities.they often sought to take advantage of the booming construction markets in the south and southwest regions of the united states known as the sunbelt.the companies formed limited partnerships,purchased sunbelt commercial real estate,and sold interests to the general public.they marketed the investments as tax shelters,capital gain opportunities,and plans.
in,kidder and miller created three separate investment funds.the two companies formed wholly owned subsidiaries to serve as general partners for the funds,and then sold limited partnerships to the public.the plan was to acquire commercial real estate properties in the sunbelt,collect rental income thus providing a steady,but modest,income stream for investors,and eventually sell the properties six to ten years later and collect substantial capital gains.the bulk of the return for investors was to come from appreciation in the properties.
kidder prepared and distributed to its brokers a prospectus,sales information,a videotape,and other reference materials describing the first investment fund in may,kidder began selling limited partnership units in that fund.by may,it had sold units in all three funds to more than six thousand investors and raised approximately million dollars.the funds purchased properties in texas,florida,georgia,new mexico,arizona,arkansas,and illinois.
the crux of the appellants claims is that kidder fraudulently suggested that the funds were,conservative investments suitable for low individuals.the appellants believe that kidder specifically targeted unsophisticated investors,intentionally misled them about the nature of the funds,and charged excessive fees and commissions.these acts allegedly constituted violations of the federal securities laws wire fraud,mail fraud,and rico violations.
furthermore,the appellants claim that kidder conducted inadequate due diligence in choosing commercial real estate investments.as a result,at least in part,fund properties lost many of their key tenants,and quarterly distributions to limited partners fell to only a few dollars per unit.additional economic factors also weakened the sunbelt real estate market as a whole and the value of the funds investments plunged.nonetheless,the appellants claim that kidder intentionally lulled them into a false sense of security that things would probably work out and substantial losses would be avoided.app.at.
economic conditions did not improve.by august,funds i and ii had stopped paying quarterly distributions.in april,kidder informed investors that conditions were unlikely to rebound,and therefore it was initiating an exit strategy.app.at.by,all three funds had announced their intention to liquidate,which they accomplished between february and november of.
ii.procedural history 
john mathews invested in fund ii in.he allegedly relied primarily upon oral representations by a kidder broker.as the fund value deteriorated,mathews became understandably frustrated and disappointed.on january,he filed a class action complaint contending that kidder had intentionally misrepresented the inherent risks associated with the funds and therefore had fraudulently induced him and others to invest.he claimed that kidder had engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity prohibited by the federal rico statute,et.specifically,he claimed that kidder had committed the predicate acts of securities fraud,mail fraud,and wire fraud 
in response,kidder filed a motion to dismiss.it claimed that mathews lacked standing to assert claims involving funds i and iii because he had only invested in fund ii,mathews had failed to allege the necessary rico elements,and his claims were barred by rico statute of limitations.the district court denied the motion without prejudice.the court agreed that mathews lacked standing concerning funds i and iii,but held that he could pursue his claims relating to fund ii.as to kidder remaining objections,the court allowed the case to move forward to develop a more complete record.
both parties quickly filed additional motions.mathews sought to amend his complaint to include plaintiffs who had invested in funds i and iii.ultimately,he moved for class certification,including investors in all three funds.kidder opposed mathews requests on procedural grounds,and in addition,argued that the private securities litigation reform act of pslra barred mathews rico action.the pslra,which congress enacted on december,amended the federal rico statute and explicitly eliminated securities fraud as a predicate act.see pub,stat,amending c.
the district court held that the pslra did not bar mathews rico claim.see mathews kidder peabody.in addition,the court allowed mathews to amend his complaint to include investors in funds i and iii,and it certified his requested class.kidder filed an interlocutory appeal to this court arguing that the pslra should apply retroactively to suits pending when the act was passed.we rejected that claim.see mathews kidder peabody,cir w e are extremely reluctant to create causes of action that did not previously exist,in this destroy causes of action and remedies that clearly did exist before congress acted.
discovery continued until november.kidder then moved for summary judgment,or alternatively to decertify the plaintiff class.mathews opposed these motions,and once again,sought to amend the complaint.in particular,he wanted to add a new allegation claiming that the kidder prospectus itself was fraudulent,because it misrepresented the inherent risks of the investment.the district court denied mathews motion to amend.the court cited undue prejudice to defendants,undue delay on the part of the movant,the movant repeated failure to cure deficiencies by previous amendments and futility of amendment.app.at.it held that amending the complaint would unduly prejudice the defendants because it would necessitate the taking of significant additional discovery and the difficulties that would entail is persuasive.app.at.mathews filed a motion for reconsideration,which was denied.
on august,the district court issued a thoughtful and thorough page opinion and order granting kidder motion for summary judgment.see app.at.the court held that mathews claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations.statute of limitations issues surrounding rico claims historically have been tricky for two reasons.first,congress failed to provide a statutory limitations period in the rico statute itself,and second,the supreme court has consistently refused to determine when a rico action,when the applicable limitations period begins to run.it is now well settled that rico actions enjoy a limitations period the question of accrual,however,remains a source of controversy.
in this case,the district court applied what it termed an injury discovery and pattern rule,see app.at,under which the statute begins to run once all of the elements of a civil rico cause of action existed,whether or not discovered,and the plaintiffs knew or should have known of the existence and source of their injury.app.at quoting poling hovnanian,d.the court assumed,for the sake of summary judgment,that mathews claims had merit and that kidder had committed securities,wire,and mail fraud.nonetheless,it had to address two questions when did the elements of a rico claim exist,and when did the appellants know,or should they have known,of their injuries 
first,the court held that all the elements of plaintiffs rico claim and their injury were in place no later than may.app.at.second,the court reviewed the mix of information available to the appellants and concluded that they should have been aware of their injury no later than february.app.at.thus,because both prongs of the injury discovery and pattern rule were satisfied,the statute of limitations began to run in early.mathews did not file his claim until almost five years later.therefore,he was barred by rico limitations period.the court also rejected mathews argument that the limitations period should be equitably tolled by kidder fraudulent acts and misrepresentations.once again,the court assumed that mathews allegations were true,but nonetheless concluded that the appellants had not exercised reasonable diligence and therefore could not benefit from equitable tolling mathews filed a timely appeal.
iii.accrual rule 
the statute of limitations for civil rico claims has engendered a great deal of controversy.the statute itself does not contain a limitations period.see rotella wood,d.as a result,in agency holding,d,the supreme court relied upon the clayton act and adopted an analogous period.however,the court did not specify when the period began,and three different interpretations arose.
a number of courts of appeals adopted the injury discovery accrual rule,which began the period once a plaintiff knew or should have known of his injury.rotella,at.at.this approach did not require any knowledge of the other rico elements.all but one of the remaining courts adopted the injury and pattern discovery rule under which a civil rico claim accrues only when the claimant discovers,or should discover,both an injury and a pattern of rico activity.id.we alone adopted a third variant,the last predicate act rule.see keystone ins.houghton,cir.from a plaintiff perspective,this was the most lenient approach under this rule,the period began to run as soon as the plaintiff knew or should have known of the injury and the pattern of racketeering activity,but began to run anew upon each predicate act forming part of the same pattern.rotella,at.at.
in,the supreme court cut the possibilities by one,rejecting our last predicate act rule.id.discussing klehr smith,d.the court based its holding on two arguments the rule created a limitations period longer than congress could have contemplated,which conflicted with a basic underlies limitations periods,and it conflicted with the ordinary clayton act rule applicable in private antitrust actions.klehr,at.at.in,the court again narrowed the possible approaches by rejecting the injury and pattern discovery rule.see rotella,at.at.the court stressed the basic policies of all limitations provisions repose,elimination of stale claims,and certainty about a plaintiff opportunity for recovery and a defendant potential liability.id.at.at.in addition,the court noted that the injury discovery rule would encourage plaintiffs to investigate their claims earlier and with greater vigor.see id.at.at.noting that the object of civil rico is not merely to compensate victims but to turn them into prosecutors,private attorneys general,dedicated to eliminating racketeering activity.
in the wake of rotella,at least two accrual rules remain possible an injury discovery rule,where the limitations period begins to run once a plaintiff discovers her injury,or an injury occurrence rule,where discovery is irrelevant.see rotella,at.at refusing to settle upon a final rule.in forbes eagleson,we recently considered these two approaches and adopted the injury discovery rule,cir a discovery rule applies whenever a federal statute of limitation is silent on the issue.see also rotella,at.at federal courts,to be sure,generally apply a discovery accrual rule when a statute is silent on the issue,as civil rico is here.
iv.zenith radio 
the appellants contend that an exception to the standard rico accrual rule applies in this case.they claim that the damages resulting from kidder misconduct were unclear at the time they invested,and a cause of action does not accrue until the fact of financial loss becomes predictable,concrete and and damages are provable.appellants br.at.thus,they argue that their claims did not accrue until kidder indicated,in and,that the investment funds were unlikely to be profitable.see appellants br.at.
the appellants rely heavily upon zenith radio hazeltine research,d a case involving alleged antitrust violations.in zenith radio,the defendant raised a statute of limitations defense,and argued that many of the purported injuries arose from conduct that occurred more than four years before the plaintiff filed suit.the supreme court rejected the defendant argument.the court held that at the time of the original misconduct,future damages were speculative and unclear and therefore unrecoverable.see id.at.at.the court noted that it would be contrary to congressional purpose s to foreclose recovery of those damages.it held that 
r efusal to award future profits as too speculative is equivalent to holding that no cause of action has yet accrued for any but those damages already suffered.in these instances,the cause of action for future damages,if they ever occur,will accrue only on the date they are suffered thereafter the plaintiff may sue to recover them at any time within four years from the date they were inflicted.
at.at.the appellants argue that this case is factually similar to zenith radio,and that rico damages were merely speculative at the time of their investment.for support,they cite a list of cases from the second circuit court of appeals and our recent decision in maio aetna,cir 
the district court rejected the proposition that the appellants were injured when their investments resulted in a catastrophic loss,that is,loss of capital gains from appreciation of the properties when they were sold.app.at.instead,the court ruled that the underlying claim was for securities fraud,and in such cases,an injury occurs when an investor purchases overpriced securities.see app.at,i t is well established that securities fraud in the sale of limited partnership interests occurs when the partnership interests are sold.citing volk davidson,cir.the court,however,did not explicitly address zenith radio nonetheless,we agree with the district court conclusion and find the appellants reliance upon zenith radio misplaced.
the value of a security is related to its expected return and its inherent risk.all else being equal,the greater the expected return and the lower the risk,the more valuable the security.if we accept the appellants allegations as true,kidder overstated the expected return of the funds and downplayed their inherent risks.thus,kidder misrepresentations exaggerated the value of the funds and led the appellants to purchase overpriced securities.we therefore conclude that the appellants sustained an injury when they purchased units in kidder investment only question is whether their damages,at the time of their investment,were sufficiently concrete.
we answer in the affirmative for three reasons.first,we agree with kidder that the actual value of the securities was readily calculable at the time of the appellants investment.see appellant br.at while this determination may require some calculation or even expert testimony,the measure of damages is not speculative.the raison of many investment banks and financial institutions is to calculate the value of complicated securities,many of which are far more complex than the funds at issue here.certainly,district courts are no strangers to expert testimony concerning financial valuation.see,sowell butcher singer,cir d amages are most commonly calculated as the difference between the price paid for a security and the security true value.in this case,as kidder contends,the funds could have been valued at any time based,in part,on the yearly valuations of these properties.appellant br.at.the appellants damages,at the time they invested,were simply the difference between the approximate value of the funds,calculated based upon market information free of kidder misrepresentations,and the actual purchase price.
second,we agree with the reasoning employed by the only other circuit court of appeals to have addressed this issue.in a remarkably similar factual setting,the second circuit court of appeals held that investors were injured when they purchased overpriced limited partnership units based upon the defendant fraudulent misrepresentations.see in re merrill lynch,cir.before the merrill lynch decision,a number of second circuit cases had suggested that a rico injury did not occur at the time of investment the district court in merrill lynch summarized those cases as follows 
they stand for the proposition that when a creditor has been defrauded,but contractual or other legal remedies remain which hold out a real possibility that the debt,and therefore the injury,may be eliminated,rico injury is speculative,and a rico claim is not ripe until those remedies are exhausted.
in re merrill lynch,d.nonetheless,the court drew a critical distinction between cases involving contractual debt instruments and those involving equity investments with no basis for recovery other than the limited partnerships performance.id.traditionally,the line between debt and equity has been well defined debt contracts promise set future payments of interest and principal.upon default,an investor can recover damages through a contract action.in contrast,an equity investment is traditionally considered an ownership stake in an underlying asset.there is no promised return therefore,an investor has no contractual remedy if the underlying property,asset,or venture fails.
the district court in merrill lynch recognized that in the debt context,a rico injury occurs only when a debtor defaults on his contractual obligation.d at.only at that point can an investor be sure that he will not receive the benefit of his bargain.we implicitly recognized the same principle in maio aetna,cir.in that case,the plaintiffs claimed that aetna fraudulent misrepresentations had led them to buy overpriced health insurance.we held,however,that a rico injury did not occur until aetna failed to perform its contractual,until it failed to provide health benefits or treatment that it had promised.at.in essence,we characterized the plaintiffs property interest as a contractual right to receive certain benefits,and distinguished it from an ownership interest in tangible property.see id.at t he property rights at issue are different from interests in real or personal property.
in contrast,the appellants interest in this case was an ownership stake in real property,fundamentally no different than a plot of land or a diamond necklace.maio,at.although kidder may have been overly optimistic in describing its investment funds,it never promised a set return.therefore,the appellants have no contractual remedy for the losses they incurred.instead,kidder offered an equity investment,contingent upon the appreciation,or lack thereof,of the underlying sunbelt properties.the crux of the appellants claim is that they overpaid for that interest.we believe that the most accurate way to measure that loss,like for any other tangible property interest,would be to calculate the difference between what the appellants paid and the true market value of what they received.therefore,we agree with the second circuit court of appeals that this case is distinguishable from those involving contractual agreements,such as debt contracts.when a defendant fraudulently misleads individuals into purchasing equity interests in real property,an injury occurs at the time of investment.
finally,caselaw concerning securities regulations also supports our conclusion.the appellants argue that their losses did not become sufficiently concrete until kidder decided to liquidate the funds in.they presumably believe that the only way to determine damages would be to calculate the difference between what they originally paid for the fund units and what they received upon liquidation.in other words,they believe rescission is the only proper approach.see pinter dahl,d r escission provides for restoration of the status quo by requiring the buyer to return what he received from the seller in terms of damages,rescission provides the consideration paid for such security with interest thereon,less the amount of any income received thereon.of course,we need not determine the best method for calculating damages in the present case.our task is merely to decide whether the appellants damages could have been calculated at the time of their injury.if an out of pocket measure of damages the difference between the purchase price of a security and its true value is viable in this case,we must conclude that the appellants injury,at the time of their investment,was sufficiently concrete.
the appellants have alleged securities fraud under of the securities exchange act of.see,app.at.section specifically provides for rescissionary damages.see ballay legg mason wood walker,cir.however,the appellants also cite b of the securities exchange act of.see b,app.at.damages in b securities fraud cases are most commonly calculated as the difference between the price paid for a security and the security true value.sowell butcher singer,cir.although we have declined to establish a firm rule for calculating b damages,see scattergood perelman,cir,the fifth circuit court of appeals has commented at length about the conceptual shortcomings of rescission 
t he rescissional measure permits the defrauded securities buyer to place upon the defendant the burden of any decline in the value of the securities between the date of purchase and the date of sale even though only a portion of that decline may have been proximately caused by the defendant wrong under these circumstances,the rescissional measure is unjust insofar as it compensates an investor for the nonspecific risks which he assumes by entering the market.losses thus accruing have no relation to either the benefits derived by the defendants from the fraud or to the blameworthiness of their conduct.
huddleston herman maclean,cir,modified on other grounds,d.we have expressed similar sentiments.see hoxworth blinder,robinson,cir although the supreme court has reserved the question whether a rescissionary measure of damages is ever appropriate for defrauded buyers under rule,this court has expressed clear disapproval of a damage theory that would insure defrauded buyers against downside market risk unrelated to the fraud.
thus,in most b cases,we are extremely hesitant to award rescissionary damages and instead apply an out of pocket measure.in this case,there is nothing in the record to suggest that the appellants injuries were any more speculative or difficult to calculate than those in a typical b claim.therefore,we reject the appellants argument that their claims require a rescissionary measure of damages.instead,we conclude that the appellants damages,at the time they purchased units in kidder investment funds,could have been calculated by an out of pocket measure and thus were sufficiently concrete and.
injury discovery 
the appellants second primary objection is that the district court erred by holding that they should have discovered their injury no later than february.app.at.because the court granted summary judgment,the burden of proof is initially on kidder to demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact surrounding the appellants discovery of their injury.see celotex catrett,d.we recognize that this puts kidder in the unenviable position of arguing that its fraud was so obvious that the appellants should have discovered their injuries.in addition,the issue is extremely.see davis grusemeyer,cir t he applicability of the statute of limitations usually implicates factual questions as to when plaintiff discovered or should have discovered the elements of the cause of action accordingly,defendants bear a heavy burden in seeking to establish as a matter of law that the challenged claims are barred.quoting van buskirk carey canadian mines,cir.therefore,kidder task is not an easy one 
in forbes,we adopted an injury discovery rule whereby a rico claim accrues when plaintiffs knew or should have known of their injury.at.by our own plain language,the rule is both subjective and objective.the subjective component needs little claim accrues no later than when the plaintiffs themselves discover their injuries.however,we offered little insight into the objective prong of the forbes test.we take this opportunity to do so.
in order to determine whether the appellants were on inquiry notice of their injuries,the district court relied heavily upon caselaw in other circuits concerning securities fraud.without a doubt,the appellants claim is greatly dependent upon their allegations of securities fraud.however,it is important to note that t he focus of accrual in a rico action is different from that for a fraud claim where the focus is on the acts of the defendants.landy mitchell petroleum tech.more specifically,a rico claim accrues when the plaintiffs should have discovered their injuries.in contrast,a securities fraud claim accrues when the plaintiffs should have discovered the misrepresentations and of the defendants.the difference is subtle,but in some circumstances,it can be dispositive in this case,however,it is insignificant because the fraud and injury occurred at approximately the same the appellants purchased kidder securities.furthermore,in most securities fraud actions,the plaintiffs injuries are inextricably intertwined with the defendant misrepresentations.discovery of one leads almost immediately to discovery of the other.therefore,we believe that the district court did not err by relying upon securities fraud precedent to determine whether the appellants were on inquiry notice of their injuries.
it would be an understatement to characterize the body of caselaw concerning what constitutes inquiry notice in a federal securities fraud action as extensive.see,lawrence kaplan,annotation,what constitutes inquiry notice sufficient to commence running of statute of limitations in securities fraud cases,fed,wl.the general articulation of the inquiry notice standard,however,is fairly consistent in the context of a rico action predicated upon a securities fraud claim,we hold that a plaintiff is on inquiry notice whenever circumstances exist that would lead a reasonable investor of ordinary intelligence,through the exercise of reasonable due diligence,to discover his or her injury.
some courts have further refined the inquiry notice test into a analysis.see,havenick network express.addeo braver.the district court in this case applied a test whether the plaintiffs knew or should have known of the possibility of fraud storm warnings and,once that possibility arose,whether plaintiffs exercised due diligence to determine the origin and extent of the fraud.the first part of the test is objective,the second subjective.app.at citations omitted.in other words,the court asked whether there were sufficient storm warnings on the horizon,and if so,whether the appellants exercised due diligence to recognize them.
we hold that inquiry notice should be analyzed in two steps.first,the burden is on the defendant to show the existence of storm warnings.as the district court noted,storm warnings may take numerous forms,and we will not attempt to provide an exhaustive list.they may include,however,substantial conflicts between oral representations of the brokers and the text of the prospectus,the accumulation of information over a period of time that conflicts with representations that were made when the securities were originally purchased,or any financial,legal or other data that would alert a reasonable person to the probability that misleading statements or significant omissions had been made.app.at.
the existence of storm warnings is a totally objective inquiry.plaintiffs need not be aware of the suspicious circumstances or understand their import.it is enough that a reasonable investor of ordinary intelligence would have discovered the information and recognized it as a storm warning.thus,investors are presumed to have read prospectuses,quarterly reports,and other information relating to their investments.this comports with the general purpose of civil rico to encourage plaintiffs to actively investigate potential criminal activity,to become prosecutors,private attorneys general,dedicated to eliminating racketeering activity.rotella,at.at.
second,if the defendants establish the existence of storm warnings,the burden shifts to the plaintiffs to show that they exercised reasonable due diligence and yet were unable to discover their injuries.this inquiry is both subjective and objective.the plaintiffs must first show that they investigated the suspicious circumstances then,we must determine whether their efforts were,whether they exercised the due diligence expected of reasonable investors of ordinary intelligence.because the stated goal of civil rico is to encourage active investigation of potential racketeering activity,see rotella,at.at,we reject the proposition that unsophisticated investors should be held to a lower standard of due diligence.
in this case,the district court found that kidder had established the existence of storm warnings.in particular,our review of the record,in addition to the district court findings,indicates four areas of potential initial prospectus,the paltry annual distributions of rental income,the falling net asset value of each partnership unit,and kidder periodic assessment of the funds economic health.while it is true that the mix of information may constitute a storm warning in the aggregate,we will address the prospectus and the subsequent financial updates separately.
we begin with the prospectus.the district court focused much of its attention upon the descriptions of risks provided in the prospectus.see app.at.we do not dispute that the language cited by the court is present,or that the specific risks discussed in the prospectus are most of the events on which plaintiffs base their allegations of fraud.app.at.nonetheless,we agree with the spirit of the appellants position,that there is nothing in the document to suggest the magnitude of the many enumerated risks.in fact,in reading through the numerous cautionary provisions,we are reminded of the laundry lists of possible that accompany most prescription medications.just because there are risks,even if they are numerous,does not mean that a drug is unsafe.similarly,there is nothing in the prospectus to suggest that the funds are especially risky or inappropriate for conservative investors 
like the seventh circuit court of appeals,we are mindful of the dangers in adopting too broad an interpretation of inquiry notice.see law medco research,cir t oo much emphasis on the statute of limitations can precipitate premature and groundless suits,as plaintiffs rush to beat the deadline without being able to obtain good evidence of fraud fujisawa pharm,kapoor,cir inquiry notice must not be construed so broadly that the statute of limitations starts running too soon for the victim of the fraud to be able to bring suit.if a relatively generic enumeration of possible risks,without any meaningful discussion of their magnitude,can be enough to establish inquiry notice at the summary judgment stage,we would encourage a flood of untimely litigation.therefore,we hold that the prospectus,by itself,does not constitute a storm warning.
kidder numerous financial updates,however,are a different matter based upon the correspondence concerning funds i and ii,we conclude that the district court,if anything,was overly generous to the appellants in holding that they should have discovered their injuries by early.sufficient storm warnings existed for investors in funds i and ii no later than april of.on august,kidder informed investors in fund i that their quarterly distribution had fallen to per unit this represented over a decrease in the initial fund distributions,which ranged from,to.on that same date,kidder informed investors in fund ii that their quarterly distributions had fallen to per unit.this represented over a decrease in the initial fund distributions,which ranged from,to.even if the distributions had returned to their original levels at some later time,this sort of volatility is simply inconsistent with a conservative investment vehicle similar to municipal bonds.
furthermore,kidder also sent the appellants annual updates on the total net asset value of the individual units as of december,fund i units had a total net asset value of.on april,kidder sent a letter to fund i investors indicating that total net asset value had fallen to.see app.at.this represented a decrease from.as of december,fund ii units had a total net asset value of.on april,kidder sent a letter to fund ii investors indicating that total net asset value had fallen to.see app.at.this represented a decrease from.
the appellants only response is that there was ample evidence from which a jury could conclude that it was entirely reasonable for them to wait and see how things developed.appellants br.at.the appellants fundamentally misunderstand their own argument.they contend that kidder fraudulently misrepresented the inherent risk of the investment funds.according to modern finance,risk is best understood as a security volatility.therefore,regardless of whether the funds recovered,the large swings in their distributions and net asset values are inconsistent with,conservative investments after the funds net asset values fell over and their distributions fell by over,the appellants should have recognized that they were not the safe,conservative vehicles promised by kidder.based upon the financial information received by the appellants,we have no problem concluding that ominous storm warnings,concerning funds i and ii,were present no later than april.
as the appellants point out,however,fund iii is a closer question.by april of,the fund net asset value had fallen only,see app.at,and its distributions were still consistent.see app.at.in fact,a noticeable decrease in the fund distributions did not occur until the first quarter of,and the appellants were not informed until may.see app.at.even when viewed in combination with kidder prospectus and the cautionary language in its quarterly updates,we would be to find no genuine issue of material fact as to whether fund iii investors were on inquiry notice of their injuries prior to.however,the appellants did not allege a separate cause of action based solely upon fund iii.instead,they sought and were granted certification of a class that included investors in all three funds,and they alleged a common,overarching pattern of racketeering activity.see mathews kidder peabody,no,wl,at,plaintiffs have alleged a large,unitary scheme,a common course of conduct.as we previously concluded,the storm warnings pertaining to funds i and ii were overwhelming.thus,we conclude that sufficient storm warnings existed for the entire class certified by the appellants.
because storm warnings were present,we must next determine whether the appellants exercised due diligence expected of reasonable investors of ordinary intelligence.we conclude that they did not.based upon the record,the parties briefs,and the district court opinion,the only action that might be termed due diligence is a single letter from attorney robert wolf inquiring into the status of fund see app.at.according to the district court,kidder responded with a four and page letter,reiterating financial information provided in quarterly reports.the only positive sentiment in the letter was kidder statement that the general partners remain confident in the underlying value of the partnership real estate assets and believe this value will be realized once these markets turnaround.app.at.there is no evidence that wolf in any fashion.we agree with the district court that if anything,this evidences a lack of due diligence.
furthermore,to determine what constitutes reasonable due diligence,we must consider the magnitude of the existing storm warnings.the more ominous the warnings,the more extensive the expected inquiry.in this case,the warnings,at least for investors in fund i and ii,were massive and extremely threatening.for conservative investors,they must have appeared like funnel clouds.that none of them pressed kidder for an explanation defies comprehension.
this case stands in stark contrast to forbes,at,where the plaintiffs hired an investigator,who made numerous inquiries and requested financial documents not only from the defendant,but also from other related parties.he continued to pursue his investigation in spite of continued opposition.reasonable due diligence does not require a plaintiff to exhaust all possible avenues of inquiry.nor does it require the plaintiff to actually discover his injury.at the very least,however,due diligence does require plaintiffs to do something more than send a single letter to the defendant.if we were to hold that the appellants exercised reasonable due diligence in this case,it would strip the requirement of any meaningful significance.therefore,because by early,there were numerous storm warnings that the appellants failed to adequately investigate,their claims accrued,and the limitations period began to run,on that date 
vi.fraudulent tolling 
finally,the appellants argue that even if their claims accrued in,the statute of limitations should be tolled due to kidder fraudulent concealment of its racketeering activity.fraudulent concealment is an equitable doctrine that is read into every federal statute of limitations.davis grusemeyer,cir.
in rotella,the supreme court indicated that rico limitation period could be tolled where a pattern remains obscure in the face of a plaintiff diligence in seeking to identify it.at,at.we adopted this holding in forbes,at,and held that the plaintiff has the burden of proving the three necessary elements of a fraudulent concealment claim active misleading by the defendant,which prevents the plaintiff from recognizing the validity of her claim within the limitations period,where the plaintiff ignorance is not attributable to her lack of reasonable due diligence in attempting to uncover the relevant facts.see also klehr smith,d w e conclude that fraudulent concealment in the context of civil rico embodies a due diligence requirement.however,when a plaintiff merely seeks to survive summary judgment,there need only be a genuine issue of material fact that the doctrine applies.thus,a court must determine 
whether there is sufficient evidence to support a finding that defendants engaged in affirmative acts of concealment designed to mislead the plaintiffs regarding facts supporting their count i claim,whether there is sufficient evidence to support a finding that plaintiffs exercised reasonable diligence,and whether there is sufficient evidence to support a finding that plaintiffs were not aware,nor should they have been aware,of the facts supporting their claim until a time within the limitations period measured backwards from when the plaintiffs filed their complaint.absent evidence to support these findings there is no genuine dispute of material fact on the issue and the defendants are entitled to summary judgment.
forbes,at citing northview motors,chrysler motors,cir.here,we will assume that kidder actively misled the appellants therefore,we must determine whether they exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to uncover the facts necessary to support a claim 
although a fraudulent concealment defense can offer a tremendous advantage to plaintiffs it is of little practical utility here.in order to avoid summary judgment,there must be a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the appellants exercised reasonable due diligence in investigating their claim.we have already answered that question in the negative.therefore,we reject the appellants fraudulent concealment claim.
vii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we will affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor kidder peabody,and the henry miller o
