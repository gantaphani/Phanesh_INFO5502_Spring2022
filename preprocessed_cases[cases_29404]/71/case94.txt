peter camplin,a maine businessman,owned and operated the sea dog brewing company,which ran into financial trouble.in the spring of he sold the company to joseph and barbara wortley,who set up a trust to hold the stock.claims and litigation brought by each side ensued.eventually a federal court jury found that joseph wortley had violated the federal securities laws,section b of the securities and exchange act of,b,and rule,and awarded camplin plus interest.at trial the judge dismissed wortley claim that camplin had violated warranties under maine version of the uniform commercial code on the ground that the evidence demonstrated the wortleys had waived the claim through a document they executed.
the wortleys appeal,making three arguments.both appeal the dismissal of the warranty claim joseph wortley also argues that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the jury verdict against him and that the damages award was excessive and contrary to law.we affirm.
camplin founded the sea dog brewing in.he owned all the stock one hundred shares in sea dog,either through a proxy his brother or in his own name.he operated the business together with his two sons brett,who ran the kitchens,and peter,who managed the business end.sea dog opened its first location,a tavern serving food and its own beers,in camden,maine in.in,sea dog opened a second location in bangor,maine and began bottling and distributing beer on a larger scale for sale outside the chain restaurants and bars.sea dog bottling and distribution operations produced substantial losses starting in.
on february,sea dog closed on a million loan from camden national bank camplin personally guaranteed the loan as collateral,camplin pledged his one hundred shares of sea dog stock his personal residence in lincolnville,maine and the stock and income from a trust holding a partial ownership interest in a building in freeport,maine.camplin sea dog stock remained subject to this pledge through spring,when he sold the stock to wortley.
sea dog lost over from to.in,camden national bank asked camplin to find another bank with which to do business.camplin approached several banks but was unable to refinance.
sea dog balance sheet shows that it was insolvent in.camplin accountant indicated on sea dog financial statement that the company might be unable to continue as a going concern.sea dog financial problems grew increasingly severe.by spring,it owed over to trade creditors,and the landlord at one of its locations had initiated eviction proceedings.sea dog nevertheless retained substantial assets,including an option on a piece of real estate in bangor valued at over one million dollars.
camplin decided to sell sea dog.in january,he began negotiations to sell sea dog to fred forsley,a friend and business associate who was the president of shipyard brewing camplin and forsley entered into a letter of intent for a secured creditor sale of sea dog in this letter,sea dog acknowledged that it was in technical default of its obligations to camden national bank,and agreed not to block the bank from foreclosing on camplin sea dog stock and then the stock to forsley.the letter of intent provides that forsley would use a ll efforts to maintain employees after a sale.the deal fell apart in february or march,apparently because forsley would not indemnify camplin for his personal guarantee of the bank loan.camplin then began aggressively looking for another prospective buyer.
in march,scott johnson,camplin,introduced camplin to wortley,an entrepreneur living in florida who had been johnson college roommate.camplin and wortley met on march and,in a restaurant in florida to discuss wortley possible acquisition of sea dog.camplin says that during these meetings the two men agreed that camplin would sell sea dog to wortley for plus the following consideration wortley would indemnify camplin from any personal liability on the guarantee of the million bank loan as well as smaller obligations to other sea dog creditors wortley would pay camplin the sum of as reimbursement for personal funds camplin had recently invested in sea dog,and camplin would continue to receive his salary and benefits until this sum was paid wortley would retain camplin two sons,peter and brett,in sea dog senior management and the legal documents memorializing the transaction would incorporate these promises.camplin son,peter,testified that wortley made the first three promises again at a meeting on april.
wortley recollection of the meetings on march and and april was very different.he acknowledged that camplin raised the issues of the million personal guarantee,the investment,and his sons employment,but he denied agreeing to camplin requests.as to the personal guarantee,wortley testified that he told camplin he would stand between him and camden national bank by foregoing any offer by the bank to discount the debt as part of refinancing which might require camplin to pay the difference between the discounted amount and the full amount.wortley also acknowledged that he told camplin there was a possibility to take the bank out of the picture altogether by the end of the summer.wortley testified that he refused to reimburse camplin the sum of,but gave him the opportunity to earn at least some of the money back by consulting for sea dog.wortley testified that he agreed merely to continue employing camplin sons,not to have them head sea dog.wortley testified that the driving force behind camplin willingness to sell sea dog for the nominal consideration of was his recognition that the business needed an immediate injection of cash in order to survive.
camplin and wortley met on april,to sign a stock purchase agreement spa.the spa,which was drafted by wortley attorney,provides that wortley purchase camplin sea dog stock for.it does not mention the promises wortley allegedly gave as consideration at the march meetings clause b does provide that wortley obligation to purchase but not camplin obligation to sell is contingent upon the signing of a more comprehensive stock purchase agreement containing comprehensive representations,warranties and covenants of seller,satisfactory to purchaser and his counsel,with respect to the stock and the company business,financial condition,results of operations and prospects.the spa contains an integration clause.
camplin testified that before signing the spa he observed to wortley that the agreement omitted the promises that were his main consideration for the sea dog stock.wortley,camplin testified,responded that the parties would sign a subsequent,comprehensive agreement containing wortley promises.according to a letter sent by camplin on november,wortley referred camplin to clause b of the spa,assuring him that the omitted promises would be part of the agreement referenced therein.on this basis,camplin testified,he signed the spa.he says he put aside his concerns about the spa omissions and ambiguities partly because sea dog precarious financial situation created strong time pressure camplin,a sophisticated businessman who had several lawyers,was not represented by an attorney in the sale of sea dog to wortley.
in,wortley transferred to a trust maintained by camplin attorney to be used to purchase merchandise for sea dog.camplin did not receive any of this money.apart from camplin salary and the initial payment,wortley made no payments to camplin before sea dog bankruptcy filing in november.
on may,wortley assigned his rights under the spa to his wife for the purpose of placing the sea dog stock in trust.that day,wortley attorney faxed camplin a letter,signed by both and wortley an assignment and transfer of rights and a stock power.the letter notified camplin of the assignment,requested that he sign and return the attached documents,and waived those conditions to purchaser obligations from the spa that had not yet been fulfilled.camplin then called wortley attorney to ask whether a more comprehensive agreement was forthcoming.camplin testified that wortley attorney answered affirmatively.wortley attorney denied this and testified that he told camplin that camplin needed to speak directly to wortley.camplin executed the assignment and stock power documents on may,transferring his sea dog stock to wortley.later that day,wortley transferred the stock to the sea dog trust.
wortley initially kept camplin and his sons on the payroll,but failed to fully meet his purported obligations to any of the family members.sea dog paid camplin salary and health benefits during much but not all of the summer and fall of.meanwhile,wortley and scott johnson,whom wortley appointed president of sea dog,effectively demoted both of camplin sons.brett left sea dog in the summer of,shortly after wortley took over,and went to work for a food supplier on its sea dog and other accounts.peter,left in june,because of an apparent reprisal against his family in response to his father lawsuit,and got a job with a mortgage company.both brothers had better pay and benefits at their new jobs than at sea dog.
wortley did take several steps to remedy sea dog financial problems and to protect camplin against personal liability.wortley notified sea dog creditors by letter dated may,that camplin had sold the company stock to the sea dog trust.later that month,after camden national bank notified camplin that the stock transfer constituted a default under the terms of the loan agreement,wortley arranged to make a payment on the principal owed to the bank in return for a forbearance.wortley and johnson tried unsuccessfully to refinance sea dog million debt with camden national bank and with pointe bank in florida.they also tried to reschedule sea dog payments to its trade creditors.
wortley did not,however,indemnify camplin.camplin had pledged his home in lincolnville as collateral on the bank loan.when camplin sold his home on october,camden national bank took the proceeds from that sale,to pay down sea dog debt.in addition,north center,a food supplier,obtained a judgment against camplin for approximately,including interest and costs,on a debt accrued by sea dog after camplin transferred ownership of the company to wortley.
on october,camden national bank wrote camplin a letter stating that the million loan was in default,that the bank planned to foreclose on the collateral and initiate litigation against the guarantors,and that a secured creditor sale of sea dog assets was scheduled for november.camplin faxed the letter to wortley and johnson.camplin also faxed johnson a letter on november,demanding the more comprehensive stock purchase agreement contemplated under clause b of the existing spa.
sea dog filed for chapter bankruptcy protection on november.on november,the bankruptcy court issued the first of several interim cash collateral orders.by agreement of sea dog and camden national bank,the orders provided that,so long as there was no further default on sea dog financial obligations to the bank,the bank would not seek to recover from camplin or other guarantors.these orders stayed in effect during the bankruptcy.during this period,wortley loaned several hundred thousand dollars to sea dog,in return for which he received liens on some of its assets.
in november or december,camden national bank informed both wortley and camplin that it had identified a potential buyer for its sea dog loan and collateral,including camplin guarantee.it invited either man to buy the debt instead.camplin,fearing that his guarantees would end up in the hands of strangers,obtained a loan,via a trust,from fleet bank that he used to buy the debt on december.camplin owned the debt through a limited liability company called wwn group,which,he testified,stood for wortley worst nightmare.camplin,then,through wwn group,was a creditor of sea dog.
in march and april,camplin adopted a strategy,seeking to regain control of sea dog while at the same time suing wortley.on march,camplin caused wwn group to publish a notice of a secured creditor sale with respect to the pledged sea dog stock.at the secured creditor sale on march,wwn group purchased the stock for.camplin then filed a motion in bankruptcy court seeking authority to close sea dog and liquidate its assets.he reversed course on liquidation,though,and on april,camplin and wwn group formally agreed to support a reorganization plan proposed by wortley.under the plan,the sea dog stock would be transferred to sea dog trust,controlled by wortley,and the loan that had been purchased by wwn group from camden national bank would be repaid in full over years at an interest rate of percent the bankruptcy plan was filed in the bankruptcy court on july,and confirmed by the court on august.as of april,the date of camplin testimony in the federal trial,sea dog had made all monthly payments to camplin and wwn group required by the plan 
camplin filed a complaint against wortley and johnson in maine state court on march.the wortleys then brought suit in the district court for maine,and camplin filed a counterclaim against the wortleys there,which tracked his state court claims.in federal court,camplin counterclaimed for violations of section and rule breach of contract fraud fraudulent inducement intentional infliction of emotional distress fraudulent transfer violation of.ann.tit,west and negligent misrepresentation.he sought a range of remedies including punitive damages and double damages.wortley brought many of the same claims against violation of section and rule violation of.ann.tit,fraud negligent misrepresentation and breach of well as a claim for breach of warranty under maine version of the.ann.tit,west.wortley claims derived mainly from camplin alleged failure to reveal that the sea dog stock he sold in spring was already pledged to camden national bank.
both parties sought summary judgment on the claims asserted against them.on february,the district court affirmed the decision of the magistrate judge denying camplin motion and granting wortley motion in part.it dismissed all of camplin claims against wortley and his claims against wortley for breach of contract,intentional infliction of emotional distress,fraudulent transfer,negligent misrepresentation,and punitive damages.
the case was tried before a jury and,after the conclusion of each party case in chief,the district court heard motions from both sides for judgment as a matter of law.wortley sought a directed verdict,inter alia,on camplin federal securities law claim,arguing that camplin had failed to demonstrate that wortley was either a seller or a purchaser of stock under the statute.the district court rejected this argument.it granted camplin motion for judgment as a matter of law on wortley warranty claim,but denied camplin motion on wortley breach of contract claim.
the jury found that wortley committed federal securities law fraud and awarded camplin in damages.it found for wortley on camplin other claims,and found for camplin on wortley claims.the district court awarded camplin half his costs.wortley again moved for judgment as a matter of law on the federal securities law verdict.he contested both the sufficiency of the evidence supporting several elements of the section claim and the legal and factual basis for the damages award.the district court denied this motion in a decision and order dated august.this appeal followed.
dismissal of the warranty claim 
the wortleys asserted that camplin had violated a statutory warranty under maine version of the by transferring to them sea dog stock in march which was under pledge to a bank.this issue is controlled by maine law.
the statutory warranty provides 
a person who transfers a certificated security to a purchaser for value warrants to the purchaser that 
b the transferor does not know of any fact that might impair the validity of the security 
c there is no adverse claim to the security 
d the transfer does not violate any restriction on transfer 
f the transfer is otherwise effective and rightful.
ann.tit.after hearing the evidence at trial,the trial court entered judgment against the wortleys,finding 
i granting the motion by the defendant for judgment as a matter of law under the ucc warranty claim.that arises under article of the uniform commercial code,section c,by which there is an automatic warranty to the purchaser that there is no adverse claim to the security when a certificate of security is transferred.there also warranty under subsection d that the transfer does not violate any restriction on the transfer.
passing the question who purchased here,under the circumstances as they been presented,camplin would seem to have violated both at the time of the transfer,but there is nothing in ucc law that prevents waiving that warranty.instead,article,section,rather,provides very clearly that the effect of provisions of this title may be varied by agreement except as otherwise provided in this title.title being title which is the whole uniform commercial code.
then there are certain other specific sections like good faith and reasonableness.and the language is that the effect may be varied.and i find therefore that the statute does not require that a waiver actually refer to the statute.here the waiver of warranties that wortley signed as the purchaser,the assignee of the rights under the purchase,expressly waived warranties in the purchase and sale agreement that were identical to the statutory ones.so i conclude as a matter of law that the statutory warranty was waived at the same time as the contractual warranties were waived.
our review of the court ruling on the statutory warranty claim is de novo.
this ruling is based on a may,letter to camplin,sent by and signed by the wortleys.that letter provided 
pursuant to section of the stock purchase agreement,barbara wortley hereby waives all the conditions set forth in section of the stock purchase agreement that have not yet been fulfilled.
the conditions set forth in section of the stock purchase agreement were the same as the statutory warranties.the letter was apparently drafted by the wortleys counsel,since this letter asked camplin to send documents to their counsel and an attached cover letter was signed only by their counsel.it is not clear if the reason for the profferred waiver was to expedite the deal or for some other purpose.
wortley argues the issue of breach of statutory warranty should have gone to the jury because the meaning of the letter was ambiguous,and because there were issues of fact as to whether any waiver was knowing or voluntary and as to camplin good faith 
wortley argues that the waiver in the may,letter is ambiguous in light of the next sentence in the letter 
accordingly,we hereby request that you sign and return the enclosed stock power,together with the original stock certificates evidencing shares of stock in sea dog brewing and the original stock transfer ledger and corporate record books of sea dog brewing.
it is clear that the may waiver satisfies the terms of,which provides 
any claim or right arising out of an alleged breach can be discharged in whole or in part without consideration by a written waiver or renunciation signed and delivered by the aggrieved party.
the wortleys argument that the release language is ambiguous,an issue of law for the judge under maine law,borders on the frivolous.see town of lisbon thayer,me.the waiver is clearly unambiguous.
the wortleys more serious argument is that a waiver under can never waive the good faith requirement under because provides 
the effect of provisions of this act may be varied by agreement,except as otherwise provided in this act and except that the obligations of good faith,diligence,reasonableness and care prescribed by this act may not be disclaimed by agreement but the parties may by agreement determine the standards by which the performance of such obligations is to be measured if such standards are not manifestly unreasonable.
they argue there is a material issue of fact as to camplin bad faith that the stock was pledged and that dispute of fact,in combination with the of the good faith requirement,means that summary judgment was erroneously entered.the trial court assumed that camplin had acted in bad faith,but found that the wortleys had waived their claim.the trial court also correctly concluded that there was no material issue of fact as to whether the wortleys waiver was knowing and voluntary.
the issue presented is a pure question of law,determined under maine law when a party knowingly and voluntarily waives statutory warranty rights,does the preclude application of the waiver to the obligation of good faith the maine courts have not addressed this issue,to our knowledge.we agree with the trial judge that maine law would find the good faith provisions may be relinquished under these circumstances when the supposed bad faith did not induce the wortleys to execute the waiver.
maine law does not impose a duty of good faith and fair dealing except in circumstances governed by specific provisions of the haines great paper,me.the supreme judicial court of maine has stressed that the itself imposes a duty of objective good faith in certain situations.first banks granite state scarborough,me.
it is generally accepted that the good faith standard of does not create an independent cause of action and that it does not create an obligation conceptually separate from the underlying agreement.anderson,anderson on the uniform commercial code,at supp.this case does not involve the more common situation of application of the good faith obligation to a seller efforts unreasonably to disclaim certain remedies.see potomac plaza terraces,qsc,most jurisdictions hold that a seller who acted in bad faith may not claim the benefit of a limitation of remedy that by itself would be valid.internal quotation omitted.
rather,this case involves a written waiver of statutory warranties,under,which was a voluntary relinquishment of rights.we think the maine courts,given their relatively strict approach to the concept of good faith obligations,would choose to read and as referring to the good faith in entering into the waiver or renunciation rather than to the good faith in connection with the underlying claim or right which is discharged.anderson,supra,at acknowledging ambiguity.since none of the wortleys evidence on this issue went to their somehow being induced in bad faith by camplin to waive their warranties,summary judgment was appropriately entered on the claim.
b.the jury verdict of violation of section 
joseph wortley argues that there was insufficient evidence to support several elements of camplin claim under section and rule.the burden was on camplin to prove that wortley made a materially false or misleading statement or failed to state a fact necessary to make a statement not misleading in connection with the purchase or sale of a security with the intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud and that camplin was injured by his reasonable reliance on wortley misrepresentations.see geffon micrion,cir shaw digital equip,cir.
first,wortley argues there was insufficient evidence that he acted with the requisite state of mind to meet the scienter requirement.scienter embraces intent to deceive,manipulate or defraud.in re cabletron,cir.to establish scienter,camplin must show either that wortley consciously intended to defraud,or that he acted with a high degree of recklessness.aldridge cross,cir see also greebel ftp software,cir discussing scienter requirement.
wortley relies on the rule that mere breach of a promise is not itself enough to establish fraudulent intent for a federal securities law violation.gurary winehouse,cir see quest kimmons,cir see also cross,at of course,more than mere proof that the defendants made a particular false or misleading statement is required to show scienter.the remedy in such a situation is an action for breach of contract.see mills polar molecular,cir.
wortley argues that he never promised to indemnify camplin on camplin personal guarantee to the bank.he admits he did promise to pursue various options in order to protect camplin,but says he met that obligation.he argues that his promise to stand between camplin and the bank could not be understood to impose any duty on him to do more than what he did do.
the district court considered this issue of the dividing line between fraud and a mere failed promise to be very close,but appropriately resolved to let it go to the jury.when the issue was raised again in wortl
