in this case,we consider challenges to a pair of district court orders one defines the obligations of a receiver,and the other denies a motion to recuse the district judge.finding error in neither ruling,we affirm in all respects.also,because appellants lawyers,michael nelson and david maney,may have violated ethical obligations binding on attorneys practicing in the federal courts,we will order them to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed.
in,a jury sitting in the united states district court for the southern district of new york convicted paul bilzerian of securities fraud and conspiracy to defraud the united states.see united states bilzerian,cir opinion of cardamone,affirming the conviction.bilzerian was sentenced to four years imprisonment and fined million.id.following his conviction,the securities and exchange commission filed a civil suit against bilzerian in the united states district court for the district of columbia.that court ordered bilzerian to disgorge over million,representing profits from his fraudulent activities and prejudgment interest.sec bilzerian.ordering disgorgement of profits,aff sec bilzerian,wl june,setting value of interest.seven years later,with the judgment still unpaid,the district court found bilzerian in contempt of the disgorgement order,sec bilzerian,d,aff,established a receivership estate for the purpose of identifying,marshalling,receiving,and liquidating his assets,sec bilzerian,d,appointed appellee deborah meshulam as receiver,and sent bilzerian back to prison for continued noncompliance,sec bilzerian,d.
appellants puma foundation and loving spirit foundation are nonprofits directed by bilzerian wife,terri steffen.when the receiver discovered that bilzerian had a financial interest in the two foundations,which shared an address with the residence in tampa,florida,the district court froze the foundations assets and ordered them turned over to the court.sec bilzerian,may,order granting ex parte temporary asset freeze and other relief sec bilzerian,june,order granting preliminary possession.
later,in december,the receiver entered into a consent agreement with steffen,puma,and several other entities pursuant to which many of the funds and assets they once held and that were then in the court registry were to be transferred to the receiver.one such asset was a large block of stock in cimetrix,a publicly traded company once run by bilzerian.the agreement also called for the sale of the residence pursuant to the terms of a separate joint marketing agreement.steffen and the receivership estate would split the proceeds of the sale evenly.finally,the consent agreement provided that once the irs released the two foundations tax liabilities,their assets would be donated to the salvation army.
central to this case,one paragraph in the consent agreement called for the settling parties to execute a series of liability releases.steffen,a trust,and several holding entities agreed to execute releases in favor of cimetrix.the agreement also provided that cimetrix,though neither a party to the litigation nor a signatory to the agreement,would execute a release in favor of steffen,the entities,the foundations,and another entity in form acceptable to them.after the parties signed the agreement,cimetrix executed releases in favor of various not puma or loving spirit.
along with the consent agreement,the parties executed an escrow agreement.under that agreement,the receiver law firm,as escrow agent,would hold all documents not filed with the court until entry of the consent judgment.once the court entered a final judgment,the escrow agent would transfer certain documents,including the third party releases involving cimetrix,to counsel for the released parties.
acting pursuant to the consent agreement,the district court entered judgment in january.sec bilzerian.the judgment incorporated the consent agreement by reference,making its provisions orders of the court,slip op.at.finding the disgorgement agreed to by the parties sufficient to purge bilzerian contempt,the court released him from prison.id.
the consent agreement and judgment,however,failed to bring the receivership proceeding to a close.over a year after entry of the judgment,in march,puma and loving spirit sued cimetrix in the united states district court for the middle district of florida,alleging breach of contract and securities fraud.cimetrix raised several counterclaims,making its failure to release the foundations a matter of immediate concern to them.in a letter to receiver meshulam,steffen asserted that the consent agreement required the receiver to procure the unexecuted releases and demanded to know by the end of business that day whether the receiver would do so.reiterating her demand two days later,steffen added that t ime is of the essence because puma and loving spirit foundation will be required to incur substantial additional legal fees in the event i do not receive assurance from you by close of business today that the requested releases will be forthcoming shortly.hours later,steffen emailed an attorney for the receiver,threatening that if i do not receive the cimetrix releases by the close of business tomorrow,i will be forced to take drastic action.steffen added that she would,at the very least,be forced to assume that the entire settlement was the result of fraud on the part of the receiver and the sec and that the entire agreement should be rescinded.
in response,receiver meshulam filed a motion to enforce,asking the district court here to clarify whether she had any obligations with regard to the unexecuted releases and warning that steffen had a history of obstruction that made her threat of drastic action particularly serious.fearing that steffen might use the releases as an excuse to impede the sale of the florida property,the receiver also sought an order forbidding steffen from obstructing marketing efforts in certain specified ways.the two foundations responded that the consent agreement,properly interpreted,required the receiver to obtain the releases.acting alone,puma also moved to recuse the district judge,the honorable royce lamberth.puma sought recusal under both,which provides that a judge with personal bias shall cease presiding over a case when a party documents the bias in an affidavit,and a,which provides that a judge shall disqualify himself when his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.
judge lamberth denied puma motion to recuse.he found the section motion untimely and concluded that the section a motion fell short of the legal standard required for recusal.sec bilzerian,june.judge lamberth also granted the relief receiver meshulam requested,observing that nothing in the consent agreement gave the receiver any obligation to procure releases from cimetrix.sec bilzerian,slip op.at july.as the agreement explicitly assigned other obligations to named individuals and entities,judge lamberth added,it would have been equally explicit about the receiver obligation to obtain releases from cimetrix had the parties actually intended to assign her that task.id.at.
puma and loving spirit now appeal,arguing that the receiver lacked standing to bring her motion to enforce.on the merits,they argue that the district court incorrectly interpreted the consent agreement provision concerning the cimetrix releases.puma challenges judge lamberth decision not to recuse himself.we address each contention in turn.
nowhere in the motion to enforce,puma and loving spirit argue,does meshulam identify any provision of the consent judgment that the foundations violated.appellant br.at.according to the two foundations,the receiver filed the motion solely because the foundations threatened to take action.id.allegations of possible future injury,they conclude,do not satisfy the requirement of article iii.id.at quoting whitmore arkansas,d.this argument is frivolous.
to begin with,steffen threats to take drastic action,including rescinding the consent agreement if the receiver failed to procure the releases immediately,easily satisfy article iii requirement that alleged harm be actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.whitmore,at.at internal citations omitted.more important,we think the receiver did not even need article iii standing to pursue her motion to enforce.neither a plaintiff nor a defendant,the receiver functions as an arm of the court,phelan middle states oil,cir,appointed to ensure that prevailing parties can and will obtain the relief it orders,see generally james moore et,moore federal practice ed.a receiver authority,therefore,is defined solely by the order of the appointing court,id.b,which may provide for the administration of the receivership in any way it sees appropriate.id.a.the district court,moreover,retains equitable power to review the actions of a receiver.fed.home loan mortgage spark tarrytown,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in this case,receiver meshulam motion to enforce sought clarification of responsibilities imposed upon her by the district court in the consent judgment,a judgment that kept t he receivership orders in full force and effect,sec bilzerian,slip op.at.when steffen threatened to withdraw from the settlement agreement if the receiver failed to obtain the cimetrix releases,the receiver,seeking to preserve the agreement,asked the court for guidance on whether she had any obligation to obtain the releases.in doing so,the receiver was fulfilling her obligation to protect and preserve the receivership action that implicates no article iii considerations.in ruling on the motion,moreover,the district court exercised its extremely broad supervisory power over an ongoing receivership proceeding.sec hardy,cir.we thus turn to the foundations challenge to the district court interpretation of the consent agreement.
reviewing the district court decision de novo,richardson edwards,explaining that we review the interpretation of a consent agreement de novo,we agree that the receiver has no obligation to procure the releases from cimetrix.the agreement discusses releases only once,in paragraph thirteen.with respect to the specific releases at issue here,paragraph thirteen provides cimetrix will execute a release in favor of steffen,the entities,and the foundations in form acceptable to them.as the district court suggested,this language is unambiguous.sec bilzerian,slip op.at july.the clause says only that cimetrix will execute the releases.nowhere does it say that the receiver must procure the releases.in fact,even though other provisions of paragraph thirteen impose specific obligations on the receiver,the provision relating to the cimetrix releases makes no reference to the receiver at all.at oral argument,counsel for the foundations,maney,admitted as much as a matter of fact,he explained,there nothing in the text of the agreement that requires the receiver to get the release.tr.of oral arg.at.
in addition to running counter to the agreement text,the foundations interpretation makes no sense.receiver meshulam rightly points out that,as a fiduciary to the district court and the receivership estate,there is no reasonable basis to presume that the receiver could represent,in any capacity,the interests of the foundations,entities she had been investigating and as to which she was adverse.appellee br.at.moreover,nothing in the record suggest s that the receiver would have any understanding of the form,breadth and scope of releases the foundations wanted from cimetrix.id.at.
faced with these facts,the foundations offer four arguments for their interpretation of the agreement,none of which merits serious consideration.first,because nothing in the consent agreement requires them to release cimetrix,they ask,with what did the district court expect the foundations to negotiate with cimetrix appellant br.at.a release,however,is not the only consideration the foundations could offer in exchange for the release they seek.in any event,the foundations doubts about whether they can obtain a release fall far short of the evidence they would need to overcome the fact that nothing in the agreement requires the receiver to obtain it.second,claiming that the receiver was cimetrix controlling shareholder,the foundations argue that she was in a position to cause the releases to be signed by cimetrix.id.at.in the district court,however,the foundations offered no evidence to support this claim,and the receiver tells us that i n fact,the receiver is not a controlling shareholder of cimetrix.appellee br.at.insisting otherwise,the foundations attach cimetrix april,proxy statement to their reply brief,asking us to take judicial notice of it.appellant reply br.at.this argument is doubly waived not only did the foundations fail to present the proxy statement to the district court,see united states thomas,noting that when an argument was not raised below,we consider it waived,but as counsel should know,this court does not consider arguments first offered in a reply brief.see power of,ferc.the foundations final two they could not be obliged to procure the releases because the escrow agreement provides that the receiver law firm not the foundations was responsible for delivering the cimetrix releases to counsel for the foundations,appellant br.at,and that the district court should have conducted an evidentiary likewise waived.in the district court,the foundations neither relied on the escrow agreement nor pointed to any other extrinsic evidence that would have required an evidentiary hearing.see sec bilzerian,slip op.at july,noting that no extrinsic evidence has been offered to support the foundations interpretation of the consent agreement.
this brings us to puma motion to recuse.according to puma,a series of judge lamberth rulings,beginning over two years before the foundation filed its motion,show personal bias,requiring recusal under.puma also contends that the rulings would lead a reasonable person to question judge lamberth impartiality,thereby requiring recusal under a.
to recuse a judge under section,a litigant must submit,along with its motion,an affidavit stating the facts and the reasons for the belief that bias or prejudice exists.the affidavit,which shall be accompanied by a certificate of counsel of record stating that it is made in good faith,must be timely.id.crucial to the integrity of the judicial process,the timeliness requirement ensures that a party may not wait and decide whether to file based on whether he likes subsequent treatment that he receives.in re united shoe mach,cir.
puma submitted its motion in june,together with an affidavit from terri steffen and a certificate from attorney michael nelson.observing that approximately eight months had passed since the last of the rulings complained of,judge lamberth dismissed the motion as untimely.sec bilzerian,july.
this circuit has never articulated the standard by which it will review denial of a section motion to recuse.most circuits review for abuse of discretion.see,jones pittsburgh,cir united states owens,cir.others review de novo.see,united states sykes,cir.in this case,we need not decide which standard to adopt,for even reviewing de novo we can easily sustain judge lamberth decision.
although section requires the affidavit to be filed not less than ten days before the beginning of the term at which the proceeding is to be heard,unless good cause shall be shown,the statute says nothing about what the timeliness requirement means where,as in this case,the recusal motion rests on events occurring after proceedings began.in such circumstances,some courts have required the affidavit to be filed at the earliest moment,sykes,at citations omitted james district of columbia,d,quoting sykes,at.in the cited seventh circuit decision,an affidavit filed two months after the allegedly prejudicial statement was considered untimely.see sykes,at.sitting en banc,this court expressed serious doubt about the timeliness of an affidavit based on remarks the judge made more than two weeks before and a law review article he published more than a year earlier.smuck hobson,en banc.we have found no case,nor has puma cited one,permitting a delay as long as the one in this case,where puma waited two years after the first order it complains of and over six months after the last.
during its long delay,moreover,puma made over a dozen filings in the proceedings before judge lamberth,and consistent with the policy underlying the timeliness requirement,courts have observed that filing motions between the events complained of and submission of the affidavit weighs heavily against a finding of timeliness,smith danyo,cir.indeed,during the period of time at issue in this case,puma consented not only to have judgment entered against it,but also to the district court continuing jurisdiction.why,then,did puma wait so long to file its motion and affidavit was it waiting to see whether it like d the subsequent treatment that it receive d 
puma offers two entirely unconvincing explanations for its tardiness.first,it tells us that it could not seek recusal earlier for want of a situation it blames on the district court asset freeze.yet puma had counsel at various times between the events described in the steffen affidavit and the time it filed the affidavit.its assets,moreover,were not frozen during the five months immediately preceding the filing of the recusal motion.second,puma alleges that the receiver motion to enforce initiated a new proceeding,and that it moved to recuse as soon as that proceeding began.as we explained,however,the motion was part of the same receivership proceeding that had been ongoing for several years.supra at.given these circumstances,the motion and affidavit were plainly untimely.
section a permits a litigant to seek recusal of a judge in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.in assessing section a motions,this circuit applies an objective standard recusal is required when a reasonable and informed observer would question the judge impartiality.united states microsoft,en banc per curiam.because a judge must form judgments of the actors in those dramas called trials and render decisions based on them,rulings resting on record evidence almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion.liteky united states,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.o only in the rarest circumstances,the supreme court has warned,will rulings evidence the degree of favoritism or antagonism required to warrant recusal.id.at.at.finding that puma identified no bias approaching the level required for recusal,judge lamberth denied the foundation motion.we review a district judge refusal to recuse under section a for abuse of discretion.united states pollard.
in support of its claim that an objective observer would reasonably question judge lamberth impartiality,appellant br.at,puma points only to the judge rulings.the foundation alleges neither that judge lamberth relied on something other than the evidence before him,nor that the rulings reflect the kind of extreme bias that could provide a basis for recusal.see liteky,at.at.moreover,as puma counsel conceded at oral argument,the foundation never appealed the decisions it now claims are so biased.tr.of oral arg.at.given this,we have no basis for concluding that judge lamberth abused his discretion in denying the motion to recuse.quite to the contrary,as we shall now explain,his rejection of puma effort to recuse under both sections and was fully justified.
rule of the federal rules of civil procedure provides that in submitting motions and other pleadings,or defending them before the district court,attorneys vouch that the claims,defenses,and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,modification,or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.b.attorneys also warrant that the allegations and other factual contentions therein have evidentiary support.b.federal rule of appellate procedure provides that if the court determines that an appeal is frivolous,it may award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.under federal rule of appellate procedure,courts of appeals have authority to discipline attorneys who engage in conduct unbecoming a member of the bar if the attorney is a member of the court bar,the court has authority to suspend or disbar the attorney for such conduct.in filing the motion to recuse and appealing judge lamberth denial of it,we believe that attorneys michael nelson,who represented the foundations in the district court and who wrote and filed the appellate briefs,and david maney,who argued the case before us,may have run afoul of one or more of these rules.
to begin with,both the motion to recuse and this appeal are frivolous in two respects.first,as we have shown,the motion was not only untimely,but blatantly so.supra at.the case law,moreover,is clear enough that any reasonably diligent attorney should have known this.as we pointed out,no case we know of permitted a delay even remotely as long as the one at issue here.see supra at.given this,we can not imagine how attorneys nelson and maney could have thought that the delay in filing the motion was at all defensible.
second,the motion rests entirely on judicial rulings,which virtually never provide a basis for recusal.see supra at.indeed,we have found no case where this or any other federal court recused a judge based only on his or her rulings.at oral argument,maney conceded that he too knew of no such case.tr.of oral arg.at.the absence of such case law is hardly surprising,for if disqualification were required merely as a result of counsel disagreement with judicial conclusions reached in the course of litigation,the judicial system would grind to a halt.barnett city of chicago.indeed,even if a particular ruling or a series of rulings revealed bias,we doubt very much that a recusal motion would be proper where,as here,the movant could have appealed the challenged decisions but failed to do so.almost invariably,the supreme court has admonished,adverse judicial decisions give proper grounds for appeal,not recusal.liteky,at.at.
in addition to being frivolous,puma motion to recuse and its appellate by attorney nelson and defended in this court by attorney false statements.for example,the motion states that,without ever having met steffen,without steffen ever having been accused of any wrongdoing,without a shred of contradictory evidence or testimony,judge lamberth unilaterally announced that he would not believe any of steffen sworn testimony.puma foundation mem.in supp.of its mot.for recusal at.this accusation,reiterated virtually word for word in puma brief to this court,appellant br.at,relates to judge lamberth treatment of an affidavit steffen filed in support of bilzerian motion to purge his contempt.denying that motion,judge lamberth explained the court does not find the affidavit of terri steffen,filed with defendant certificate,to be credible t he wording used by steffen leaves much open to interpretation as to whether there are other documents that have not been turned over.sec bilzerian,slip op.at june,order denying motion to certify full compliance.contrary to puma allegations,then,judge lamberth did not say that he would not believe any of steffen sworn testimony emphasis added.he questioned only the credibility of the affidavit steffen filed with defendant certificate.nor did judge lamberth make this finding without a shred of evidence.the wording used by steffen,the judge explained,leaves much open to interpretation.
equally false are two statements about a temporary restraining order on november,without notice,without a hearing,and without providing puma an opportunity to be heard,judge lamberth unilaterally extended an existing tro until november.on november,in violation of rule b,which prohibits a tro from being extended more than once judge lamberth entered yet a third tro.puma foundation mem.in supp.of its mot.for recusal at see also appellant br.at repeating the allegations in virtually identical language.the facts,however,are quite different.in the november order,judge lamberth explained that an existing tro,entered a week earlier,would expire on november,noted that the receiver had moved to extend the tro,and ordered that puma file any response by november.sec bilzerian,no,order setting time to respond.when puma failed to respond,judge lamberth extended the tro
