this appeal involves the fairness of the attorneys fees the district court awarded the plaintiffs attorneys in a class action brought under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,by the victims of a ponzi scheme the ponzi scheme involved the sale of securities of corporations formed for the purpose of making loans to members of the public,who would pledge their automobile titles as collateral.the named plaintiffs and the members of their class are the purchasers of these securities the defendants are the issuer corporations and those entities and individuals who devised or facilitated the scheme.
the plaintiffs complaint,which was filed in the southern district of florida on february,alleged that the defendants fraudulently misrepresented that the proceeds of the securities the plaintiffs purchased would be used to fund the loans that were to be collateralized with the automobile titles,because the defendants intent was,instead,to divert most of the proceeds to their own uses.such fraud and the defendants misappropriation of investment proceeds,the plaintiffs alleged,violated the federal mail fraud wire fraud and money laundering statutes constituted racketeering activity under rico and rendered the defendants liable in treble damages.
during their investigation of the matter,the plaintiffs attorneys concluded that some of the funds obtained from the plaintiffs had passed through various bank accounts in the united states and the bank of bermuda cayman limited bank.counsel concluded that the bank had aided and abetted the defendants in their perpetration of the alleged fraudulent scheme and,thus,was answerable with the defendants in rico damages.counsel therefore amended the plaintiffs complaint to add the bank as a party defendant.
several months later,on june,plaintiffs counsel and the bank arrived at a settlement and entered into an agreement which called for the bank to pay the members of the plaintiff class million in exchange for releases of liability and the dismissal of the plaintiffs claims under the agreement,the bank would deposit this amount with phillip stenger,who,acting as the administrator of the settlement settlement administrator,would pay the class plaintiffs claims.after the parties submitted the settlement agreement to the district court for approval,the court held a fairness hearing.no one objected to the settlement,and the court therefore approved it.four days later,on october,the court entered an order dismissing the plaintiffs claims against the bank with prejudice in a final judgment entered pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.
the settlement agreement provided that the fees for the plaintiffs attorneys would be paid out of the million settlement fund.the court entered the final judgment dismissing the claims against the bank without fixing counsel fees apparently with the consent of the parties,the court deferred ruling on counsel fee application the court ruled on counsel fee application at the conclusion of a hearing in which it heard from the plaintiffs attorneys members of the plaintiff class counsel for the securities and exchange commission sec,which,as indicated below,was prosecuting a suit against the defendants other than the bank in the northern district of illinois and the appellants.after considering what they had to say,the court,on november,awarded plaintiffs counsel fees in the sum of million,which amounted to seventeen percent of the settlement fund.
phillip stenger,as receiver,two joint official liquidators jols of cayman islands companies and the cayman islands liquidations creditors committee creditors committee now appeal the district court attorneys fee decision in a joint brief,they ask us to vacate the district court fee award as excessive and to remand the case for further proceedings.the plaintiffs attorneys,as appellees,ask us to dismiss this appeal on the ground that none of the appellants has standing to prosecute it.
we conclude that the appellants lack standing to appeal and therefore dismiss the appeal without reaching the question of whether the district court abused its discretion in awarding the attorneys fees at issue.before setting forth the reasons for our conclusion,we think it appropriate to explain the various hats phillip stenger wears in this case,as receiver,as settlement administrator,and as jol.
on october,the sec brought a lawsuit in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois against the defendants with the exception of the bank named in the instant action its complaint described the same ponzi scheme described in the complaint in the instant case and sought relief under section a of securities act of sections b,a and c of the securities exchange act of and rule of the sec regulations securities and exchange commission homa.on november and december,the district court,with the consent of the defendants attorneys,entered orders granting the sec application for the appointment of a receiver of the receivership property of each of the defendants for the benefit of investors to marshal,conserve,protect,hold funds,operate and,with the approval of the court,dispose of any assets constituting the receivership property.the receivership property included all of the defendants assets.the two orders appointed phillip stenger as the receiver and gave him the authority to bring such legal actions based on law or equity in any state,federal or foreign court as he deems necessary or appropriate in discharging his duties as receiver on behalf of the estate of the defendants or on behalf of investors whose interests he is protecting.the orders also authorized him to employ his law firm,stenger stenger,of grand rapids,michigan,to represent him in march,the grand court of the cayman islands appointed stenger and james cleaver of the ernst young accounting firm as the jols of the cayman islands companies involved in the ponzi scheme.on september,stenger,acting as receiver of cash titles a defendant in the instant case,sued the bank in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois,stenger bank of bermuda.pending the bank motion to dismiss the action,the proceedings,including discovery,were stayed.stenger settled the case,releasing the bank from the receivership claims,as part of the settlement agreement the bank made with the class plaintiffs on june.with this history in mind,we address the plaintiffs attorneys motion to dismiss this appeal.
article iii of the constitution confines the reach of federal jurisdiction to cases and controversies.rivers coalition norton,cir quoting const.art.iii.
the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three requirements.first and foremost,there must be alleged and ultimately proved an injury in harm suffered by the plaintiff that is concrete and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,there must be fairly traceable connection between the plaintiff injury and the conduct of the defendant.and third,there must be likelihood that the requested relief will redress the alleged injury.this triad of injury in fact,causation,and redressability constitutes the core of article iii requirement,and the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing its existence.
steel citizens for a better environment,d citations and marks omitted.in addition to these three constitutional requirements,the supreme court has held that prudential requirements pose additional limitations on standing.for example,even when the plaintiff has alleged injury sufficient to meet the case or controversy requirement the plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights and interests,and can not rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.warth seldin,d.
litigants must establish their standing not only to bring claims,but also to appeal judgments.arizonans for official english arizona,d the standing article iii requires must be met by persons seeking appellate review,just as it must be met by persons appearing in courts of first instance.citations and marks omitted.though similar and overlapping,the doctrines of appellate standing and trial standing are not identical.see knight alabama,cir.the primary limitation on a litigant appellate standing is the adverseness requirement which is one of the rules of standing particular to the appellate setting.only a litigant who is aggrieved by the judgment or order may appeal.id.at quoting dairyland ins.makover,cir.unit.thus,it is entirely possible that named defendants in a trial proceeding,who would doubtless have appellate standing for the purposes of challenging some final rulings by the trial court,could lack standing to appeal other trial court rulings that do not affect their interests.
generally,one not a party lacks standing to appeal an order in that action.taylor ouachita parish school,cir.unit a but see in re subpoena to testify before grand jury directed to custodian of records,cir acknowledging that nonparties can sometimes intervene to appeal a judgment that would abridge another protected speech when those intervenors are potential recipients of the speech.
although several class members objected to plaintiffs counsel fee petition at the trial level,not a single class member appealed the final fee award ultimately issued.instead,the appellants consist of stenger,the jols,and the creditors committee.none of them were parties before the district court none moved the court for leave to intervene in the case for any purpose.when plaintiffs counsel learned that stenger planned to contest their fee application and attempted to discover the materials he might introduce at the hearing on their application,stenger objected on the ground that he was not a party in the litigation and hence was not subject to discovery under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.because he was not a party,stenger argued that to obtain the materials,counsel had to serve him with a subpoena under rule,which provides procedures for obtaining testimony or the production of potential evidence from nonparties.the jols,moreover,in a document filed with the district court,specifically identified themselves as non parties in this action.
in sum,if appellants became parties in this case,they became such solely because they voiced objections to the fees plaintiffs attorneys were seeking or because one of them was the receiver for defendants other than the bank.we conclude that neither of these circumstances made the appellants parties in this case.t he district court has great latitude in formulating attorney fee awards.gilmere city of atlanta,cir.in its discretion,the court could have permitted innumerable sources to inform its judgment,regardless of whether those sources were proper parties with a legal right to object.thus,the objections alone do not indicate party status.furthermore,there is no reason to suppose that stenger automatically became a party to the class action lawsuit merely by virtue of his role as the defendants receiver in a separate action see,d receivers the receiver does not,by virtue of his or her appointment,become a party to a pending action against the corporation or person for whose property the receiver is appointed,but is a stranger to the action until added or substituted by an order of the court wherein the action is pending.stenger has consistently represented himself as a receiver,not as a representative of the respective defendant entities.he has not been substituted for any defendant as a party,and there is no intimation that he appears for the defendants now in this appeal because this case provides no reason to depart from the usual rule against appeals by nonparties,see taylor,at,we find that the appellants lack standing to appeal the district court fee award.
in any event,the appellants lack injury sufficient to satisfy the requirements of article iii.this shortcoming would deprive appellants of standing even if,contrary to all appearances,they were parties to the trial proceeding.in other contexts,we have recognized that a defendant is not prejudiced by the settlement and therefore has no standing to complain about the settlement.in re beef industry antitrust litigation,cir.on the facts of this case,none of the appellants is responsible for paying the plaintiffs attorneys fees none would suffer any imaginable concrete injury if those fees were increased,nor would they enjoy any concrete benefit if those fees were eliminated altogether.instead,these hypothetical injuries or benefits would accrue to the class members themselves.the class members proved themselves capable of objecting to the fees at trial,and they elected not to appeal the fee award before this court.the appellants have no legal basis for waging a battle that the allegedly injured class members elected not to pursue.
appellants inventive attempts to squeeze an injury out of the fee award underscores the fault of their position.appellants first argument,presented in their joint brief,is founded on the principle that the class members can not recover twice for the same injuries thus,every dollar the bank pays to compensate the defrauded investors is a dollar for which the other defendants can not be liable.extrapolating from this principle,appellants argue that stenger,as receiver for the other defendants,is injured insofar as the receivership entities are subject to greater residual liability for every settlement dollar disbursed to the plaintiffs lawyers instead of the class members themselves.this argument achilles heel is its fatally questionable assumption that the class members purposes of prohibiting double recovery from defendants other than the measured as million less the attorneys fees,rather than as the whole amount the bank pays out to settle the claims against it.appellants fail to provide any support in the record or law for this assumption.the fact of the matter is that the class members receive two assets from the bank settlement cash compensation for their injuries and valuable legal services.the bank ultimately financed both of these assets in exchange for releases from suit.there is absolutely no reason to suppose that the bank has paid less or that the receivership entities remain liable for more simply because a percentage of the bank payout is allocated to attorneys fees.
although appellants do not identify stenger qua settlement administrator as a,they argue that in that capacity he is injured by the fees because greater fees mean that fewer funds come into his custody for distribution among the class members.this red herring fails to swim around the fact that the settlement administrator is simply that an administrator who performs nothing more than a mechanical function in distributing funds for the court.under the settlement agreement,stenger must deposit the funds in an bank account,separate from the other receivership assets.he has no duty or even discretion to deposit the funds in a investments in fact,he has no choice but to place the funds at a bank in illinois or michigan.he must disburse pro rata payments to the class members based on their claims against the bank,and he has no discretion to vary the percentage of recovery awarded among class members even within this narrow range of responsibility,the settlement administrator activities are subject to the court supervision all interest accrued on the settlement fund pending distribution accrues to the plaintiffs,not stenger.with respect to his own compensation,stenger is entitled to nothing more for his services than reimbursement for fees,costs and expenses incurred in connection with the administration of the settlement fund.this reimbursement,like all other aspects of the settlement administration,is subject to court approval.there is no reason to suppose,and appellants do not argue,that the administrator reimbursement will vary in proportion to the size of the fund after the plaintiffs attorneys fee has been deducted.finally,as settlement administrator,stenger will hold only the net settlement fund,which is defined in the settlement agreement as the bank total payout less the fees awarded to the plaintiffs attorneys.thus,the agreement does not entrust stenger with a specified sum from which fees will be withdrawn rather,stenger rol
