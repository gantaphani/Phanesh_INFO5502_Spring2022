the defendant,john larrabee,was convicted of securities fraud after a jury trial and sentenced to months imprisonment,followed by supervised release for a term of two years.he was also fined.on appeal,the defendant argues that his conviction should be reversed and his sentence vacated because the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law.finding the evidence sufficient to support the conviction,we affirm the district court.
we describe the facts briefly here,but delve into them in greater detail where necessary for our discussion.larrabee was employed as director of fiduciary services by the boston law firm of bingham dana gould bingham dana.larrabee,as director of fiduciary services,controlled the selection of stockbrokers for the placing of securities trades on behalf of the trust accounts managed by bingham dana.was employed as a stockbroker by painewebber,and larrabee directed a large share of bingham dana business to.and larrabee also shared a personal and financial relationship.
from almost december,until december,bingham dana represented bank of boston in connection with a potential merger with baybanks.this was a highly confidential transaction.though few attorneys at bingham dana were involved in the transaction,larrabee had daily contact with at least one,john brown.brown visited larrabee office frequently to check stock prices and monitor brown personal account.computer records indicate that larrabee opened brown account summary on larrabee computer at and on december.
at,one minute after opening brown account summary,larrabee placed a call to.the call lasted one minute and twelve seconds.immediately after larrabee call,called his trading assistant,krista floramo,and entered orders to purchase approximately shares of baybanks stock,priced at per share,for his own account and those of other family members and his girlfriend.when the trades were slow to be executed,he instructed floramo to call a painewebber trader in new york to urge prompt execution.remained on the line until the trades were executed just prior to the market close at.this particular purchase and trading pattern was unusual for.this purchase was nearly twice as large as his previous trades.moreover,floramo purchased shares of baybanks stock for her own account because of the unusual pattern of trades.to her knowledge,never had bought across all of his family accounts at once.
after the market closed on december,bank of boston and baybanks announced their merger.as a result of the merger,baybanks stock price increased by per share before the market opened on december.before the market opened on december,placed orders to sell all the shares he purchased the previous evening.realized a profit for those accounts of approximately.
painewebber attorneys questioned both and floramo about those trades.attempted to speak with floramo about her interview and unsuccessfully attempted to contact larrabee.larrabee and eventually spoke for approximately eight minutes on the morning of december.painewebber officials contacted a bingham dana attorney,gerald rath,to inform him of their suspicions and that larrabee name would likely surface in an sec investigation.bingham dana attorneys then spoke with larrabee about his contact with.
on june,a federal grand jury returned a indictment against,john larrabee and james,charging each with securities fraud in violation of b,a and aiding and abetting in violation of.the defendants were tried separately and both were found guilty on all counts.both filed notices to appeal,but has since withdrawn his appeal.
larrabee seeks to reverse his conviction,arguing that t he evidence was not sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that larrabee appropriated material nonpublic information such that he could have misappropriated that information.italics in original.he further argues that t he evidence was not sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that larrabee misappropriated material nonpublic information for use in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.
at the conclusion of the government case,the defendant moved for judgment of acquittal pursuant to.a.the defendant failed,however,to renew his motion at the close of his case,as is required.see united states concemi,cir when the defendant does not renew its motion for acquittal,it is considered waived.the jury returned a verdict against the defendant the defendant now challenges the sufficiency of the evidence.because the defendant failed to renew his challenge after the close of the evidence,we review his challenge on appeal for clear and gross injustice.united states stein,cir united states santiago,cir concemi at.even if the challenge were adequately presented,the evidence is more than sufficient to rationally support the verdict.
on appeal,we must determine whether the evidence,
taken in the light most favorable to the perspective that requires us to draw every reasonable inference and to resolve credibility conflicts in a manner consistent with the permit a rational trier of fact to find each element of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt.

the government brought this case under a misappropriation theory of insider trading.see united states,d.under a misappropriation theory,
a person commits a fraud in connection with a securities transaction,and thereby violates b and rule,when he misappropriates confidential information for securities trading purposes,in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information.under this theory,a fiduciary undisclosed,use of a principal information to purchase or sell securities,in breach of a duty of loyalty and confidentiality,defrauds the principal of the exclusive use of the information t he misappropriation theory outlaws trading on the basis of nonpublic information by a corporate outsider in breach of a duty owed not to a trading party,but to the source of the information.

the defendant argues that proof of opportunity or access to material,nonpublic information is not the same as proving actual possession.that is correct,but does not carry the day.while the defendant is correct that opportunity alone does not constitute proof of possession,opportunity in combination with circumstantial evidence of a and sequence of events,culminating with successful stock trades,creates a compelling inference of possession by the tipper.see,sec warde,cir sec singer,sec musella.
after reviewing the record,and resolving all doubts and credibility issues in favor of the government,sargent,at,we find that there was compelling evidence for a jury to determine that larrabee possessed material,nonpublic information.we examine myriad factors,including access to information relationship between the tipper and the tippee timing of contact between the tipper and the tippee timing of the trades pattern of the trades and attempts to conceal either the trades or the relationship between the tipper and the tippee.
the evidence presented at trial,when pieced together,painted a picture which allowed the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that larrabee possessed material,nonpublic information about the bank of merger.larrabee had the opportunity to access the in
