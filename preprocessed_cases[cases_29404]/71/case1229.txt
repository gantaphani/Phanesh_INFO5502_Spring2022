this appeal presents two issues,the first of which is an issue of first impression in this circuit whether the doctrine of in pari delicto bars a trustee claims on behalf of a bankrupt debtor for violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and whether the trustee can maintain a claim for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duties under georgia law.see a c.darryl laddin is the for ets,which operated a massive ponzi scheme that defrauded thousands of investors of hundreds of millions of dollars.laddin appeals an order that dismissed his complaint,under rico and georgia law,against entities that,laddin alleges,assisted ets in the operation of its fraudulent scheme.because the defense of in pari delicto bars recovery by a central and active violator of rico and georgia courts do not recognize a claim for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duties,we affirm the dismissal of laddin complaint.
background 
in his complaint,laddin alleged that in october,charles edwards formed ets payphones,a company that sold and payphones as investment opportunities.with edwards at its helm,ets devised a scheme where an investor paid a fixed sum to purchase a payphone,and ets leased the payphone back from the investor for a fee.ets represented itself as a no loss proposition and induced individuals to purchase the phones.although ets created marketing and promotional materials that promised returns of or,it consistently lost money on its payphone operations and continually had to attract new investors to meet its obligations to existing investors.w ith the sale of each phone,ets assumed a liability it could not satisfy.the operation of the program was a ponzi scheme that defrauded thousands of investors of over million.as the sole shareholder of ets,edwards transferred the proceeds from ets to himself or other companies he owned.
on september,ets filed for bankruptcy.the bankruptcy court allowed the creation of an official committee of unsecured creditors,and the debtors and creditors committee created the ets creditors litigation trust.the committee appointed laddin as trustee of the debtor estate.
laddin sued several defendants,including reliance trust,pensco,and community national bank,for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duties under georgia law,violations of section c and d of rico,c,d,and avoidance claims.reliance trust,pensco,and community national bank collectively,ira custodians are large holders of individual retirement accounts,and laddin alleged that these ira custodians aided ets in defrauding investors by funneling investor ira funds into ets payphone investments.laddin alleged that b y failing to conduct appropriate due diligence ignoring the facts altogether,t he ira custodians enabled thousands of investors to partake of the ets scheme and caused ets to incur millions of dollars in additional debt.
the ira custodians moved to dismiss laddin complaint.they argued that laddin,as trustee,could not maintain a claim of aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duties and the doctrine of in pari delicto,which provides that a wrongdoer may not profit from his wrongful acts,barred laddin claims.the district court granted the motions to dismiss.
before it addressed the merits of laddin complaint,the district court addressed laddin standing to sue.the district court concluded that laddin had standing to bring claims on behalf of the debtor,ets,but laddin did not have standing to assert claims on behalf of the creditors.the court reasoned that the creditors committee did not have the authority to assign the claims belonging to ets creditors and the trust agreement did not authorize laddin to bring claims on behalf of creditors.
the district court also concluded that the doctrine of in pari delicto barred laddin complaint.the district court found that,under georgia law,the wrongdoing of edwards as a sole shareholder was imputed to ets,the debtor corporation,under the sole actor rule.the court reasoned that,because the legal and equitable interests of the debtor in bankruptcy are only as strong as the debtor claim against defendants at the commencement of the bankruptcy,see a,the doctrine of in pari delicto barred laddin state law claims.the district court also held that the doctrine of in pari delicto barred laddin claims under rico.laddin appeals the dismissal by the district court.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews de novo the ruling of the district court on a motion to dismiss and construes the allegations in the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.jackson bellsouth,cir.a motion to dismiss should not be granted unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.conley gibson,d.
iii.discussion 
our discussion is divided into three parts.we first address the trustee argument that his complaint is not subject to a defense of in pari delicto that might have been asserted against the debtor.we then discuss whether the defense of in pari delicto can be asserted against a plaintiff who asserts violations of the federal rico statute.we finally consider whether the trustee can maintain a claim under georgia law for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duties.
a.the trustee is subject to the defenses that were available against the debtor.
the bankruptcy code provides that property of the debtor estate includes all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.a.legal interests or equitable interests include any causes of action the debtor may bring.official comm.of unsecured creditors lafferty,cir.a trustee,as the representative of the estate,succeeds into the rights of the and has standing to bring any suit that the debtor corporation could have brought outside of bankruptcy.first union bank,cir.the argument of the ira custodians that the wrongdoing of ets deprives laddin of standing to assert claims against them fails because a n analysis of standing does not include an analysis of equitable defenses,such as in pari delicto.lafferty,at.we agree with the district court that laddin had standing based on an alleged injury to the debtor estate,see id.at,but laddin standing to bring claims on behalf of the debtor estate does not mean that the debtor wrongdoing is immaterial.
laddin contends that his enforcement,as a trustee of the legal interests or equitable interests of the debtor estate,is not subject to the doctrine of in pari delicto.laddin argues that,because the doctrine of in pari delicto depends on the personal malfeasance of the individual seeking to recover,the wrongs of ets should not be imputed to him as the bankruptcy trustee.laddin asserts that his argument is supported by the legislative history to the bankruptcy code,which explains that t o the extent an interest is limited in the hands of the debtor,it is equally limited in the hands of the estate except to the extent that defenses which are personal against the debtor are not effective against the estate.cong.rec.
we need not resort to legislative history because the text of section a is unambiguous,and the language of our laws is the law.cbs,primetime joint venture,cir.under the plain meaning of section a,the debtor estate includes all legal or equitable interests of the debtor as of the commencement of the case.a emphasis added.a bankruptcy trustee stands in the shoes of the debtor and has standing to bring any suit that the debtor could have instituted when the debtor filed for bankruptcy,and there is no suggestion in the text of the bankruptcy code that the trustee acquires rights and interests greater than those of the debtor,at see also a.if a claim of ets would have been subject to the defense of in pari delicto at the commencement of the bankruptcy,then the same claim,when asserted by the trustee,is subject to the same affirmative defense.
even if we considered legislative history,laddin argument would fail.the portion of the legislative history on which laddin relies pertains to section d,not section a.section d governs p roperty in which the debtor holds only legal title and not an equitable interest,such as a mortgage secured by real property d.the portion of the legislative history quoted by laddin is inapplicable to the interpretation of property of the debtor estate under section a.see cong.rec.in the law of commercial paper,personal defenses are affirmative defenses that may not be asserted against a.see a,stating that a is subject to real defenses of duress,fraud in the factum,infancy,insolvency,and legal incapacity see also fdic wood,cir ronald anderson,anderson on the uniform commercial code,under the negotiable instruments law that preceded the code,the defenses were divided into real and personal defenses.in his complaint,laddin does not assert any rights either as a or under section d.laddin provides no support for his assertion that in pari delicto is a personal defense that is excluded from the debtor estate under section a.
our reading of the text of section a also comports with the purposes of the bankruptcy code.see demarest manspeaker,d stating that the text of the statute governs unless the result would be so bizarre that congress could not have intended it internal quotations and citations omitted.upon the commencement of a bankruptcy case,an automatic stay freezes the rights of parties to the bankruptcy,both debtor and creditors.a.the automatic stay and the definition of the debtor estate place both temporal and qualitative limitations on the reach of the bankruptcy estate.sender buchanan in re.assocs,cir see.under laddin erroneous interpretation of section,a postpetition event,the appointment of a trustee,could undermine the automatic stay and change the nature of the legal and equitable interests of the debtor estate.
laddin argues that his recovery would ultimately inure to the benefit of innocent creditors instead of the wrongful debtor,but he fails to account for the likelihood that individual creditors damaged by the debtor ponzi scheme could separately pursue claims against the ira custodians free from the bar of in pari delicto.if laddin were allowed to pursue the debtor claims,his recovery,on the one hand,would become part of the bankruptcy estate to be apportioned among creditors without regard to whether they were harmed by the ira custodians.see,b stating that the plan of confirmation must be fair and equitable with respect to each class of claims or interests.if creditors who were harmed by the ira custodians,on the other hand,sued separately outside of bankruptcy,then those creditors would not risk dilution through apportionment to senior creditors or unharmed creditors of equal priority.see id.prioritizing classes of claims.creditors whose legal interests were harmed by the ira custodians could rightfully recover more outside of bankruptcy because they would not compete with the trustee claims on behalf of the debtor estate.
we are not alone in concluding that the defense of in pari delicto may be asserted against a bankruptcy trustee.although this is an issue of first impression in this circuit,our sister circuits that have considered the issue have unanimously concluded that in pari delicto applies with equal force to a as a debtor outside of bankruptcy.see grassmueck am.shorthorn ass n,cir official comm.of unsecured creditors lafferty,cir terlecky hurd in re dublin sec,cir sender buchanan in re.assocs,cir see also official comm.of unsecured creditors of color tile coopers lybrand,llp,cir applying the defense of in pari delicto to bar texas law claims brought by.against this weight of authority,laddin urges us to chart a new course.
laddin erroneously relies on a decision of the seventh circuit and the perspective of a commentator to support his argument that in pari delicto does not bar recovery by a bankruptcy trustee.see scholes lehmann,cir jeffrey davis,ending the nonsense the in pari delicto doctrine has nothing to do with what is property of the bankruptcy estate,emory.laddin argues that the seventh circuit refused to apply in pari delicto to bar recovery for a receiver who brought a fraudulent conveyance action under illinois law,scholes,at,but laddin appeal is governed by the bankruptcy code,not the law of receiverships and fraudulent conveyances under state law.see knauer jonathon roberts fin.group,cir in re,at.fraudulent conveyances also are an exception to the general rule that the trustee takes the debtor estate as it is at the commencement of the bankruptcy.compare b providing that trustees may void prepetition fraudulent conveyances after the commencement of the bankruptcy with id.a providing that the debtor estate includes all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in the property as of the commencement of the case emphasis added.as for laddin other persuasive authority,the legal commentator makes the same flawed arguments about legislative history and the scholes decision that we have already rejected.see davis,supra at,see also tanvir alam,fraudulent advisors exploit confusion in the bankruptcy code how in pari delicto has been perverted to prevent recovery for creditors,am.
both the text and purposes of the bankruptcy code support the conclusion of the district court that laddin complaint is subject to the same defenses that were available against a complaint filed by the debtor at the commencement of the bankruptcy.the equitable defense of in pari delicto is available in an action by a bankruptcy trustee against another party if the defense could have been raised against the debtor.grassmueck,at citing lafferty,at.the next questions involve whether the defense of in pari delicto would have barred recovery by the debtor,ets,under either the federal rico statute or georgia law.we consider these questions in turn.
b.the doctrine of in pari delicto bars a rico claim by a conspirator.
laddin argues that the district court erroneously dismissed his rico claims because the defense of in pari delicto is not an available defense against the debtor.under rico,a ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section of this chapter may sue and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains c.section c of rico states,it shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise to conduct or participate in the conduct of such enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.id.c.conspiracies in violation of section c are also prohibited.id.d.
the doctrine of in pari delicto is an equitable doctrine that states a plaintiff who has participated in wrongdoing may not recover damages resulting from the wrongdoing.black law dictionary ed.this common law defense derives from the latin,in pari delicto potior est conditio defendentis in a case of equal or mutual fault the position of the defending party is the better one.bateman eichler,hill richards,berner,d.the doctrine of in pari delicto is based on the policy that courts should not lend their good offices to mediating disputes among wrongdoers and denying judicial relief to an admitted wrongdoer is an effective means of deterring illegality.id.the issue whether this defense bars a complaint under rico is one of first impression for our circuit.
the federal law of affirmative defenses governs the enforcement of causes of action created by federal statutes.see myers fdic,d.there is a paucity of federal caselaw regarding whether the doctrine of in pari delicto bars a complaint under rico,and none of our sister circuits have squarely decided the issue.see roma constr.arusso,cir whether or not there exists such an innocent party requirement is a question of first impression in this circuit and,indeed,we are not aware of any cases anywhere that adopt such a requirement.bontkowski first bank of cicero,cir considering whether the doctrine of in pari delicto barred a rico defendant for purposes of equitable tolling.
in two cases,the supreme court has considered the application of the in pari delicto doctrine in the enforcement of antitrust and securities laws.bateman eichler,d perma life mufflers,int l parts,d.although in both cases it declined to apply the doctrine of in pari delicto,the court explained that this or a related doctrine might
