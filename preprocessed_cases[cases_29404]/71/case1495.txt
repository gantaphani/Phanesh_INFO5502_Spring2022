this is an appeal from a final judgment of the court of chancery following a retrial of a statutory appraisal action.this matter arises from a merger of the minority shareholders of technicolor,technicolor,a delaware corporation.with approval from a majority of technicolor shareholders,macandrews forbes group maf merged its subsidiary,macanfor corporation macanfor,into technicolor.the only in this appraisal action is technicolor,the surviving corporation.the are cinerama,the beneficial owner of shares of technicolor common stock,and cede company,the record owners of those shares collectively,cinerama.the court of chancery valued each share at and entered a judgment in the principal amount of with and interest.
cinerama raises two arguments for our consideration.first,cinerama assigns several errors to the court of chancery appraisal of the fair value of its technicolor shares.second,cinerama argues that the court of chancery erred,as a matter of law,in awarding interest of compounded annually from the merger date until only august.
we conclude that the court of chancery valuation model is supported by record evidence and was the product of an orderly and logical deductive process.however,the court of chancery use of a discount rate and million corporate debt was contrary to the law of the case.a discount rate of and million corporate debt are required by the law of the case doctrine.this results in a per share value of and a judgment in the principal amount of.
we also find the law of the case doctrine governs cinerama entitlement to prejudgment interest.cinerama is entitled to prejudgment interest on this principal amount at compounded annually consistent with the initial determination of the court of chancery which awarded prejudgment interest until the date of judgment.
accordingly,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand with instructions to enter judgment consistent with this opinion.
this is the sixth appeal by cinerama relating either to its statutory appraisal proceeding the appraisal action or its shareholder rescissory damages lawsuit for fraud and unfair dealing the personal liability action.as the court of chancery correctly noted,the history of this sempiternal appraisal action is thoroughly recorded in the annals of delaware corporate law 
in the late summer of,maf sought to purchase technicolor.maf structured a deal where it would make a tender offer of per share for all of the outstanding common stock of technicolor,followed by a merger with the remaining outstanding shares converted into per share,with technicolor becoming the wholly owned subsidiary of maf.on october,the technicolor board agreed to the acquisition proposal made by maf.on that date,the technicolor board approved the agreement and plan of merger with maf,recommended to its stockholders the acceptance of the offer of per share and recommended the repeal of the super majority provision in technicolor charter.technicolor also filed forms and with the securities and exchange commission which reflected those board actions and recommendations.
in november,maf commenced an tender offer of per share to the shareholders of technicolor when the tender offer closed on november,maf had gained control of technicolor.by december,maf had acquired of the technicolor stock.thereafter,maf and technicolor were consolidated for tax and financial reporting purposes.
between the date the technicolor board agreed to maf acquisition proposal october,and the date the merger was accomplished january,maf made a strategic decision not to follow the kamerman plan.the court of chancery made a factual finding that,upon acquiring control of technicolor,perelman and his associates began to dismember what they saw as a badly conceived melange of businesses.maf then implemented the perelman plan,which would sell off four of technicolor unprofitable business units,thereby generating additional cash flow.
the merger was accomplished on january,at which time a merger occurred,converting all common stock not owned by maf into the right to receive in cash cinerama,dissented from the merger and sought a judicial appraisal of its stock under delaware appraisal statute.cinerama holdings represented of the total shares of technicolor outstanding.during pretrial discovery in the appraisal proceeding,certain deposition testimony caused cinerama to believe that the technicolor board violated their fiduciary duties in connection with the sale of the company.
as a result,on january,cinerama filed the personal liability action against technicolor,seven of the nine members of technicolor board at the time of the merger,maf,macanfor and ronald perelman collectively,the defendants.cinerama personal liability action alleged fraud,breach of fiduciary duty and unfair dealing.cinerama sought,among other things,rescissory damages the defendants in the personal liability action filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that cinerama had no standing to pursue such a claim after petitioning for an appraisal of its shares.the court of chancery denied this motion,but later ruled that cinerama would have to elect which cause of action it intended to pursue cinerama filed an interlocutory appeal to this court.in that appeal,this court concluded that the court of chancery erred,as a matter of law,in requiring cinerama to make an election of remedies before trial this court held that cinerama was entitled to pursue concurrently through trial its appraisal action and its personal liability action both actions were then remanded to the court of chancery for a consolidated trial 
following discovery and an extended trial which lasted,the court of chancery announced its first decision in the appraisal action.in a decision dated october,the court of chancery found technicolor fair value to be under the kamerman plan 
the court of chancery then issued its personal liability opinion,entering a judgment in favor of the defendants.in its opinion dated june,the court of chancery held that even if there was persuasive evidence that the technicolor board had not exercised due care in approving the merger,cinerama had failed to prove that it had been damaged in reaching this conclusion,the court of chancery relied on its earlier appraisal opinion.
cinerama appealed from the judgments entered in both the appraisal and personal liability actions.with respect to the personal liability action,this court affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded to the court of chancery for an application of the entire fairness standard to the challenged transaction,and to resolve additional issues relating to the duty of loyalty this court also noted that cinerama appeal of the court of chancery original appraisal decision was moot pending its resolution of the companion personal liability action 
on remand,the court of chancery concluded that the technicolor board met their burden of showing entire fairness the court of chancery entered judgment in favor of the technicolor board in the personal liability action.cinerama then filed its third appeal.this court affirmed the court of chancery final judgment dismissing the personal liability action this court reasoned that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the court of chancery finding that the deal price was the highest price reasonably available consequently,the appraisal action that remained in abeyance following this court remand in technicolor ii was no longer moot therefore,the only remaining issue was for the court of chancery to determine the fair value of cinerama shares and the appropriate interest to be awarded.
the court of chancery then entered a restated modified order and final judgment in the appraisal action on october.that judgment set the fair value of a share of technicolor stock at.that judgment awarded cinerama i the principal amount of ii interest on that amount at a rate of compounded annually from january,the date of the merger and iii interest thereafter,at the rate of simple interest,accruing only on the principal award of.
cinerama then filed its fourth appeal.in addressing cinerama appeal of the court of chancery appraisal decision,this court reversed,finding that the court of chancery improperly valued technicolor this court mandate required the court of chancery to value technicolor on the merger date as it was then operating pursuant to the perelman plan,rather than valuing technicolor under the kamerman plan the difference between perelman technicolor as of the merger date and kamerman technicolor as of october,was that the former operated pursuant to business plans and strategies focused on the processing and duplication of film and videotape and the provision of services to the united states government and which planned and expected to generate million in cash during from the sale of unwanted unsuccessful businesses,while the later business plans and strategies assumed diversification away from a concentration on film processing and videotape duplication for the professional market toward consumer oriented businesses 
recognizing that that dichotomy resulted in different factual assumptions being made by the parties respective experts this court held that the court of chancery had arrived at an understatement of technicolor fair value because it had valued technicolor pursuant to a discounted cash flow model with the negative factual input and assumptions from the kamerman plan rather than the perelman plan.that model was technicolor alcar model,which the court of chancery adopted as its valuation model this court held that when the court of chancery adopted the alcar model it excluded from its valuation calculus the value added to the going concern by the majority acquiror,including the value created by substituting new management and redeploying assets.quantifying the undervaluation,this court held that the court of chancery attribution of only a per share value difference between the perelman plan and the kamerman plan should not be considered the law of this case upon remand.
after this matter was remanded to the court of chancery,the chancellor recused himself sua sponte from further participation and the case was.the court of chancery then set forth its understanding of this court mandate and decided several significant procedural issues.specifically,the court of chancery decided to appoint a to serve concurrently as an independent expert witness on valuation matters and as a special appraisal master defer ruling on several issues presented by cinerama pursuant to court of chancery rule defer consideration of the admissibility under delaware rule of evidence and of technicolor expert opinion evidence from bruce klopfenstein,which cinerama had moved to exclude and rule that certain evidence was inadmissible to establish merger date value 
cinerama filed a motion in the court of chancery for certification of an interlocutory appeal.technicolor did not oppose that application.the court of chancery issued an order granting cinerama request for certification and this court accepted the interlocutory appeal.this court then reversed the court of chancery procedural guidelines,holding that a new trial was required to avoid prejudice,the court of chancery could appoint an expert witness but could not delegate authority nor appoint a special master for valuation purposes,the court of chancery must determine the reliability and relevance of an expert witness,and evidence of asset sales was admissible to show value as of the merger this court ordered the court of chancery to conduct a new appraisal trial 
the court of chancery correctly recognized that although a new appraisal trial was ordered,the law of the case doctrine still applied.with regard to the pre and interest award,the court of chancery decided that its prior ruling regarding interest at the rate of per year compounded annually was the law of the case however,the court of chancery determined that this interest was only to run from the merger date until august,which was the date of the original appraisal judgment 
the new appraisal trial was held in may.on december,the court of chancery issued a opinion valuing technicolor at per share on the merger date.both cinerama and technicolor filed motions pursuant to court of chancery rule,each addressing clerical errors made in the appraisal.the court of chancery,acknowledging these clerical errors,issued a corrected opinion on july,revising the valuation of technicolor to per share this resulted in a judgment in the principal amount of the court of chancery finally concluded that following august,interest should accrue at a rate of simple interest on the principal of the award only until the date of payment 
we will address first whether the court of chancery abused its discretion with respect to the other financial inputs used in its valuation model.we will specifically address cinerama request for this court to revise the court of chancery figures for vidtronics depreciations,newbury park revenue and material cost income spread,north hollywood footage and margin and technicolor fixed capital expense forecast.
the parties dispute the applicable standard of appellate review of a determination of fair value made by the court of chancery in a statutory appraisal proceeding.cinerama advances a de novo standard of review.it contends that the court of chancery committed legal error in determining the fair value of technicolor and therefore should not be accorded a high level of deference on appeal.the appellee,on the other hand,advocates for an abuse of discretion standard of review.
the determination of fair value in a statutory appraisal proceeding at the court of chancery level is accorded a high level of deference on appeal.this court reviews appraisal valuations pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard,so long as the court of chancery has committed no legal error the court of chancery abuses its discretion only if its factual findings do not have support in the record or its valuation is not the result of an orderly and logical deductive process 
this deferential standard of review is based on the recognition that the court of chancery,over time,has developed an expertise in statutory appraisal proceedings this court will defer to the court of chancery factual findings so long as they are supported by the record,even if this court might independently reach an opposite conclusion 
it is often the case in statutory appraisal proceedings that a valuation dispute becomes a battle of experts this is evidenced by the fact that the court of chancery is frequently presented with conflicting expert testimony.the court of chancery,as the finder of fact in an appraisal case,enjoys the unique opportunity to examine the record and assess the demeanor and credibility of witnesses thus,the court of chancery is the sole judge of the credibility of live witness testimony.this court will accept the court of chancery factual determinations if they turn on a question of credibility and the acceptance or rejection of particular pieces of testimony a factual finding made by the court of chancery based on a weighing of expert opinion may be overturned only if arbitrary or lacking evidential support this court will only make contradictory findings of fact when the findings below are clearly wrong and the doing of justice requires their overturn 
a less deferential standard of review applies to law of the case determinations.these determinations involve questions of law.a trial court application of the law of the case doctrine is therefore subject to de novo review 
we now turn to the merits of cinerama argument that the court of chancery abused its discretion with regard to several financial inputs.
vidtronics depreciation 
cinerama claims that the court of chancery ratio of vidtronics depreciation to fixed capital investments was logically impossible.cinerama points to the fact that for all other divisions of technicolor,the annual depreciation figure averaged of fixed capital investment.cinerama also points to the fact that vidtronics forecasted depreciation as a percentage of fixed capital investment varied between and from through.it contends that the only explanation for such a low percentage is when new equipment and machinery has a very long useful life,to years.cinerama maintains that in a business experiencing rapid obsolescence,like vidtronics business,a depreciation percentage in this range is logically impossible and is contrary to the nature of the enterprise.
cinerama position is refuted by the present record.the court of chancery findings for vidtronics forecasted depreciation were based on a historical ratio of depreciation to sales.this historical ratio reveals that vidtronics was able to accomplish the logically impossible feat of maintaining low depreciation to fixed capital expenditures.thus,the court of chancery findings did not constitute an abuse of discretion because they were supported by the record and were the product of an orderly and logical deductive process 
newbury park revenue material cost income spread 
cinerama also challenges the court of chancery valuation of newbury park.first,cinerama argues that the court of chancery miscalculated newbury park revenue based on a growth rate.it points to the fact that newbury park revenue in was.at a growth rate of,cinerama maintains that the forecast for newbury park revenue should have been.cinerama contends that the court of chancery erroneously used a figure for newbury park revenue forecast,which represented only a growth rate over and was too low.second,cinerama criticizes the court of chancery finding that,as of the merger date,newbury park would not continue to benefit from the material cost spread income stream.this income stream was attributed to rebates on raw material stock.
both of the court of chancery findings have support in the record.the court of chancery calculation of newbury park revenue was supported by technicolor management predictions for revenues from the cy plan the court of chancery used the cy plan in valuing every other technicolor entity.furthermore,the court of chancery conclusion that newbury park material cost spread income stream at the time of the merger would not be expected to continue was supported by evidence contained in the present record.first,the record consisted of testimonial evidence that the rebates on raw material stock was not expected to continue.second,the present record revealed that technicolor contract with warner brothers provided that warner brothers not technicolor was entitled to all discounts and thus had a right to all rebate income.finally,income from material rebates was not included in the cy plan for newbury park.thus,the court of chancery did not abuse its discretion in valuing newbury park.
north hollywood footage margin 
cinerama launches numerous attacks on the court of chancery valuation of north hollywood.despite its breadth,cinerama challenge essentially takes issue with the court of chancery reliance on the cy plan in valuing north hollywood.however,cinerama attack on the court of chancery valuation of north hollywood is foreclosed by its own admission that the valuation was based on evidence contained in the record.in its opening brief,cinerama concedes that the court of chancery relie d on technicolor cy plan for north hollywood because the court of chancery factual findings have record support,we will not independently make the contrary factual findings needed to support cinerama arguments.thus,the court of chancery did not abuse its discretion in valuing north hollywood.
technicolor fixed capital expenses 
cinerama finally challenges the court of chancery fixed capital expenditure inputs for technicolor on two grounds.first,it contends that while the court of chancery relied on the cy plan in all other respects,its fixed capital expense projection of million over the five year period of through was well in excess of the cy plan.second,cinerama argues that the court of chancery fixed capital expenditure inputs was in excess of certain contractual limitations.it bases this argument on the fact that technicolor controlling shareholder was contractually restricted to spend no more than million on fixed capital investments.cinerama challenges are not persuasive.
from forward,the court of chancery forecasted technicolor fixed capital expenditures based on a percentage of the following year sales for technicolor operating entities,with the exception of newbury park.for newbury park,the court of chancery based its forecast on the testimony of james wilson,a technicolor executive,as well as estimates from analysts,all of which stated that newbury park required additional capital expenditures to add to its capacity.for technicolor remaining divisions,the court of chancery relied on historical data to forecast fixed capital expenditures.the dramatic jumps in technicolor fixed capital expenditures from to were primarily attributed to newbury park,where that entity forecasted net sales increased greater than threefold.other causes for the increase in technicolor fixed capital expenditures forecast were attributed to vidtronics and north hollywood capital expenditures returning to their historical levels.the court of chancery made these findings based on evidence located in the present record.
cinerama attempt to limit technicolor fixed capital expenditures to a loan agreement restricting technicolor controlling shareholder to spend no more than million in fixed capital expenses is also improper.the court of chancery appropriately determined that these restrictions were not binding in perpetuity.these restrictions were capable of being amended or waived pursuant to contract.thus,the court of chancery did not abuse its discretion in forecasting technicolor fixed capital expenditures as its findings were supported by the record and were the product of an orderly and logical deductive process.
we must next decide whether the court of chancery erred,as a matter of law,by utilizing a discount rate and million corporate debt.cinerama argues that the court of chancery use of a discount rate and million corporate debt was contrary to the law of the case.as previously stated,our review of an application of the law of the case doctrine is de novo.
it is that when an appellate court remands for further proceedings,the trial court must proceed in accordance with the appellate court mandate as well as the law of the case established on appeal the trial court must implement both the letter and the spirit of the mandate taking into account the appellate court opinion and the circumstances it embraces.the appellate court opinion becomes part of the mandate,and the trial court must consider everything as one although the trial court on remand is not constrained by the mandate as to issues not addressed on appeal,the trial court is required to comply with the appellate court determinations as to all issues expressly or implicitly disposed of in its decision 
the law of the case doctrine embraces the same principles arising from the mandate rule the law of the case doctrine posits that findings of fact and conclusions of law by an appellate court are generally binding in all subsequent proceedings in the trial court or in a later appeal.the law of the case doctrine,much like the stare decisis doctrine,is founded on the principles of efficiency,finality,stability and respect for the judicial system the doctrine is meant to bring some closure to matters already decided in a given case by the highest court of a particular jurisdiction.under the principles governing the law of the case doctrine,a trial court may make any order or direction in further progress of the case so long as it is not inconsistent with the decision of the appellate court,as to any question not settled by the decision 
the law of the case doctrine,however,is not inflexible in that,unlike res judicata,it is not an absolute bar to a prior decision that is clearly wrong,produces an unjust result or should be revisited because of changed circumstances this court has recognized these three instances as exceptions to the law of the case doctrine 
in light of these governing principles,we turn to the issue of whether the discount rate and million corporate debt are the law of the case.if so,we must next determine whether any exception to the law of the case doctrine justifies the court of chancery use of a discount rate and million corporate debt at
