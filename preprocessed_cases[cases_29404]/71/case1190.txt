background 
in july,birnie davenport,botefuhr,davenport,and vestal aunt,gave a total of shares of hondo drilling company,hondo stock to botefuhr,davenport,and vestal,but she effectuated these transfers in two different ways.she entered into sales agreements with davenport and vestal,whereby she agreed to sell vestal shares of hondo stock and davenport shares.see estate of davenport united states,cir.the sales agreements valued the shares at per share.as consideration for the stock,birnie davenport received in cash from davenport and vestal,and davenport and vestal executed promissory notes in which they agreed to pay birnie davenport and,respectively,in twenty annual installments,beginning in july the agreements also required vestal and davenport to pay six percent interest annually on the unpaid principal.estate of davenport,at.
less than two years after the sale and over four years before davenport and vestal were to commence paying their promissory notes,birnie davenport forgave the balances remaining on the notes id.at.on march,birnie davenport filed a united states gift tax return in which she reported forgiving the promissory notes and,after applying various discount rates,reported and paid in gift tax liability.
birnie davenport transferred the hondo stock to botefuhr in a different manner.instead of entering a sales agreement,as she had with davenport and vestal,birnie davenport executed a deed of gift transferring to him shares of hondo stock.id.in the fall,botefuhr,davenport,and vestal signed an agreement in which botefuhr agreed to file any required gift tax returns and pay any gift taxes due with respect to the hondo stock he received from birnie davenport.id.botefuhr,however,never filed a gift tax return for this gift.
in,birnie davenport passed away.her last will and testament were admitted to probate in tulsa,oklahoma,and botefuhr,davenport,and vestal,were appointed by the probate court to act as representatives of birnie davenport estate the estate.while preparing tax returns for the estate,corinne childs,who had prepared tax returns for birnie davenport since,uncovered botefuhr failure to file a gift tax return for his shares of hondo stock.consequently,on november,childs filed a gift tax return for the gift to botefuhr,which both vestal and davenport signed,but which botefuhr did not.id.at at.the return valued the hondo stock at per share and reported a tax liability of,which the estate paid.id.
the irs subsequently audited this gift tax return and in the process concluded that the gift tax return underreported the value of hondo stock.in the process,the irs also concluded that the shares birnie davenport sold to davenport and vestal were also gifts,apparently because they were sold at a discounted price.consequently,on september,the irs sent the estate a notice of deficiency indicating a gift tax deficiency of and an addition to the tax of.at.on december,the estate,through vestal,filed timely petitions in the united states tax court challenging this deficiency determination.in the ensuing court proceedings,the estate again represented by vestal stipulated that for the purposes of th at case the fair market value of the hondo stock which was transferred by birnie davenport to patricia vestal,gordon davenport,and charles botefuhr was per share.vestal app.at.after holding a bench trial,the tax court concluded that the estate owed a federal gift tax deficiency in the amount of and a penalty of.at.the estate then appealed this finding to this court,and we affirmed.see id.at.
on march,the irs made an assessment against the estate for the gift tax deficiency and demanded payment the estate,however,did not pay the assessment.as of,the estate owed in gift tax liability,penalties,and interest.prompted by the estate failure to pay,the irs brought on february,the present action against the estate and also against botefuhr,davenport,and vestal in their representative and individual capacities.the underlying complaint contained three counts.count i sought to reduce to judgment the unpaid assessment levied against the estate.the remaining counts,however,sought to collect at least some of the outstanding gift tax liability from botefuhr,davenport,and vestal.count ii,for example,asserted that botefuhr,davenport,and vestal could be held liable for the unpaid gift tax as donees under b.similarly,count iii alleged that,as personal representatives of the estate,botefuhr,davenport,and vestal could be held responsible under for having distributed the estate assets prior to paying the gift tax liability,thereby render ing the estate insolvent and unable to pay the federal gift tax liability.
in the spring,botefuhr and davenport,both residents of texas,each filed motions pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure arguing that the suits against them should be dismissed because the district court lacked personal jurisdiction,an argument the court eventually rejected a year later.
on february,while the personal jurisdiction motion was still pending before the district court,the irs filed a motion seeking summary judgment on count i estate liability and count ii individual donee liability under,but declining to seek summary judgment on count iii liability as estate representatives.in its motion,the irs also argued that the appellants were precluded from litigating the value of the gift.in particular,the irs argued that botefuhr,davenport,and vestal individual tax liability should be determined using the per share figure stipulated by the estate via vestal in the prior litigation involving the estate.botefuhr,davenport,and vestal responded by filing a joint motion that sought summary judgment on count ii donee liability and count iii representative liability,but that conceded liability on count i estate liability.they also argued that they were not bound by the estate per share stipulation.in replying to the appellants joint cross motion for summary judgment,the irs expressly abandoned count iii,thus reducing the remaining issues in the case to one overarching substantive botefuhr,davenport,and vestal,as donees,could be held personally liable for the gift tax deficiency under b and a subsidiary botefuhr,davenport,and vestal were bound by the per share stipulation made by the estate before the tax court.
the district court concluded that the appellants could be held liable under b and that they were bound by the per share valuation.accordingly,the district court found botefuhr liability to be shares multiplied by per share,or.united states estate of davenport,d.the court calculated davenport and vestal liability in a similar manner,but then reduced their total liability by the amount they paid for the stock per share.id.thus,the court concluded that davenport,who received shares,owed,and that vestal,who was given shares,owed id.this appeal followed.

we review a grant of summary judgment de novo and apply the same legal standard as the district court.summary judgment is proper if the movant shows there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.when applying this standard,we view the evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.mitchell city of moore,cir other internal quotation marks and citations omitted.we review the district court jurisdictional ruling de novo and resolve all factual disputes in favor of the plaintiff.intercon,bell atlantic internet solutions,cir.
iii.personal jurisdiction 
we turn first to the threshold question of whether the district court erred in asserting personal jurisdiction over botefuhr and davenport.in rejecting botefuhr and davenport motions to dismiss,the district court relied heavily upon count iii of the irs complaint,which asserted that botefuhr and davenport violated by depleting birnie davenport estate of all its assets without satisfying the gift tax liability.march,order at.the district court concluded that because botefuhr and davenport had been appointed representatives of birnie davenport estate,they could easily anticipate being sued for a violation of in oklahoma for their conduct concerning the estate the court,however,found jurisdiction over the irs donee liability claim under in count ii far more problematic.nonetheless,the district court reasoned that if it possessed jurisdiction over the claim count iii,which went to botefuhr and davenport personal liability for their actions as representatives of the estate,it also possessed jurisdiction over the claim count ii,which concerned botefuhr and davenport liability as gift recipients,or donees.id.at,citing nelson greenspan.after making this finding,however,the court announced that it would reserve the right to review the basis for jurisdiction in later proceedings.
less than two weeks after this ruling,the government dropped the count.estate of birnie davenport,d at.consequently,the court dismissed this claim however,in that order the court refused to reexamine its personal jurisdiction ruling over the claim,and observed that because botefuhr and davenport had not presented any additional evidence negating its previous ruling that the government had made out a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction,it would decline to dismiss count ii for lack of personal jurisdiction.id.at.for the reasons discussed below,we conclude the district court committed reversible error.
general legal background 
unless congress specifically indicates otherwise,there are two limits on a federal court ability to assert personal jurisdiction.first,a federal district court may only exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant who could be subjected to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state in which the district court is located.k a.second,in addition to satisfying this state law requirement,the exercise of personal jurisdiction must not offend the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.far west capital,towne,cir.because this case comes from the united states district court for the northern district of oklahoma,we must apply oklahoma law.oklahoma,however,permits the exercise of any jurisdiction that is consistent with the united states constitution.intercon,at.consequently,whether the district court properly exercised personal jurisdiction over botefuhr and davenport,collapses into a single due process analysis under the constitution.rambo american southern ins,cir.
the due process clause permits the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant so long as there exist minimum contacts between the intercon,at quoting volkswagen woodson,d.depending on the level of contact,personal jurisdiction may be either specific,in which case personal jurisdiction is based on specific activities or contacts the defendant had with the forum state,burger king rudzewicz,d,or it may be general,in which case jurisdiction is based upon continuous or systematic contacts between the defendant and the forum state.rambo,at.under either theory of jurisdiction,the defendant contacts must be substantial enough so that exercising personal jurisdiction does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.far west capital,at quoting international shoe washington.this requirement will be satisfied where,after reviewing the defendant interactions and connections with the forum state,a court can conclude that the defendant has purposefully availed himself of the protection and benefits of the laws of the forum state.federated rural ins.kootenai,cir quoting burger king,at.
the irs does not claim that oklahoma courts possess general jurisdiction over botefuhr and davenport.nor does the government ever suggest that botefuhr and davenport,in their capacities as donees,reached out to oklahoma or otherwise availed themselves of the state laws.instead,it argues,as it did below,only that because the district court had jurisdiction over botefuhr and davenport for the alleged violation in their capacity as representatives of the estate,it also had jurisdiction over the claim,which it argues arose out of the same core facts.
pendent personal jurisdiction 
thus,the central jurisdictional issue in this case is one of pendent personal jurisdiction.pendent personal jurisdiction,like its better known cousin,supplemental subject matter jurisdiction,exists when a court possesses personal jurisdiction over a defendant for one claim,lacks an independent basis for personal jurisdiction over the defendant for another claim that arises out of the same nucleus of operative fact,and then,because it possesses personal jurisdiction over the first claim,asserts personal jurisdiction over the second claim.see,generally,charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice procedure ed linda sandstrom simard,exploring the limits of specific personal jurisdiction,ohio.in essence,once a district court has personal jurisdiction over a defendant for one claim,it may piggyback onto that claim other claims over which it lacks independent personal jurisdiction,provided that all the claims arise from the same facts as the claim over which it has proper personal jurisdiction.anderson century prods.
the concept of pendent personal jurisdiction traces its origins to federal question cases where state law claims were tacked onto federal causes of action under pendent or supplemental subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.though originally a concept,congress later endorsed and codified the concept of supplemental subject matter jurisdiction.see a t he district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.by contrast,pendent personal jurisdiction is not explicitly authorized by statute and remains,at least in the view of most commentators,a federal common law doctrine.miller wright,supra,at arguing that can not be read as authorizing pendent personal jurisdiction and explaining that the concept must be properly understood to be a federal common law doctrine.
however,the majority of federal district courts and every circuit court of appeals to address the question have upheld the application of pendent personal jurisdiction,and we see no reason why,in certain situations,the assertion of pendent personal jurisdiction would be inappropriate.see starlight int l,herlihy,d,explaining that every circuit court confronting the issue has upheld the principle of pendent personal jurisdiction wright miller,supra,at explaining that most federal courts that have dealt with the subject have adopted the pendent personal jurisdiction doctrine simard,supra,at nn.collecting cases and explaining how the majority of federal courts have upheld pendent personal jurisdiction see also robinson eng g.pension plan trust george,cir explaining that a district court properly invoked pendent personal jurisdiction over a rico claim that arose out of the same nucleus of operative fact as a federal securities claim esab group,centricut,cir analogizing to supplemental subject matter jurisdiction and adopting the doctrine of pendent personal jurisdiction iue pension fund herrmann,cir explaining that pendent personal jurisdiction may be invoked for related state law claims even if personal jurisdiction is not otherwise available oetiker jurid werke,collecting cases and adopting pendent personal jurisdiction clapsaddle telscape int l,d,applying pendent personal jurisdiction principles.like these courts and commentators,we agree that where claims arise from the same common nucleus of operative fact the inconvenience to a defendant is not necessarily sufficient to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.wright miller,supra,at.
of course,even where a court could legally exercise pendent personal jurisdiction over a claim,a district court retains discretion.see oetiker,at explaining that a district court has discretion over whether to exercise jurisdiction over the personal pendent jurisdiction claims wright miller,supra,at explaining that courts have the discretion to decline to exercise pendent personal jurisdiction.generally,when a district court dismisses the federal claims,leaving only supplemented state claims,the most common response has been to dismiss the state claim or claims without prejudice.ball renner,cir.indeed,while we have suggested that it is appropriate,perhaps even advisable,for a district court to retain supplemented state claims after dismissing all federal questions when the parties have already expended a great deal of time and energy on the state law claims,see anglemyer hamilton county,cir,we have held that,absent such a showing,a district court should normally dismiss supplemental state law claims after all federal claims have been dismissed,particularly when the federal claims are dismissed before trial.see ball,at sawyer county of creek,cir because we dismiss the federal causes of action prior to trial,we hold that the state claims should be dismissed for lack of pendent jurisdiction.these holdings draw support from supreme court precedent.see,cohill,d explaining that in the usual case a district court will or should dismiss state claims when claims have dropped out of the lawsuit in its early stages united mine workers of america gibbs,d certainly,if the federal claims are dismissed before trial,even though not insubstantial in a jurisdictional sense,the state claims should be dismissed as well.
we need not resolve the precise contours of pendent personal jurisdiction in this case.even if we assume that the count was a proper anchor claim and that the and claim arose from a common nucleus of operative facts,we hold that the district court abused its discretion by retaining jurisdiction over the claims after its pretrial dismissal of the count.
first,it is important to note that the district court considered its assertion of personal jurisdiction over the claim problematic from the start and only justified its decision to assert jurisdiction on the fact that it possessed personal jurisdiction over botefuhr and davenport on the count.moreover,even after reaching this conclusion,the district court reserved the right to review the basis for jurisdiction,particularly as to count ii.second,the anchor count,the alleged violation of,dropped out of this litigation before trial,estate of davenport,d at explaining that the irs withdrew count iii during summary judgment proceedings,and less than two weeks after the district court made its personal jurisdiction ruling.also importantly,this count disappeared from the litigation not because the district court found it to be without legal merit,but because the party asserting the withdrew it within days of the court using it as a basis for asserting personal jurisdiction.see also olin fisons plc,d,dismissing pendent personal jurisdiction claims after dismissing anchor claims.third,neither the district court nor the irs have identified any persuasive reason for retaining personal jurisdiction following the dismissal of the count.indeed,the irs merely reasserts that because the district court had personal jurisdiction over the claim,it also had jurisdiction over the claim,never discussing whether or how the legal analysis changed once the count dropped out of the litigation.similarly,the district court simply held that because no additional evidence had been presented on the personal jurisdiction question,it retained jurisdiction over the claim,even following the irs withdrawal of the claim.estate of davenport,d at.this conclusion,however,ignores the fact that once the count disappeared,there was no claim before the district court for which it could be said botefuhr and davenport had minimum contacts with oklahoma.
consequently,we reverse the district court conclusion that it had personal jurisdiction over botefuhr and davenport 
iv.liability under 
because we conclude that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over botefuhr and davenport,we do not address the other arguments they raised on appeal.therefore,the remaining question in this case is whether vestal can be held liable under for the estate gift tax deficiency.before the district court,botefuhr,davenport,and vestal filed a joint brief in which they argued that b personal liability provision has,like the lien provision,a limitation period,which has long since expired.alternatively,they contended that if b personal liability provision was not subject to a limitations period,it was governed by another provision of the irc,whose statute of limitations period has also lapsed.the district court rejected both arguments and concluded that a different provision of the irc,established the statute of limitations for holding donees personally liable for the gift tax.estate of davenport,d at.in addition to reasserting these arguments,vestal argues for the first time on appeal that the statute of limitations for bringing an action under has lapsed because returns filed by birnie davenport in the early placed the irs on notice of the gifts.given the posture of this case,we disagree.vestal argues,among other reasons,that the irs is prohibited from collecting the deficiency under because the relevant statute of limitations for bringing such an action has lapsed and because it would be inequitable.we disagree.
general legal background 
subject to various qualifications,the irc imposes tax liability on transfers of property by gift,estate of davenport,at see,and defines gifts as including transfers of property for less than an adequate and full consideration in money or money worth.id.b.generally speaking,the party that makes the gift,the donor,bears primary responsibility for paying any tax liability associated with the gift.see c the tax imposed by shall be paid by the donor.fletcher trust commissioner,cir the provisions of the act make plain that the liability of the donor is primary.
where,however,the donor completely fails to pay or only partially satisfies the federal gift tax,the recipient of the gift,the donee,can be held liable for the donor tax deficiency,at least to the extent of the value of the gift.dougherty,supra note,a,at see generally gregory byron,transferee liability under section defining the extent of a transferee liability for interest,idaho.section of the irc expressly establishes this transferee or donee liability for gift tax,mississippi valley trust commissioner,cir fletcher,at,and provides in relevant part 
u nless the gift tax is sooner paid in full or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time,such tax shall be a lien upon all gifts made during the period for which the return was filed,for years from the date the gifts are made.if the tax is not paid when due,the donee of any gift shall be personally liable for such tax to the extent of the value of such gift.
b emphasis added 
thus,provides both for a lien and it also makes a donee personally liable for any gift tax deficiency.courts have emphasized that this liability arises the instant the donor fails to pay the tax.see poinier commissioner,cir since a gift tax was due and unpaid,the donees are liable for its payment mississippi valley trust,at if the donor fails to pay the automatically imposed tax when due,in accordance with the statute,no matter what the reason for his failure,there is an immediate and direct liability on the donee for the tax,to the extent of the value of the gift.fletcher trust,at.moreover,the donee liability,though derivative in the sense that it arises only after the donor fails to pay the gift tax when due,exists regardless of whether the donor is solvent.la fortune commissioner,cir solvency or insolvency of the donor is immaterial baur commissioner,cir i t is wholly immaterial to the enforcement of the legal liability whether the transfers rendered the donor insolvent or whether he remained solvent during the period of his enforceable liability for the tax.indeed,once the donor fails to pay the underlying gift tax,the irs may elect to collect the tax from either the donor or the donee,and need not take any direct action against the donor before pursuing the donee.la fortune,at a ssertion of a deficiency against a donor is not required.see also mississippi valley trust,at explaining that the donee liability is not contingent or dependent upon a formal determination of deficiency against the donor or upon any other steps to collect from him fletcher trust,at neither do we think that notice to the donor is essential in order to maintain a proceeding against transferees.
courts have also held that under,a donee is liable,to the extent of the value of that donee gift,for any gift tax incurred by the donor during the year in which the donee received a gift,regardless of whether that individual donee gift actually contributed to the donor gift tax deficiency.as this court explained years ago,the statute clearly imposes liability on any donee gift during the year and hence the fact that the deficiency exists because of a gift to another makes no difference.la fortune,at see also want commissioner,cir friendly,explaining that a donee is liable not only for the tax owing on the gift to him but also for the tax due on all other gifts made by the donor during the calendar year baur,at same see also dougherty,supra note,at t he donor may also be held liable for the tax on gifts made by the donor in the same calendar year.
section lien limit as statute of limitations 
vestal initially argues that the irs can not pursue its action against her because the period for bringing a action has lapsed.in particular,vestal contends that the limit on special lien also applies to personal liability provision.as the irs concedes,the time period for enforcing lien has lapsed.see estate of birnie davenport,d at.contrary to vestal suggestions,we do not believe that the lapsing of lien provision prevents the irs from collecting tax deficiencies under the section personal liability provision.
section b draws a clear distinction between the special lien imposed on the gift received by the donee and the donee personal liability for gift tax incurred by the donor.the statute,for instance,creates in one sentence the special lien on the gifted property and then states in the following sentence if the tax is not paid when due,the donee of any gift shall be personally liable for such tax to the extent of the value of such gift.b.as outlined above,courts interpreting this provision have routinely analyzed the personal liability prong of independent from and without reference to the lien provision.see,la fortune,at mississippi valley trust,at baur,at see also tilton commissioner,wl it will be observed that the language of b imposes a lien upon any gift to secure payment of the tax and,if the tax is not paid when due,personal liability on the donee to the extent of the value of such gift.internal quotation marks deleted and emphasis added.
this distinction is significant,because b does not explicitly state a statute of limitations for a donee personal liability.moreover,the relatively few cases to have considered the issue suggest that the statute of limitations for the donee liability depends upon the statute of limitations for the donor liability so long as the government could bring a timely action against the donor,its action against the donee will be considered timely.united states wright,cir explaining that suits against persons derivatively liable for taxes are timely,or not,according to the rules for timeliness against taxpayers.the few courts that have considered this issue directly in the context of have looked at the generally applicable statutes of limitations created under and of the irc,and they have reasoned that if the suit would be timely brought against the donor under these provisions,it will be considered timely against the donee or transferee.see united states degroft,holding that established the statute of limitations for holding a transferee personally liable,not lien provision see also united states geniviva,civ,wl,at,same,aff,cir united states warner,civ lbs,wl,at,united states russell,civ.no,wl,at,holding that is the applicable statute of limitations to actions brought under a,and that an action timely brought against a transferor would be timely against the transferee,aff,cir acknowledging district court holding but noting that that holding was not at issue on appeal united states updike.holding that if the period of limitation runs in favor of the transferor,it has also run in favor of the transferees see also walter schwidetzky,heirs may face liability,tax for acct,the service must bring an action to collect the tax liability arising under a within the collection period specified in.
in pertinent part,of the irc provides that the irs must assess a taxpayer within three years after the return was filed.a.section,in turn,provides that the irs must collect any assessed tax by levy or by a proceeding in court commenced within ten years after the assessment of that tax.id.a.
in this case the parties concede,or at least have failed to contest,that the irs made a timely assessment against birnie davenport estate on march.estate of davenport,d at.as a result,the irs had until march,to commence a court proceeding to collect the gift tax liability from the estate,a.in fact,the estate conceded its liability for the gift tax before the district court id.at.therefore,because the irs is acting within the time period in which it could act against the donor,birnie davenport,its case against vestal as a donee is timely 
vestal only significant response is to argue that legislative history suggests that congress intended,through its lien provision,to provide a statute of limitations for the collection of taxes due on unpaid estate and gift taxes.in making this argument,she quotes the following from a senate report 
in general terms,these modifications are intended to represent a reasonable accommodation of the interests of the government in collecting the taxes of delinquent taxpayers with the rights of taxpayers and third parties.the modifications are concerned with the procedures for levying upon property of a delinquent taxpayer,the liability of lenders,sureties,for withholding taxes,the running of statutes of limitations in the case of delinquent tax liabilities,procedures arising out of,or with respect to the sale of property of delinquent taxpayers,the court procedures to be followed with respect to tax liens,and provision for the redemption of real property by the united states,where it is sold by a creditor with a higher priority.
the bill amends the provisions relating to the special liens for estate and gift taxes,first,to make it clear that these special liens are extinguished after the running of the period of limitations on the collection of the underlying estate or gift tax liability and,second,to extend to additional categories of interests the same protection against the special estate and gift tax liens which these interests are accorded by the bill in the case of the general tax lien.

we find vestal argument unpersuasive.as a general matter,we will not invoke legislative history absent ambiguity in the text of a statute.in re geneva steel,cir.yet even if we delve into the legislative history cited by vestal,we find her argument unconvincing for at least three reasons.first,courts that have examined legislative history have noted that it is of little aid in construing the statute.united states cleavenger,cir.second,the legislative history vestal refers even the cases she refers lien provision and make few,if any,references to the personal liability provision,much less the applicable statutes of limitations for that liability.see united states davis,cir focusing on lien provision cleavenger,at same.third,the language in the legislative history and statutory text that vestal emphasizes in her opening referring to the fact that the lien expires if the underlying gift tax becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time,b does not bolster her claim that the period created an limitations period.all this clause suggests is that if the underlying tax liability becomes unenforceable,the special lien duration is shortened.united states potemken,cir.accordingly,we reject vestal legislative history argument.
notice concerning gift to vestal 
vestal also devotes a substantial portion of her briefs to arguing that the irs is from collecting gift taxes because its assessment of liability against the estate was untimely,at least in regard to her gifts.she argues that the filing of the gift tax return by birnie davenport on march,was sufficient to begin the running of the statute of limitations with respect to any additional taxes that might be owed and resulting from the stock given to them individually.in essence,vestal asserts that because birnie davenport filed a gift tax return in reflecting the fact that she had forgiven the promissory notes vestal and davenport gave to her for the sale of hondo stock,the irs was also on notice of the gifts predicated on the undervaluation of the hondo stock at the time of the sale and should not have sat idly by when it ha d the necessary facts to collect the unpaid taxes.
vestal is correct that we have recognized that once a taxpayer has evinced an honest and genuine effort to satisfy the law by filing such a return,the a period begins to run.dowell commissioner,cir see also lucia united states,cir noting that the statute of limitations for collecting deficient taxes might begin to run when the irs has been informed by the taxpayer that there is,or might be,tax liability.vestal,however,is not entitled to assert this argument on appeal,because she never raised the argument below.see sac fox nation hanson,cir explaining that issues not raised before the district court will not be considered on appeal except for the most manifest error.indeed,in this case,the district court expressly noted that the parties had not challenged the timeliness of the irs assessment against the estate and that in previous rulings,the tax court had found the assessment timely estate of davenport,d at.
vestal would nonetheless have us exercise our discretion and address the issue she explicitly failed to raise below.see colorado interstate cit,cir.vestal attempts to overcome her default by arguing that the district court order unilaterally applied statute of limitations provision to this case,despite the fact that the irs never identified the statute of limitation period for bringing a personal liability action under b.
we are not convinced by this argument.in the joint brief filed with the district court,botefuhr,davenport,and vestal argued at length that the irs was from holding them personally liable for birnie davenport gift tax deficiencies.clearly,the claim that the irs knew in about the gifts of hondo stock but failed to act upon that knowledge until the,as vestal and davenport now claim,could and should have been raised below,regardless of the issue.additionally,we find unconvincing vestal claim that the district court invocation of changed the nature of this case,given that is a general statute of limitation provision and that prior courts have applied in the context moreover,as a representative of birnie davenport estate,vestal would,or at least should,have had every incentive to argue that the gift tax return filed by birnie davenport in triggered the statute of limitations provisions under and for bringing a claim against the estate vestal,along with botefuhr and davenport,after all,conceded the estate liability.
vestal also argues for the first time on appeal that she can not be held liable for any gift tax deficiencies because birnie davenport paid some gift tax in,and if the donor has paid the tax,even if deficient,the donee no longer has any liability.for the reasons outlined above,this argument fails because it is asserted for the first time on appeal.even if we were to address the claim,however,we would reject it.a straightforward reading of indicates that a donee is liable when a donor fails to pay the full gift tax owed,even if the donor has made a partial,yet deficient,payment or filed a tax return claiming that no tax is owed,as precedent establishes.berliant commissioner,cir upholding transferees liability for estate tax where estate filed an initial return,but irs subsequently concluded that return undervalued estate assets moore commissioner,cir upholding donee liability where donor made deficient payment wilkes united states,d,explaining that if the estate tax is not paid in full when due,then transferees shall be personally liable for such tax.
in summary,the district court properly concluded that the lien provision in b does not create a statute of limitations for collecting gift taxes from a donee under b.instead,case law supports the conclusion reached by the district court,that if an action could be timely commenced against a donor under the provisions of and,an action against the donee under b will be considered timely.
value of hondo stock 
at its core,this issue centers around whether vestal is bound by the estate stipulation during the tax court proceedings that the market value of hondo stock in was per share.see estate davenport,at estate davenport,tax.memo lexis,at.as discussed above,the value of hondo stock at the time of the transfer is important to botefuhr,davenport,and vestal case,because,generally speaking,a donee liability for a donor gift tax is capped by the value of the gift received.when determining vestal tax liability,the district court used the per share figure.see estate of davenport,d at based on the parties stipulation and the tax court ruling in previous litigation,this court adopts the value of the stock gifted by birnie davenport at per share.
on appeal,vestal advances various arguments for why she is not bound by this figure.in particular,she contends that the stipulation was limited to the tax court proceeding only and does not preclude litigation of that issue in this case.we agree.
as an initial matter,we note some confusion over whether the district court invoked the doctrine of claim preclusion or issue preclusion when concluding that the stock should be valued at per share.ultimately,however,we conclude that this matter must be evaluated as an assertion of issue preclusion,rather than claim preclusion.claim preclusion is inapplicable to the situation here presented.
