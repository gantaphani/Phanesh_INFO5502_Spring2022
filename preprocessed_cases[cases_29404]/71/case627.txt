the plaintiffs allege that belo engaged in a fraudulent scheme designed to inflate dmn circulation artificially in the face of a nationwide downward trend in newspaper circulation.belo allegedly paid bonuses for achieving circulation targets,rigged audits of dmn circulation,and implemented a policy that eliminated any incentive for distributors to return unsold newspapers.those actions,the plaintiffs claim,allegedly artificially increased recorded circulation,which led to higher advertising revenues for dmn and larger profits for belo.
on march,belo announced that dmn future circulation would be down on daily papers and on the sunday paper.on august,after the new york stock exchange nyse closed,belo issued a press release the press release that admitted that an internal investigation had revealed questionable circulation practices.
according to the press release,the allegedly fraudulent practices resulted in a daily paper circulation decline and a sunday decline.the press release noted that the declines were coupled with the circulation declines announced in march and with lower anticipated circulation for the next six months the total circulation decline from all of these announcements was predicted to be for the daily paper and for sunday.the press release also stated that belo would begin exercising more stringent control over possible improper manipulation of circulation.
