plaintiff edward dunn appeals the decision of the eastern district of virginia,rendered in february,dismissing his securities fraud claims against defendants borta,linzmeyer,and davis for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,see.b,and for failure to plead fraud with particularity,see id.b.dunn maintains that he was defrauded out of more than a dollars on his investment in ronbotics corporation and that the court erred when it dismissed the claims he asserted under the virginia securities act.as explained below,dunn virginia state law claims pass muster under the applicable pleading requirements,and we reverse and remand.
ronbotics corporation is a privately held virginia corporation founded to develop and manufacture electric motion platforms,used primarily in arcade games and training simulators.ronbotics was operated,in part,by the individual defendants ronald borta,its chief technology officer and chairman of the board leslie davis,its president and chief operating officer and peter linzmeyer,its chief executive officer collectively,the defendants 
in january,ronbotics approached edward dunn about investing in its business,providing him with a confidential information memorandum the memorandum describing ronbotics current and proposed product lines,business prospects,assets,and marketing strategy,and including financial reports and other information.the memorandum asserted that ronbotics has developed proprietary motion control technology currently embodied in its patented electric motion platforms and that t he low cost of ronbotics patented platforms is attributable to its proprietary mechanical and systems designs,proprietary software and trade secret manufacturing processes.
in addition,the memorandum made several representations concerning ronbotics business prospects.for example,it asserted that major manufacturers such as sega,namco,and gaelco were designing products using the ronbotics platform,and it specified the stage of development for each of these companies designs.the memorandum further asserted that ronbotics was involved in discussions with general electric and other major distributors regarding ronbotics products and that it had sold units of its principal product,the coasterider,prior to january.finally,the memorandum made projections about ronbotics future growth and asserted that the company was negotiating with a manufacturing facility in oklahoma to handle overflow production.
during the third week of january,dunn met with borta and linzmeyer to discuss his possible investment in ronbotics.at the meeting,which lasted several hours,dunn was asked to invest in the company by purchasing its stock at per share.when he expressed doubt that ronbotics stock was worth that price,linzmeyer and borta suggested that dunn instead purchase a convertible subordinated note issued by the company.dunn then voiced concern that ronbotics did not possess sufficient assets to satisfy such a note if the company went bankrupt.linzmeyer and borta responded that ronbotics owned two patents,one for a motion pinball machine and one for the electric motion platform used in the coasterider that the patents were worth millions that an outside investment firm had valued the patents at between million and million and that the patents were the company primary assets.when dunn inquired as to the protections ronbotics had in place to ensure that competitors did not misappropriate its technology,linzmeyer and borta represented that the company patents protected against such misappropriation.
on january,linzmeyer,on behalf of ronbotics,executed a convertible subordinated note the note by which ronbotics promised to pay dunn the principal sum of on january,plus ten percent interest per annum,payable on the first day of each calendar quarter.ronbotics made the note first required interest payment to dunn on april,but it failed to make any subsequent interest payments through october.exercising his rights under the note,dunn then demanded immediate payment of all principal and interest due thereon.the note was not paid,and ronbotics subsequently filed for bankruptcy in the eastern district of virginia bankruptcy court.
on june,dunn filed a complaint in the eastern district of virginia against ronbotics and the defendants,alleging violations of federal and state securities laws,common law fraud,and breach of contract.ronbotics did not enter an appearance in the action,but the defendants filed motions to dismiss pursuant to rules b and b of the federal rules of civil procedure on october,the court granted the motions to dismiss without prejudice,but authorized dunn to amend his complaint.
on october,dunn filed an amended complaint,naming the same defendants,which is the operative complaint in this appeal the complaint.the complaint made numerous factual allegations against the defendants.first,it alleged that the defendants had authored and approved the memorandum,which contained false and misleading statements in that it referred to ronbotics patented products,even though the patents were only pending when the memorandum was provided to dunn.complaint.the complaint further alleged that the defendants orally made false statements concerning the existence and value of the patents and failed to disclose that borta,the inventor,had retained certain reassignment rights in the patents.complaint.
next,the complaint alleged that the memorandum contained false and misleading statements regarding the status of ronbotics business.complaint part g.in particular,the complaint alleged that,contrary to the memorandum,sega,namco,and gaelco were not in the process of designing products using ronbotics motion platform.complaint.the complaint further alleged that ronbotics had never engaged in substantive discussions with general electric and had never been in serious negotiations with any other major distributors.complaint.also,according to the complaint,the memorandum falsely asserted that ronbotics had sold coasteriders,when in fact the company had not sold anywhere near that number prior to january.complaint.in addition,the complaint alleged that the memorandum provided misleading and unrealistic financial information.complaint.
based on its factual allegations,the complaint alleged eight separate causes of action.counts iii and iv are the only counts relevant here,as dunn has appealed only the two claims arising under the virginia securities act the act count iii alleged violation of sections and a of the act complaint.section prohibits selling securities by means of an untrue statement or omission of a material fact section a creates civil liability for the sale of a security by means of such an untrue statement or omission count iv alleged violation of section c of the act,which provides for control person liability for violations of section a complaint.
on november,the defendants again filed motions to dismiss pursuant to rules b and b.in opposition to the motions,dunn maintained that the act does not require proof of scienter,reliance,or causation.the district court declined to address this contention,stating instead that,even under dunn construction,the virginia statute requires a material misrepresentation.dunn ronbotics,at.the court went on to conclude that dunn had failed to allege a material misrepresentation because the fact that ronbotics patents were still pending constituted publicly available information that a reasonable investor would have considered.id.at.in addition,the court concluded that the claims against davis impermissibly relied on the concept known as group pleading rather than alleging specific actions on her part.id.at.on these bases,the court dismissed the complaint id.as noted,dunn appeals only those claims arising under the act,counts iii and iv we possess jurisdiction pursuant to 
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint pursuant to rule b.mylan,matkari,cir.we also review de novo a court dismissal on the basis of rule b,because lack of compliance with rule b pleading requirements is treated as failure to state a claim under rule b.harrison westinghouse savannah river,cir.
in assessing whether the district court erred in dismissing counts iii and iv of the complaint,we must first determine whether the complaint sufficiently alleges material misrepresentations on the part of the defendants,and we must then examine the defendants contention that we should imply elements of reliance and causation into the act.finally,we must assess whether the allegations against davis in counts iii and iv impermissibly relied on the group pleading presumption.as explained below,we reject the defendants contentions and conclude that counts iii and iv were erroneously dismissed 
we first consider whether the district court correctly concluded that the alleged misrepresentations were not material.in so doing,we recall that a fact stated or omitted is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable purchaser or seller of a security would consider the fact important in deciding whether to buy or sell the security or would have viewed the total mix of information made available to be significantly altered by disclosure of the fact.longman food lion,cir citing basic levinson,d gasner bd.of supervisors,cir see also tsc indus.northway,d setting forth total mix standard.
in applying this materiality standard,we must bear in mind that it does not require proof that an investor would not have invested had he known the truth rather,the reasonable investor standard requires a showing of a substantial likelihood that,under all the circumstances,the omitted fact would have assumed actual significance in the deliberations of the reasonable investor.tsc,at.in addition,we are mindful that,i n general,the materiality of a statement or omission is a question of fact that should normally be left to a jury rather than resolved by the court on a motion to dismiss.thus,we review the complaint only to determine that it pleads the existence of such statements and presents a plausible jury question of materiality.bielski cabletron,in re cabletron.secs.litig,cir internal citation omitted see also anderson clow in re stac elecs.secs.litig,cir.as explained below,we conclude that dunn has sufficiently pleaded misrepresentations that,if factually supported,would present a jury question as to their materiality 
first,a reasonable jury could conclude that the defendants misrepresentations concerning their ownership of the patents were material.the complaint alleges that the defendants represented to dunn that the patents were the most valuable and primary assets of ronbotics.complaint.a reasonable investor would undoubtedly attach significance to whether the company in question actually owned what it deemed its most valuable and primary assets,as opposed to merely anticipating owning them in the future.the belief that a company currently possesses property that,in fact,it only hopes to possess would cause a reasonable investor to misassess the risk of his potential investment.unbeknownst to dunn,he faced a substantial risk that ronbotics would never own its most valuable and primary assets that is,the patent applications could well have been rejected that ronbotics eventually obtained patent rights does not alter the fact that,when dunn was faced with the decision whether to invest,the company did not possess those rights.a reasonable jury could find that,to a reasonable investor,the knowledge that ronbotics risked rejection of its patent applications would have assumed actual and substantial significance.see tsc,at.
on the other hand,the defendants contend that the total mix of information available to dunn included the fact that ronbotics patents were pending at the time dunn made his investment,because such information was publicly available and readily obtainable.the act does not,however,impose any duty to investigate upon a purchaser,and the court thus impermissibly imposed a due diligence requirement upon dunn.
most importantly,the plain language of sections and a of the act does not impose on a purchaser of a security the duty to investigate a seller statements.section imposes no obligation on the buyer but merely declares it illegal,in the offer or sale of securities,to obtain money or property by means of a material misrepresentation.as for section a,the act requires simply that the purchaser not know of such untruth or omission.there is nothing in the act indicating that this phrase implies constructive knowledge as well as actual knowledge.the complaint,read in the light most favorable to dunn,alleges that he had no actual knowledge of the defendants misrepresentations,and the act does not impose a duty to investigate upon him 
our construction of the act is consistent with the manner in which other courts have construed similar statutes modeled on section a of the uniform securities act.for example,in midamerica federal savings and loan ass express,cir,the tenth circuit had occasion to construe section a of the oklahoma securities act.stat.ann.tit,a,a nearly identical statute to section a of the act.observing that s ection is designed to protect purchasers,the court concluded that the oklahoma statute required that the plaintiff demonstrate only a lack of actual knowledge of the misleading statement or omission,and it thus decline d to impute constructive knowledge of the information contained in the prospectuses to the plaintiff.midamerica fed.sav.loan ass n,at.
similarly instructive are judicial constructions of section of the federal securities act of,a,a statute substantially identical to section a of the act in wright national warranty,for example,the sixth circuit construed section to bar recovery only when a plaintiff has actual knowledge that a representation is false or knows that existing information has been withheld,cir.notably,the eighth circuit reached the same conclusion in alton box board goldman,sachs,in which it explained that t he district court conclusion that the plaintiff should have been aware from the public record of the financial condition of the company in which he invested and therefore was barred from recovery under clearly is not the law,cir see also haralson hutton group,cir noting that a purchaser who is actually ignorant that a seller representation is inaccurate or incomplete may recover even though the full truth is apparent from materials in her possession midamerica fed.sav.loan ass n,at a purchaser has no duty to investigate a seller possible fraud and need not verify a statement accuracy.casella webb,cir sanders john nuveen,cir hill york am.int l franchises,cir.in sum,we agree with these authorities and with the observations of a leading commentator on blue sky laws,joseph long,that t he investor has no due diligence obligation to make any investigation concerning the investment or to verify any information.the uniform securities act was intended to reverse the concept of caveat emptor and replace it with the concept of caveat venditor or seller beware.therefore,the investor is not charged with information which he might have acquired or with constructive knowledge.joseph long,blue sky law.
the defendants nonetheless maintain that our decision in phillips lci international,cir,mandates a contrary result and that the ruling of the district court should be affirmed.in phillips,we considered a situation in which the defendants had asserted that their company was not for sale when,allegedly,they were in ongoing negotiations to sell it.our distinguished panel explained that,i f what the defendant actually said here that the company was not for sale is examined in the context of all of the information publicly available,we believe that a reasonable factfinder could not conclude that the contested statement constitutes a material misrepresentation.id.at.based on this observation,the defendants maintain that phillips requires us to charge dunn with knowledge that the patent applications were pending.
a careful examination of the phillips decision leads us to conclude otherwise.first,the phillips plaintiffs did not assert state blue sky claims,but instead brought federal claims under section b of the securities exchange act of,b,and rule.such federal claims have no elements rather,they were judicially created see basic,at.and because the causes of action under section b and rule are implied,the responsibility of defining those claims rests with the courts.gerhard gohler,ira wood,utah.in this dispute,however,the cause of action has been created by the virginia general assembly and codified at section of the act.it would be inappropriate for us to augment a virginia cause of action with a requirement that does not appear on the face of the statute.see hutton rousseff,so d.
second,the consideration of all publicly available information was logical in phillips because there the plaintiffs were relying on a theory.id.at.that theory authorizes a plaintiff to demonstrate reliance as required for the federal claims at issue in phillips based on a presumption that he relied on the integrity of the market,as reflected in the company stock price.see longman,at.in such a situation,the reasonable investor is the market itself therefore,courts charge the market with knowledge of all publicly available information,because such information is exactly what affects the market price.see basic,at.this dispute differs significantly from phillips in that we are obligated to examine materiality from the viewpoint of a reasonable purchaser,not the market,and thus we need not deviate from our previous conclusion that dunn is not charged with knowledge of all publicly available information 
the complaint also makes allegations that,if sufficiently proven,would present a jury question concerning the defendants failure to inform dunn that it had reassigned its patent rights to borta.on may,unbeknownst to dunn,davis had executed an agreement to reassign on behalf of ronbotics.in that agreement,ronbotics,which had been assigned the patent rights to borta electric motion platform and control system,agreed to reassign those rights to borta upon the occurrence of any of a number of specified events.one such event was ronbotics defaulting on its obligations and seeking bankruptcy protection.the defendants failed to disclose to dunn that,if ronbotics were to file for bankruptcy,borta would regain all patent rights in the electric motion platform and its control system.a jury could conclude that this omitted information would have been significant to a reasonable investor,in that such an investor would consider whether,in the event of ronbotics bankruptcy,the company most substantial assets would be available for creditors such as himself.assuming dunn allegations are true,the defendants failure to inform dunn of the agreement to reassign thus presents a plausible question as to materiality.
the district court also decided that the defendants representations concerning ronbotics business prospects constituted mere puffery and were therefore insufficient to support an allegation of fraud.as the court observed,the judiciary has long distinguished between mere puffing statements utilizing opinion and exaggeration to pitch a sale,on the one hand,and factual statements that constitute fraudulent misrepresentations,on the other.the supreme court has explained that when a proposed seller goes beyond mere exaggeration of the qualities which an article has,assigns to the article qualities which it does not possess,does not simply magnify in opinion the advantages which it has but invents advantages and falsely asserts their existence,he transcends the limits of puffing and engages in false representations and pretenses.united states new farm home.reversing dismissal of indictment for fraudulent sales of swamp land in florida because misrepresentations did not constitute mere puffery see also miller premier,cir observing that an unspecific and false statement of opinion such as occurs in puffing generally can not constitute fraud.
in his complaint,dunn does not allege mere exaggeration and opinion,nor does he assert that the defendants promised him a great investment or an amazing return on his money.instead,dunn alleges very specific misrepresentations on the part of the defendants that ronbotics had sold coasterider units,complaint that sega,namco,and gaelco were designing products using ronbotics technology,complaint that ronbotics was in negotiations with general electric,betson,atlas,state sales,and other major companies,complaint that ronbotics planned to introduce in early a product simulating gravitational forces with two degrees of freedom,and would feature its motion theater with three degrees of freedom,complaint and that ronbotics was negotiating with a particular manufacturing facility in oklahoma to handle overflow production,complaint.these specific factual allegations regarding ronbotics business dealings and prospects are not simply sales pitches but rather can be proven true or,if properly supported,could be found material by a reasonable jury.see generally raab physics,cir declaring as inactionable puffery statements that company expected certain growth rate and was poised to carry that rate into future and distinguishing cooke manufactured homes,cir,in which we held that representations of specific business projects,including negotiations with insurance company that would act as guarantor,were actionable.counts iii and iv are therefore sufficient to state claims against the defendants under the act 
the defendants also maintain on appeal that,even if the complaint alleges material misrepresentations,the act should be construed as requiring both reliance and causation,which the complaint does not allege.as explained below,we are unable to construe the act as requiring these elements.
the necessary starting point for determining the elements of a claim under section a the text of the not include any reference to either reliance or causation.its only provision that could arguably be read to imply a requirement of reliance or causation is the phrase by means of an untrue statement.ann.a ii.and the pertinent authorities are to the contrary.first,according to the draftsmen commentary to section a,t he by means of clause is not intended as a requirement that the buyer prove reliance on the untrue statement or the omission.louis loss,commentary on the uniform securities act.we implied as much in johns hopkins university hutton,in which we rejected a causation theory as an impermissible attempt to introduce reliance as a necessary element of section,cir.in so ruling,we characterized as a similar ploy an argument that was summarily rejected in demarco edens,cir,in which the seller sought to defend on the ground that the sale was not by means of an offending circular.johns hopkins,at.
furthermore,as the seventh circuit has correctly explained,a lthough the by means of language in the statute requires some causal connection,the statute in question section imposes liability without regard to whether the buyer relied on the misrepresentation or omission.sanders,at.according to the supreme court,t here is,however,more than one way to demonstrate the causal connection.basic,at.in this situation,the connection is created through the privity required by section a,that is,that the seller of the security shall be liable to the person purchasing such security from him emphasis added.see gerhard gohler,ira,at privity establishes the necessary link between the alleged misrepresentation and the plaintiff injury and therefore serves the same purpose as the reliance requirement of common law fraud and the federal implied cause of action.the plain language of section a of the act therefore does not include the elements of reliance and causation.
indeed,the defendants do not contend on appeal that the statute explicitly contains these elements rather,they urge that these elements should be implied by the judiciary,asserting,i n the absence of legal precedent,appellees submit that both of these requirements should be implied into the virginia securities act.because the act fails to mention reliance or causation,however,it would be inappropriate for a court to imply them.see schmidt goddin,declining to read additional requirements into a statute because the court is not permitted to add words to a statute or to accomplish the same result by judicial interpretation 
even were we to view the statute as ambiguous on the issues of reliance and causation,we would be compelled to reach the same result.first,our construction comports with the purpose of the act,which is intended to protect investors from fraudulent sales of securities.pollok commonwealth.it is therefore proper to construe a statutory ambiguity,if any exists,in favor of the investor.
in addition,we have rejected similar contentions that the elements of reliance and causation should be implied into section claims,which are practically identical to section a claims.see supra note.in johns hopkins university hutton,we firmly rejected the suggestion that reliance was an element,explaining that,u nder section a buyer need not prove that he relied on the misstatement or omission.to say that purchaser reliance is a prerequisite to seller liability is to import something into the statute which is not there.at quoting woodward wright,cir see also caviness derand res,cir adalman baker,watts,cir.and other courts and commentators have reached the same conclusion with respect to similar adoptions of section a.see,in re westcap,cir texas statute gerhard gohler,ira,at utah statute hutton,so d at florida statute see also unif.sec.act,official cmt.unlike the current standards on implied rights of action under rule,neither causation nor reliance has been held to be an element of a private cause of action under the precursor to section b,section a,whose language is mirrored by ann.section.joseph long,blue sky law.we therefore decline to read the elements of reliance and causation into the act,and counts iii and iv are not deficient in that regard 
finally,we turn to the district court dismissal of counts iii and iv against davis on the basis of rule b.the court concluded that dunn allegations failed to meet the specificity requirements of rule b with respect to davis because,i n his amended complaint,dunn fails to plead how davis,individually,contributed to the alleged fraud,relying instead on impermissible group pleading.dunn ronbotics,at.on the contrary,the group pleading presumption sometimes known as the information presumption is not a prohibition on forms of pleading rather,it serves as a presumption that may be invoked in favor of a plaintiff.as the fifth circuit has explained,g roup pleading allows a plaintiff to rely on a presumption that statements in company generated documents represent the collective work of those individuals directly involved in the company daily management.schiller physicians res.group,cir see also decker,in re glenfed,secs.litig,cir.
we have never addressed the issue of whether the group pleading presumption should be recognized in this circuit and,because counts iii and iv satisfy the pleading requirements as to davis without reliance on the presumption,we need not decide that issue today.this approach was taken by the first circuit in bielski cabletron systems.there the court of appeals declined to address the question of whether the group pleading presumption should be applied because the complaint alleged that the officers and directors had access to information contrary to the company public statements,that they had participated in making the fraudulent statements and stock sales,and that they had signed certain forms.id.at.
similarly,counts iii and iv assert claims against davis,not solely because of her position as an officer of ronbotics,but because she was directly involved in making material misrepresentations to dunn.although dunn refers to borta,linzmeyer,and davis in form naming them the individual defendants,he clearly explains,e xcept where otherwise specified,individual defendants is to include each or all of these individuals.complaint.as a result,each allegation made concerning the individual defendants is a specific allegation against davis.and dunn explicitly alleges that the individual defendants participated in the drafting,preparation,approval of the written and oral statements complained of herein,such as the memorandum.complaint.like the officers in bielski,davis is alleged to have had access to contrary information and to have personally participated in making the misrepresentations.the complaint therefore provides davis with fair notice under rule b of the claims made against her in counts iii and iv,and they should not have been dismissed on this basis.
pursuant to the foregoing,we reverse the dismissal of counts iii and iv of the complaint and remand for such other and further proceedings as may be appropriate 
reversed and remanded 
because the misrepresentations on which edward dunn allegedly relied in investing in ronbotics corporation were not material and,in any event,did not cause dunn loss,i would affirm the district court dismissal of dunn complaint under federal rules of civil procedure b and b.
ronbotics was a small corporation formed to manufacture and develop electric motion platforms for arcade video games and training simulators.in january,ronbotics approached dunn about investing in ronbotics,giving him a confidential information memorandum about ronbotics business.the memorandum was a business plan for ronbotics that expressed its hopes and projections for profit,but it contained no traditional financial data,such as a balance sheet,income statement,or cash flow statement.moreover,the document stated on its face 
neither the company nor any of its respective affiliates,employees or representatives makes any representation or warranty,express or implied,as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information contained in this memorandum or any other information whether communicated in written or oral form transmitted or made available to prospective investors,and each of such persons expressly disclaims any and all liability relating to or resulting from the use of this memorandum or such other information by a prospective investor or any of their affiliates or representatives.
in addition to the memorandum,dunn had a single,meeting in late january with the principals of ronbotics,during which the principals expressed enthusiasm about their patented technology,which they said was worth millions of dollars and would justify dunn investment.they also expressed enthusiasm for the future of the company.based on the memorandum and the single meeting,dunn invested in ronbotics.he has alleged that in doing so,he relied principally on the value of the patented technology.his complaint asserts,dunn primary interest in ronbotics related to ronbotics patented technology,as represented by defendants.skeptical even about this value,dunn demanded a convertible subordinated note from ronbotics in the face amount of.
after ronbotics failed as a company,dunn commenced this action and alleged his reliance on five misrepresentations made by ronbotics in the confidential information memorandum and at the january meeting,characterized as follows 
first,linzmeyer and borta confirmed the existence of the patents and described them as two patents,one for a motion pinball machine,and the other for the electronic motion platform used in ronbotics principal product,the coasterrider.second,linzmeyer and borta stated on more than one occasion at the january meeting that the company owned the patents and had the assigned rights to them.third,linzmeyer and borta made numerous statements to dunn at the january meeting concerning the value of the patents,including the fact that they were worth millions,and that they had been valued between million to million.linzmeyer and borta told dunn that the value of the patents was based not only on their own opinion,but on the opinion of an outside investment firm that had valued the patents fourth,dunn also inquired of linzmeyer and borta at the january meeting what protection ronbotics had against a competitor misappropriating the ronbotics technology,and linzmeyer and borta replied that the ronbotics patents protected against such misappropriation.fifth,in describing the value of the patents and in relating to dunn the other assets of ronbotics,the individual defendants directly and implicitly represented to dunn that the patents were the most valuable and primary assets of ronbotics.
dunn then alleged that t
