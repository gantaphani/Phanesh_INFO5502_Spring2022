in this appeal,we consider whether benihana,was authorized to issue million in preferred stock and whether benihana board of directors acted properly in approving the transaction.we conclude that the court of chancery factual findings are supported by the record and that it correctly applied settled law in holding that the stock issuance was lawful and that the directors did not breach their fiduciary duties.accordingly,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
rocky aoki founded benihana of tokyo,bot,and its subsidiary,benihana,which own and operate benihana restaurants in the united states and other countries.aoki owned of bot until,when he pled guilty to insider trading charges.in order to avoid licensing problems created by his status as a convicted felon,aoki transferred his stock to the benihana protective trust.the trustees of the trust were aoki three children kana aoki nootenboom,kyle aoki and kevin aoki and darwin dornbush who was then the family attorney,a benihana director,and,effectively,the company general counsel.
benihana,a delaware corporation,has two classes of common stock.there are approximately million shares of class a common stock outstanding.each share has vote and the holders of class a common are entitled to elect of the directors.there are approximately million shares of common stock outstanding.each share of common has one vote and the holders of common stock are entitled to elect the remaining of benihana directors.before the transaction at issue,bot owned of the common stock and of the class a stock.the nine member board of directors is classified and the directors serve terms 
in,shortly after aoki married keiko aoki,conflicts arose between aoki and his children.in august,the children were upset to learn that aoki had changed his will to give keiko control over bot.joel schwartz,benihana president and chief executive officer,also was concerned about this change in control.he discussed the situation with dornbush,and they briefly considered various options,including the issuance of sufficient class a stock to trigger a provision in the certificate of incorporation that would allow the common and class a to vote together for of the directors 
the aoki family turmoil came at a time when benihana also was facing challenges.many of its restaurants were old and outmoded.benihana hired wd partners to evaluate its facilities and to plan and design appropriate renovations.the resulting construction and renovation plan anticipated that the project would take at least five years and cost million or more.wachovia offered to provide benihana a million line of credit for the construction and renovation plan,but the restrictions wachovia imposed made it unlikely that benihana would be able to borrow the full amount because the wachovia line of credit did not assure that benihana would have the capital it needed,the company retained morgan joseph to develop other financing options.
on january,after evaluating benihana financial situation and needs,fred joseph,of morgan joseph,met with schwartz,dornbush and john abdo,the board executive committee.joseph expressed concern that benihana would not have sufficient available capital to complete the construction and renovation plan and pursue appropriate acquisitions.benihana was conservatively leveraged,and joseph discussed various financing alternatives,including bank debt,high yield debt,convertible debt or preferred stock,equity and options.
the full board met with joseph on january.he reviewed all the financing alternatives that he had discussed with the executive committee,and recommended that benihana issue convertible preferred stock joseph explained that the preferred stock would provide the funds needed for the construction and renovation plan and also put the company in a better negotiating position if it sought additional financing from wachovia.
joseph gave the directors a board book,marked confidential,containing an analysis of the proposed stock issuance the transaction.the book included,among others,the following anticipated terms i issuance of of preferred stock,convertible into common stock ii dividend of iii conversion premium of iv buyer approval required for material corporate transactions and v one to two board seats to the buyer.at trial,joseph testified that the terms had been chosen by looking at comparable stock issuances and analyzing the morgan joseph proposal under a theoretical model.
the board met again on february,to review the terms of the transaction.the directors discussed benihana preferences and joseph predicted what a buyer likely would expect or require.for example,schwartz asked joseph to try to negotiate a minimum on the dollar value for transactions that would be deemed material corporation transactions and subject to the buyer approval.schwartz wanted to give the buyer only one board seat,but joseph said that benihana might have to give up two.joseph told the board that he was not sure that a buyer would agree to an issuance in two tranches,and that it would be difficult to make the second tranche.as the court of chancery found,the board understood that the preferred terms were akin to a wish list.
shortly after the february meeting,abdo contacted joseph and told him that bfc financial corporation was interested in buying the new convertible stock in april,joseph sent bfc a private placement memorandum.abdo negotiated with joseph for several weeks they agreed to the transaction on the following basic terms i million issuance in two tranches of million each,with the second tranche to be issued one to three years after the first ii bfc obtained one seat on the board,and one additional seat if benihana failed to pay dividends for two consecutive quarters iii bfc obtained preemptive rights on any new voting securities iv dividend v conversion premium vi bfc had the right to force benihana to redeem the preferred stock in full after ten years and vii the stock would have immediate as if converted voting rights.joseph testified that he was satisfied with the negotiations,as he had obtained what he wanted with respect to the most important points.
on april,abdo sent a memorandum to dornbush,schwartz and joseph,listing the agreed terms of the transaction.he did not send the memorandum to any other members of the benihana board.schwartz did tell becker,sturges,sano,and possibly pine that bfc was the potential buyer.at its next meeting,held on may,the entire board was officially informed of bfc involvement in the transaction.abdo made a presentation on behalf of bfc and then left the meeting.joseph distributed an updated board book,which explained that abdo had approached morgan joseph on behalf of bfc,and included the negotiated terms.the trial court found that the board was not informed that abdo had negotiated the deal on behalf of bfc.but the board did know that abdo was a principal of bfc.after discussion,the board reviewed and approved the transaction,subject to the receipt of a fairness opinion.
on may,after he learned that morgan joseph was providing a fairness opinion,schwartz publicly announced the stock issuance.two days later,aoki counsel sent a letter asking the board to abandon the transaction and pursue other,more favorable,financing alternatives.the letter expressed concern about the directors conflicts,the dilutive effect of the stock issuance,and its questionable legality.schwartz gave copies of the letter to the directors at the may board meeting,and dornbush advised that he did not believe that aoki concerns had merit.joseph and another morgan joseph representative then joined the meeting by telephone and opined that the transaction was fair from a financial point of view.the board then approved the transaction.
during the following two weeks,benihana received three alternative financing proposals.schwartz asked becker,pine and sturges to act as an independent committee and review the first offer.the committee decided that the offer was inferior and not worth pursuing.morgan joseph agreed with that assessment.schwartz referred the next two proposals to morgan joseph,with the same result.
