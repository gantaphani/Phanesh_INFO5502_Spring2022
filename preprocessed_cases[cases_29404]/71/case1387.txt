the notice provisions of the unclaimed property law do not require the controller to provide notice to apparent owners of escheated stock before the controller sells the stock.sale of escheated stock without notice to the owners does not violate the due process provisions of the federal or state constitutions.
factual,procedural and legal background 
gene harris,peggy lee dominguez,annette schoon,russ garcia and julianne jackson collectively,harris worked for gte corporation during the and.in june,gte merged with bell atlantic to create verizon.during the period march to september,harris and the others learned they owned stock in gte that had been transferred to the state of california and sold without their knowledge.they retained counsel,and an investigation revealed that gte had issued duplicate shareholder certificates and delivered them to the california controller.the controller records show the stock escheated to the state of california on november.the controller sold the stock,without notice to harris,and deposited the funds from the sale in the unclaimed property fund.the controller records show that harris,dominguez,schoon and garcia filed claims and,on various dates in,received payment for their shares of gte stock from the state of california.the controller has no record of any claim by jackson.
harris and the others filed a class action complaint against the controller,on september,they alleged the controller had a statutory obligation to provide notice to the stock owners,by direct mail to known owners and by publication,and failed to do so because of lack of resources and impracticality the controller taking and sale of the stock without notice and due process assertedly violated several provisions of the united states and california constitutions,california and federal securities laws,and the unclaimed property law code civ.as a result of the controller conduct,harris and class members were deprived of their shareholder rights and suffered significant monetary losses,including the growth in value of the stock and significant capital gain taxes triggered by the involuntary liquidation of their stock investments.harris sought declaratory relief,an accounting,injunctive relief ordering the controller to comply with the law and return the stock to harris and the other class members,and recovery of attorney fees.
the trial court granted the controller motion for judgment on the pleadings.the court concluded that the controller was required by law to sell the property the controller was afforded immunity for the sale and no notice of pending sale of securities was required under the unclaimed property law.judgment was entered in favor of the controller on june,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
harris alleges,and we assume for purposes of review,that the controller did not comply with the notice provisions of section of the unclaimed property law hereafter,upl.that section requires notice by publication,within one year of delivery of escheated property to the state,and in some cases requires notice by mail to the apparent owner.code civ.the controller failure to comply with section,harris contends,violates the owners constitutional rights and deprives the controller of the immunity from suit to which he would ordinarily be entitled under section of the upl.harris contentions are without merit.we first describe the statute in general terms,and then analyze harris claims.
statutory overview.
the upl establishes the conditions under which certain unclaimed personal property escheats to the state.the upl is not a permanent or true escheat statute.instead,it gives the state custody and use of unclaimed property until such time as the owner claims it its dual objectives are to protect unknown owners by locating them and restoring their property to them and to give the state rather than the holders of unclaimed property the benefit of the use of it,most of which experience shows will never be claimed.douglas aircraft cranston cal d,bank of america cory d.
the upl requires holders of unclaimed or financial organizations,business associations including corporations,and so file reports and to pay or deliver the unclaimed property to the controller.for example,a corporation such as gte is required to file a report and to transfer stock to the controller when the owner has not claimed a dividend or other sums or corresponded or otherwise indicated an interest in the stock for three years,and the corporation does not know the location of the owner at the end of that time,subd.b.the upl contains notice provisions,requiring the controller to publish notices and in some circumstances to mail notices to apparent owners.
article of the upl governs the controller administration of property after it is paid or delivered to the controller.dividends accruing on stock prior to its liquidation or conversion to money must be credited to the owner account,and the controller is required to sell escheated property.securities listed on an established stock exchange must be sold at prevailing prices on that exchange,subd.b.proceeds from the sale must be deposited in an account titled abandoned property in the unclaimed property fund,subd.a.
article of the upl sets forth procedures for filing claims.until recently,the controller was required to add interest to the amount of any claim paid to the owner for the time the property was deposited in the unclaimed property fund a person may file suit to establish a claim if he or she is aggrieved by a decision of the controller,or if the controller fails to make a decision on a claim within a specified time.
the controller failure to comply with statutory notice provisions does not operate to restrict his statutory duty to sell the escheated shares.
harris claims that owners of unclaimed stock are entitled to notice that the stock has escheated to the state before the state may liquidate or convert the stock into money.we conclude from our review of the statute that the notice provisions are neither substantively nor procedurally related to the sale provisions of the upl.that is,the controller compliance with the notice provisions of section is not a condition precedent to his statutory obligation to liquidate escheated personal property.this is apparent for a number of reasons.
first,no provision of the statute suggests the owner of unclaimed property that escheats to the state is entitled to an return of the property.indeed,the statutory objective of giving the state the beneficial use of the property effectively requires conversion of escheated property to cash.thus,the upl specifies that anyone claiming an interest in escheated property may file a claim to the property or to the net proceeds from its sale,subd.a.
second,the timing requirement in the notice provision,and the absence of any timing restriction in the sale requirements,likewise confirm the lack of connection between these two separate duties of the controller section,as it read in november when gte delivered harris shares to the controller,stated 
a within one year after payment or delivery of escheated property,the controller shall cause a notice to be published,in a newspaper of general circulation which the controller determines is most likely to give notice to the apparent owner of the property.
in addition,section then stated 
within days after payment or delivery of escheated property,the controller shall mail a notice to each person having an address listed therein who appears to be entitled to property of the value of dollars or more escheated under this chapter.
by contrast,section,as read in,provided that s ecurities listed on an established stock exchange shall be sold at the prevailing prices on such exchange.former code civ,stats,ch.no time constraint or other condition was placed on the controller obligation to sell escheated securities.thus the controller was given a year to publish a notice to owners of unclaimed property,but was free to sell the escheated securities at any time.neither section nor any other provision of the upl required the controller to wait any period of time after the publication or mailing of notice before
