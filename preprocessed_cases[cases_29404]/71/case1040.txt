matrixx initiatives,matrixx is a pharmaceutical company that sells cold products through its subsidiary,zicam,llc.one of its main products is zicam cold remedy,which comes in several different forms are lead plaintiff,pension fund,and named plaintiff,james siracusano,in a class action brought against matrixx and three matrixx executives collectively appellees under the private securities litigation reform act of pslra.appellants alleged that appellees violated the securities exchange act of by failing to disclose material information regarding zicam cold,that zicam causes a condition called anosmia,which is a loss of the sense of smell,in its users.the district court granted in part and denied in part appellees motion to strike portions of the complaint and granted appellees motion to dismiss the complaint and the action.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
on april,appellants filed a class action against matrixx and three individual johnson,matrixx chief executive officer,president and a director william hemelt,matrixx chief financial officer and executive vice president and timothy clarot,matrixx vice president and director of research and behalf of investors who purchased matrixx securities during the class period,october,to february.zicam cold remedy accounted for approximately percent of zicam sales during the class period.zicam cold remedy active ingredient is zinc gluconate and can be applied as a nasal spray or a gel.appellants alleged that appellees were aware that numerous users of zicam had developed anosmia,but that they failed to disclose the risk and instead issued false and misleading statements regarding zicam.
allegations of adverse information regarding zicam 
in december,alan hirsch,the neurological director of the smell taste treatment and research foundation,called matrixx customer service line to inquire into the amount of zinc contained in zicam nasal gel.cac.hirsch spoke with a landau and explained that at least one of hirsch patients had developed anosmia after using zicam.hirsch stated that other studies had indicated potential problems with intranasal application of zinc,and offered to conduct a clinical study on the issue.landau declined his offer.
in september,clarot,vice president of research and development,called miriam linschoten,of the university of colorado health sciences center.clarot contacted linschoten because a patient linschoten had treated for loss of smell following use of zicam also had complained to matrixx.linschoten expressed concern that zicam,an product,contained no warning that it could cause a loss of smell.clarot told linschoten that matrixx had received similar complaints from other customers as early as.linschoten asked whether matrixx had performed any studies,told clarot about existing studies linking zinc sulfate to the loss of smell,and offered to send clarot information regarding those studies.clarot replied that matrixx had not done any studies but that it had hired a consultant to review the product.cac.
on september,linschoten sent an email to clarot including abstracts on the link between zinc sulfate and the loss of smell.clarot called linschoten to ask if she would participate in animal studies to be conducted by matrixx,but linschoten declined because she focused on human,not animal,research.
linschoten,bruce jafek of the university of colorado school of medicine,and another colleague planned to submit their findings regarding ten patients who had developed anosmia following zicam use in a presentation to the american rhinologic society on september.on september,matrixx sent a letter to jafek stating that he did not have permission to use matrixx name or the names of its products in the presentation.cac.jafek asked for permission to use the zicam name,but matrixx refused.the presentation to the american rhinologic society accordingly was made without naming zicam.jafek findings regarding zicam were ultimately disclosed to the public on february,on good morning america.id.
as of april of,jafek had evaluated over cases of anosmia following zicam use.cac.linschoten had treated approximately such patients,all of whom complained of an immediate,severe burning immediately following use of zicam nasal gel,followed by a loss of smell.none of the patients had fully recovered.id.jafek and hirsch have observed that the zicam nasal spray does reach the upper area of the nasal cavity where smell reception occurs.
ii.allegations of misleading statements 
on october,matrixx issued a press release announcing that its net sales for the third quarter of had increased by over the third quarter of.johnson was quoted in the press release as follows 
the zicam brand is poised for growth in the upcoming cough and cold season with improved retail exposure by virtue of three new unique oral delivery forms of our zicam cold remedy product,the resumption of our television advertising campaigns in recent weeks and the momentum from last year successful season.additionally,our retail partners have come to rely on the zicam brand not only as an efficacious product for their customers,but also for the profitability that zicam branded products produce for their respective.
matrixx press release.appellants alleged that these statements were materially false and misleading because they failed to disclose appellees awareness of the material health risk that zicam posed to consumers.
on october,appellees held an earnings conference call,at which johnson expressed his enthusiasm for the most recently completed quarter and his optimis m about the future.tr.at.johnson explained that 
we have very strong momentum going into the upcoming cough and cold season.in addition,what lies behind these results is a unique product in the zicam product line,a product that offers a unique benefit,the ability for consumers to actually reduce the duration and severity of the common cold,not just mask the symptoms,and tremendous support that we are receiving from our retail customers.
id.at.johnson further expressed the expectation for the year that our revenues will be up in excess of and that earnings per share for the full year will be in the range.id.at.hemelt stated that the growth was driven by increased sales of all of our zicam products,explaining that approximately of the increase in sales was due to three new zicam oral cold remedy products,and that the remainder of the increase was due to increased sales of our other seven zicam products.id.at.johnson and hemelt then answered questions.
at one point,they were asked to make any comment on the litigation mtxx or its officers are involved in,or whether or not there is any sec securities and exchange commission investigation.id.at.they replied that t he officers of this company are not involved in any litigation,and that they were not aware of any sec investigation id.at.johnson concluded by reiterating the optimism we have for the future.id.at.there was no mention of the anosmia issue.
on november,matrixx filed its form report for the third quarter of with the sec.the section of the form that appellants alleged was false and misleading was this paragraph from the section on risk factors 
we may incur significant costs resulting from product liability claims 
we are subject to significant liability should use or consumption of our products cause injury,illness or death.although we carry product liability insurance,there can be no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to protect us against product liability claims or that insurance coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms.a product liability claim,even one without merit or for which we have substantial coverage,could result in significant legal defense costs,thereby increasing our expenses and lowering our earnings.such a claim,whether or not proven to be valid,could have a material adverse effect on our product branding and goodwill,resulting in reduced market acceptance of our products.this in turn could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
cac.appellants alleged that these statements were materially false and misleading because appellees failed to disclose that a lawsuit alleging that zicam caused anosmia had already been filed and,given the findings of the researchers at the university of colorado it was highly likely that additional suits would be filed in the future.id.
matrixx issued a press release on january,in which it upwardly revised its guidance for fiscal year.the company expects total revenues to grow by greater than percent compared to and fully diluted earnings per share to be in the range of to.cac.matrixx reported that t he increase in the guidance for reflects a much greater incidence of colds than previously anticipated.id.
on january,an article in the dow jones newswires reported that the fda was looking into complaints that an medicine manufactured by a unit of matrixx initiatives mtxx may be causing some users to lose their sense of smell.the article stated that t he fda interest follows at least three lawsuits filed by individuals against matrixx and zicam llc,a subsidiary,by users of zicam cold remedy.
appellants alleged that matrixx stock declined after this report,falling from per share on january,to per share on february.cac.
on february,matrixx issued a press release,respond ing to the dow jones in the money report fda looks into complaints about zicam,by carol remond,alleging that the fda is investigating consumer complaints regarding intranasal zinc loss of smell.matrixx press release.the press release stated 
matrixx initiatives,the manufacturer of zicam r cold remedy,is not aware of an fda inquiry into the safety of our intranasal products 
all zicam products are manufactured and marketed according to fda guidelines for homeopathic medicine.our primary concern is the health and safety of our customers and the distribution of factual information about our products.matrixx believes statements alleging that intranasal zicam products cause anosmia loss of smell are completely unfounded and misleading.
in no clinical trial of intranasal zinc gluconate gel products has there been a single report of lost or diminished olfactory function sense of smell.rather,the safety and efficacy of zinc gluconate for the treatment of symptoms related to the common cold have been well established in two,randomized clinical trials.in fact,in neither study were there any reports of anosmia related to the use of this compound.the overall incidence of adverse events associated with zinc gluconate was extremely low,with no statistically significant difference between the adverse event rates for the treated and placebo subsets.
a multitude of environmental and biologic influences are known to affect the sense of smell.chief among them is the common cold.as a result,the population most likely to use cold remedy products is already at increased risk of developing anosmia.other common causes of olfactory dysfunction include age,nasal and sinus infections,head trauma,anatomical obstructions,and environmental irritants.
the circumstances surrounding the development of remond column are extremely suspect.the article appeared online in public financial message boards almost immediately following its availability through the dow jones in the money service.at least one of these message board postings was made by a registered username frequently used by floyd schneider,a defendant currently being sued for defamation by matrixx initiatives.from at least august to the present,schneider has posted false and defamatory statements about matrixx on various internet message boards using a variety of anonymous aliases.it has come to our attention that schneider has also attempted to interfere with matrixx business by contacting our retail customers.
remond article appears on today dow jones very day that matrixx initiatives is deposing schneider.we believe that the timing of this article was manipulated by schneider to interrupt the deposition process.we know that remond and schneider were in close communication during the development of remond article and even discussed the disclosure statement detailing the basis for our suit against schneider,which has not yet been made public.therefore,it is particularly troubling that remond neglected to mention the defamation action or that schneider was one of her chief sources of information.we consider her failure to mention these facts to be a significant omission in fair and balanced reporting.
matrixx initiatives would like to underscore that we intend to vigorously pursue those individuals involved in any effort to improperly discredit the company and its products.furthermore,we strongly urge dow jones to open its own investigation to determine whether dow jones credibility was undermined by the use of copyrighted material in an attempt to do further harm to the value and reputation of matrixx initiatives and its products.
matrixx press release.appellants alleged that matrixx vigorous,but baseless,denials had their intended effect the stock price rose,closing at per share on february.cac.
on february,the television show good morning america did a report on matrixx zinc gluconate products and anosmia.reporter john ferrugia reported that jafek had treated more than a dozen patients and that four lawsuits had been filed,and others were being prepared.cac.appellants alleged that,i n response to the good morning america segment,the price of matrixx common stock plummeted,falling from per share on february,to close at per share on february drop of on unusually heavy trading volume.cac.
on february,matrixx issued another press release,describing the reports linking anosmia with zinc gluconate intranasal gels as completely unfounded and misleading.matrixx press release.matrixx assure d our consumers that zicam cold remedy intranasal zinc gluconate products are manufactured and marketed according to food and drug administration guidelines for homeopathic medicine.id.matrixx further asserted as follows 
in no clinical trial of intranasal zinc gluconate gel products has there been a single report of lost or diminished olfactory function sense of smell.rather,the safety and efficacy of zinc gluconate for the treatment of symptoms related to the common cold have been well established in two,randomized clinical trials.in fact,in neither study were there any reports of anosmia related to the use of this compound.the overall incidence of adverse events associated with zinc gluconate was extremely low,with no statistically significant difference between the adverse event rates for the treated and placebo subsets.
a multitude of environmental and biologic influences are known to affect the sense of smell.chief among them is the common cold.as a result,the population most likely to use cold remedy products is already at increased risk of developing anosmia.
a few researchers have attempted to link nasal products containing zinc to the onset of anosmia.however,this hypothesis is based on data from polio studies conducted in the using a concentrated zinc sulfate solution.current nasal products,such as zicam cold remedy,contain zinc gluconate,which is an entirely different compound.
matrixx press release.
on february,appellees filed a form with the sec,in which matrixx stated that it had convened a meeting of physicians and scientists to review current information on smell disorders.cac.the form stated that the meeting was in response to the september,presentation to the american rhinologic society.the form further stated that,i n the opinion of the panel,there is insufficient scientific evidence at this time to determine if zinc gluconate,when used as recommended,affects a person ability to smell.
on march,ferrugia,the reporter on the good morning america segment,reported on that matrixx now admit ted that they do know if their nasal gel could cause loss of smell.cac.the article stated that t he stunning information came after a investigation found that some consumers who have used zicam report the loss of smell.id.the article reported that matrixx initially told us its studies showed the product was safe,but that it would begin studies to determine if the product could cause the loss of smell.id.alteration in original.the article further provided as follows 
doctors at the university of colorado taste and smell clinic have an increasing number of patients who say they lost their sense of smell after using zicam intranasal gel,which contains zinc gluconate.bruce jafek has been documenting the cases from around the country,and there have been several lawsuits in at least five states.all along,matrixx initiatives,the maker of zicam,said the product was safe.but now it admits there are no studies dealing with the issue.in a filing to the securities and exchange commission on issues affecting stockholders,matrixx now discloses there is insufficient evidence at this time to determine if zinc gluconate,when used as recommended,affects a person ability to smell.what more,after our initial investigation,dozens of consumers have filed complaints with the food and drug administration.in response,the company formed a medical advisory panel in february.it says it will now conduct animal and human studies to further characterize these complaints.study findings are expected to be available in months.it seems to me that those studies should have been done before they put the product on the market,said jafek.
on march,matrixx filed its form with the sec,stating that numerous suits alleging that its zicam product s caused anosmia had been filed.cac.as of december,suits involving three users of the zicam cold remedy nasal gel products had been filed in various federal and state courts.id.appellants stated that,a ccording to matrixx own sec filings,from late through october matrixx has been sued by approximately individuals in different lawsuits alleging that zicam caused damage to their sense of smell,and included in the complaint a table detailing the lawsuits.cac.the table included suits filed on october,december,december,and january,as well as numerous suits following the close of the class period.
appellants alleged that the financial information contained in matrixx form filed on november,was false and misleading and violated sec rules and the generally accepted accounting principles gaap promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb.appellants asserted that,at the time matrixx filed the form,
matrixx should have disclosed,if not provided a reserve for,a potential contingency that had arisen related to safety issues concerning its products.during the class period,matrixx did not disclose that several lawsuits had been filed against the company,including one prior to the start of the class period,alleging that the company zinc products had caused plaintiffs to suffer from anosmia and that anecdotal evidence had surfaced questioning the safety of the company mainstay cold medication.the failure to disclose these known contingencies violated gaap.
cac.appellants listed the fasb rules violated by matrixx form and asserted that the undisclosed adverse information concealed by defendants during the class period is the type of information which,because of sec regulations,is expected by investors to be disclosed and is known by corporate officials to be the type of information which is expected to be and must be disclosed.cac.
appellants alleged that,a s a result of defendants materially false and misleading statements and failure to disclose adverse information regarding zicam,matrixx securities traded at artificially inflated prices during the class period.cac.appellants also alleged that,d uring the class period,defendants materially misled the investing public,thereby inflating the price of matrixx common stock,by publicly issuing false and misleading statements and omitting to disclose material adverse facts regarding zicam,necessary to make defendants statements,as set forth herein not false and misleading.cac.
in the section of the complaint entitled additional scienter allegations,appellants alleged as follows 
d efendants acted with scienter in that defendants knew that the public statements or documents issued or disseminated in the name of the company were materially false and misleading knew that such statements or documents would be issued or disseminated to the investing public and knowingly and substantially participated or acquiesced in the issuance or dissemination of such statements or documents as primary violations of the federal securities laws.as set forth elsewhere herein in detail,defendants,by virtue of their receipt of information reflecting the true facts regarding matrixx,their control over,receipt modification of the company alleged materially misleading misstatements their associations with the company which made them privy to confidential proprietary information concerning matrixx,participated in the fraudulent scheme alleged herein.
defendants were aware since at least september of,that numerous users of their zicam product had experienced a rare condition known as anosmia or loss of smell.findings of post treatment anosmia were reported by bruce jafek,miriam linschoten and bruce morrow of the university of colorado school of medicine,department of otolaryngology at a medical conference in september of.at the time,jafek had reported cases of anosmia after zicam use.as of april of,jafek had evaluated over such cases.on september,over one month before the start of the class period,matrixx informed jafek that as a legal matter he did not have their permission to use their company name or product trademarks in the poster reporting jafek research.in order to avoid threatened legal action from the company,jafek deleted any reference to zicam or matrixx from the poster which he used to present his research at a medical conference 
appellees filed a motion to strike any allegations that concerned user complaints and lawsuits that occurred after the close of the class period.the district court denied the motion in part and granted it in part.the court reasoned that the relevant inquiry was not whether there was a link between zicam and anosmia,but whether appellees knew that their statements were false at the time they were made.the court therefore denied the motion to strike as to the complaints and lawsuits that were filed because those allegations were relevant to appellees knowledge of user complaints.however,the court granted the motion to strike as to jafek ultimate conclusions,which were published after the close of the class period.
the district court then dismissed the complaint without prejudice,reasoning,that the allegations of user complaints were not material because they were not statistically significant.the court also found that appellants had failed sufficiently to allege scienter.
the court further stated that any amendment would be futile a bsent allegations defendants knew there was a definitive and statistically significant link between zicam and anosmia during the class period that was sufficiently serious and frequent to affect future earnings.the court therefore granted the motion to dismiss and dismissed the complaint without prejudice.the court then entered judgment,dismissing the complaint and the action without prejudice appellants timely appealed.
standard of review 
the district court dismissal for failure to state a claim is reviewed de novo.zucco partners,llc digimarc,cir.we accept the plaintiffs allegations as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.id.dismissal is inappropriate unless the plaintiffs complaint fails to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.id.quoting bell atl.twombly,d.

materiality 
appellants contend that appellees failure to disclose information regarding the possible link between zicam and anosmia constituted the omission of a material fact.an omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote.tsc,northway,d.
questions of materiality involv e assessments peculiarly within the province of the trier of fact.sec talbot,cir quoting arrington merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir alterations in original.thus,the ultimate issue of materiality is appropriately resolved as a matter of law only where the omissions are so obviously important to an investor,that reasonable minds can not differ on the question of materiality.tsc,at.quoting johns hopkins hutton,cir.
the district court summarized the allegations of links between zicam and anosmia for which defendants had knowledge as follows a phone conversation between a matrixx and university of colorado researcher discussing one anosmia complaint,a study recognizing a possible link,and a university of colorado study citing cases of anosmia in zicam users.district.order at.the court then found that appellants had failed adequately to allege materiality because the number of complaints of which appellees were aware was not statistically significant.the court relied on the statistical significance standard used by the second circuit in in re.securities litigation,cir,and in re.securities litigation,cir.we conclude,however,that the district court erred in relying on the statistical significance standard to conclude that appellants failed adequately to allege materiality.
the supreme court has rejected the adoption of a rule to determine materiality because t he determination of materiality requires delicate assessments of the inferences a reasonable shareholder would draw from a given set of facts and the significance of those inferences to him.basic levinson,d quoting tsc,at.second alteration in original.instead,courts should engage in a inquiry in assessing materiality.id.at.thus,d etermining materiality in securities fraud cases should ordinarily be left to the trier of fact.sec phan,cir quoting in re apple computer sec,cir see also joint council pension trust fund am.holding,cir declining to adopt a rule to determine materiality,engaging in the inquiry required by basic,and finding that the plaintiffs had sufficiently pleaded materiality.
in relying on the statistical significance standard to determine materiality,the district court made a decision that should have been left to the trier of fact.instead,we agree with the approach of the court in in re pfizer.securities litigation,d,where the united states district court for the southern district of new york rejected the defendant pharmaceutical company argument that the plaintiffs failed to plead materiality,which was based on the contention that three studies revealing adverse effects of the company drug were not statistically significant.the court reasoned that it can not determine as a matter of law whether such links were statistically insignificant because statistical significance is a question of fact.id.at.
thus,we are to engage in the inquiry required by basic.in doing so,we must take the allegations in the complaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable to appellants and determine whether the complaint fails to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.zucco,at internal quotation marks omitted.the following allegations in the cac go to the question of whether the information regarding the possible link between zicam and anosmia was information that a reasonable investor would have considered significant 
in december,hirsch called matrixx customer service line and reported one patient who had developed anosmia after zicam use and mentioned studies regarding intranasal application of zinc.
in september,clarot called linschoten because one of her patients had complained to matrixx about zicam and anosmia.clarot told linschoten that matrixx had received similar complaints from other customers since,and linschoten told clarot about studies linking zinc sulfate to loss of smell.
on september,linschoten sent clarot an email with abstracts on the link between zinc sulfate and the loss of smell.
in september,jafek presented findings about ten or eleven patients who suffered anosmia following zicam use.matrixx,through clarot,stopped jafek from using matrixx and zicam names in the presentation.
on october,two plaintiffs filed suit against matrixx in the united states district court for the western district of michigan,alleging that zicam caused anosmia.
on december,a plaintiff filed suit against matrixx in los angeles superior court regarding zicam and anosmia.
on december,another suit regarding zicam and anosmia was filed against matrixx in alabama state court and removed to federal court.
on january,five plaintiffs filed a consolidated suit against matrixx in the superior court of maricopa county,arizona regarding zicam and anosmia.an additional plaintiffs later joined this action,after the close of the class period.
by april,jafek had evaluated over cases of anosmia following zicam use,and linschoten had seen cases,although the time period of these allegations is not clear.
we believe that the foregoing allegations are sufficient to meet the pleading requirement under the pslra,which requires that 
the complaint shall specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information or belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.
b.the allegations in the cac are sufficient to meet that standard and,as well,to nudge appellants claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.twombly,at.appellants have sufficiently alleged materiality,and the district court finding to the contrary is reversed.
ii.scienter 
in order to plead scienter,the pslra requires the complaint to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b.the plaintiff must allege that the defendant had an intention to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.metzler inv.gmbh corinthian,cir quoting ernst ernst hochfelder,d.i n determining whether the pleaded facts give rise to a strong inference of scienter,the court must take into account plausible opposing inferences.tellabs,makor issues rights,d.the complaint will survive a motion to dismiss only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.id.at.this does not mean that a plaintiff must plead more than she would be required to prove at trial.id.at.rather,a plaintiff alleging fraud under b action must plead facts rendering an inference of scienter at least as likely as any plausible opposing inference.id.
to establish scienter,a complaint must allege that the defendants made false or misleading statements either intentionally or with deliberate recklessness.zucco,at quoting daou,at.we must first determine whether any of the plaintiff allegations,standing alone,are sufficient to create a strong inference of scienter.id.at.if not,we are to conduct a holistic review of the same allegations to determine whether the insufficient allegations combine to create a strong inference of intentional conduct or deliberate recklessness.id.recklessness is defined as 
a highly unreasonable omission,involving not merely simple,or even inexcusable negligence,but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,and which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it.
in re silicon graphics.sec,cir quoting hollinger titan capital,cir en banc.
the district court here concluded that the cac failed to allege the requisite scienter because it fails to allege any motive or state of mind with relation to the alleged omissions.in ord
