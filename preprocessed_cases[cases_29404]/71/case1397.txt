discussion 
i.the trial court refusal to grant appellant deferred entry of judgment.
appellant argues that the trial court erred by refusing to order deferred entry of judgment under rule and section et pursuant to section and rule,during the proceedings the district attorney filed a determination of eligibility for deferred entry of judgment that specified appellant met the eligibility requirements of the statute.the probation department and the district attorney,however,opposed deferred entry of judgment for appellant.following a hearing on the matter,the trial court agreed with the probation department and found appellant unsuitable to participate in the deferred entry of judgment program.appellant complains that the court disregarded the statutory criteria,failed to give consideration to crucial factors,and improperly relied upon the district attorney speculation and mischaracterizations in denying him the benefit of deferred entry of judgment.he argues that since he met all the requirements specified by rule,the juvenile court abused its discretion and erred by denying deferred entry of judgment.
our first task is to determine whether,as appellant seems to suggest,failure to grant deferred entry of judgment is error if the minor meets the articulated statutory eligibility requirements.we must interpret the statutes to ascertain the intent of the legislative body so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.people jefferson cal th,d,people dyer th,d.penal code sections must generally be construed according to the fair import of their terms,with a view to effect its objects and to promote justice.citations.consistent with that general principle,appellate courts first examine the language of the code section to determine whether the words used unequivocally express the legislature intent.if no ambiguity,uncertainty,or doubt about the meaning of the statute appear,the provision is to be applied according to its terms without further judicial construction.citations.when the language of the section is on its face ambiguous or leaves doubt,the court must resort to extrinsic aids to ascertain the purpose behind the statute and give the provision a judicially created meaning commensurate with the purpose.citation.citations.citation.people franz th,d see also people avila th,d.our interpretation of the statutory requirements for deferred entry of judgment is guided by settled principles.w e look first to the plain meaning of the statute.if the statute meaning is ambiguous,we turn to the voters intent and,finally,if the voters intent is not clear,construe the statute most favorably to the offender.people superior court henkel th,d.
whether a particular statute is intended to impose a mandatory duty,rather than a mere obligation to perform a discretionary function,is a question of statutory interpretation for the courts.citation.the enactment language is,of course,a most important guide in determining legislative intent,but there are unquestionably instances in which other factors will indicate that apparent obligatory language was not intended to foreclose a governmental entity or officer exercise of discretion.citation.haggis city of los angeles cal th,d.
nothing in the statutory language indicates to us an intent to require the juvenile court to grant deferred entry of judgment if the circumstances specified in section and rule are found to exist to the contrary,the statutes invariably use discretionary rather than compulsory terms when expressing both the guidelines and procedures that govern the trial court responsibility to grant deferred entry of judgment to a qualifying juvenile defendant.
rule a provides that a juvenile may be considered for a deferred entry of judgment if all of the eligibility requirements are met.italics added.the procedures enumerated in the statutes once the threshold eligibility determination is made confirm that a grant of deferred entry of judgment is discretionary rather than mandatory.subdivision b of section specifies that i f the minor is found eligible for deferred entry of judgment,the prosecuting attorney shall file a declaration in writing with the court or state for the record the grounds upon which the determination is based,and the trial court then may set the hearing for deferred entry of judgment at the initial appearance under section.italics adde
