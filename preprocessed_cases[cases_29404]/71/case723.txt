appellants kelly hughes and kevin stacy challenge their convictions and alternatively the district court denial of their motion for judgment of acquittal motion for a new trial.this appeal,originally filed by hughes,was consolidated with case number,filed by stacy.there are nine issues raised on appeal,two by hughes,seven by stacy.both appellants allege that there was a variance between the indictment and the evidence presented at trial on the conspiracy counts.they further argue that the variance resulted in substantial prejudice,thus necessitating a new trial.stacy makes the following additional arguments that the jury verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence and was not supported by sufficient evidence with respect to the charge of making false statements and the charges of conspiracy to engage in insider trading and to obstruct justice that the jury relied on material outside the record in its deliberations that defense counsel failed to present an adequate defense at trial due to the district court exclusion of certain expert testimony that the jury instructions were inadequate and that prejudice resulted from the cumulative effect of errors made by the district court.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the judgment of the district court,although based upon a slightly different analysis from the one used by that court.
factual and procedural background 
kellogg buyout and suspicious stock 
this case involves insider trading based on the purchase,by the kellogg company kellogg,of worthington foods wf,a small meatless foods company located in columbus,ohio.from july,when negotiations began with kellogg,to october,when the buyout occurred,appellants roger blackwell blackwell sat on the board of directors at wf.as a member of the board,blackwell was privy to information about the kellogg purchase and the price per share negotiated by the parties.
from june to september,many of blackwell friends and family bought wf stock.the largest purchaser was justin voss voss,a friend and business associate to blackwell,who bought shares.the second largest purchaser was jack kahl kahl,a friend and business associate to blackwell,who bought shares.hughes,longtime employee and friend to blackwell,and her husband,stacy,were the fifth largest purchasers with combined shares.arnold jack jack,longtime friend to blackwell,and black jack enterprises,by jack and blackwell,purchased shares.dale blackwell,blackwell father,purchased shares.gertrude and alfred stephans the stephanses,parents of blackwell wife kristina purchased shares.finally,blackwell son,christian blackwell,purchased shares of wf stock.
ii.appellants relationship to blackwell and other 
blackwell is a former professor at the ohio state university school of business.hughes first worked for him while she was still in college,grading papers for the professor.she started her professional career working for him at roger blackwell associates,rba in as an administrative assistant.eventually she became the director of marketing,and was responsible for all of rba finances,accounting and marketing.
most years,hughes met with blackwell during the month of august to discuss the company finances.on august,hughes had such a meeting with blackwell,just days before her various purchases of wf stock.
hughes had a close relationship with blackwell.she was said to be devoted to him.blackwell also valued hughes as a friend,stating at his birthday party in that he could not have gotten through all this without her help and support.he also added that he valued her husband stacy support.
in addition to her duties at rba,hughes was responsible for the investment decisions for the roger blackwell pension plan pension plan.her first investment for the pension plan was in september of with the purchase of wf stock.at that time,only two employees of rba,and hughes,were vested in the pension plan.
stacy,a surveyor by trade,married hughes in.he also had a close relationship with blackwell and was an usher at blackwell wedding.stacy and hughes socialized many times with blackwell and his wife,along with blackwell friends and family.stacy even thought of jack,one of blackwell closest friends,as his attorney.
iii.blackwell direct connection to the conspiracy 
sometime in late july or early august of,blackwell discussed the possible buyout of wf with his then wife.the two discussed the propriety of purchasing stock in wf at that time.blackwell told his wife that they could not purchase wf stock at that time,but when she asked whether her parents would be able to purchase wf stock,blackwell responded that he did think that would be a problem.
contacted her mother,gertrude stephans,and encouraged her to purchase wf stock.blackwell was aware of this conversation.additionally,blackwell and provided her parents with to purchase wf stock.
blackwell also informed his friend and business associate,kahl,of the imminent purchase of wf by kellogg and the substantial rise in wf stock that would result.blackwell told kahl that,if he were to decide to purchase wf stock,he should go in thinly and not buy too much because it was a thinly traded stock 
kahl served on the board of directors for another company,henkle,along with blackwell.in january,kahl and other members of the henkle board received a letter from blackwell stating 
i also want to clarify a few facts of this situation.first and foremost,i never discussed the merger of kellogg and worthington foods with anyone nor disclosed anything that can be remotely considered insider information.that is my policy at all times for all companies with which i am affiliated.
kahl questioned the truthfulness of the letter because he had personally received inside information about the buyout from blackwell.kahl understood the letter to express blackwell position in the investigation rather than a true and accurate version of the events surrounding the buyout.
iv.investigations 
in december,the national association of securities dealers nasd launched an investigation into the purchases of wf stock,based on increased activity during the months directly preceding the buyout.nasd sent out a questionnaire requesting information on the relationships among purchasers of stock during the relevant period and those persons who knew about the buyout.instead of providing the information requested in the questionnaire,blackwell responded by stating i supplied no information about the transaction to any of the people on the list or any one sic else.when asked by anyone about worthington foods during this period,i replied that i was not able to comment about the company stock,as is my standard practice.blackwell eventually did disclose to nasd his relationships to his father,his son,jack,black jack enterprises,hughes and stacy,but continued to deny providing information to them about the buyout.it is important to note that in a time frame,during the same month the nasd investigation began,blackwell telephone calling card was used from new york to call most of the people he was connected to who had purchased wf stock during the period under investigation,including dale blackwell,the stephanses,hughes and stacy,jack,and voss.
in,the securities and exchange commission sec subpoenaed blackwell to testify and to provide various documents regarding the matter.on january,blackwell testified before the sec that he did not disclose the information about the kellogg buyout to anyone.he also responded to a later sec inquiry,restating his position of.in february of,along with her parents,testified before the sec,stating that they had not received insider information from blackwell about the buyout.according to,she and her husband has previously agreed that no one would disclose that blackwell had provided them with insider information about the buyout.
in november,hughes and stacy both provided sworn testimony before the sec.both testified that they did not receive inside information about the purchase of wf and did not base their purchases of wf stock on any such information.on may,hughes again testified before the sec.she stated that she never received money from blackwell to help pay for wf stock and that the check she received from rba,discussed below,was not used to purchase wf stock.
hughes and stacy stock purchases 
from april through august,stacy was a fairly conservative investor in his ira accounts.his transactions involved the purchase of shares in checkpoint systems,in april,the purchase of shares in karrington health,in september,the sale and repurchase of those same stocks in december,the sale of the karrington stock in january,and the purchase of shares of worthington industries,in january.
in september,stacy purchases dramatically increased.stacy purchased shares of wf on september,shares of wf on september,and,and shares of wf on september.the announcement of the kellogg buyout occurred on october.from october,stacy sold all the wf stock he had purchased in the previous month,making a substantial profit.
hughes considered herself to be a knowledgeable investor based on her research and her attempt to educate herself on the equities markets in general.she handled the family finances and investments.hughes was also a conservative investor prior to september.from january through august,hughes bought and sold only four stocks checkpoint shares in january,shares in april,and selling shares in december karrington shares in august and selling shares and then buying them back in december and reselling in january wild shares in july and airnet separate purchases of shares and shares in january.
in activity that was inconsistent with her prior behavior in the stock market,in september,hughes began to sell shares of other stock in order to obtain wf stock.on september,hughes sold shares of airnet systems and shares of wild oats,and purchased shares of wf.the next day she sold shares of airnet and shares of checkpoint systems and purchased shares of wf.on october,hughes sold all of her wf stock,making a substantial profit.
in the couple joint account,hughes appeared to be moderately aggressive in her stock purchases from august through september,the couple bought shares of airnet systems,shares of huntington bancshares,shares of worthington industries and shares of banc stk group.in january and february,they sold off their shares of previously purchased max ermas stock,and purchased shares of consolidated stores,shares of airnet systems and shares of wf.in july,they purchased more shares of huntingon.
in september,purchases in the joint account also drastically changed.on september,the couple purchased shares of wf stock and an additional shares two days later.by october,the couple had sold all of their wf stock for a substantial profit.
the profits received by hughes and stacy for the sale of the wf stock were as follows for the couple joint account for stacy accounts and for hughes accounts.the couple shared profits totaled.the pension plan,managed by hughes,also profited by.
between the two of them,stacy and hughes used seven different brokerage accounts to buy wf stock.hughes had two personal accounts,one with advest and one with eisner.stacy had three accounts,one with advest,one with eisner,and one with charles schwab.the two also had two joint accounts,one with eisner and one with ubs.additionally,the charles schwab account and the ubs account were both opened on september,and were used solely to purchase wf stock.
one of the government witnesses,jody stewart,testified about hughes and stacy checking account.stewart stated that on september,there was a deposit of and on september,there was a deposit of.the later deposit was solely comprised of a check issued to hughes by rba that contained the notation loan and was signed by blackwell.on september,hughes made out a check to national financial for.two days later,she made out a check to charles schwab for.
timothy salzer,one of hughes and stacy brokers,also testified for the government.based on the couple recent purchase of shares of wf,salzer requested new financial information on them because he did not believe it was a suitable investment for them due to their limited liquidity.the liquid net worth stated by hughes and stacy in was between and.in september,that number changed to between and.when salzer learned of the kellogg buyout,he was surprised because of the size of the couple recent purchases of wf stock and the proximity to the buyout.because the couple virtually doubled their money in eight days,salzer concluded that they either had great luck or had inside information.
vi.procedural history 
on august,a grand jury indicted hughes,stacy,jack,voss,and black jack enterprises on the following charges insider trading in violation of and,conspiracy to commit insider trading in violation of,obstruction of agency proceedings in violation of,conspiracy to obstruct agency proceedings in violation of,and making false statements in violation of.blackwell,hughes and stacy were convicted of most of the charges against them.voss,jack,and black jack enterprises were acquitted on all counts.

discussion 
both appellants allege that a variance occurred because the evidence presented at trial demonstrated multiple conspiracies,whereas the indictment alleged single conspiracies.appellants also assert that they suffered substantial prejudice as a result thereof.the government disputes this claim.the district court,in its denial of the motion for judgment of acquittal a new trial,found that no variance had occurred and that the jury instructions properly prevented any prejudice due to spillover.
standard of review 
we perform a de novo review when determining whether there has been a variance at trial from the indictment.united states smith,cir,cert.denied,d.a variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are unchanged,but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the indictment.united states chilingirian,cir quotations omitted.i f an indictment alleges one conspiracy,but the evidence can reasonably be construed only as supporting a finding of multiple conspiracies,the resulting variance between the indictment and the proof is reversible error if the appellant can show that he was prejudiced thereby.united states warner,cir citing kotteakos united states.therefore,to obtain the reversal of a criminal conviction due to a variance,an appellant must demonstrate that a variance occurred and that it affected a substantial right.united states manning,cir.
we first look to whether the evidence can reasonably be construed only as supporting a finding of multiple conspiracies rather than the single conspiracy alleged in the indictment.warner,at.whether single or multiple conspiracies have been shown is usually a question of fact to be resolved by the jury and is to be considered on appeal in the light most favorable to the government.united states schultz,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the principal considerations in determining the number of conspiracies are the existence of a common goal,the nature of the scheme,and the overlapping of the participants in various dealings.smith,at.
to demonstrate substantial prejudice,the appellant must show that the variance prejudiced his ability to defend himself or prejudiced the overall fairness of the trial.manning,at.a reviewing court looks to whether there is a danger that the appellant was convicted based on evidence of a conspiracy in which the appellant did not participate guilt transference.united states blackwell,cir.however,t he concept of variance is designed to prevent the prosecution from convicting the defendant of a different offense,not a lesser variation on the charged offense.united states solorio,cir.
even if an appellant can demonstrate that a variance resulted in guilt transference,typically any danger of prejudice can be cured with a cautionary instruction to the jury that if it finds multiple conspiracies,it can not use evidence relating to one conspiracy in determining another conspiracy.blackwell,at.however,as the blackwell court noted,the more evidence presented at trial that is unrelated to the defendant conduct,or a conspiracy in which the defendant took part,the less likely instructions are to cure the danger of guilt transference.id.if there is a significant amount of evidence produced at trial that was unrelated to the appellant,we must look to the following factors to determine if the variance was prejudicial the number of conspiracies the evidence establishes the number of tried with defendant and the size of the conspiracy alleged in the indictment.id.
conspiracy to engage in insider trading 
hughes and stacy claim that the evidence at trial demonstrated somewhere between ten to twenty different conspiracies.this is based not only on the evidence presented about the other codefendants,but also the evidence presented regarding the unnamed conspirators.because voss,jack,and black jack enterprises were acquitted of the crimes charged in the indictment,they will not be included in the discussion of whether a single conspiracy existed.the question becomes whether there was a single conspiracy among the remaining alleged conspirators blackwell,unindicted conspirator,the stephanses unindicted conspirators,hughes and stacy,kahl unindicted conspirator,and dale and christian blackwell unindicted conspirators.
the government theory at trial and on appeal is that the goal of the conspiracy was to enrich blackwell inner circle of friends and family.in support of that theory,it has attempted to demonstrate that all and unindicted conspirators knew or should have known that they were involved in a single conspiracy because they were all close friends and had socialized together often.however,mere association with conspirators is not enough to establish participation in a conspiracy.united states pearce,cir.moreover,it is not sufficient simply to demonstrate that the alleged conspirators knew each other and committed the same or associated crimes.the essence of a conspiracy is the agreement to commit the offense and not the commission of the substantive offense.united states fife,cir united states sutton,cir.
the government did not present evidence that dale blackwell,the stephanses,or voss socialized with appellants.although the government did present evidence of social connections among other conspirators,it did not demonstrate that those individuals discussed the stock market or ways to increase their own wealth.it also failed to present evidence,either direct or circumstantial,that there was any sort of agreement amongst all those named in count of the indictment.
despite viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and making all reasonable inferences in its favor,we find that there was no basis for a reasonable juror to conclude that appellants knew or should have known that blackwell had provided inside information to anyone else.to the contrary,it was more likely that they believed that blackwell would not disseminate the information widely.the evidence established that blackwell knew wf was a thinly traded stock,and that hughes considered herself to be knowledgeable in the stock market.blackwell and hughes would both have known that the purpose of the charged scheme would have been defeated if many people were involved.the marked increase in wf stock purchases caused by widespread participation would drive up the market price of the stock before all of the intended beneficiaries of the information could buy the volume they hoped to buy,thereby diminishing the benefit to blackwell friends and family.
based upon the above,we disagree with the district court and find that the government presented no evidence of a common goal amongst the persons listed as conspirators in the indictment.furthermore,although there was a single conspiracy alleged in count of the indictment,we find that the evidence presented at trial demonstrated multiple unrelated conspiracies,resulting in a variance.
however,even though a variance occurred,we find that appellants did not suffer substantial prejudice so as to justify a new trial.the supreme court concluded in berger united states,that the fact that the proof disclosed two conspiracies instead of one,each within the words of the indictment,can not prejudice a defendant defense of former acquittal of the one or former conviction of the other,if he should again be prosecuted,overruled on other grounds by stirone united states,d.the supreme court further held that a variance should never be regarded as material where the allegation and proof substantially correspond,or where the variance was not of a character which could have misled the defendant at trial and where it did not deprive the accused of his right to be protected against another prosecution for the same offense.id.at.
in this case,the conspiracy involving stacy and hughes was contained within the indictment.those claims substantially corresponded to the evidence presented at trial.therefore,neither stacy nor hughes would have been misled by the indictment.the indictment also put them on notice about what evidence would be produced against them at trial.finally,the variance between what was charged in the indictment and the evidence produced at trial does not deprive either appellant of his or her right to be protected against another prosecution for the same offense in the future.
appellants argue that we should apply the holding in kotteakos,supra,and find that the variance was fatal.in kotteakos,an overarching conspiracy was alleged in the indictment but the proof at trial demonstrated multiple conspiracies.at.the key defendant had experience obtaining loans under the national housing act.id.at.he used that knowledge to assist other in obtaining loans under the act for various fraudulent reasons.id.at.each loan was unique unto itself.id.additionally,none of the loans went through at the same time and each was obtained for a different purpose.id.the supreme court found that an impermissible variance occurred between the indictment and the evidence at trial,and that the variance resulted in substantial prejudice to the defendants.id.at.
this case,however,is factually distinguishable from kotteakos because each conspiracy involved the transmission of inside information.that information was then used to purchase wf stock at a low price.the purchasers made substantial profits when the stock was sold after the announcement of the kellogg buyout.the facts in this case are more similar to those in berger.
in berger,the evidence at trial demonstrated two different conspiracies to pass counterfeit money.at.however,the facts of each of the alleged conspiracies were contained in the indictment.id.the supreme court found that although there was a variance between what was charged and the evidence presented,it was not material and did not affect the defendants substantive rights.id.at.in the case at bar,there were three separate conspiracies to engage in insider trading.although the government did not prove that there was one common goal amongst the conspirators,it certainly would not have shocked appellants at trial to be confronted by evidence involving the conspiracy among blackwell,hughes and stacy.therefore,the variance was immaterial.
additionally,it is noted that this court held in blackwell that the jury instructions given by the district court properly protected the defendants from any guilt transference.at.hughes argues that this holding should not be binding because the bulk of the evidence presented at trial was unrelated to her.however,upon review of the transcript,we find this argument to be without merit.the question we must consider is not whether there was substantial evidence unrelated to hughes specifically,but whether there was substantial evidence unrelated to the conspiracy in which she allegedly participated in.therefore,evidence concerning blackwell actions,which comprises approximately of the transcript,is certainly relevant as he is a conspirator in the blackwell,hughes,and stacy conspiracy.in addition,hughes significantly downplays the amount of evidence and testimony presented against her at trial.nearly every witness in the government testified about hughes.there were at least fifty exhibits presented by the government that involved hughes her husband stacy.this fact alone weighs in favor of finding,as the court did in blackwell,that the jury instructions properly protected the appellants from guilt transference.
even if we were to find a majority of the evidence was unrelated to hughes,the factors to consider to determine if prejudice existed do not weigh in her favor.these include the number of conspiracies the evidence demonstrated the number of tried along with the defendant and the size of the conspiracy alleged in the indictment.blackwell,at.although appellants argue that the evidence demonstrated between ten and twenty different conspiracies,clearly the jury disagreed,acquitting voss,jack,and black jack.if we were to consider the three separate conspiracies discussed previously,it is unlikely that the jury was confused and thus transferred guilt from one defendant to the other when such a small number of alleged conspiracies was involved.
the second factor requires consideration of the number of tried along with appellants.in this case,six people were tried together,three of whom were part of the blackwell,hughes and stacy conspiracy.this is not a case where the sheer number of resulted in a likelihood of juror confusion or guilt transference.
finally,we look to the size of the conspiracy alleged in the indictment.this factor appears to be the only one that weighs in appellants favor.there are eleven alleged conspirators,six named in the indictment along with five unindicted conspirators.because there was a significant amount of testimony and evidence presented against hughes and stacy at trial and because a majority of the above factors do not demonstrate that there was a likelihood of guilt transference,we can not find that adequate jury instructions would not have prevented prejudice against appellants due to a variance.
as previously stated,this court determined in blackwell that the jury instructions given by the district court adequately protected the defendants from substantial prejudice due to guilt transference.at.this holding was based on the finding that t he trial court instructed the jury that it could not consider evidence of one defendant actions,against another defendant,unless the jury first found the defendants to be.we presume the jury followed these instructions.id.at.
because the blackwell court decided the exact issue regarding the jury instructions,and its conclusion was not based on a determination of the weight of evidence against any one of the defendants,the holding becomes the law of the case and may not be revisited unless substantially new evidence has been introduced,there has been an intervening change of law,or the first decision was clearly erroneous and enforcement of its command would work substantial injustice.united states corrado,cir quoting miles kohli kaliher,cir see also united states wilson,wl,at cir.july,ruling that a panel holdings in the appeals of three became the law of the case as to the identical issues raised in the subsequent appeal of a fourth heathcoat potts,cir f indings of fact and conclusions of law by an appellate court are generally binding in all subsequent proceedings in the same case in the trial court or on a later appeal.citation omitted.appellants have failed to produce new evidence,argue an intervening change of law,or demonstrate that the previous decision was clearly erroneous and enforcement of its holding would result in substantial injustice.therefore,we find that appellants did not suffer substantial prejudice because the jury instructions adequately protected them from guilt transference.
conspiracy to obstruct justice 
unlike the conspiracy charge discussed above,in viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the government,it would be reasonable for a juror to infer that all of the named conspirators in count had the agreed common goal of concealing the fact that blackwell had provided them with inside information.there is also evidence that each conspirator knew or had reason to know of the participation of the others in the conspiracy and that it was necessary for each to provide false and misleading testimony before the sec to conceal his or her actions.
during december,as the nasd launched its investigation,blackwell received a list of suspicious purchasers from nasd requesting that he identify the persons he knew and their relationship to him.on that list were jack,kahl,hughes,hiser,juanita hiser,stacy,voss,the stephanses,and dale and christian blackwell.blackwell phone records show that within a period that month,he used his telephone calling card from new york to make calls to dale blackwell,the stephanses,hughes and stacy,jack,and voss.
kahl testified that he received a letter from blackwell providing a blanket denial of the allegations that he provided insider information.he understood that the letter was blackwell position in the investigation and not the truth.
blackwell kept track of who was being subpoenaed.he was aware that voss had given testimony before the sec.when hiser received her subpoena from the sec,she immediately contacted stacy.stacy informed her about both his and hughes subpoenas.stacy also informed jack about the subpoena.
on november,the contact information contained in the rba computer for voss,stephanses,kahl,and cousin,sigi macfetridge,was deleted.testified that she and blackwell had an agreement that both she and her parents would testify before the sec that they did not receive confidential information from him regarding the kellogg buyout.the evidence also demonstrated that all persons who testified before the sec essentially made the same statement,which was that they did not receive inside information from blackwell and that their stock purchases were not based on any inside information.it was reasonable for a juror to conclude that there was an agreement amongst all the alleged conspirators to hide the fact that they had received inside information from blackwell.viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the government,we find that the evidence at trial demonstrated a single conspiracy to obstruct justice,just as was alleged in the indictment.thus,no variance occurred.it is,therefore,unnecessary to discuss whether appellants suffered substantial prejudice.
ii.sufficiency of the evidence and manifest weight 
stacy argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to convict him and that his convictions were therefore against the manifest weight of the evidence for count to insider trade,count to obstruct justice,and counts,and false statements.although stacy seventh stated issue raises a general claim of insufficiency against his convictions on all counts,he makes only argument on the specific counts listed above.therefore,any other sufficiency challenges are waived.see united states layne,cir.
the district court,in its denial of the motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to rule and motion for a new trial pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure,found that sufficient evidence was presented for a rational trier of fact to find that all the elements of the offenses were proved beyond a reasonable doubt and that the evidence did not preponderate against the verdicts of guilt arrived at by the jury.therefore,the court found that the convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence.
standard of review 
when considering a challenge to the sufficiency of evidence to sustain a conviction on direct appeal,the relevant question is whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d.the appellate court must view all evidence and resolve all reasonable inferences in favor of the government.id see also united states searan,cir.because the issue is one of legal sufficiency,the court neither independently weighs the evidence,nor judges the credibility of witnesses who testified at trial.united states talley,cir.an appellate court can not substitute its judgment for that of the jury.united states hilliard,cir.finally,it must be remembered that circumstantial evidence alone can sustain a guilty verdict and such evidence need not remove every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.united states stone,cir.this standard is a great obstacle to overcome,united states winkle,cir,and presents the appellant in a criminal case with a very heavy burden.united states jackson,cir.
a motion for a new trial under rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure may be premised upon the argument that the jury verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence.generally,such motions are granted only in the extraordinary circumstance where the evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict.united states turner,aff,cir.a district judge,in considering the weight of the evidence for purposes of adjudicating a motion for new trial,may act as a thirteenth juror,assessing the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence.united states lutz,cir.our review of the trial court ruling is limited to determining whether it was a clear and manifest abuse of discretion.united states hernandez,cir.
conspiracy counts 
under,it is illegal for two or more persons to conspire either to commit any offense against the united states,or to defraud the united states,or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose.to prove conspiracy,the government must establish the existence of an agreement to violate the law knowledge and intent to join the conspiracy and an overt act constituting actual participation in the conspiracy.see,united states martinez,cir united states jamieson,cir.a tacit or material understanding among the parties to a conspiracy is sufficient to establish the agreement,and conspiracy may be inferred from circumstantial evidence which may reasonably be interpreted as participation in a common plan.united states walls,cir internal citations omitted.
insider trading 
we find that in its denial of the motion for judgment of for a new trial,the district court provided an appropriate listing of the elements necessary for the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the offense of insider trading 
that the defendant,in connection with the purchase or sale of wf stock,employed manipulative and deceptive devices and contrivances by employing a device,scheme or artifice to defraud,or engaging in acts,practices or courses of business which operated or would operate as a fraud and deceit upon other persons 
that the defendant acted knowingly and wilfully and with the intent to defraud and that the defendant knowingly used or caused to be used means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce or the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the purchase or sale of securities in furtherance of the fraudulent conduct.
at.additionally the government was also required to prove that hughes and stacy,as tippees received material,confidential,and information from blackwell knowing that he was the source knew or should have known that blackwell breached his fiduciary duty and knowingly and wilfully purchased or caused to be purchased shares of wf stock based on that information.dirks sec,d.
stacy argues that the government presented nothing but speculation and conjecture in support of its theory that blackwell provided inside information to hughes himself.he points out that the government presented nothing but circumstantial evidence and he,along with blackwell and hughes,took the witness stand and denied engaging in insider trading.stacy also points to the reasonable explanations testified to at trial for both his and his wife purchases of wf stock.however,t he government may meet its burden through circumstantial evidence alone,and such evidence need not exclude every possible hypothesis except that of guilt.united states jackson,cir citing united states peters,cir,cert.denied,d.additionally,it is well settled that when a defendant offer s an innocent explanation for the incriminating facts proved by the government,the jury is free to disbelieve it.united states schreane,cir.
at trial,the government produced evidence that blackwell found out about the proposed buyout in late july or early august.this information was not public.it was only through blackwell position on the board at wf that he gained this knowledge.on august,hughes had a meeting with blackwell at rba.hughes had a close relationship with blackwell and had worked for him for a number of years.hughes was a knowledgeable investor.additionally,stacy testified that it would be impossible for hughes to have inside information and not tell him.
beginning on september,and continuing until september,just days before the buyout,stacy and hughes,previously cautious investors,bought thousands of shares of wf.additionally,the couple received a check from blackwell for which they promptly used to purchase wf stock.by october,hughes and stacy had sold all of their wf stock,obtaining in profits.based on these facts,we find that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to demonstrate that blackwell obtained information about the buyout and conveyed that information to hughes,who in turn shared that information with her husband,stacy,and that the couple purchased wf stock based on that information.as a knowledgeable investor,hughes would have known that blackwell was breaching his duty to the company,its shareholders,and the investing public by sharing this information.the jury could also infer that appellants close relationship would mean that stacy was also aware,through hughes,that blackwell conduct was improper.
stacy again asserts that each of the persons alleged to have conspired with blackwell did not have a connection with the other alleged conspirators and thus had no common goal.this issue was discussed above and will not be discussed further.
based on the above,we find that,viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the government,a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the government had proven the essential elements of conspiracy to engage in insider trading with respect to stacy.additionally,because the amount of evidence presented was substantial,the denial of stacy rule motion was not a clear and manifest abuse of discretion.
obstruction of justice 
stacy argues that the evidence presented against him at trial on this charge was insufficient to sustain a conviction and,thus,that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence.he points out that there was no evidence that he entered into an agreement with or blackwell to delete names from rba database,an act admitted to on the witness stand.he further argues that he did not trade on inside information,thus making his statements to the sec accurate.finally,stacy claims that even if it was found that he did make false statements,the government presented no evidence that he conspired with anyone,including his wife,to obstruct justice.
as stated above,a conspiracy can be shown through circumstantial evidence,that may reasonably be interpreted as participation in a common plan.walls,at.additionally,even though there was no evidence that stacy was involved in the deletion of names from the computer,that act was not the only overt act listed in the indictment.the indictment alleges that stacy failed to provide copies of his brokerage account statements for the month of september,when all the significant purchases of wf were made,and that he gave false stat
