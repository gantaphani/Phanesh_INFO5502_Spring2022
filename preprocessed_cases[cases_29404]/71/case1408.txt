discussion 
the governing statutory scheme.
chapter of the general corporation law is entitled shareholder derivative actions.section thereof covers conditions,security,motions for order,and determinations.
under the statute,a party may move for an order requiring the plaintiff to furnish a bond upon one or both of the following grounds that there is no reasonable possibility that the prosecution of the cause of action alleged in the complaint against the moving party will benefit the corporation or its shareholders.that the moving party,if other than the corporation,did not participate in the transaction complained of in any capacity,subd.c.
at the hearing upon any motion pursuant to subdivision c,the court shall consider such evidence,written or oral,by witnesses or affidavit,as may be material to the ground or grounds upon which the motion is based,or to a determination of the probable reasonable expenses,including attorneys fees,of the corporation and the moving party which will be incurred in the defense of the action.if the court determines,after hearing the evidence adduced by the parties,that the moving party has established a probability in support of any of the grounds upon which the motion is based,the court shall fix the amount of the bond,not to exceed fifty thousand dollars,to be furnished by the plaintiff for reasonable expenses,including attorneys fees,which may be incurred by the moving party and the corporation in connection with the action,including expenses for which the corporation may become liable pursuant to section.a ruling by the court on the motion shall not be a determination of any issue in the action or of the merits thereof.if the court,upon the motion,makes a determination that a bond shall be furnished by the plaintiff as to any one or more defendants,the action shall be dismissed as to the defendant or defendants,unless the bond required by the court has been furnished within such reasonable time as may be fixed by the court.e if the plaintiff shall,either before or after a motion is made pursuant to subdivision c,or any order or determination pursuant to the motion,furnish a bond in the aggregate amount of fifty thousand dollars to secure the reasonable expenses of the parties entitled to make the motion,the plaintiff has complied with the requirements of this section and with any order for a bond theretofore made,and any such motion then pending shall be dismissed and no further or additional bond shall be required,subds.d e.
ambiguity in section with respect to aggregate amount of bond that may be ordered under subdivision d requires ascertainment of legislative intent.
subdivision d of section is ambiguous with respect to maximum amount of bond that may be ordered.
subdivision d of section empowers the trial court,in ruling on a motion by the moving party,to require a bond not to exceed fifty thousand dollars.however,subdivision d is silent with respect to whether,in a case involving multiple defendants,the trial court may require a bond up to as to each moving defendant.
subdivision e of section provides that if the plaintiff,either before or after a motion is made pursuant to subdivision c,or any order or determination pursuant to the motion,furnish es a bond in the aggregate amount of fifty thousand dollars to secure the reasonable expenses of the parties entitled to make the motion,the plaintiff has complied with the requirements of this section and with any order for a bond theretofore made,and any such motion then pending shall be dismissed and no further or additional bond shall be required.italics added.
thus,although subdivision d of section is silent in this regard,subdivision e states that once the plaintiff has posted a bond,the plaintiff has satisfied section and no additional bond may be required.the language in subdivision e allowing a plaintiff to satisfy the statute by posting a bond either before or after the hearing or order,could be construed as providing that in no case may the required security exceed.
we also make the observation that if subdivision d of section were construed as allowing for a bond in favor of each moving defendant,while subdivision e allows the plaintiff to take preemptive action by posting a bond in the first instance,an absurdity could result.under the interpretation urged by respondents herein,if there were twenty moving defendants,the plaintiff might be facing a million bond requirement under subdivision d.however,subdivision e clearly allows the plaintiff unilaterally to satisfy his or her obligation under the statute by posting a bond either before or after the hearing or order.if subdivision d were construed as allowing the trial court to require a bond for each moving defendant,there could be an enormous differential in the bond requirement,based purely on the happenstance of whether the bond is posted pursuant to an order under subdivision d,or the plaintiff engages in an end run around subdivision d by posting a bond up front pursuant to subdivision e.given the obvious tension between the aggregate amount in subdivision e,and the absence of an express cap in subdivision d,we resort to the legislative history for guidance.
principles of statutory construction.
the touchstone of statutory interpretation is the probable intent of the legislature.when interpreting a statute,we must ascertain legislative intent so as to effectuate the purpose of a particular law.of course our first step in determining that intent is to scrutinize the actual words of the statute,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.california teachers governing bd.of rialto unified school dist.cal th,d.when the words are clear and unambiguous,there is no need for statutory construction or resort to other indicia of legislative intent,such as legislative history.california fed.savings loan city of los angeles cal th,d.but language that appears unambiguous on its face may be shown to have a latent ambiguity if so,a court may turn to customary rules of statutory construction or legislative history for guidance.stanton panish
