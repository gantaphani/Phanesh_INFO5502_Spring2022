this appeal arises from a million partial settlement between lead plaintiffs and healthsouth corporation healthsouth collectively the settling parties in the healthsouth securities fraud class action the federal actions richard scrushy scrushy,the former chairman and ceo of healthsouth,is a defendant in the class action litigation.scrushy appeals the scope of the bar order in the partial settlement because it extinguishes his contractual claims against healthsouth for indemnification of settlement payments he might make to the underlying and extinguishes his claims for advancement of legal defense costs 
scrushy appeal challenges two portions of the bar order contained in the partial final judgment approving the settlement agreement.first,scrushy contends that the district court erred in allowing the bar order to extinguish scrushy contractual rights as a corporate officer for healthsouth to reimburse him for good faith settlement amounts in his litigation with the underlying plaintiffs.second,scrushy argues that it was error to bar his contractual claim against healthsouth for advancement of his defense costs in that litigation.scrushy advances several arguments in support of each challenge.we address each of his several arguments and conclude that they are without merit.
background 
this appeal stems from the healthsouth securities fraud litigation.in march of,healthsouth acknowledged that its previous financial statements had substantially overstated its income and assets.in response,healthsouth investors filed several class actions against healthsouth,scrushy,and others alleging violations of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of.in july of,these actions were consolidated in the northern district of alabama.in,the settling parties reached a partial settlement agreement in which healthsouth and its insurers agreed to pay the underlying plaintiffs million.scrushy was not allowed to participate in the mediation sessions leading up to the settlement agreement.after entertaining scrushy written objections and his arguments at the fairness hearing,the district court approved the partial settlement.
scrushy,the former chairman and ceo of healthsouth,is a defendant in the underlying class action litigation.lead plaintiffs alleged that scrushy was the mastermind of the fraud.in,scrushy and healthsouth executed an agreement requiring healthsouth to indemnify scrushy to the fullest extent permitted by law.the indemnification agreement,governed by delaware law,requires healthsouth to indemnify scrushy for any judgment or settlement in any action in which he is sued for actions taken as a director or officer of the company,if he acted in good faith and reasonably believed he was acting in the best interest of the company.the agreement allows scrushy to recover any defense costs and expenses,including attorneys fees,if he is successful in the defense of any such action.in addition,the agreement entitles scrushy to receive advancement of attorneys fees as they become due,provided he agrees to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified against the expenses.
the settling parties stipulation of partial settlement stipulation contained a bar order extinguishing certain future claims by the settling defendants and the defendants.the bar order extinguished any claim for contribution whether contractual or otherwise by defendants,by scrushy against the released persons,healthsouth where the injury to the defendant is that person actual or threatened liability to the underlying plaintiffs,including any amounts paid in settlement of such actual or threatened liability,or any cost or expenses including attorneys fees incurred in connection with the federal actions the bar order is reciprocal,extinguishing similar claims by the settling defendants 
the extinguishment of scrushy claims is balanced not only by the reciprocal bar of any contribution claim against scrushy by a released person,but also by a judgment credit,crediting defendants in any future judgment with the greater of settling defendant proportionate liability or the amount actually paid by the settling defendant.the judgment credit ensures that defendants are not required to pay more than their proportionate share of liability and ensures that the underlying plaintiffs do not reap a windfall the stipulation also included an insurance credit for the defendants.
scrushy objected to the bar order in the stipulation.scrushy complained that the proposed final judgment extinguished valuable and enforceable rights to which scrushy was entitled under his indemnification agreement with healthsouth.scrushy filed written objections.then on january,the district court heard arguments on the fairness of the partial settlement.scrushy argued that the bar order needed to be changed because it took away his contractual rights against healthsouth for indemnification for good faith settlement amounts and for advancement of defense fees.
on january,the district court entered the partial final judgment approving the partial settlement.the partial final judgment includes the bar order extinguishing scrushy claims for indemnification if scrushy ultimately settles with the underlying plaintiffs and extinguishing scrushy claims for the advancement of legal defense fees.scrushy filed a motion to reconsider the bar order,and the district court denied the motion.the district court determined that the settlement agreement was fair and that scrushy was adequately compensated by the judgment credit.
scrushy challenges two aspects of the bar order.first,he makes several arguments supporting a challenge to that portion of the bar order that precludes his potential claim against healthsouth for indemnification of any amounts he might pay in settlement of actual or threatened liability to the underlying plaintiffs.second,he asserts several arguments supporting his challenge to that portion of the bar order that extinguished his contractual claim against healthsouth for advancement of legal fees in litigation with the underlying plaintiffs after stating the appropriate standard of review,we address scrushy arguments in turn.

iii.discussion 
scrushy challenge to that portion of the bar order that precludes his potential claim against healthsouth for indemnification of any amounts he might pay in settlement of actual or threatened liability to the underlying.scrushy argument that the pslra mandatory contribution bar is exclusive 
scrushy notes that the pslra mandates that settlement agreements,such as the one at issue here,contain a bar order that bars all future claims against the settling parties for contribution.scrushy contends that the mandatory contribution bar in the pslra is exclusive,and prohibits the district court from barring claims other than contribution claims.in particular,scrushy argues that,pursuant to a contractual agreement with healthsouth,he has a contractual right to be indemnified for any amounts he might pay in settlement of actual or threatened liability to the underlying plaintiffs.because this contractual right is one for indemnification,and because he argues that the pslra contribution bar sets both a floor and a ceiling on the scope of such a bar order,scrushy argues that the instant bar order exceeds the permitted scope of such a bar order in that it bars not only his contribution claims,but also his indemnity claims.we reject this argument,and hold that the instant bar order is not inconsistent with the pslra insofar as it bars not only scrushy contribution claims,but also his indemnification claim for amounts he might pay in settlement of actual or threatened liability to the underlying plaintiffs.
the pslra provides 
a covered person who settles any private action at any time before final verdict or judgment shall be discharged from all claims for contribution brought by other persons.upon entry of the settlement by the court,the court shall enter a bar order constituting the final discharge of all obligations to the plaintiff of the settling covered person arising out of the action.the order shall bar all future claims for contribution arising out of the action 
i by any person against the settling covered person and 
ii by the settling covered person against any person,other than a person whose liability has been extinguished by the settlement of the settling covered person.
f a emphasis added.
the question of whether or not the mandatory contribution bar contained in the pslra is exclusive is an open question in this circuit.in aal high yield bond fund deloitte touche llp,cir,we declined to decide whether the pslra mandated contribution bar is exclusive,but we asked the district court,on remand,to consider whether the pslra contribution bar is exclusive,and determine,in the alternative,whether the pslra suggests caution with respect to broader bar orders.id.at 
for the following reasons,we hold that the mandatory contribution bar in the pslra does not preclude a bar order containing a provision like the instant,barring scrushy potential claim against the released persons for indemnification of any amounts he might pay in settlement of actual or threatened liability to the underlying plaintiffs.first,we note that there is no provision in the statute expressly limiting or prohibiting a bar of indemnity claims.nor is there any language in the statute suggesting that the contribution bar is exclusive.the statute merely mandates a contribution bar,but is silent with respect to barring similar indemnification claims.
second,scrushy has pointed to no case law holding that the pslra mandatory contribution bar is exclusive in this manner,in prohibiting such indemnification claims.to the contrary,there is case law following the effective date of the pslra approving bar orders that not only bar contribution claims,but also bar such indemnification claims.see,in re heritage bond,cir holding that bar orders issued pursuant to the pslra may only bar claims for contribution and indemnity or disguised claims for such relief carroll leboeuf,lamb,greene macrae,civ.lak,wl,at july,holding that a district court may properly bar claims by defendants against settling defendants for contribution and indemnity as long as the bar order ensures fairness in re rite aid.sec,d,noting that the pslra did not include language expressly prohibiting indemnification bars and was enacted against a backdrop of cases allowing indemnification bars,and rejecting the argument that the pslra prohibits bar orders that preclude indemnification claims.
the third reason,and a very significant one,that we reject scrushy argument is that the pslra was enacted against a background of established case law which had approved bar orders precluding such indemnification claims.for example,in this circuit,our decision in in re oil gas litigation,cir approved a bar order precluding claims for contribution or indemnity against the settling defendants.id.at see also eichenholtz brennan,cir concluding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in barring causes of action for indemnification,including claims based on underwriting indemnification agreements,because indemnification agreements run counter to the policies underlying the securities acts franklin kaypro,cir agreeing with the district court determination that contractual indemnity clauses were invalid globus law research,cir affirming the district court decision to set aside a jury verdict based on an indemnification agreement between an issuer and an underwriter,relying on the sec view that indemnification of directors and officers is against the public policy of the act,and determining that underwriters should be treated equally with directors and officers.we can readily conclude that the background of case law against which the pslra was enacted clearly established that the barring of such indemnity claims is permissible.indeed,courts have indicated that the pslra codified the prior federal common law with respect to bar orders,heritage bond,at.we believe that it is highly unlikely that congress would intend by its mere silence to overrule such case law.
scrushy argument that his contractual claim against healthsouth to be indemnified for any amounts he might pay in settlement of actual or threatened liability to the underlying plaintiffs is a truly independent claim because it is not based on his liability to those plaintiffs 
scrushy points out that the cases which have approved bar orders have involved orders that bar claims by defendants against settling defendants where the injury to the defendant was based on its liability to the underlying plaintiffs scrushy argues that his contractual claim against healthsouth for amounts he might pay in settlement to the underlying plaintiffs would not be based on his liability to the underlying plaintiffs,because he would inevitably deny liability in any settlement agreement.we reject this argument as almost frivolous.we agree with,and follow,the second circuit in denney deutsche bank ag,cir.in that decision,the second circuit rejected this precise argument,holding that such settlements would be nonetheless on account of liability or the risk thereof to the underlying plaintiffs.id.at.
scrushy argument that the preclusion of his contractual indemnity claim against healthsouth for settlement amounts was unjustified because he received no compensation therefor 
scrushy is correct that both the case law and the pslra recognize that a bar order deprives a defendant of potentially valuable rights,and therefore,the defendant should be compensated.as noted above,the instant bar order includes,as part of its compensation to scrushy,a judgment credit,which would credit scrushy against any future judgment that the underlying plaintiffs might obtain against him.the credit is the greater of the settling defendants,healthsouth proportionate liability or the amount actually paid by healthsouth and its insurers,million.scrushy argues that this judgment credit is inadequate.he argues that the judgment credit does not come into play unless there is an adverse judgment against scrushy,and thus would not come into play if he reaches a settlement with the underlying plaintiffs.
we reject this argument as wholly without merit.we conclude that the judgment credit is very significant compensation to scrushy in the context of a settlement with the underlying plaintiffs.in negotiating any such settlement,both the underlying plaintiffs and scrushy will know that,if scrushy persists in taking the litigation to trial and judgment,the underlying plaintiffs will recover nothing at all from scrushy and other defendants unless the verdict exceeds million.because scrushy will be liable to the underlying plaintiffs,at most,only to the extent that any judgment against him and other defendants exceeds million,scrushy will be able to use that fact as a very significant bargaining chip in negotiating a settlement with the underlying plaintiffs.we conclude that the judgment credit provides adequate compensation to scrushy for the extinguishment of his potential claim against healthsouth for indemnification for any amounts he might pay in settlement to the underlying plaintiffs.
scrushy public policy arguments 
scrushy argues that public policy supports indemnification of corporate officers sued for actions taken within the scope of their employment.scrushy points to the governing state law of delaware which allows such broad indemnification.one purpose of the delaware law is to encourage qualified individuals to serve as corporate officers and directors,by safeguarding them when they act in good faith on behalf of the corporation.stifel fin.cochran.
to the extent that the public policy of delaware supports indemnification agreements in general,that must be balanced against countervailing policies in favor of settlements and against indemnification in the securities litigation context.this court has stated public policy strongly favors the pretrial settlement of class action lawsuits.oil,at.class actions increasingly incorporate bar orders because they play a key role in facilitating settlements.id.at.defendants buy little peace through settlement unless they are assured that they will be protected against codefendants efforts to shift their losses through for indemnity,contribution,and other causes related to the underlying litigation.id.moreover,precedent indicates that indemnification of participants in the context of securities violations is inconsistent with the policies underlying the securities laws.see,eichenholtz,at baker,watts miles stockbridge,cir stowell ted finkel inv,cir.unit b globus,at see also h stating that the sec position is that indemnification to officers and directors for liabilities arising under the securities act is against public policy and such indemnification is unenforceable,with the exception for expenses incurred in successful defense of any action.the cases have noted that such indemnification of participants would undermine a primary goal of securities,to encourage diligence and discourage negligence in securities transactions.thus,the third circuit in eichenholtz noted that generally,federal courts disallow claims for indemnification because such claims run counter to the policies underlying the federal securities acts.at.
in sum,we conclude that the language in the bar order barring scrushy potential claim against healthsouth for indemnification of any amounts he might pay in settlement of actual or threatened liability to the underlying plaintiffs is neither inconsistent with the mandatory contribution bar in the pslra,nor with public policy.we also reject scrushy argument that his claim is truly independent and that he received inadequate compensation.accordingly,the district court did not err in rejecting scrushy challenge in this regard.
scrushy challenge to that portion of the bar order that extinguished his contractual claim against healthsouth for advancement of legal fees in litigation with the underlying plaintiffs 
scrushy argument that his claim against healthsouth for advancement of fees is a truly independent claim because it is not measured by his liability to the underlying plaintiffs 
scrushy points out that the cases which have approved bar orders have involved orders that preclude claims by defendants against settling defendants where the injury to the defendant was its liability to the underlying plaintiffs.gerber,at see also heritage bond,at requiring modification of a bar order to ensure that it only extinguished claims for contribution,indemnity,and claims in which the injury was the defendants liability to the underlying plaintiffs tbg,bendis,cir stating that courts have only allowed bar orders barring claims measured by the defendant liability to the plaintiff,noting that no court had allowed the barring of claims with independent damages.for example,although the opinion of this circuit in in re oil gas litigation,supra,has been interpreted by other courts as staking out a broader scope for permissible bar orders,our recent opinion in aal high yield construed oil more narrowly.we held there the oil opinion expressly declined to address the issue of truly independent claims.at.rather,we pointed out that the precluded,pinnacle there was an attempt to seek indemnity from a a for the federal securities law violations alleged against pinnacle in the complaints in that very case,for pinnacle liability to those same plaintiffs.id.internal quotations omitted.we noted that pinnacle stated in its that it seeks damages against a a and riley to the extent that it is liable to any of the plaintiffs herein.id.internal quotations omitted.
indeed,the gerber opinion modified the bar order in that case to limit the barred claims to those where the injury is the defendants liability to the plaintiffs.at.the gerber court contemplated that daiwa a defendant not included in the settlement at issue may have sustained independent reputational damages arising out of a breached contractual or fiduciary relationship with the auditor a settling defendant.id.at the second circuit limited any such claim by daiwa against the auditor to the extent that the injury to the defendant under any such claim is its liability to the kayne plaintiffs.id.at.
scrushy argues that his contractual claim against healthsouth for advancement of his attorneys fees for defending suits against him by the underlying plaintiffs is a truly independent claim.his argument is that his injury is not measured by his liability to the underlying plaintiffs.rather,his injury is his payment of funds to his attorneys.therefore,scrushy argues,his claim is truly independent.
although we acknowledge that our research has uncovered no circuit court opinion which has addressed this issue,and although we acknowledge that the injury to scrushy with respect to this claim is not measured precisely by amounts scrushy has paid or might have to pay to the underlying plaintiffs,we nevertheless reject scrushy argument for the following reasons.although the attorneys fees for which scrushy seeks advancement are not paid directly to the underlying plaintiffs,we believe that the attorneys fees are nonetheless paid on account of liability to the underlying plaintiffs or the risk thereof.in a somewhat different context,the second circuit in denney approved a bar order extinguishing claims of a defendant seeking to recover from a settling defendant amounts paid by the defendant in a settlement with the underlying plaintiffs notwithstanding the fact that the settlement denied the defendant liability.the denney court held that such payments were nevertheless on account of liability or the risk thereof.denney,at.similarly,in this case,the attorneys fees for which scrushy seeks advancement were incurred on account of scrushy liability or the risk thereof to the underlying plaintiffs.scrushy claim for attorneys fees clearly can not be considered to be independent of his liability to the underlying plaintiffs.we believe that the nature of scrushy claim for advanced attorneys fees is so close to the nature of the claims which established case law holds are appropriately barred that our application of that case law here constitutes a minimal and reasonable extension thereof.
in sum,we reject scrushy argument that contractual claims for advancement of legal fees are claims that by their very nature,not being measured by liability to the underlying plaintiffs can not be precluded by bar orders.rather,we hold that scrushy claim is not a truly independent claim that might be per se inappropriate to bar.
scrushy public policy argument for advancement of attorneys fees 
scrushy makes the same public policy argument for advancement of fees as he did for reimbursement of settlement amounts.he argues that delaware law supports advancement of litigation fees for officers and directors to ensure that they will resist unjustified claims,and to encourage qualified individuals to serve.see stifel fin,supra.he notes that an innocent officer might have difficulty proving his innocence if attorneys fees are not advanced.
we note at the outset that the instant bar order expressly carves out and reserves to scrushy his claim for contractual reimbursement of fees if he prevails in the federal actions as required by the pslra.however,it is true that in the absence of fee advancement,an innocent officer or director might have difficulty proving his innocence,and thus might have difficulty realizing a prevailing status.
as noted above,however,these policy arguments supporting advancement of legal fees must be balanced against countervailing policies in favor of settlements and against indemnification in the securities litigation context.healthsouth might well have been reluctant to contribute for the settlement if it thought it would continue to be liable for endless legal fees to fund scrushy individual defense against the same violations,especially as healthsouth and the underlying plaintiffs perceive scrushy as a central figure in the violations.in other words,absent a bar of any claim by scrushy for advancement of legal fees,healthsouth would have bought only a limited peace in addition,the precedent discussed above suggests that advancement of legal fees might be inconsistent with the policies underlying the securities laws.see discussion in part,supra.although the policy against indemnification of participants in securities violations probably would not be inconsistent with advancement of fees to an outside director who the evidence suggested was excusably ignorant of the violations,we discuss below the fact that scrushy made no showing in the district court that he was merely an innocent bystander with respect to the violations at issue here.
in sum,we can not conclude that public policy considerations support scrushy challenge to the bar of his contractual claim against healthsouth for advancement of legal fees.
scrushy argument that preclusion of his contractual claim for advancement of legal fees was unjustified because he received no compensation therefor 
scrushy argues that he had a contractual agreement with healthsouth whereby healthsouth agreed to advance his legal fees incurred in suits against him for actions taken as an officer or a director of healthsouth,provided that he agreed to repay same if it is ultimately determined that he was not acting in good faith with a reasonable belief that he was acting in the best interest of healthsouth.scrushy now argues that this contractual claim against healthsouth was barred without any reciprocal bar placed upon healthsouth.in other words,because healthsouth possessed no such contractual right to advancement of its legal fees,there was no bar thereof scrushy argument seems to be that the adequate compensation required by the case law and pslra for a bar order must match each barred claim by a reciprocal bar of precisely the same kind placed upon the other party.
we reject scrushy argument as without merit.scrushy has offered no rationale and no authority to support a requirement of such precision.on rebuttal at oral argument,scrushy attorney finally conceded that there was no requirement for such precision.
we also hold that the overall compensation to scrushy was adequate.the judgment credit discussed above is significant compensation to scrushy.also,the bar order was reciprocal with respect to contribution claims it barred any contribution claim including defense costs by healthsouth or other released persons including settling insurers against scrushy.this constitutes very significant compensation to scrushy,in light of the perception by the underlying plaintiffs and healthsouth that scrushy was a central figure in the violations.additional compensation to scrushy took the form of an insurance credit.
we need not decide in this case the scope of a permissible departure from a precise match of each barred claim with a reciprocal bar of the same kind placed upon the other party.we noted above that there was in this case a reciprocal bar extinguishing any claims by healthsouth against scrushy in which healthsouth might have sought to require scrushy to contribute to healthsouth defense costs in the litigation with the underlying plaintiffs.see note,supra.thus,there is in this case some reciprocity with respect to defense costs there is simply not complete and precise reciprocity because there is no contract providing for scrushy to advance legal fees to healthsouth.in other words,our holding is a minimal and reasonable departure from such precision.
in sum,we conclude that the bar of scrushy claim against healthsouth for advancement of legal fees was supported by adequate compensation.
the effect of f b ii 
healthsouth in this appeal argues that there is a negative pregnant in f b ii that supports preclusion of scrushy claim for an advance of fees.that section provides as follows 
in any case in which a contractual relationship permits,a covered person that prevails in any private action may recover the attorney fees and costs of that covered person in connection with the action.
f b ii.because congress expressly provided for a covered person,such as scrushy,to recover attorneys fees if he prevailed in litigation with the underlying plaintiffs,it is of course possible to construe the provision as containing a negative pregnant that an advance of fees would be inappropriate.however,we decline to construe the statute as prohibiting enforcement of a contractual relationship for the advancement of fees,or even as placing a thumb on that side of the scale.we note that the provision occurs in the context of congress contemplation of completed,a judgment.thus,congress may or may not have been contemplating the issue of advancement of attorneys fees prior to judgment.moreover,we can contemplate situations in which the equities would indicate that a corporate officer should be permitted to enforce a contractual right to advancement of attorneys fees,an outside director who adduces credible evidence that he was excusably ignorant of the fraud,and who would be significantly prejudiced in his ability to prove his innocence in the absence of an advancement of fees.
we note that,in the absence of the negative pregnant urged upon us by healthsouth,the propriety of barring contractual claims for fee advancements,like scrushy,will be left to the sound discretion of district courts.in other words,district courts should consider the issue in light of the general standards for approval of such settlements and such bar orders in determining whether they are fair,adequate,and reasonable to the settling and parties.because we conclude below that the district court here did not abuse its discretion in barring scrushy claim for advancement of fees,we need not in this case decide whether f b ii contains such a negative pregnant.accordingly,we decline to decide that issue.
in light of the general fair,adequate and reasonable standard,did the district court abuse its discretion in barring scrushy contractual claim against healthsouth for advancement of legal fees 
applying the general fair,adequate and reasonable standard to scrushy argument,we readily conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion.we noted above our rejection of scrushy argument that his claim is a truly independent claim,our conclusion that public policy arguments do not support scrushy challenge,and our conclusion that scrushy received adequate compensation for barring his claim for advancement of fees.we now inquire whether other factors indicate that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that the bar order was fair,adequate and reasonable.as suggested above in weighing the conflicting public policy considerations,a very preliminary peek at the merits might be appropriate scrushy proffered or adduced no evidence in the district court indicating that he was merely an innocent bystander with respect to the violations.nor did he adduce any evidence of his inability to fund a full and adequate defense to any claims against him by the underlying plaintiffs.finally,the fact that scrushy failed to make this particular objection to the bar order until his reply in the district court in other words,the fact that scrushy raised the issue as an afterthought provides a strong indication that barring his claim for advancement of fees would not prejudice his ability to defend himself.it may also provide support for the view that even scrushy himself entertained little hope that he would be viewed as an innocent bystander.
in sum,we can not conclude that the district court committed either legal error or an abuse of discretion in permitting the bar to scrushy claim against healthsouth for advancement of legal fees.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we reject scrushy challenges to the instant bar order.we reject his several challenges to that portion of the bar order that bars his potential claim against healthsouth for indemnification of an
