harris associates advises the oakmark complex of mutual funds.these funds an fund is one that buys back its shares at current asset value have grown in recent years because their net returns have exceeded the market average,and the investment adviser compensation has grown apace.plaintiffs,who own shares in several of the oakmark funds,contend that the fees are too high and thus violate b of the investment company act of,b,a provision added in.the district court concluded that harris associates had not violated the act and granted summary judgment in its favor.wl,dist.lexis.
plaintiffs rely on several sections of the act in addition to b,and we can make short work of these.the act requires at least of a mutual fund trustees to be disinterested in the adviser,see a,and obliges the fund to reveal the financial links between its trustees and the adviser,see b.compensation for the adviser is controlled by a majority of the disinterested trustees.c.plaintiffs say that the oakmark funds have violated all of these rules.because none of the funds is a party to this suit,an order directing the funds to comply is not available as relief.plaintiffs say that the court could require harris to return the compensation it has received,but such a penalty would be disproportionate to the wrong.that not the only problem although b creates a private right of action,the other sections we have mentioned do not.we need not decide whether a private right of action should be implied,see alexander sandoval,d,or whether a sensible remedy could be devised,as there has been no violation of a or c.
victor morgenstern is among the funds trustees.until the end of,when he retired,morgenstern was a partner of harris associates and counted among the funds interested trustees.since his retirement,morgenstern has been treated as a disinterested trustee and has voted at the special meetings that deal with the adviser compensation.plaintiffs insist that morgenstern does not meet the statutory standards because harris associates bought out his partnership with a stream of payments that can be deferred if harris does not satisfy performance benchmarks in a given year.this makes the payments a form of profit sharing,plaintiffs contend,and because agreements are treated as securities under a,morgenstern owns securities in harris associates and is not disinterested.a b iii.moreover,plaintiffs continue,the oakmark funds did not disclose these facts to the public and so are out of compliance with b.
harris associates contends that payments fixed in amount are not profit sharing in the statutory sense just because the time of payment is uncertain.let us assume again without deciding that morgenstern held a security under the act because he was exposed to the risk of business reverses at his old firm.failure to disclose morgenstern payments from harris associates might support an order directing the funds to correct their annual reports and other official disclosure documents but would not justify any relief against harris associates.to get anywhere,even with a private right of action,plaintiffs would have to show the sort of violation that knocks out any valid contract between harris associates and the funds.only a violation of the independence rule or the rule could do that.yet most of the funds trustees are disinterested even if morgenstern is treated as interested.
during the time covered by the suit,the funds had nine or ten trustees,at least seven of whom are independent even if we count morgenstern as interested.that comfortably over the statutory requirement that of trustees be disinterested.and as the disinterested trustees unanimously approved the contracts with harris associates,it makes no difference how morgenstern is classified.plaintiffs ask us to suppose that morgenstern possessed some sway over the other trustees,so that his presence in the room was enough to spoil their decisions.but in and before,when morgenstern had been treated as interested,the disinterested trustees met in his absence and approved harris compensation.more although the disinterested directors initially meet separately,the whole board ultimately discusses and votes on the contract.a.interested directors are not silenced.so it is impossible to see how morgenstern role from through can be treated as poisoning the deliberations.
now for the main event plaintiffs contention that the adviser fees are excessive.they rely on b,which provides 
for the purposes of this subsection,the investment adviser of a registered investment company shall be deemed to have a fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of compensation for services,or of payments of a material nature,paid by such registered investment company,or by the security holders thereof,to such investment adviser or any affiliated person of such investment adviser.an action may be brought under this subsection by the commission,or by a security holder of such registered investment company on behalf of such company,against such investment adviser with respect to any such action the following provisions shall apply 
it shall not be necessary to allege or prove that any defendant engaged in personal misconduct,and the plaintiff shall have the burden of proving a breach of fiduciary duty.
in any such action approval by the board of directors of such investment company of such compensation or payments,or of contracts or other arrangements providing for such compensation or payments,and ratification or approval of such compensation or payments,or of contracts or other arrangements providing for such compensation or payments,by the shareholders of such investment company,shall be given such consideration by the court as is deemed appropriate under all the circumstances 
the district court followed gartenberg merrill lynch asset management,cir,and concluded that harris associates must prevail because its fees are ordinary.gartenberg articulated two variations on a theme 
t he test is essentially whether the fee schedule represents a charge within the range of what would have been negotiated at arm length in the light of all of the surrounding circumstances.
t o be guilty of a violation of b the must charge a fee that is so disproportionately large that it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm length bargaining.
ibid.oakmark fund paid harris associates per year of the first billion of the fund assets,of the next billion,of the next billion,and of anything over billion.the district court opinion sets out the fees for the other funds they are similar.it is undisputed that these fees are roughly the same in both level and breakpoints as those that other funds of similar size and investment goals pay their advisers,and that the fee structure is lawful under the investment advisers act.see.the oakmark funds have grown more than the norm for comparable pools,which implies that harris associates has delivered value for money.
plaintiffs contend that we should not follow gartenberg,for two principal reasons first,that the second circuit relies too much on market prices as the benchmark of reasonable fees,which plaintiffs insist is inappropriate because fees are set incestuously rather than by competition second,that if any market should be used as the benchmark,it is the market for advisory services to unaffiliated institutional clients.the first argument stems from the fact that investment advisers create mutual funds,which they dominate notwithstanding the statutory requirement that of trustees be disinterested.few mutual funds ever change advisers,and plaintiffs conclude from this that the market for advisers is not competitive.the second argument rests on the fact that harris associates,like many other investment advisers,has institutional clients such as pension funds that pay less.for a client with investment goals similar to oakmark fund,harris associates charges of the first million under management and of the amount over million,with intermediate breakpoints.plaintiffs maintain that a fiduciary may charge its controlled clients no more than its independent clients.
