appellants are class representatives of all persons who purchased stock in micrion corporation micrion between april and june.they allege that defendants micrion,nicholas economou,robert mcmenamin and david hunter were responsible for statements or omissions in violation of b and a of the securities exchange act of,b and a,and in violation of securities and exchange commission rule.the district court found that there was no genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the statements in question were misleading or fraudulent,and granted summary judgment to defendants.geffon micrion,d.this appeal followed.for the reasons explained herein,we affirm the grant of summary judgment,albeit based on different reasoning than that used by the district court,namely that appellants adduced insufficient evidence of defendants scienter.
background 
the district court presented the factual background at length in its grant of summary judgment.id.at.to the extent necessary,we revisit it here.the relevant facts are undisputed.
a.the agreement between micrion and 
micrion designs and manufacturers fib systems.prior to,micrion typically sold fib systems in small batches of one to two machines per customer.in early,micrion negotiated a sale of fib systems to corporation.under the terms of an equipment purchase agreement dated february,the agreement ordered fib systems to be delivered between march and september.micrion also agreed to sell up to fifty additional units upon the issuance of written releases from retained the ability to cancel in whole or part any purchase order with written notice.moreover,was in no way obligated to purchase any units for which it had not issued a written release.
b.the press releases and the conference call 
on march,micrion issued a press release the march release reporting that it had completed negotiation of a purchase agreement valued at over million,and that when combined with a previous agreement with the same customer,the total order was valued at over million.the march release also warned that the press release include d forward looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company actual results to vary materially.it referred readers to a form the filed with the securities and exchange commission on the same day.the identified a number of potential risks relevant to the agreement,including the exercise of cancellation or termination provisions,including provisions that entitle the customer to cancel issued purchase orders or to terminate the agreement for convenience.
on april,micrion issued a press release the april release announcing record revenues for its third quarter ending march.in the april release,economou stated that 
micrion booked an order worth over million for micrion fib systems to be used in a new production application.this order is an extension of the million order announced by micrion in october.the total order is now valued at over million,the largest order ever placed for fib equipment.
a note attached to the release referred investors to the for information on risks and uncertainties associated with forward looking statements contained therein.
also on april,economou and hunter held a conference call with securities brokers and analysts the conference call.during the call,hunter stated that micrion actual backlog totaled million as of the end of march.economou then had the following exchange with financial analyst mark fitzgerald to explain further what micrion meant by backlog 
fitzgerald i n terms of the timing on the backlog,this is all within months,that million,is that how you are defining your backlog 
economou that correct.
fitzgerald and when you said it was concentrated in the first two quarters,are we talking,percent of it in the first two quarters of 
economou no,i did mean to say quite that.i think what i said was that the significant shipments would start in the second half of the calendar year.i would necessarily say that the rest of the order or whatever is left of the order would be in the first six months of our fiscal year.i think it will be a little more evenly distributed than that.but it will certainly be within the twelve months starting from now.
during the conference call,micrion director of corporate relations bill monigle again referred to the,noting that there are important factors that might cause micrion performance to vary from that projected in the conference call and that current cautionary information identifying these factors could be found in the form.
subsequent events 
on april,investment bank hambrecht and quist issued a recommendation for micrion stock,resulting in a increase in the share price.a may,press release,while not identifying as micrion major customer,noted that the large order we recently booked makes up a major portion of the current backlog.the may release again warned investors of the risks that the agreement might be cancelled or terminated.on june,micrion stock price fell sharply,apparently in response to a dow jones report that weakness in the industry might hurt and soften its demand for micrion products.on june,cancelled some of its firm order reducing the stock ordered to units and indicated that it would not be placing orders for any of the units covered by the blanket order section of the agreement.micrion announced the cancellation in a press release dated june.
d.the allegedly misleading material statements and the alleged material omission 
although appellants made numerous claims of false and misleading statements by micrion in their original complaint,by the time of summary judgment and for purposes of this appeal,they pinpoint three particular statements and one alleged material omission.first,they claim that economou statement in the april release that micrion had booked an order worth over million was false and misleading because the term book an order refers only to orders where the customer was committed to purchasing the product ordered,firm orders.at the time that micrion issued the press release,had only placed a firm order for machines.the remainder of the machines were covered under a blanket order under which micrion was obligated to sell up to machines,but was not obligated to buy any for which it had not yet filed a written release.under appellants interpretation of book an order,micrion had booked an order for under million,not million.
second,appellants claim that economou inclusion of the entire order in actual backlog in the conference call was false and misleading because backlog only includes items for which a firm order had been placed,and not items covered under the blanket order.under this interpretation,micrion backlog as of april,would have been approximately million,rather than the million stated in the conference call.
third,appellants claim that economou statement that the rest of the order would certainly be shipped within twelve months of the conference call was false and misleading given that no specific delivery dates had been set for items under the blanket order,and that delivery for those items might never occur absent written purchase orders from.
finally,even if none of these specific statements was false and misleading,appellants claim that micrion failure to disclose that had no obligation to purchase a majority of the equipment covered by the agreement was a material omission actionable under rule.see,roeder alpha,cir citing sec.gulf sulphur,cir when a corporation does make a disclosure there is a duty to make it complete and accurate.
e.the two summary judgment opinions 
the district court originally denied defendant motion for summary judgment.geffon micrion,memorandum and order hereinafter geffon,first summary judgment opinion.the court held that there were multiple plausible interpretations of the statements at issue,and that a reasonable jury could find that any of the three statements was misleading in context.see id.at.the court also found that genuine dispute s of fact existed as to whether the statements were material.id.at.most notably for our purposes,the court noted that the question of scienter should ordinarily be left to the trier of fact,id.at quoting in re apple computer sec,cir,and concluded that because evidence has been proffered that defendants knew that had not committed itself to purchasing the machines from micrion,a genuine dispute of fact existed as to the question of scienter,id.at.although the district court refused to grant summary judgment for defendants,it explicitly noted that it would not allow this case to proceed to a jury trial until plaintiffs have identified factual issues for submission to the jury,and it reserved the option of reconsidering its summary judgment ruling should it not be persuaded that a material fact was genuinely in dispute.id.at.
after accepting proposed jury questions and limited additional evidence immaterial for the purposes of this appeal,the court revisited its summary judgment opinion.it determined that the evidence proffered by appellants was insufficient to show a genuine dispute of material fact.geffon,d at.it based this determination on its conclusion that,as a matter of law,the agreement constituted a firm order for units and a blanket order for units.id.as a result of this legal conclusion,the court determined that no reasonable jury could find micrion use of the word order to be false and misleading in the respect alleged by plaintiffs,and thus no actionable misrepresentations had been made by micrion or micrion officers to the extent the court addressed the question of scienter,it noted that its conclusion that defendants were entitled to summary judgment was reenforced by consideration of greebel ftp software,cir,which had required heightened pleading requirements with respect to scienter after passage of the private securities litigation reform act the pslra.
discussion 
the district court grant of summary judgment is subject to plenary review,with all inferences indulged in favor of the party.lucia prospect high income portfolio,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the record indicates no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.citing.c.the may not rely on allegations in its pleadings,but must set forth specific facts indicating a genuine issue for trial.id.citing.e.
in order to prove a claim,plaintiffs must demonstrate that defendants made a materially false or misleading statement or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make a statement not misleading that defendants acted with scienter that either plaintiffs or the market relied on the misrepresentation or omission and resultant injury.shaw digital equip,cir.for purposes of this opinion,we need only discuss the first factor,on which the district court premised its opinion,and the second factor,on which we focus our energies.
a.the statements at issue revisited 
the district court ultimately concluded either that the statements at issue were not misleading as a matter of law,or that no reasonable jury could have found that they were misleading.appellants argue that this conclusion was in error,and that they proffered sufficient evidence to make it a question for the trier of fact whether the statements were misleading or not in short,appellants claim that under one plausible interpretation of the statements in question,economou represented that was obligated to purchase all units.in other words,appellants suggest that a reasonable jury could have found any of the following i that the statement that micrion had booked an order for million was false or misleading because it indicated,wrongly,that micrion had received a firm order for million worth of equipment ii that the statement that micrion backlog was million was false or misleading because the term backlog only included equipment which a customer was obligated to buy,which only totaled approximately million at the time of the statement or iii that economou statement that all units would certainly be delivered within the next twelve months was false or misleading because had only committed to purchase units.alternatively,appellants argue that the failure to disclose that had no obligation to buy units was a material omission,viewed in the context of the information provided in the agreement.
for purposes of this appeal,we assume that there were triable issues of fact as to the falsity or misleading nature of these statements.as we explain below,however,we affirm the grant of summary judgment on the separate ground that appellants introduced insufficient evidence of scienter.burns state police ass of,cir court of appeals may affirm a grant of summary judgment on any ground supported by the record.
in order to prevail in a action,a plaintiff must show that defendants had the requisite scienter,namely,the intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.ernst ernst hochfelder,d.scienter may be established by proving knowing conduct on the part of defendants,sec macdonald,cir,which entails more than mere proof that the defendants knowingly made a particular statement.the plaintiff must prove that defendants knew i that the statement was false or misleading,and ii that it was made in reference to a matter of material interest to investors.id.at requiring knowledge that posed a risk of misleading investors see also sec world radio mission,cir intent to deceive means intent to say something that is not believed to be true,or,if strictly true,is hoped will be understood in an untruthful sense.
alternatively,we have indicated that in the absence of knowing conduct,reckless statements of misleading facts may be actionable under however,recklessness in this sense is more than mere negligence.greebel,at recklessness in this context comes closer to being a lesser form of intent quoting hoffman estabrook,cir see also id.at recklessness means a highly unreasonable omission,involving not merely simple,or even inexcusable,negligence,but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,and which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious the actor must have been aware of it quoting sundstrand sun chem,cir.
in greebel,we revisited the substantive evidentiary requirements for an inference of scienter,albeit in the context of the allegations required to survive a motion to dismiss after the passage of the pslra.we noted that this court does not categoriz e patterns of facts as acceptable or unacceptable to prove scienter,but instead analyze s the particular facts alleged in each individual case to determine whether the allegations are sufficient to prove scienter.at.at the pleading stage,an allegation that defendants had the motive and opportunity to make false or misleading statements is insufficient to support the strong inference of scienter required after the pslra.id.at citing maldonado domínguez,cir in other words,a plaintiff must allege some additional misconduct from which a jury can draw a reasonable inference of intentional deception.evidence we have found relevant to the scienter issue includes insider trading in conjunction with false or misleading statements a divergence between internal reports and public statements disclosure of inconsistent information shortly after the making of a fraudulent statement or omission bribery by top company officials evidence of an ancillary lawsuit,charging fraud,which was quickly settled disregard of current factual information acquired prior to the statement at issue accounting shenanigans and evidence of actions taken solely out of.id.at compiling first circuit cases.
although greebel dealt with how much evidence of scienter is necessary to prevail at the pleading stage,we agree with the district court that t he judicial reasoning applicable to imposing heightened pleading requirements is at least as forceful,if not more so,with regard to proof requirements that a trial judge must consider in deciding whether to allow a motion for summary judgment.geffon,d at.if allegations of motive and opportunity are not sufficient at the pleading stage,clearly evidence of mere motive and opportunity can not suffice against a motion for summary judgment on the issue of scienter.here,appellants proffered no evidence which would enable a reasonable jury to infer scien
