between april and april,barclays completed four offerings,from which lead plaintiffs and members of the putative class purchased some million shares at per share,yielding proceeds to barclays of billion.the four offerings were made pursuant to two shelf registration statements,one filed in september and another in august,as well as supplemental prospectuses filed on the dates of the offerings april,the series offering september,the series offering november,the series offering and april,the series offering collectively the offering materials.
as has been well documented,in the years leading up to,an increased demand for homes,low interest rates,and easy access to credit fueled a rise in home prices and home building.to feed the growing demand for home ownership,mortgage loans were extended to many borrowers including those whose ability to repay was questionable.lenders were willing take on borrowers because the mortgages could be syndicated and sold into a robust market for securities mbss,collateralized debt obligations cdos,and other similar securities.to hedge their investments in these complex securities,banks and other purchasers required that the securities be insured through monoline insurers.in this climate,in april,barclays completed its series offering,yielding proceeds of million.
by late and through,faced with inflated mortgage payments and declining home values,borrowers began defaulting on their mortgages.in turn,the securities that were linked to payments by these borrowers began to decline in value.banks that had substantial exposure to securities,either by holding the securities or having lent to entities who held them,began to experience losses.many monoline insurers had difficulty absorbing the losses,which were occurring on an unprecedented scale.
in september,barclays series offering yielded billion.that same fall,many of barclays peers reported substantial losses as a consequence of the deteriorating securities market.for example,in october,merrill lynch announced that it was writing down the value of the cdos it held by billion.later that month,ubs announced a billion writedown in the value of its cdo and residential mbs assets.seemingly less affected than its peers,barclays did not take any substantial writedowns at that point.rather,on november,barclays issued an unscheduled and unannounced trading update,disclosing that while it held a total of billion in and other instruments,it had taken only a billion writedown on its cdo and subprime assets.the following week,barclays proceeded with its billion series offering.
in february,barclays announced its results and reported that it had written down the value of its assets by billion over the preceding year.meanwhile many of barclays peers had taken significantly larger writedowns,and some were on the verge of bankruptcy.in april,barclays completed its series offering,yielding billion.
in august,after completing the four offerings at issue,barclays disclosed that its net income had declined in the first half of the year,due in part to a billion writedown it had taken on its assets.by october,barclays revealed that it was in need of capital,and later that month,it announced that,in order to raise billion in capital,it was selling a third of the bank to middle eastern investors.barclays also set up a hedge fund to purchase toxic assets off of its balance sheets.by march,the shares in question,which had initially sold for,were trading between and dollars.
in early,the lead plaintiffs,who purchased shares in each of the four offerings,sued under and a alleging that defendants had made material misrepresentations and omissions in the offering materials by failing to adequately disclose barclays exposure to risks and by misleadingly assuring investors that barclays risk management practices would prevent massive losses.lead plaintiffs claims were also premised on defendants alleged failure to accurately value and timely write down barclays related assets as the value of those assets declined and their alleged failure to comply with international financial reporting standards ifrs and sec regulations.
the defendants moved to dismiss,alleging that the complaint failed to state a claim,that lead plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue a a claim,that the claims relating to the series,and offerings were,and that the lead plaintiff for the series offering claims was not an adequate lead plaintiff.the district court agreed and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.in re barclays bank plc sec,cv,wl.the court concluded that the claims regarding the series,and offerings were and in any event,those claims,along with the series offering allegations,failed to adequately plead violations of and a.id.at.the district court reasoned that the pleadings were inadequate because the specific credit exposures allegedly omitted were not actually required to be disclosed,and the allegedly insufficient writedowns of barclays assets were based on subjective determinations and were therefore not actionable absent plausible allegations that defendants disbelieved the subjective valuations at the time they made them.id.at.
in addition,the district court concluded that the lead plaintiffs lacked standing to bring a claims as they failed to allege that they had purchased the relevant shares directly from barclays.id.at.further,with respect to just the series offering claims,the district court concluded that because the only series lead plaintiff,martin ettin,had purchased his series shares after barclays made corrective disclosures,he knew of the alleged untruths at the time of purchase and therefore could not recover under and a,much less serve as a lead plaintiff.id.at.
soon after the dismissal,lead plaintiffs moved for reconsideration,requesting that the court modify its dismissal to be without prejudice and grant them leave to amend their complaint.they submitted a proposed second consolidated amended complaint the proposed complaint,which included,among other changes,amended allegations regarding the series offering that ostensibly addressed the pleading deficiencies identified by the district court.significantly,the proposed complaint alleged that the defendants did not believe that the writedowns barclays took on its assets were sufficient.after reviewing the proposed complaint,the district court denied reconsideration,holding that amendment would be futile as lead plaintiffs could not allege that the defendants had
