on july,the williams companies,wmb announced that it would be spinning off its telecommunications subsidiary,williams communications group wcg,in a move that it called the best way to ensure that both our energy and communications businesses have the efficient and effective access to the capital necessary to pursue the substantial growth that each enjoys.not two years later,on april,wcg filed for bankruptcy and its stock hit.a nationwide class of plaintiffs who purchased stock or notes issued by wcg between those dates brought fraud claims under b and a of the securities exchange act and rule.the district court found genuine issues of material fact as to falsity,materiality,and scienter in connection with numerous alleged misrepresentations,but granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on the issues of loss causation and damages.the plaintiffs had attempted to prove the latter with the expert testimony of blaine nye,but the court found his testimony unreliable under daubert because his theories of loss causation could not distinguish between loss attributable to the alleged fraud and loss attributable to related news and events.the plaintiffs appeal the exclusion of nye testimony and the grant of summary judgment we affirm.
background 
a.the rise and fall of wcg 
as an energy company that produces and transports natural gas,wmb owns a large network of pipelines.in the,it began running cable through decommissioned pipelines and formed a telecommunications subsidiary that built a network.it sold that subsidiary in and entered into a temporary agreement that prevented it from reentering the telecommunications industry until.during this interim,telecommunications stocks continued to rise,with the telecom index growing from at the beginning of to by that year end,an increase of.when the agreement expired,wmb formed a new subsidiary,wcg,that set out to build a nationwide network using the decommissioned pipeline that wmb still owned.in october,when the telecom index had reached,wcg conducted an ipo to raise additional capital for its network expansion.over the next few months both wcg share price and the telecom index climbed even higher,with wcg peaking at on march,and the telecom index peaking three days later at.
at that point,wcg stock price began to decline,and by july,had fallen more than to.during that same period the telecom index declined.on july,first day of the class announced that it would spin off wcg,making it a company.wcg stock was trading at that day.
the plaintiffs allege that wmb,wcg,and various corporate officers publicly misrepresented the reasons for the,the prospects for wcg survival as a company,and the adequacy of wcg capitalization.publicly,for instance,wmb issued a press release saying,our energy and communications businesses have tremendous opportunities before them.creating the most effective and efficient access to capital will help fuel that growth,and we believe that can best be achieved by creating two independent businesses.private discussions within the wmb board,however,seem to show that the true reason for the was that wcg growing capital needs were a drain on wmb balance sheet,and that wmb needed to heave the junk called wcg overboard as fast as possible.wmb ceo,defendant keith bailey,told shareholders that wcg was strongly positioned for success with the financial resources in place to enable it to deliver on the promise of a very bright future.he announced that wcg was for their capital needs to carry them to that point of ebitda positive,and during the road show,senior executives said that the better enables each company to execute its respective business plan optimizes access to capital and creates a for wmb and wcg shareholders.internally,however,there seems to have been much more pessimism about the continuing availability of enough capital to satisfy wcg appetite.officers were warning that wcg was still approximately million through the end of,and that wcg did not have any choice at this point other than going on a rigid,essential need only capital diet while it restore d capital capacity through operating performance and selling non core assets.in short,plaintiffs allege that the defendants public statements painted a rosy view of wcg future prospects as an independent company,when in reality its need for capital and growing debt not only called future profitability into doubt,but was indeed the motivation for the itself.
this gap between the public statements and internal assessments continued up to and after the occurred on april.in august,for instance,wcg publicly announced that it continues to project becoming free cash flow positive by,and its ceo,howard janzen,said that,with funding that takes us into,a plan to be free cash flow positive by the end of,and the right team and strategy in place,we are positioned to not only survive the current shakeout,but thrive in the years to come.at the same time,internal assessments recognized that wcg lack of funding was growing more and more worrisome in light of its large amount of debt.a presentation to the board in august said that,f rom a financial standpoint we realize the cash generated from our business is insufficient to service our debt.the wcg board considered a number of options for generating additional cash to service the company debt,but none seemed feasible.wcg stock price continued to decline,and by the end of it was trading at per share.the telecom index had fallen to.
on january,wmb issued a press release announcing the delay of its earnings report pending assessment of wmb contingent obligations with respect to wcg.wcg stock fell from to.that same day,one of wcg competitors wrote down billion worth of assets,and the day before another of wcg competitors announced bankruptcy.also that day,milberg weiss filed the first of the lawsuits that would later be consolidated into the present case.on february,wcg issued a press release announcing that its lenders had informed wcg that it might be in default,and that wcg was performing a review of the possible impairment of its assets.the stock price fell from to.on february,wcg issued another press release.this time it announced that it was considering the potential benefits of a chapter bankruptcy.the stock price fell to.after the market closed on april,wcg filed for bankruptcy.at the end of the next day,its stock closed at.
nye testimony 
the controversy in the present case concerns the plaintiffs ability to present a theory of loss causation.while the district court agreed that triable issues of fact existed with regard to whether the defendants made misrepresentations,whether they knew they were false,and whether those misrepresentations were material,the plaintiffs also bore the burden of demonstrating that the decline in the price of wcg stock and notes was attributable to a draining of the fraud premium.their one expert on the subject,nye,presented two basic scenarios 
in scenario,nye used a leakage theory to identify the losses that could be attributed to the disclosure of the fraud.under this theory,the fraud was not revealed to the market by a single corrective disclosure,but instead the leakage of wcg true financial condition and prospects during the class period revealed the risks that had been concealed by the prior misrepresentations.nye rpt.the losses were caused by the materialization of the concealed risks,specifically that wcg assets were overstated,that wcg was in default of its debt covenants,and that there was significant uncertainty about wcg ability to continue as a going concern.id.scenario posited that wcg true value,had the defendants not made their rosy statements about wcg prospects,was its value upon declaring bankruptcy.nye therefore began with the at which wcg was trading upon filing for bankruptcy,and then incorporated the movements of the market and industry back to july,the first day of the class period.doing this,he concluded that wcg true value on the day wmb announced the was not,but.id.at.under scenario,nye attributed almost all of wcg the fraud,and assumed that almost the entire decline in price was the result of the truth gradually leaking into the market,despite the fact that the decline in wcg share price closely correlated with the overall decline in the telecommunications industry as a whole.
the district court found scenario an unreliable method for identifying the loss attributable to the alleged fraud.for one thing,while nye claimed to remove the market and industry effects on the value of wcg stock and notes,he did not even purport,in scenario,to have removed the effects of n onfraud information.dist.op.at.instead,scenario attributed any decline in wcg value that was independent of market and industry effects to the exposure of the fraud.this fail ed to differentiate between losses rooted in causes cognizable under loss causation doctrine,on one hand,and,on the other hand,losses attributable to stresses,the meltdown in the telecommunications sector,and other negative developments unrelated to the alleged fraud.id.at.the district court second objection to scenario was that nye had not identified any public disclosures before january,that even arguably alerted the market to the fraud,other than to say that disclosures occurred every day.id.at.thus,remarkably,he has not identified either fraud or related news much less parsed the effects of the two for the class period through january,even though loss causation requires proof that a market decline was the result of the revelation of a misrepresentation or omission.id.at.
scenario and the corresponding notes scenario was based upon a corrective disclosure theory.here,nye focused on the price declines after four specific public disclosures wmb delay of its earnings report on january wcg february announcement that it might be in default wcg february announcement that it was considering bankruptcy and wcg actual filing for bankruptcy on april.nye calls these four announcements partial disclosures,as they did not precisely mirror the alleged misrepresentations but nonetheless revealed the risks that had been concealed by the prior misrepresentations and omissions,and therefore plaintiffs losses were caused by the materialization of the concealed risks.nye rpt.at.nye attributed the decline in value after each corrective disclosure,net of market and industry effects that he purported to isolate through a regression analysis to the revelation of fraud.
the district court found scenario unreliable because it is not supported by a showing of material,new,and information that became available to the efficient market on january,or on the three subsequent corrective disclosure dates proposed by plaintiffs.dist.op.at.the new was in reference to the fact that milberg weiss had filed the cali complaint on that day,alleging the very fraud that was allegedly exposed.the district court believed that if the information had been sufficiently exposed such that milberg weiss was able to file its detailed allegations of fraud,then nye claim that new information was being revealed to the market was considering that the share price did not significantly drop.id.at.furthermore,scenario suffered from the same flaws as scenario nye did not distinguish between declines attributable to disclosures of fraud and declines attributable to information.
summary judgment 
after excluding nye expert testimony as unreliable under daubert,the district court determined that the plaintiffs had failed to present evidence sufficient to raise a triable issue as to loss causation.id.at.for largely the same reasons that it excluded nye testimony,the court found that the plaintiffs had failed to present evidence of a causal connection between the decline in value and the exposure of the misrepresentations,and had failed to separate losses from losses attributable to other factors.it therefore granted the defendants motion for summary judgment.id.at.the plaintiffs now appeal both the court daubert ruling and the grant of summary judgment.
ii.discussion 
loss causation under dura 
in a private securities fraud action the plaintiff must prove that the defendants made a material misrepresentation or omission with scienter in connection with the purchase or sale of a security upon which the plaintiff relied that the plaintiff suffered an economic loss and that the material misrepresentation was the cause of that loss.see stoneridge inv.partners,llc,d.the sixth element is commonly referred to as loss causation.see emergent capital inv,llc stonepath group,cir loss causation is the causal link between the alleged misconduct and the economic harm ultimately suffered by the plaintiff.pasley freeman,eng,if,indeed,no injury is occasioned by the lie,it is not actionable but if it be attended with a damage,it then becomes the subject of an action.
before,there was some confusion amongst the courts as to what exactly plaintiffs had to show in order to prove loss causation,with the ninth circuit holding that a plaintiff need only show that the price on the date of purchase was inflated because of the misrepresentation,knapp ernst whinney,cir,and other circuits holding that an allegation of a value disparity,standing alone,can not satisfy the loss causation pleading requirement.emergent capital,at.the supreme court resolved the confusion in dura pharmaceuticals,broudo by rejecting the ninth circuit approach and holding that an inflated purchase price will not itself constitute or proximately cause the relevant economic loss,d.alleging that price has been inflated as a result of a misrepresentation is not if the plaintiff has suffered a the plaintiff can identify a causal connection between the loss and the misrepresentation.id.at.
even if the truth has made its way into the marketplace,dura requires that a plaintiff show that it was this revelation that caused the loss and not one of the tangle of factors that affect price.id.at.
when the purchaser subsequently resells such shares,even at a lower price,that lower price may reflect,not the earlier misrepresentation,but changed economic circumstances,changed investor expectations,new or facts,conditions,or other events,which taken separately or together account for some or all of that lower price.
id.at.the securities laws are not meant to provide investors with broad insurance against market losses,but to protect them against those economic losses that misrepresentations actually cause.id.at.the plaintiff bears the burden of showing that his losses were attributable to the revelation of the fraud and not the myriad other factors that affect a company stock price.without showing a causal connection that specifically links losses to misrepresentations,he can not succeed.
nye testimony 
before expert testimony can be admitted,federal rule of evidence requires the district court to ensure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant,but reliable.daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d.in performing this gatekeeper role,the judge must assess the reasoning and methodology underlying the expert opinion,then determine whether it is scientifically valid and applicable to a particular set of facts.burlington northern and santa fe ry.grant,cir.see also daubert,at.instructing district courts to consider the relevance,or fit,of the testimony in resolving the factual dispute.the question before us is whether either of nye methods could reliably link the class losses to the revelation of the alleged misrepresentations,as dura requires.we review the district court decision to admit or deny testimony for abuse of discretion.joiner,d burlington northern,at.
loss causation is easiest to show when a corrective disclosure reveals the fraud to the public and the price subsequently,of course,that the plaintiff could isolate the effects from any other intervening causes that could have contributed to the decline.see,in re winstar commc ns,wl,at.dura did not suggest that this was the only or even the preferred method of showing loss causation,though it acknowledged that the relevant truth can leak out,dura,at,which would argue against a strict rule requiring revelation by a single disclosure.see in re seitel.sec,d,t he supreme court did not adopt the argument that a plaintiff must show that the stock price declined due to a specific corrective disclosure or financial restatement.in re bradley.sec,d,rejecting argument that dura mandates a corrective disclosure method for proving loss causation in re enron,derivative erisa,d.by premising scenario on a leakage theory rather than a corrective disclosure theory,therefore,nye methodology does not automatically run afoul of dura.
to satisfy the requirements of dura,however,any a leakage theory that posits a gradual exposure of the fraud rather than a full and immediate have to show some mechanism for how the truth was revealed.see in re worldcom.sec,wl,at,plaintiff must establish that his losses were attributable to some form of revelation to the market of the wrongfully concealed information emphasis added.a plaintiff can not simply state that the market had learned the truth by a certain date and,because the learning was a gradual process,attribute all prior losses to the revelation of the fraud.the inability to point to a single corrective disclosure does not relieve the plaintiff of showing how the truth was revealed he can not say,well,the market must have known.
it was precisely this failure to describe how the market was alerted to the fraud between july,the first day of the class period and january,the day of the first potential corrective disclosure that led the district court to reject scenario as unreliable.at one point nye argued that a number of tiny corrective disclosures occurred each and every day of the class period,which had the cumulative effect of gradually disclosing the fraud.
a nye i think under scenario i say that corrective disclosures are throughout the class period on the beginning of the class period.
q okay.and on what days were there corrective disclosures under scenario 
a scenario,every day.in other words,the whole thing is a manipulated period.
nye dep.he even submitted a compendium of news articles,reports,and sec filings that was supposed to show numerous instances of leakage of corrective information concerning wcg true financial condition.dist.the majority of these allegedly corrective disclosures,however,were actually either news that was generally applicable to the telecommunications industry as a whole,or was an upbeat rather than negative statement about wcg.dist.as it would be difficult to characterize an announcement that contained no negative information about wcg as revelatory of the truth about wcg grim prospects,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in rejecting the theory that these disclosures leaked the truth to the market.
the primary justification for scenario,however,was not that any specific disclosure alerted the market to the fraud,but that the fraud was revealed once the previously concealed risks materialized.according to nye,plaintiffs losses were caused by the materialization of the concealed risks,specifically that wcg assets were overstated,that wcg was in default of its debt covenants,and that there was significant uncertainty about wcg ability to continue as a going concern.nye.rpt.the problem is that nye identifies no point between july,and january,when these concealed risks did materialize.while the truth could be revealed by the actual materialization of the concealed risk rather than by a public disclosure that the risk exists,see lentell merrill lynch,cir loss can be caused by materialization of the concealed risk,any theory of loss causation would still have to identify when the materialization occurred and link it to a corresponding loss.
plaintiffs argue that scenario was reasonable in light of nye premise that wcg true,share price on each day of the class period was very low.aplt.br.in other words,because nye opined that wcg true value was at the level the company was trading on the day it declared bankruptcy,any decline in price before bankruptcy must have resulted from the draining of the fraud premium.while an expert testimony that a security value has been inflated by fraud throughout the class period could be relevant for showing transaction causation,it does not show loss causation.see lentell,at allegations that market price of the securities was artificially inflated and that securities were acquired at artificially inflated prices may establish transaction causation,but do not establish loss causation.loss causation requires a showing of more than an artificially inflated price and subsequent decline.dura,at.until the fraud is revealed the purchasers actually benefit from the inflation and therefore have no legally compensable injury.
nye scenario bootstraps from the conclusion that wcg was essentially valueless from the start to a scenario where any decline was a recognition of this truth and therefore a draining of the fraud premium.he fails,however,to identify any causal link between the revelation of the truth and the decline in price from july,to january.wcg share price fell from to during that period,and while nye could not explain how the market learned of the fraud over that,he claimed that the decline must have resulted from its revelation and not from the tangle of factors that affect a company stock the fact that the same period witnessed the bankruptcies of wcg competitors,a decline in the telecommunications industry as a whole,and the overall market declines that followed the terrorist attacks.see dura,at.other things being equal,the longer the time between the purchase and sale,the more likely that other factors caused the loss.this failure to show a causal connection between the fraud and the loss would turn the securities laws into just the sort of broad insurance against market losses that dura rejected.id.at.we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in finding that nye failure to explain how the truth was revealed to the market and failure to then link the revelation of truth to a corresponding loss made his theory unreliable.
while plaintiffs preferred scenario because it would allow them to recover for the entire decline in wcg stock price,including the decline from to,nye also provided a more modest method for demonstrating loss causation that would identify specific corrective disclosures rather than conclusively assert a leakage of the relevant information.he identified four such disclosures that occurred in the early months of wmb january announcement that it was assessing its contingent obligations related to wcg wcg february announcement that its lenders had informed wcg that it might be in default wcg february announcement that it was considering chapter and wcg april filing for said bankruptcy.the district court found nye attempt at identifying corrective disclosures inadequate,however,because scenario was not supported by a showing of material,new,and information that became available to the efficient market on january,or on the three subsequent corrective disclosure dates proposed by the plaintiffs.dist.op.at.in other words,nye had not shown why these disclosures should be considered corrective such that corresponding losses could be reliably attributed to the revelation of fraud rather than other factors.
any reliable theory of loss causation that uses corrective disclosures will have to show both that corrective information was revealed and that this revelation caused the resulting decline in price.to be corrective,the disclosure need not precisely mirror the earlier misrepresentation,but it must at least relate back to the misrepresentation and not to some other negative information about the company.see caremark,coram healthcare,cir stating that loss causation can be proved by showing defendant made a fraudulent misstatement and that this misstatement was responsible for its damage emphasis added.nye himself,however,could not tie these four particular disclosures to any of the alleged misrepresentations or describe why they should be considered corrective.in his deposition,he admitted,i have not tied those four things specifically to allege d misrepresentations.nye dep.at.plaintiffs offer an explanation for his failure that these four disclosures revealed the same relevant truth,which was that wcg likely would not be able to repay its debt as scheduled and,therefore
