petitioner russell ponce ponce petitions for review of the securities and exchange commission sec ruling that he violated the securities exchange act of exchange act,section b and rule thereunder,by preparing and certifying financial statements of american aircraft corporation aac,filed with the sec,that ponce knew,or was reckless in not recognizing,were false willfully aided,abetted,and caused aac to violate exchange act section a,and rules,and,by filing reports with the sec that contained false statements of material fact,and failing to correct misleading or omitted information willfully aided,abetted,and caused aac to violate exchange act section b,by failing to maintain aac books,records,and accounts to accurately and fairly reflect the transaction and disposition of aac assets and violated rules e ii and iii of the sec rules of practice by engaging in improper or unethical professional conduct in connection with aac accounting,and by aiding,abetting,and causing aac violation of federal securities laws,and rules and regulations thereunder.as a result of its decision,the sec ordered ponce to cease and desist his fraudulent activities,and permanently barred him from practicing before the sec.
we hold that substantial evidence supports the sec ruling that ponce violated federal securities laws,rules,and regulations in the course of performing accounting and auditing services for aac.we further hold that the sec decision was not arbitrary,capricious,or otherwise not in accordance with the law,and that the sanctions imposed on ponce by the sec were not an abuse of discretion.
ponce was a certified public accountant and served as aac independent auditor from to.the sec proceedings against ponce stem from two distinct aac matters and ponce role in their reporting and auditing.the sec alleged that ponce violated federal securities law by license designs that aac purchased from moody design bureau and preparing,certifying,and submitting reports containing this to the sec and characterizing certain tooling and prototype expenses as inventory in aac financial statements.it also held that ponce had violated sec rules of practice e ii and iii by engaging in improper professional conduct,and by virtue of assisting aac violations of federal securities laws.
the sec enforcement division issued an order instituting proceedings oip and instituted a cease and desist proceeding against ponce pursuant to section of the exchange act on february.a hearing on the matter was held before an administrative law judge alj,during which moody,adolfo batista and loreto tersigni,a certified public accountant who was qualified as an expert regarding generally accepted accounting principles gaap,generally accepted auditing standards gaas,and professional standards in accounting,testified.ponce also testified on his own behalf.crediting ponce explanations of his accounting and auditing practices discussed infra,and noting the inherent difficulties of precise financial reporting,the alj ruled that ponce did not violate rule e ii or iii of the sec rules of practice,nor did he willfully violate or willfully aid or abet the violation of any federal securities laws,rules,or regulations.
the sec enforcement division appealed the alj decision.after conducting an independent review of the record,the sec reversed the alj decision.ponce filed a timely petition for review on october.
the following is a recitation of the undisputed facts with respect to each of the matters involved in the sec proceedings against ponce.
a.the license designs 
in february,aac purchased from moody design bureau,a sole proprietorship of william moody moody,all rights and an exclusive license to manufacture certain aircraft,patent application files,copyrights,and design patents for aircraft and helicopters hereinafter the license designs,for million shares of restricted aac stock.
in march,aac acquired the assets and operations of phalanx organization,phalanx.this transaction is termed a reverse acquisition,because aac purchased all of phalanx assets,valued by aac at.in exchange,aac issued shares of its common stock for the assets,the equivalent of a share.prior to the merger,moody was phalanx president and controlling shareholder after the transaction,he became the president and ceo of aac.
in his audit of aac financial statements,ponce valued the license designs as an asset worth.after discussions with aac management,ponce arrived at this valuation by taking aac share bid quoted on nasdaq on the day aac issued the million restricted shares in exchange for the license designs,and discounting it by fifty percent.
tooling and prototype costs 
moody executed and sent letters to ponce for aac,and financial statements,representing that aac had progressed beyond the research and development stage in developing certain aircraft and that,as a result,their tooling was properly capitalized.specifically,the letters stated that in this was true for the dragon,falcon,hind,patriot,and cobra projects in for the dragon,falcon,hind,and penetrator projects and in for the falcon,hind,patriot,and penetrator projects.however,in the form annual reports for and,aac disclosed that it had not completed development on its penetrator helicopter project.also,at the hearing before the alj,moody testified that the falcon and hind were never flight tested.
additionally,in april,aac board of directors passed a resolution that the tools for the hind,falcon and dragon aircraft be capitalized in the amount of.however,aac form annual report stated that the company had recently acquired designs for the hind,falcon,dragon,and patriot and had to expend a significant amount of its capital in their research,development and tooling.
at the hearing before the alj,ponce testified that he discussed the treatment of tooling costs with aac management.initially it was ponce belief that they be treated as research and development however,moody insisted that since it was not new technology,it should be capitalized.ponce had previously told moody on other occasions that tooling costs were research and development and thus should be expensed.as such,the tooling costs were initially recorded as expenses when incurred.
in the end,ponce treated aac tools as assets worth in the form annual report for.similarly,in its form annual report,tools and molds were treated as assets worth.this was true even though the penetrator was the only project in active development and aac had written off tools for projects that were deferred in the amount of.
prototypes 
during fiscal year,aac capitalized certain costs related to the manufacture of its aircraft prototypes.in its form,aac disclosed that since january,it had been developing the penetrator,a remanufactured version of the huey helicopter,that was now obsolete.they also disclosed that after flight testing,which began in december,the single penetrator proof of concept would be disassembled and analyzed.ponce initially recorded the prototype costs for the penetrator as expenses when incurred.once again,moody disagreed with ponce characterization of the prototype costs because he believed them to be assets.ponce then directed aac bookkeeper,adolfo batista,to adjust the accounting records and financial statements for to reflect moody position that the prototype costs were assets.in the end,aac reported the penetrator prototype as assets valued at and in and,respectively.
ponce unpaid fees 
during the years in question,aac accumulated and carried a balance of outstanding fees that it owed ponce for his accounting and auditing services.these outstanding fees serve as a basis for the sec allegations that ponce violated rule e ii of the sec rules of practice,engaging in improper professional conduct by failing to maintain his independence from the company on february,ponce sent a letter to moody regarding his impending audit of aac for fiscal year.ponce wrote that the unpaid balance due to him for services rendered in prior periods is.on february,he again noted that the unpaid balance due to him for services rendered in prior periods is.a similar letter from ponce to moody dated november,reflected an unpaid balance of.
additionally,a letter dated march,from ponce to moody delineated a schedule of payments to satisfy the balance owed to him by aac and also reflected what would be an unpaid balance of,at the completion of the audit for fiscal year.lastly,a letter dated december,from ponce to moody regarding the fiscal year audit notes an unpaid balance of.
ponce testified at the hearing before the alj that he discussed the issue of his unpaid fees every year with aac.ponce also testified that he advised aac that the guidelines put forth by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa presumed a lack of independence if an auditor has outstanding audit fees at the time he performs an audit.

ponce violation of exchange act section b and rule 
the first question we must address,which sets the stage for the remainder of our review of the sec findings,is whether there exists substantial evidence to support the sec conclusion that ponce violated section b and rule.the sec found that ponce violated section b and rule by falsely representing that he audited aac financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards gaas,and that aac financial statements were not set out in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap.specifically,the sec held that ponce overvalued the license designs in aac financial statements and improperly capitalized research and development costs,which should have been expensed.on appeal,ponce argues that there lacks substantial evidence to support the finding that he violated these provisions.we hold that there is substantial evidence to support the sec factual findings underlying the violations and find no grounds on which to set aside the sec ultimate conclusion that ponce violated section b and rule,as it was not arbitrary or capricious.
section b of the exchange act states,in relevant part 
it shall be unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,by the use of any facility of any national securities exchange t o use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
b.companion rule provides that it is unlawful to use any facility of the national securities exchange t o employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud.a.it also provides that it is unlawful t o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.id.at b.

the sec found that ponce recklessly made false and misleading material statements in the course of preparing and auditing aac financial statements,with respect to the license designs and aircraft tooling and prototype costs.
false or misleading statements about the license designs 
the sec held that ponce violated section b and rule by overvaluing the license designs aac purchased from moody.the crux of ponce argument challenging the sec findings with respect to the overvaluation of the license designs is that he included a footnote to the financial statements in which he disclosed the nature and the effect of the accounting methods,thereby rendering the statements neither false nor misleading,and precluding a finding that he prepared and certified statements that were false or misleading.the footnote,note,read as follows 
valuation analysis 
the company investment in moody aircraft design bureau is based on management estimate of value relating to the consideration paid by the company in the form of its restricted common stock and not on appraised values or historical cost data of the assets acquired.this alternative method of valuation is a less desirable test of value,however,appraisals of the intangible assets acquired,namely,designs and related data,may be difficult,if not impossible.nevertheless,because the amounts recorded on the company books of account are so material as to represent essentially all of the stockholder equity,the correctness of management valuation is critical to the company continued existence as a going concern as discussed in note.
note reads as follows 
basis of existence 
the company has experienced significant losses,and it has no working capital.in addition,certain intangible assets are the basis for the equity on the balance sheets,as discussed in note.
the accompanying financial statements have been presented using accounting principles applicable to a going concern,which principles contemplate the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.the company continued existence is dependent on its ability to achieve profitable operations through product sales and to obtain additional equity debt financing sufficient to finance production levels necessary for profitable operations 
ponce argues that,given the above disclosure,even if subsequent events have shown that the treatment of information included in the financial statements that he audited were not correct,its inclusion in the statements did not violate the antifraud provisions because the sec has not shown that his actions were deceptive.ponce cites anixter prod,cir,to support his assertion that his actions were not deceptive.
the sec considered and rejected ponce argument that the statements were not misleading because he disclosed the valuation method for the license designs in a footnote to the financial statements.it found that the footnote failed to elucidate the information that rendered the valuation suspect,including the subsequent price paid by phalanx for aac stock,lower than originally valued,ponce belief that the license designs were not worth the value assigned,and the fact that aac stock was thinly traded and thus an unreliable benchmark.in short,the sec found that the footnote was insufficient to cure the defect that resulted from the overvaluation and that potential investors or shareholders were not given accurate information in the financial statements.
the record reveals substantial evidence to support the sec finding that the valuation of the license designs in aac financial statements was misleading and that footnote did not cure this defect.ponce did not dispute the significance of the information that the sec found to be material and absent from the footnote,nor did he point to any information in the statements,aside from the footnote,that would make the valuation less misleading.there is evidence in the record to support the sec assertions above,namely that aac stock was thinly traded and that after aac purchase of the license designs,phalanx paid a price that was lower than originally valued for aac stock.
moreover,ponce testimony at the hearing before the alj reveals that he was fully aware of the problems associated with the valuation method he used for the license designs,yet he nonetheless did not alter the valuation.ponce stated that the purpose of the footnote was to let the reader know that their valuation method was just a way of doing it,and it may or may not be correct.in addition,ponce admitted that he had reservations about valuing the license designs at and believed that aac could not sell them for the assigned value.despite these reservations,he nevertheless retained the valuation and certified the financial statements.
ponce argument that he can not be found to have violated section b because he was not deceptive and his reliance on anixter are misplaced.ponce fails to recognize that in our circuit,recklessness satisfies section b scienter requirement.see hollinger,at.anixter did nothing to alter this scheme.moreover,there is evidence in the record to sustain the sec finding that ponce acted recklessly in valuing the license designs and certifying the statements containing the valuation.the sec offered tersigni expert testimony that ponce chosen method of valuing the license designs,based on aac stock price,was not only an unacceptable methodology for valuing thinly traded stock,but also unreliable because of aac history of operating losses,virtual insolvency,and the fact that the stock was thinly traded.further,ponce was aware of the false impression it could give the public,yet he proceeded with the valuation in the face of this danger.
in light of the above,ponce certification of aac financial statements was inconsistent with gaas,and in violation of section b and rule,since it contained misleading information regarding aac financial assets,and ponce was reckless as to its misleading nature.in sum,the sec conclusion that ponce valuation of the license designs,and certification of the financial statements containing the valuation,violated section b and rule is supported by substantial evidence.see eichler,at.
false or misleading statements about prototype and tooling costs 
the sec also held that ponce violated section b and rule by capitalizing prototype and tooling costs,rather than expensing them in conformity with financial accounting standards.ponce argues that this finding should be set aside because he was instructed to capitalize the tooling and prototype costs by aac management.we hold that substantial evidence supports the sec finding that ponce prepared and certified financial statements containing these capitalized prototype and tooling costs that he knew or should have known were false.we further hold that aac management directives to ponce instructing him to capitalize research and development costs do not absolve ponce from his duty as an auditor to certify only accurate financial statements and reports.
financial accounting standard fas provides guidance regarding how to report research and development costs,namely the tooling and prototype costs associated with aac development of aircraft.fas defines both research and development,and also designates a list of activities that constitute research and development which should be expensed.the sec alleges that aac tooling and prototype costs fell squarely into fas paragraph f design,construction,and testing of preproduction prototypes and models,and g design of tools,jigs,molds and dies involving new technology.although perhaps not as clear as the sec contends,the record supports the sec finding that the tooling and prototype costs should not have been capitalized.notably,only one of aac aircrafts,the penetrator,arguably progressed past the research and development stage,and only after the years in question.however,its costs were capitalized despite the fact that the penetrator still needed to be flight tested,after which it would be disassembled and evaluated.none of aac other projects were ever manufactured.
moreover,there is also evidence that ponce was aware of,yet chose to disregard,the impropriety of recording aac prototype and tooling costs as assets for projects that were still in development.first,ponce testified that he initially disagreed with aac management about how to characterize these costs and believed they should be recorded as research and development expenses,not assets.ponce fails to give reasons,other than that he had substantial discussions with management and management representations that contracts were on hand for immediate production,for changing his mind.ponce failure to conduct any meaningful investigation into management representations is inexcusable.even if it were true that contracts were on hand for some of the projects,under fas this fact would still not be dispositive of the research and development issue.fas requires a more nuanced analysis of the projects to ensure accurate reporting.as discussed infra,gaas requires that ponce inquire into management representations and conduct his own,independent research to determine whether its assertions are true.ponce failed to offer any evidence that he verified aac representations regarding the prototype and tooling costs,and instead largely relied on their assurances,which ponce had reason to believe were inaccurate.
ponce admission and aac misrepresentations notwithstanding,aac annual and quarterly reports reveal that the projects at issue were still in development at the time that they were capitalized moody testified to this effect about a number of aac projects between and.ponce nevertheless included a note to the financial statements in aac reports which indicated that he complied with fas,when in actuality research and development costs were consistently treated as assets.thus,ponce conveyed false assurances that aac had complied with fas,compounding the misconceptions that,in conjunction with the overvaluation of the license designs,painted a rosier financial picture of aac than actually existed.
the record in this case contains sufficient evidence to support the sec conclusion that ponce valuation of the license designs and his capitalization of tooling and prototype costs were not in accordance with gaas.similarly,the financial statements he certified were not prepared in conformity with gaap,as they contained the same defects.at the hearing before the alj,the sec presented testimony from loreto tersigni,a certified public accountant who was qualified as an expert regarding gaap,gaas,and professional standards in the accounting profession.he testified extensively about gaap and gaas,and rendered an opinion that ponce valuation of the license designs and his treatment of the prototype and tooling expenses were not in conformity with gaap.he also opined that,to the extent he did not correct them or disclose the defects,ponce audits were not conducted according to gaas.ponce does not challenge tersigni opinion regarding gaap or gaas,nor does he offer alternative evidence that his valuation of the license designs,and characterization of tooling and prototype costs,were proper under those standards.
in sum,the sec conclusion that ponce violated section b and rule by certifying that aac statements complied with gaap and that his audit was conducted according to gaas,in light of the evidence of serious departures contained in the record,is supported by substantial evidence.both the valuation of the license designs and the capitalization of research and development costs portrayed an overall picture of aac as having greater assets and financial stability than in reality it did.this,in the final analysis,is dispositive.see sec richmond,cir holding that the overall effect of advertisements was misleading in violation of section b despite fact that no single statement of material fact was false.furthermore,there is substantial evidence that ponce was aware of the defects and was reckless in certifying the financial statements.
ponce aiding and abetting of aac violation of section a and b and corresponding regulations 
next,we must decide whether there exists substantial evidence to support the sec conclusion that ponce willfully aided,abetted,and caused aac to violate section a and b of the exchange act,and their companion regulations based on ponce role in the overvaluation of the license designs and his mischaracterization of the tooling and prototype costs,the sec held that ponce had willfully aided,abetted,and caused aac filing of misleading reports and caused it to fail to correct these reports in violation of exchange act section a,and rules and.it also held that ponce willfully aided,abetted,and caused aac filing of false annual and quarterly reports that were misleading in violation of rules and.lastly,the sec held that ponce willfully aided,abetted,and caused aac violation of exchange act section b resulting from aac failure to keep books,records,and accounts that accurately and fairly reflected the transactions and disposition of aac assets.we hold that substantial evidence supports the sec conclusions that ponce violated exchange act section a and b,and their corresponding regulations.
exchange act section a and rule require every issuer having securities registered with the sec to file annual reports including certain financial information.section a was codified as a and reads as follows 
periodical and other reports 
a reports by issuer of security contents 
every issuer of a security registered pursuant to section of this title shall file with the commission,in accordance with such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate for the proper protection of investors and to insure fair dealing in the security 
such information and documents and such copies thereof as the commission shall require to keep reasonably current the information and documents required to be included in or filed with an application or registration statement filed pursuant to section of this title,except that the commission may not require the filing of any material contract wholly executed before july.
such annual reports and such copies thereof,certified if required by the rules and regulations of the commission by independent public accountants,and such quarterly reports and such copies thereof,as the commission may prescribe.
every issuer of a security registered on a national securities exchange shall also file a duplicate original of such information,documents,and reports with the exchange.
similarly,rule a was codified as and reads as follows 
requirements of annual reports.
every issuer having securities registered pursuant to section of the act shall file an annual report on the appropriate form authorized or prescribed therefor for each fiscal year after the last full fiscal year for which financial statements were filed in its registration statement.registrants on form,s b of this chapter,shall file an annual report for each fiscal year beginning on or after the date as of which the succession occurred.annual reports shall be filed within the period specified in the appropriate form.at the time of filing the annual report,the registrant other than a person registered under the public utility holding company act of or the investment company act of shall pay to the commission a fee of,no part of which shall be refunded.
in short,these provisions of the exchange act require the filing of financial statements that are prepared in conformity with gaap and contain a report by an independent auditor certifying that the auditor had audited the company financial statements,in accordance with gaas,to determine whether the statements were prepared in conformity with gaap.under rule,aac had a duty to correct any misstatements or omissions in documents filed with the sec.this rule was codified as and reads as follows 
additional information.
in addition to the information expressly required to be included in a statement or report,there shall be added such further material information,if any,as may be necessary to make the required statements,in the light of the circumstances under which they are made not misleading.
section b requires companies to maintain books,records and accounts accurately and record transactions in conformity with gaas.section b was codified as b and reads in relevant part 
periodical and other reports 
b form of report books,records,and internal accounting directives 
every issuer which has a class of securities registered pursuant to section of this title and every issuer which is required to file reports pursuant to section d of this title shall 
a make and keep books,records,and accounts,which,in reasonable detail,accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer and 
b devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that 
i transactions are executed in accordance with management general or specific authorization ii transactions are recorded as necessary i to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements,and ii to maintain accountability for assets iii access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management general or specific authorization and iv the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.
finally,rule requires the filing of quarterly reports that are not misleading,reads in relevant part as follows 
quarterly reports on form and form a of this chapter.
a except as provided in paragraphs b and c of this section,every issuer that has securities registered pursuant to section of the act and is required to file annual reports pursuant to section of the act,and has filed or intends to file such reports on form and form of this chapter or s of this chapter shall file a quarterly report on form and form a of this chapter within the period specified in general instruction.to that form for each of the first three quarters of each fiscal year of the issuer,commencing with the first fiscal quarter following the most recent fiscal year for which full financial statements were included in the registration statement,or,if the registration statement included financial statements for an interim period subsequent to the most recent fiscal year end meeting the requirements of article of regulation,for the first fiscal quarter subsequent to the quarter reported upon in the registration statement.the first quarterly report of the issuer shall be filed either within days after the effective date of the registration statement or on or before the date on which such report would have been required to be filed if the issuer has been required to file reports on form and form as of its last fiscal quarter,whichever is later.
insofar as the sec based its findings as to these violations on the largely undisputed facts that gave rise to the section b and rule violations,the sec conclusion that ponce violated the reporting and record keeping provisions of the exchange act is also supported by substantial evidence.ponce does not deny that he prepared and certified aac annual and quarterly reports during the years in question,nor does he otherwise dispute the reporting and record keeping requirements that the sec imposed on him.ponce also does not dispute that the violation of b and would subject him to liability under section a and b,but merely argues that this finding must fail because the b and violations fail.
since the facts underlying the violations provide the same factual basis for the reporting and record keeping violations of the federal securities laws,and we held earlier in this opinion that substantial evidence supports ponce violations,we hold that the sec findings that ponce violated section a and b of the exchange act and associated rules thereunder are similarly supported by substantial evidence and are not arbitrary,capricious,or otherwise not in accordance with the law.the record reveals that aac financial statements contained the of the license designs,as well as the mischaracterization of tooling and prototype costs,both practices which were not in conformity with gaap as required by section a and rule.furthermore,it is evident that ponce audits and certification of aac reports were not conducted in conformity with gaas,because he certified them despite the fact that aac financial statements contained the aforementioned misleading information,in contravention of section a and rule.
the same misleading financial statements that were submitted and certified with aac annual reports were submitted with aac quarterly reports,in violation of rule.in addition,pursuant to rule,aac had a duty to correct any misstatements or omissions in documents filed with the sec,which it also failed to do,footnote notwithstanding.moreover,the overvaluation of the license designs and the improper capitalization of the tooling and prototype costs depicted aac as having more assets than it actually did.thus,section b was also violated because aac failed to keep books,records,and accounts that accurately and fairly reflected the transactions and disposition of aac assets.
our finding that aac violated exchange act sections a and b,and accompanying rules,does not end our inquiry with respect to ponce liability.the sec found that ponce had willfully aided,abetted,and caused aac violation of the above record keeping provisions.although there is apparently no circuit law articulating the requirements for aider and abettor liability for section violations,we are guided by cases finding aider and abettor liability of other securities laws violations.in order to find that ponce aided and abetted aac violation of federal securities laws,it must be found that aac violated the relevant securities laws ponce had knowledge of the primary violation and of his or her own role in furthering it and ponce provided substantial assistance in the primary violation see fehn,at fashioning a test for aiding and abetting a section d violation based on section of the private securities litigation reform act and the test for aiding and abettor liability for section b violations graham sec,identifying three principal elements to establish liability for aiding and abetting a section b and rule violation as that a principal committed a primary violation that the aider and abettor provided substantial assistance to the primary violator and that the aider and abettor had the necessary scienter accord sec arthur young,cir recognizing aiding and abetting liability under sections b,a and d of the exchange act sec kalvex,holding corporate director liable for aiding and abetting violations of exchange act sections a,a,and rules and because he provided assistance and encouragement to conduct patently in violation of the securities laws.
the first prong of the aider and abettor test is easily met.aac filed the required reports that contained the false and misleading financial statements,along with ponce audit certification.moreover,ponce does not dispute his role in preparing the financial statements or performing the audits.second,while ponce may not have conceived them as false or misleading at the time he made them ponce certainly had knowledge,or at least was reckless in not recognizing,the misleading nature of the statements.ponce undeniably played a major role in preparing and certifying the financial statements,and as aac accountant and auditor,ponce not only facilitated aac reporting and record keeping responsibilities to the sec,but he played an essential and integral part of the process.indeed,exchange act section a and rule require that a registrant reports be filed with audit certification.accordingly,ponce also provided substantial assistance to aac primary violation of sections a and b,by preparing the financial statements that were eventually filed with both the quarterly and annual reports,as well as auditing and certifying the reports that aac filed.we hold that there is substantial evidence to support the factual findings underlying the sec conclusion that ponce aided and abetted aac violation of exchange act sections a,b and corresponding regulations,and that the conclusion itself is not arbitrary or capricious 
ponce violation of rules e ii and iii of the sec rules of practice 
the next issue before us is to examine the sec findings that ponce violated two of its rules of practice,and whether there is substantial evidence to uphold its conclusions in this respect.first,the sec permanently barred ponce from practicing before it pursuant to rule e iii of the sec rules of practice,based on his violations of exchange act section b and rule,sections a and b,and corresponding regulations.the sec went on to find that ponce also violated rule e ii because he had engaged in improper professional conduct.we hold that both findings are supported by substantial evidence and are not arbitrary,capricious,or otherwise not in accordance with the law.
sec rule of practice e,codified as,reads in relevant part 
e suspension and disbarment.
generally.the commission may censure a person or deny,temporarily or permanently,the privilege of appearing or practicing before it in any way to any person who is found by the commission after notice and opportunity for hearing in the matter 
ii to be lacking in character or integrity or to have engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct or 
iii to have willfully violated,or willfully aided and abetted the violation of any provision of the federal securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder.
because we hold that the sec finding that ponce violated federal securities laws is supported by substantial evidence,it follows that the sec finding that ponce violated rule e iii is also supported by substantial evidence.however,the sec also held that ponce was subject to sanctions under rule e ii,by engaging in the following improper professional conduct that violated gaas he did not act with due professional care in performing his audit,because he conducted no investigation to corroborate management representations that the aircraft designs were no longer in the research and development stage,and that tooling and prototype costs were properly capitalized he falsely stated that his audits were conducted in accordance with gaap and he did not comport with the independence requirements set out by gaas due to the outstanding fees that aac owed him.
the sec findings that ponce engaged in improper professional conduct are supported by substantial evidence.ponce does not dispute that he did not conduct any investigation into aac representations that prototype and research costs should be capitalized because the projects they related to were no longer in development,rather he notes himself that he relied on management representations.ponce does not challenge that he had an obligation to verify management representations nor that not doing so falls below a level of due professional care that is required of him.he merely reiterates his challenge to the sec conclusion that he violated the provisions of the securities laws.this argument fails to relieve him of liability for a violation of the rules of practice because sec findings are supported by substantial evidence and are not arbitrary or capricious.
furthermore,the sec has shown that due professional care requires that accountants test management representations about their finances.tersigni testified that ponce practice of relying on management representations in performing his audits violated gaas.instead,ponce should have conducted independent te
