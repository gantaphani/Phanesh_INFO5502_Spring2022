this is an interlocutory appeal from the denial of defendants motion to dismiss a civil complaint based on an issue of law.
the complaint was brought by the sec on a misappropriation theory of insider trading.it alleged that defendant patricia rocklage intentionally used deceptive means to obtain from her husband highly negative and information about his company,in order to tip her brother who owned company stock,which then led to trading of the stock by her brother and another.specifically,rocklage initially concealed from her husband her prior agreement with her brother to tip him if she learned significant negative information about the company.she also concealed that she did not intend to maintain the confidentiality that her husband had reasonably understood to bind her.after rocklage acquired the information on the basis of this deception,and shortly before she actually tipped her brother,however,she told her husband that she was going to give her brother the information.her husband asked her not to do so,but she did so anyway,pursuant to the agreement.under the circumstances and timing of the events,there was little her husband could do to prevent her from tipping her brother or to prevent her brother from trading on the information.her brother sold his stock in the company on the next day the market opened and he passed the information on to a friend who did the same.the brother,william beaver,and friend,david jones,are also defendants.
the three defendants moved under federal rule of civil procedure b to dismiss the sec complaint for failure to state a claim they argued that under language in united states,d,rocklage disclosure to her husband,telling him that she intended to her brother,completely negated any liability under the misappropriation theory.we conclude that does not require dismissal of this suit for failure to state a claim.
on january,the sec filed a civil complaint against the defendants.the complaint alleged the following key facts,which we must take as true under rule b.see conley gibson,d.we draw all reasonable inferences in the sec favor.see ramirez arlequin,cir.
rocklage was the wife of scott rocklage.rocklage was the chairman and ceo of cubist pharmaceuticals,a biotechnology company.rocklage was not an employee of cubist.
on december,rocklage learned that one of the company key drugs had failed its clinical trial.that afternoon,he phoned rocklage to discuss the trial results and he reached her while she was in a limousine.before discussing the results with her,rocklage made clear his intention that the results be kept confidential.he told her that she was not to react to what he was about to say,and he instructed her not to discuss the results in front of the limousine driver.she agreed.from the time that rocklage joined cubist in,he had routinely communicated material,nonpublic information to his wife,and she had always kept the information confidential.based on rocklage agreement,and based on their prior history of sharing nonpublic information about the company and her keeping that information confidential,rocklage had a reasonable expectation that she would not disclose the trial results to anyone.based on his understanding that she would keep the information confidential,rocklage informed his wife that the clinical trial had failed.before the results were disclosed to her,rocklage understood her husband expectation of confidentiality.
unbeknownst to her husband,rocklage had a preexisting understanding with her brother,defendant beaver,that she would inform him with a wink and a nod if she learned significant negative news about cubist.at the time that rocklage learned the negative trial results,she knew or had reason to believe that beaver owned cubist stock.she also knew or had reason to know her brother would trade in cubist securities if she disclosed the nonpublic information to him.
on the evening of december,rocklage discussed the failure of the drug trial in more depth with rocklage.he informed her that cubist would be making a public announcement about the results,and that until that happened the results were nonpublic.rocklage asked how the news would affect cubist stock,and rocklage informed her that the stock price would drop significantly.as before,at the time that rocklage originally conveyed this information to rocklage,he had a reasonable expectation that she would keep it confidential and would not otherwise have disclosed the information.in effect,by her deception rocklage induced her husband to disclose material information he would not otherwise have disclosed,and she did so with the intention of sharing this information with her brother to allow him to trade securities.
after that conversation,and on or about the evening of december,rocklage informed her husband that she planned to signal her brother to sell his stock.rocklage urged her not to do so,and he expressed his displeasure at the idea.nevertheless,sometime before the morning of january,rocklage called beaver and gave him a wink and a nod regarding cubist.beaver interpreted this to mean that he should sell his cubist stock,and so on the morning of january,first possible trading day after he was tipped sold all of his shares of cubist stock.by tipping her brother,rocklage was providing a gift of confidential information to a relative,and so she personally benefitted.
beaver also tipped off his close friend and neighbor,defendant jones.jones knew that beaver,rocklage,was chairman and ceo of cubist.jones sold all of his shares of cubist stock on the morning of january.
cubist publicly announced the negative drug trial results on january,after the market had closed for the day.by selling when they did,beaver and jones avoided losses of and,respectively.
the sec alleged that on the basis of these facts all three defendants were guilty of insider trading under b of the securities exchange act of,see b,and rule thereunder,see it sought both injunctive relief and monetary penalties from the defendants.
all three defendants filed a rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.on august,the district court issued an opinion denying their motion.in its opinion,the court explained that the supreme court has recognized two theories of insider trading liability the classical theory and the misappropriation theory.the classical theory generally only imposes liability when a trader or tipper is an insider of the corporation.the classical thus breaches a fiduciary duty owed to the corporation shareholders.the misappropriation theory,however,creates liability when a tipper or trader misappropriates confidential information from his source of the information.the misappropriator thus breaches a fiduciary duty owed to the source.
the district court agreed with defendants that rocklage could not be held liable under the classical theory.she was not a traditional insider at cubist.and the court determined that the relationship between rocklage and cubist shareholders was not of the kind that could lead to temporary insider status no alleged facts demonstrated that rocklage disclosure to her was solely for corporate purposes.see dirks sec,d.
the district court disagreed,however,with the defendants argument that there was no liability under the misappropriation theory.although had said that disclosure to the source would negate liability under the misappropriation theory,the district court found distinguishable.however,the court grounds for distinguishing were based on a misreading of facts.the court reasoned that because law firm had obligations to the company as the district court read the case,any hypothetical disclosure by would have quickly made its way to the shareholders.in rocklage case,by contrast,the special nature of the marital relationship meant that her disclosure would never make its way to the shareholders rocklage loyalties lay first and foremost with his wife.thus the district court found that the complaint stated facts sufficient to support a misappropriation theory of liability.
the district court also refused to dismiss the case against the downstream tippees,beaver and jones.if a claim was stated against rocklage,it held,then the tippees liability turned on whether they knew or should have known of rocklage breach of duty.the district court determined this last question to be one of fact,and thus inappropriate for resolution on a b motion 
all three defendants moved the district court for reconsideration,correctly arguing that the district court had misread.contrary to the court reading,firm had represented the bidding company in a tender offer,not the target company whose shares traded.see,at.thus,the defendants argued that firm had no obligation to inform the target shareholders,and any hypothetical disclosure by him would not have had real effect.in the alternative,the defendants asked the court to certify the issue for interlocutory appeal pursuant to b.
on december,the district court denied the motion for reconsideration.the court conceded that it had misread but reasoned that was distinguishable because a hypothetical disclosure by would have given either his firm or the bidding company the opportunity and motivation to take remedial action.by contrast,the nature of the marital relationship meant that rocklage disclosure did not give her husband adequate opportunity to take similar remedial action.the court certified the issue for an interlocutory appeal,see b,which this court accepted.
this case turns on an understanding of the underpinnings of the misappropriation theory,an understanding of the acts that are the deceptive or manipulative device or devices alleged,and a careful reading of the opinion.we first discuss the misappropriation theory,examining why the supreme court concluded that this theory came within the ambit of b.then we explain our resolution of the remaining disputed issues,and how our resolution of those issues flows from.
a.the misappropriation theory of insider trading liability 
the text of b makes it unlawful to use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of rules promulgated by the b.rule furnishes further explication of this statute,providing inter alia that it is unlawful to engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.c.from these two sources of law on insider trading,the supreme court has fashioned two theories of liability the classical theory,and the misappropriation theory.see,at.
under the classical theory,b and rule are violated when an insider trades without disclosure in a corporation securities based on material,nonpublic information that he has acquired.so long as that insider owes a fiduciary duty to the corporation stockholders,the supreme court has deemed such trades to be deceptive because they constitute a breach of that fiduciary duty.id.however,when the trading individual owes no fiduciary duty to the stockholders of the corporation,and he has not obtained the information from one who has breached such a duty,there can be no insider trading liability under the classical theory.see chiarella united states,d.
in such cases,however,liability may still be premised on a misappropriation theory.liability under that theory is based on deception of the source of the information,rather than on deception of the shareholders it is that deception which brings this trading within the statutory language.see,at.t he misappropriation theory premises liability on a deception of those who entrusted him with access to confidential information.such deceptive trading exploits unfair informational disparities in the securities market making such trading illegal also comports with the congressional purposes underlying b.see id.at.
the case in which the supreme court first recognized the misappropriation theory,illustrates the theory underpinnings.the defendant,james,worked at a law firm representing the bidding company in a contemplated tender offer.id.at.learned about the proposed deal and purchased shares in the target company before the deal was made public.id.at.because firm represented the bidder,he owed no fiduciary duty to the target stockholders and could not be prosecuted under the classical theory.id.at.nevertheless,the court held he was liable under a misappropriation theory because he had deceived both his law firm and its client he had pretended to be loyal to them while secretly converting information obtained from them into personal gain.see id.at.the court remarked that it would make scant sense to hold a lawyer like a b violator if he work ed for a law firm representing the target of a tender offer,but not if he work ed for a law firm representing the bidder.the text of the statute requires no such result.id.at.
the court did say,however,that b ecause the deception essential to the misappropriation theory involves feigning fidelity to the source of information,if the fiduciary discloses to the source that he plans to trade on the nonpublic information,there is no deceptive device and thus no b violation.id.at.it is this language in,arguably dicta on which defendants pin their argument they contend that rocklage disclosure to her husband eliminated any deception involved with her tipping,which would mean that her actions did not come within the text of b.
liability under the misappropriation theory after 
to establish liability under the misappropriation theory,the sec must show that rocklage communicated material nonpublic information,with scienter,in violation of a fiduciary duty she owed to her husband.see ernst ernst hochfelder,d sec sargent,cir.additionally,to satisfy the language of b,the sec must demonstrate that rocklage engaged in a manipulative or deceptive device,and that she did so in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.b see also,at.
the defendants do not dispute that the complaint meets the scienter requirement,and that the disclosed information was material and nonpublic.they also do not seriously challenge the sec allegation that rocklage breached a duty she owed to her spouse under b 
the heart of this case is thus whether the sec complaint has stated a claim that rocklage engaged in any manipulative or deceptive device that was in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.in answering that question,we find it helpful to examine the issue in two parts.first,we identify exactly what manipulative or deceptive devices rocklage was alleged to have engaged in and we assess whether they were sufficiently in connection with a securities transaction.second,we examine rocklage disclosure to her husband to determine whether that disclosure eliminated the deception from her actions.
the deceptive devices 
the sec contends that rocklage engaged in deceptive devices,in connection with a securities transaction,when she tricked her husband into revealing confidential information to her so that she could,and did,assist her brother with the sale of his cubist stock.we agree and think it helpful to view the devices in terms of deceptive acquisition of information and then deceptive tipping of her brother,both of which were steps in a broader scheme to enable her brother to trade in cubist securities.the question of whether rocklage disclosure makes these acts nondeceptive is a different question,which we address later.
we start with the second of these actions.had rocklage never made any disclosure of her intent to tip her brother,there would have been deception in connection with a securities transaction when she did tip her brother,without her husband consent,to enable her brother to trade in securities.under,this would have been the case irrespective of the means by which rocklage acquired the information 
still putting aside for the moment any consideration of the effects of disclosure,we turn to the other alleged deceptive.rocklage acquisition of information.here more analysis is required.we agree that this acquisition of information was deceptive.the complaint alleges,and we must take as true,that before her husband initial disclosure about the clinical trial,rocklage did absolutely nothing to correct his mistaken understanding that she would keep the trial results confidential.this was so even though rocklage knew that her husband had this mis understanding,and even though she had a preexisting arrangement to disclose certain confidential information to her brother.
the defendants argue that this acquisition of information,even if deceptive,was not in connection with a securities transaction.they point to language from discussing the in connection with requirement and explaining that the fiduciary fraud is consummated,not when the fiduciary gains the confidential information,but when he uses the information to purchase or sell securities,at.in defendants view,rocklage deceptive acquisition of information was simply too far removed from her brother sale of securities to satisfy b in connection with requirement.
we disagree with defendants reading of and of the in connection with requirement.we read the quoted sentence in as explaining when a misappropriator deceptive scheme ends,and not as indicating when it begins.see webster new international dictionary of the english language unabridged philip babcock gove,defining the verb to consummate as meaning to bring to completion.next,had no occasion to interpret the in connection with requirement in a case alleging deceptive acquisition of information intended to be used in a securities transaction.the opinion does not discuss whether tricked or deceived his law firm into telling him about the tender offer,and whether while doing so he knew he would use the information for trading.the government brief to the supreme court stated that t he record does not indicate how first learned about the potential tender offer.see brief for the united states at,d.there was no claim that had used deception to obtain the information.on those facts,it is no surprise that the supreme court based liability only on act of undisclosed trading itself.see united states falcone,cir noting that the defendant in legitimately possessed the information and that any misappropriation only occurred when he used that information to trade securities.
since the act of trading was itself deceptive in,the securities transaction and the breach of duty thus coincide d,at.in this case it is true there was no such exact coincidence.but that disjunction does not mean the deception in obtaining the information was not in connection with the sale of securities.
this case differs from in that the sec squarely alleges that rocklage deceptively obtained information,and that she did so as part of a preexisting scheme to assist her brother in the sale of securities.the question is how that difference is relevant to the in connection with requirement.indeed,in a case raising somewhat similar concerns the second circuit recognized that the supreme court in did not purport to set forth the sole combination of factors necessary to establish the requisite connection in all contexts.falcone,at.
the second circuit opinion in falcone held that did not alter that circuit long standing rule,stated in united states carpenter,cir,aff by an equally divided court and aff by the full court on other grounds,d,that the government can satisfy the in connection with requirement when a tipper misappropriates information that his tippees later trade on.the court reasoned that 
the defendants use of the misappropriated information for the ir financial benefit and to the financial detriment of those investors with whom the defendants traded supports the conclusion that the defendants fraud was in connection with the purchase or sale of securities under section b and rule.we can deduce reasonably that those who purchased or sold securities without the misappropriated information would not have purchased or sold,at least at the transaction prices they obtained,had they had the benefit of that information.certainly the protection of investors is the major purpose of section b and rule.
falcone,at quoting carpenter,at internal citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted.although neither carpenter nor falcone was a case in which the court relied on the tipper specifically engaging in deception in order to acquire information,both stand for the proposition that the in connection with requirement may be satisfied even when the act of misappropriation in breach of a duty in those cases,tipping,and the act of trading,do not coincide.in our view not only left this untouched,see id.at,but reinforced it.
indeed,discussion of the in connection with requirement actually bolsters the sec position in this case.discussed a hypothetical in which a person defrauds a bank into giving him a loan and then uses the proceeds to purchase securities.see at.that hypothetical thus dealt with a case of deceptive acquisition,albeit the deceptive acquisition of money.importantly,the supreme court indicated that such deception was not in connection with a securities transaction because the acquired item was money and not information.see id.the wide variety of uses for money made this deceptive acquisition sufficiently detached from a subsequent securities transaction.id.at.but the information rocklage deceptively obtained and gave her brother did not have that same variety of uses it was instead the sort of information that misappropriators ordinarily capitalize upon to gain profits through the purchase or sale of securities.id.at.thus her deceptive acquisition of the information is fairly regarded as an act that was part of a broader scheme of deception in connection with the sale of securities.
moreover,we think that rocklage actions fit within a natural reading of the in connection with requirement.rocklage preexisting arrangement with her brother can easily be understood as a scheme or practice or course of business,a,c,whose goal was to enable her brother to trade in cubist securities at a substantially reduced level of risk.her deception of her husband was a natural and integral part of this scheme she induced her husband to reveal material negative information to her about cubist,knowing full well that in obtaining that information she would enable her brother to execute a securities transaction.she then actively facilitated a securities transaction by tipping her brother,and securities were in fact sold based on her information.these events show that her deceptive acquisition of material inside information was in connection with a securities transaction.
finally,our interpretation finds further support in the investor protection purposes of b.see sec zandford,d interpreting b in connection with requirement flexibly so as to further the statute broad investor protection purposes,at.same.one of the animating purposes of the statute was to insure honest securities markets and thereby promote investor confidence,at.it furthers that purpose if the in connection with requirement reaches schemes in which one party deceptively and intentionally obtains material nonpublic information to enable another to trade with an unfair informational advantage.see id.at.discussing how informational disparities can negatively impact securities markets.
the effect of rocklage disclosure of her intent to tip her brother 
we have determined that the complaint alleges that rocklage engaged in a scheme involving devices that would have been deceptive in the absence of disclosure,and we have concluded that these devices were employed in connection with a securities transaction.we now turn to the heart of defendants argument whether rocklage disclosure to her husband,indicating her intent to pass the information to her brother,nonetheless means no claim of deception is stated by virtue of language about disclosure.
the defendants view is that a disclosure to the source of an intention to trade or tip completely eliminates any deception involved in the transaction.they rely on language that if the fiduciary discloses to the source that he plans to trade on the nonpublic information,there is no deceptive device and thus no b violation.id.at.the defendants argue that put no qualifiers on what is meant by disclos ure to the source of a plan to trade on nonpublic information,and so the sec is not free to qualify the concept.
the sec disagrees,arguing that the di
