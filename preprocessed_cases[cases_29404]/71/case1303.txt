once again,shareholders of a failed savings and loan association also called a thrift seek damages in this case for the government breach of its alleged contract with them to permit the thrift to use an accounting method favorable to it.the united states court of federal claims dismissed the shareholders complaint because they had not shown that they had a contract with the government.cain united states.we affirm.
a.the background and consequences of the savings and loan industry financial crisis in the has been frequently described and need not be repeated here.see united states winstar,d landmark land fdic,glass united states.
the crisis arose because the interest rates the thrifts had to pay on deposits were higher than the interest rates they received on their real estate mortgages in which their capital was invested.the federal home loan bank board bank board,the agency that regulated the thrifts,tried to alleviate the situation by encouraging economically healthy thrifts and individuals to acquire or invest in the financially troubled institutions.to induce such acquisitions or investments,the bank board permitted the troubled thrifts to follow accounting practices under which their capital for regulatory purposes included losses.
in,congress reacted to this situation by enacting the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act financial reform act,pub,stat.that act,among other things,prohibited thrifts from employing those accounting practices.
the result was that numerous thrifts no longer complied with the regulatory capital requirements and were placed in receivership.many of them and their stockholders filed suits against the united states to recover their losses.the cases included claims for breach of contract and fifth amendment takings.
in winstar,the supreme court affirmed the decision of this court,that the united states is liable to respondents three thrifts for breach of contract.at.the contracts there permitted the three failed thrifts to meet regulatory capital requirements by using a fictional asset called supervisory goodwill that represented the excess of the thrift liabilities over its assets,and to amortize that asset over a substantial period.fdic united states,quoting landmark,at.most of the cases we have decided also have involved such supervisory goodwill.
b.the present case involves a different but comparable accounting system.security federal savings bank security federal,a mutual thrift owned by its depositors,in sold most of its loans at a loss of million.cain.at.the bank board permitted the thrift to treat the loss as part of its regulatory capital requirements and to amortize part of the loss over the original loan period.id.despite this action,security federal financial condition continued to deteriorate.id.the shareholders complaint stated i n late and early,as solution to security federal capital deficiency problems,the bank board suggested that plaintiffs convert the thrift from a mutual association to a stock association.cain pls.am.compl.
security federal board of directors adopted such a conversion plan,under which the directors would provide additional capital by purchasing the stock.the board of directors authorized security federal president,laurance hardee,to negotiate and take any and all such action as he may deem necessary or desirable in order to implement the plan of conversion and the transactions contemplated thereby,to prepare and file an application for approval of conversion form ac with the bank board,and to take any and all such other action as is or may be necessary or required in connection with such filing.cain.at alterations in original.o n behalf of security federal,hardee informed the bank board that it was preparing a proposal to convert from a mutual association to a stock institution.id.
security federal law firm,morgan,lewis bockius,prepared and filed with the bank board a conversion application.id.the application was filed for security federal savings loan association of panama city and was signed by laurance hardee,director,president and principal financial officer duly authorized representative.on the following page,after the word attest were the signatures of the chairman of the board of directors,the controller,a director who also was the secretary treasurer,and four other directors.
the bank board initially rejected the application because the converted thrift proposed to use the historical accounting method instead of the accounting method that generally accepted accounting principles required.id.at.see p.this was significant because under accounting,the converted thrift could not treat its losses as part of its regulatory capital and amortize them,which it could continue to do under historical basis accounting.cain.at.
extensive discussions and negotiations ensued between the law firm,which acted on behalf of the thrift,hardee,and the regulators.it was made clear that the directors would not invest in the stock of the converted thrift unless it could continue to treat the loan losses as part of its regulatory capital.cain pls.am.compl.the matter was settled by the thrift agreeing to use accounting and the bank board permitting the thrift to continue using the loan losses as part of its regulatory capital.cain.at.
by letter dated december,the bank board approved the conversion.the letter,addressed to the four directors who had acquired the largest number of shares and to security federal board of directors,approved the application.id.at.the bank board also did not disapprove notices of change of control of the thrift that the four principal stockholders had submitted,provided that seven specified conditions were complied with.id.at.one of those conditions was that the four stockholders enter into an agreement with the new thrift that would limit the amount of dividends it could pay.id.all the stockholders signed such an agreement with security federal.id.
the approval letter further stated 
deferred loan losses 
the new association is hereby allowed to carry forward the deferred loan losses,as defined in part,reported as of the date of consummation of the conversion as a special component of its regulatory capital,provided that the deferred loan losses be amortized in accordance with currently prevailing regulations 
id.finally,the letter concluded with a tax certification.
the letter was signed by a representative of the bank board office of general counsel and a representative of the office of regulatory policy,oversight and supervision.
security federal converted from a mutual to a stock thrift.id.the appellants purchased its stock for million.id.
several months later,the financial reform act was enacted.the act restricted the ability of thrifts to count intangible assets,including deferred loan losses and goodwill,towards their regulatory capital requirements.id.citing t.it also mandated regulations requiring thrifts to use generally accepted accounting principles.b.it abolished the bank board and created the office of thrift supervision ots,which was responsible for the regulation and supervision of all federally insured thrifts.cain.at.
ots issued regulations that prohibited the use of dlls deferred loan losses as assets for the purpose of computing regulatory capital requirements.id.ots informed security federal that it was not in compliance with minimal capital standards and required it to submit a capital plan demonstrating how it intended to remain in compliance with such standards.id.security federal capital plan was denied because security federal intended to continue including its dlls in calculating its minimum capital requirements.id.at.
security federal response was to file suit against ots in the united states district court for the northern district of florida.that court entered a preliminary injunction enjoining ots from enforcing against the plaintiffs any regulatory capital requirements inconsistent with the conversion agreement for security federal savings bank of florida.sec.fed.sav.bank of,office of thrift supervision.
the injunction did not save security federal,whose financial condition continued to deteriorate,and it failed to meet all of its regulatory capital requirements.cain.at.in january,security federal was placed in receivership.id.
seven security federal shareholders the shareholders,the appellants in the present case,filed suit in the court of federal claims against the united states seeking damages for breach of contract.in their second amended complaint,the shareholders alleged that t his action stems from a contract between plaintiffs and the defendant entered into as a part of the conversion of security federal savings bank of florida security federal from a mutual association to a stock company,cain pls.am.compl.that t he documents and transactions described above collectively evidence and establish the contract under which the united states promised these individual plaintiffs that it would recognize deferred loan losses as capital of security federal for the full amortization period provided in the regulations then applicable the agreement,id.and that the government had breached that contract when it precluded security federal from including deferred loan losses in its regulatory capital,id.
following the filing of numerous motions,including motions to dismiss and for summary judgment by the shareholders,the court dismissed the shareholders claims because the shareholders had no privity of contract with the government.the court ruled that the shareholders do not have standing to pursue direct breach of contract claims against the government relating to the conversion of security federal.cain.at.the court stated that the shareholders could not demonstrate how they were injured independently of their status as shareholders,and that any injury suffered by the shareholders can not be distinguished in any meaningful way from the injury suffered by security federal when its ability to count dlls towards regulatory capital,as allowed by the bank board approval letter,was taken away.id.at.
the court concluded that the evidence upon which the shareholders relied to show that they had entered into a contract with the government,discussed in part ii below,does not indicate that the bank board treated the acquirers as contracting parties.id.at.finally,the court stated that the pertinent facts in this case are indistinguishable from that sic of first hartford.pension plan trust united states,fed.cl,aff,in which this court held that a shareholder of a failed thrift could not maintain a damage suit against the united states based on a similar alleged breach of contract claim because it was not in privity with the government since the agreement at issue was entered into by the bank and not the shareholder.id.
the court also rejected the shareholders claim that they could maintain their suit as third party beneficiaries of a contract between security federal and the government.cain.at.the shareholders appeal does not challenge that ruling.
in addition to the shareholders suit,the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic,as the receiver of security federal,filed its own complaint in intervention on behalf of the thrift to recover damages for breach of contract.the court dismissed that complaint because it did not present any case or controversy between the fdic and the government,since the fdic would have to return to the government any recovery it might obtain on behalf of the thrift.id.the fdic appealed from that ruling but subsequently dismissed its appeal.
the contract that the shareholders contend they entered into with the government allegedly was formed by the shareholders offering to invest more than in the converted thrift,and the bank board permitting the converted thrift to continue to include in its regulatory capital its deferred loan losses.the shareholders theory is that the bank board accepted their offer and thereby created a contract by approving the conversion in its letter of december.the shareholders emphasize that that letter was addressed not only to security federal board of directors but also to the four largest shareholders,including hardee,the thrift president.
this court recently noted for a contract to be formed once an offer is made,there must be an acceptance,a manifestation of assent to the terms thereof made by the offeree in a manner invited or required by the offer.anderson united states.the record may be searched in vain for any showing of the necessary manifest assent,by the bank board under our precedent,to form a contract with the shareholders for the extended amortization of goodwill.id.footnote omitted.
the december,letter shows no intent by the bank board to enter into any contract with the shareholders.the first two paragraphs stated that w e have completed our review of the application filed 
to convert from a federally chartered mutual savings and loan association to a federally chartered stock savings and loan association pursuant to section i,p of the home owners loan act of,as amended hola,section i,and subpart c of part of the rules and regulations for the federal savings and loan insurance corporation,sections,in a voluntary supervisory conversion in which the association will issue approximately shares of conversion common stock.
we have also completed our review of the notices of change of control of the association filed by hardee,harrison,haney and dantzler collectively,the acquirors for authority to acquire control of the association pursuant to section q and part,upon consummation of its conversion to stock form.
the third paragraph stated 
on the basis of the information contained in all of the applications,the office of general counsel ogc,and the office of regulatory policy,oversight and supervision orpos have determined,after having made all required findings and determinations,to approve all of the aforesaid applications.
the letter continued 
the association is hereby authorized to convert from the mutual to the stock form of organization and to adopt the proposed form of stock charter and bylaws submitted with the application,and the acquirors change in control notices regarding the acquisition of control of the association as a result of that conversion are hereby not disapproved provided that the following conditions are complied with to the satisfaction of the supervisory agent.
the letter then listed seven conditions,including that the conversion be completed within ninety days,that counsel for the association submit an opinion to the supervisory agent,indicating that the proposed merger did not result in any significant tax liability to the association or the new association,and that within thirty days the acquirors and the new association sign an agreement that dividends paid by new association shall be limited to percent of net income.
the letter then set forth the deferred loan losses provision quoted in part i b above,stating that t he new association is hereby allowed to carry forward the deferred loan losses,as defined in part,on the terms specified.finally,as noted,the letter contained a tax certification.
the december letter does not contain or provide any contractual commitment by the bank board to the shareholders.instead,on its face it constitutes and reflects no more than the bank board regulatory approval of the proposed conversion of security federal into a stock company.the provisions of the letter described above are typical regulatory actions approval of the conversion of the thrift and the imposition of terms and conditions for such action,approval of the acquisition of control of the thrift by the principal shareholders,authorization for the new association to include the deferred loan losses in its regulatory capital,and granting of a tax certification.
an agency performance of its regulatory or sovereign functions does not create contractual obligations.something more is necessary.d n bank united states,citation omitted,reh g denied,reh g en banc denied.here there is nothing more than the bank board performance of its regulatory function.
the bank board addressing of the notice of approval to the thrift four largest shareholders can not be viewed as manifesting intent to enter into a contract with them.the obvious reason for the board doing so was because the board a
