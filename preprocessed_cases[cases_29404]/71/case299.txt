this case,which was filed in district court for the middle district of georgia but consolidated with the worldcom securities litigation in the district court for the southern district of new york denise cote,judge,presents several issues,four of which encompass questions of georgia law,william holmes and four entities under his control collectively,holmes or plaintiffs,once held a substantial number of shares in worldcom,the telecommunications giant,and allegedly refrained from selling those shares on the advice of their brokerage firm,citigroup global markets,citigroup,then salomon smith barney,ssb,and jack grubman,an ssb financial analyst holmes decision,allegedly induced by defendants fraudulent misrepresentations,resulted in the financial demise of holmes and the entities.
we consider whether the district court erred in denying plaintiffs untimely motion to amend their complaint or dismissing plaintiffs claim under georgia blue sky law on the grounds that plaintiffs failed to state a claim under the relevant statute.further,resolution of this appeal requires us to consider whether georgia courts would recognize plaintiffs claims of fraud based on defendants alleged intent to cause plaintiffs to refrain from selling securities,plaintiffs have adequately pleaded proximate cause under georgia law,and ssb owed plaintiffs a fiduciary duty under georgia law.we affirm the judgment of the district court with respect to the first two of these five issues.because the state highest court has not directly addressed the remaining issues and because we are unable to predict with certainty how the court would rule on them in the instant case,we certify the final three questions to the supreme court of georgia.
background 
where,as here,we consider a district court dismissal of a complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,we accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true.burch pioneer credit recovery,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in,plaintiffs owned approximately million shares of worldcom stock.holmes alleges that on june,he ordered his ssb broker to sell all of his worldcom stock.at that time,worldcom stock was trading at approximately per share.according to holmes,the broker advised him not to sell the stock and observed that recent research reports by jack grubman had taken a favorable view of worldcom.holmes believed that the advice given by grubman in his reports was reliable because,as holmes put it,grubman reputation for excellence in analysis of telecommunications securities imbued him with status as a swashbuckling deal broker who knew everyone who was anyone in the telecom sector including worldcom ceo bernard ebbers.joint appendix at.
based on the broker advice and grubman reports,holmes not only refrained from selling the worldcom stock,but also purchased additional shares as the price per share declined.in october,holmes was forced to sell his worldcom stock so that his ssb account would satisfy ssb minimum balance requirement.according to holmes,these margin call sales resulted in losses of nearly million.the holmes entities then filed for chapter bankruptcy in the bankruptcy court for the middle district of georgia.
in june,plaintiffs brought the instant action seeking compensatory and punitive damages under georgia law in the same bankruptcy court as an adversary proceeding related to the chapter bankruptcy proceeding.shortly thereafter,plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging,among other things,that ssb and grubman made negligent and fraudulent misrepresentations designed to induce them to purchase and to refrain from selling worldcom securities.the gravamen of this compliant was that defendants operated under a conflict of interest,commencing in april,when ssb began to provide underwriting services to worldcom at the same time that grubman made purportedly objective investment recommendations in his reports to investors such as holmes.holmes alleged that ssb knew that worldcom stock was grossly overvalued but nevertheless promoted it to him and other account holders in order to secure worldcom investment banking business.
the case was transferred to the district court for the southern district of new york and consolidated,for purposes,in the worldcom securities litigation.see holmes grubman in re worldcom.sec.litig,civ,wl,at,holmes i or march opinion.after the transfer,holmes filed a second amended complaint and defendants moved to dismiss.on march,the district court granted defendants motion on the grounds that under georgia tort law,plaintiffs can not recover damages arising from their decision to hold securities instead of selling them,id.at plaintiffs failed to identify the statutory provision giving rise to their securities claim under georgia securities laws,id.at and plaintiffs failed to plead adequately their breach of contract claim,id.the district court,sua sponte,permitted plaintiffs to file a third amended complaint,with the following instructions

plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint,alleging that defendants recommended that investors purchase worldcom stock solely as a means to retain worldcom investment banking business and despite defendants knowledge of worldcom weak prospects.see holmes grubman in re worldcom.sec.litig,d,holmes ii.the third amended complaint contained the following seven causes of action fraudulent misrepresentation and omission of worldcom financial condition and the defendants conflict of interest breach of fiduciary duty negligent misrepresentation for misleading information and omissions negligence in making disclosures violation of georgia blue sky laws,as codified at section of the annotated georgia code breach of contract and a holder,one based on holmes decision,allegedly induced by ssb,to forbear the sale of worldcom to preserve the issue for appeal.id.at.for the first time,plaintiffs alleged that defendants made fraudulent misrepresentations that induced plaintiffs to purchase worldcom securities prior to june.id.at.

discussion 
before this court,plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in denying them leave to amend their complaint to include claims based on their purchases of worldcom securities prior to june,and in dismissing plaintiffs blue sky law claims for failure to identify with requisite specificity ssb alleged violation of ann.according to plaintiffs,the district court erred in dismissing their remaining claims after predicting that georgia courts would hold that,under georgia law,plaintiffs could not be granted relief based on their holder claims plaintiffs failed to plead proximate cause,and ssb did not owe plaintiffs a fiduciary duty 
leave to amend 
pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,a court should freely give leave to amend when justice so requires.we review a district court denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion.see,mccarthy dun bradstreet,cir sims blot,cir a district court has abused its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or rendered a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.internal citations,alterations,and quotation marks omitted.generally,a district court has discretion to deny leave for good reason,including futility,bad faith,undue delay,or undue prejudice to the opposing party.mccarthy,at.where,as here,a scheduling order governs amendments to the complaint,see.b a schedule may be modified only for good cause and with the judge consent,the lenient standard under rule a,which provides leave to amend shall be freely given,must be balanced against the requirement under rule b that the court scheduling order shall not be modified except upon a showing of good cause.grochowski phoenix,quoting older versions of federal rules of civil procedure a,b.whether good cause exists turns on the diligence of the moving party.id.
it is undisputed that plaintiffs motion to enlarge their complaint to include purchases was untimely under the district court scheduling order.in rejecting holmes untimely motion,the district court concluded that plaintiffs had not been diligent in setting forth claims arising from their purchases of worldcom and had not shown good cause for their failure to include those claims in earlier versions of the complaint.specifically,the district court recounted 
holmes had never referred to any claims based on,purchases in his prior pleadings and motion practice,and as a result,leave to amend was confined to claims based on purchases of worldcom stock after june.indeed,in his prior pleadings holmes s claims hinged on his asserted reliance on a june,telephone conversation.based on that call,holmes alleged that he decided to not sell the million shares of worldcom stock that he owned,deciding to hold that stock and acquire an unidentified amount of additional shares after june.based on that cryptic reference to purchases made in reliance on the defendants representations,holmes was granted a limited leave to amend his complaint for a fourth time.
holmes ii,d at see also id.at explaining that defendants contend that this is in fact plaintiffs fifth amendment.
we agree with the district court assessment of plaintiffs actions.the record is devoid of evidence supporting plaintiffs contention that good cause existed for the district court to modify its scheduling order.accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of holmes motion to amend.
georgia blue sky law 
we review de novo the district court dismissal of plaintiffs claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.b.see,burch,at.we construe plaintiffs complaint liberally,accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true,and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.id.
in order to survive a motion to dismiss under rule b,a complaint must include a plain statement of the claim that give s the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.patane clark,cir internal quotation marks omitted alterations in original.plaintiffs second amended complaint asserted that i n recommending the purchase of worldcom stock defendants violated title chapter of the official code of georgia,at,and further alleged that ssb knowingly made false and misleading statements in proceedings governed by chapter of the official code of georgia,at.as the district court noted,that section of the georgia code contains different prohibitions,many of which proscribe false or misleading statements.holmes ii,d at see also ann.in dismissing holmes second amended complaint,the district court had stated,to the extent plaintiffs wish to pursue a claim under ann,they must identify the specific provision they seek to enforce.holmes i,wl,at.
notwithstanding the district court instructions,holmes third amended complaint neither cited a specific provision of the statute,nor referred to particular false or misleading statements that allegedly violated the statute.the complaint stated simply that ssb,as a securities dealer,knowingly made false and misleading statements in proceedings governed by title chapter section of the official code of georgia.we agree with the district court that plaintiffs complaint effectively obstructed any analysis of whether plaintiffs pleading stat ed a claim,under georgia securities statute,insofar as the complaint tracks several of the statute provisions.holmes ii,d at.because plaintiffs failed to provide ssb with fair notice of their claim and the grounds upon which it rested,the district court dismissal of this claim was entirely appropriate.
remaining claims 
the district court dismissed holmes remaining claims,which sounded in georgia law,after concluding that plaintiffs had not stated grounds for relief.as we explain below,the supreme court of georgia has not addressed the questions necessary for resolving these issues.
holder claims 
the supreme court of georgia has defined one of the elements of the tort of fraud as an intention to induce the plaintiff to act or refrain from acting.stiefel schick,emphasis added quotation marks omitted.while that court has not applied this rule in the context of fraud claims arising from the holding of publicly traded securities,it has not foreclosed that possibility.the georgia court of appeals,georgia intermediate appellate court,has on two occasions touched on the subject.in mack smith,the georgia court of appeals dismissed a fraud claim,in part,because the plaintiffs did not purchase the securities or investment contracts.more recently,however,the same court affirmed a judgment for plaintiffs who claimed to have been fraudulently induced into making and keeping their investments.argentum int l,llc woods,emphasis added.
the district court acknowledged in a related case that georgia courts have not addressed the issue,but nevertheless rejected the holder claims,citing the inherent difficulty of proving reliance and damages in such actions,as well as the potential for suits brought merely to extract a settlement,and the possibility that holder claims would throw open to the trier of fact many rather hazy issues of historical fact the proof of which depended almost entirely on oral testimony about largely conjectural and speculative damages.weinstein ebbers in re worldcom.sec.litig,d,internal quotation marks omitted.the district court also noted that individuals who have not actually purchased securities are not entitled to sue under section b of the securities exchange act of,et.see in re worldcom.sec,d at citing blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d.
plaintiffs argue that holder claims would be recognized under georgia law because forbearance,an induced failure to act,has long been recognized as a valid basis for claims sounding in fraud.see,restatement second of torts one who fraudulently makes a misrepresentation of fact,opinion,intention or law for the purpose of inducing another to act or to refrain from action in reliance upon it,is subject to liability to the other in deceit for pecuniary loss caused to him by his justifiable reliance upon the misrepresentation.emphasis added gullock spectrum scis.software,d,the supreme court of georgia has routinely cited to the restatement of torts for positive authority collecting cases.plaintiffs further note that several california,new york,and new fraud claims based on forbearance in the sale of publicly traded securities.among other cases,plaintiffs rely on small fri
