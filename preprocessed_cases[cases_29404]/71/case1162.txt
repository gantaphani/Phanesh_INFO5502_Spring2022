joseph nacchio and robert woodruff,the former chief executive officer and chief financial officer of qwest communications international,qwest,respectively,appeal the district court approval of a class action settlement in a securities fraud case.the settlement was negotiated between the class,including lead plaintiffs new england health care employees pension fund,clifford mosher,tejinder singh,and sotpal singh collectively plaintiffs,and qwest,including eleven of its officers.nacchio and woodruff were not included in the approved settlement.our jurisdiction arises under and we remand to the district court so that it might make appropriate findings and conclusions with respect to nacchio and woodruff objections to the settlement.
background 
this case began on july,with a class action complaint alleging various federal securities laws violations by employees of qwest.aplt.app.at.several other complaints were subsequently filed,and the operative complaint is plaintiffs fifth amended complaint filed on february,which includes fourteen former qwest employees and arthur andersen accountants as defendants arthur anderson llp joins qwest brief and contributed to the settlement.id.at,aplt.br.at aplee.br.at.after difficult and arms length negotiations with mediators.at,qwest and eleven of its officers came to a settlement agreement with the plaintiff class,and plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion for preliminary approval of a stipulation for partial settlement on november.id.at,pl.br.at.
nacchio and woodruff were not included in the settlement negotiations but were informed that they would be included if they would pay personally into any settlement fund.at.plaintiffs believed that nacchio and woodruff were especially culpable and should not be allowed to join a settlement in which only qwest would pay.id.nacchio and woodruff were not so inclined and therefore were not included in the final settlement.id.at.both nacchio and woodruff have agreements with qwest that require qwest to indemnify them for any reasonable amounts they might pay in settlement of a lawsuit against them as former directors or officers.id.at,aplt.br.at.
the settlement includes three provisions that are at issue in this appeal.aplt.br.at.the first,as required by section of the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,bars contribution claims between and among the released persons and defendants defined to include nacchio and woodruff based on,relating to,or arising out of the released claims.at.this is the reform act bar see id.
the second states,in relevant part,that the defendants are permanently barred,enjoined,and restrained from commencing,prosecuting,or asserting any claim,if any,however styled,whether for indemnification,contribution,or otherwise and whether arising under state,federal,or common law,against the released persons based on,arising out of,or relating to the released claims.id.this is the complete bar.see id.at.
the third provision includes two separate provisions that are grouped and addressed together as the contractual provisions.id.at aplee br.at.the first states that the class will not settle any claim or judgment against a defendant without obtaining from the defendant the release of any and all claims the defendant may have against any of the released persons based on,arising out of,relating to,or in connection with the released claims or the subject matter thereof.at.the second orders that to the extent but only to the extent not covered by the reform act bar order the complete bar order,the lead plaintiffs,on behalf of themselves and the class,further agree that they will reduce or credit any settlement or judgment up to the amount of such settlement or judgment they may obtain against a defendant by an amount equal to the amount of any settlement or final,judgment that a defendant may obtain against any of the released persons based on,arising out of,relating to,or in connection with the released claims or the subject matter thereof.id.at.
the district court preliminarily approved the partial settlement on january,id.at,and,after a motion by plaintiffs and briefing by the parties,a hearing on final approval of the settlement was held on may.at.nacchio and woodruff objected to the settlement on several grounds.id.at.all parties were heard at this hearing.id.at.on september,the district court entered its partial final judgment and order of partial dismissal with prejudice pfj,overruling nacchio and woodruff objections b ased on the reasons stated,arguments advanced,and authorities cited by qwest in its reply.id.at.the district court held that the settlement was fair,reasonable,and adequate to the extent.e c applies to nacchio and woodruff.id.at.the district court entered its final judgment on october.at,nacchio and woodruff appeal followed.id.at.
discussion 
nacchio and woodruff attack the district court approval of the settlement on several grounds,but we need only address whether they have standing to challenge the settlement and whether the district court provided sufficient findings and conclusions pursuant to the pfj for appellate review.we hold that nacchio and woodruff have standing and remand the case for the district court to provide a more extensive explanation for its decision.
it is well established that any party,including the court sua sponte,can raise the issue of standing for the first time at any stage of the litigation,including on appeal.rector city and county of denver,cir.qwest did not object to nacchio and woodruff standing in the district court but now challenge it.aplee.br.at.
whether a plaintiff has standing is a legal question,which we review de novo.lippoldt cole,cir.federal courts may only hear actual cases or controversies,const.art.iii,cl,and a plaintiff bears the burden of proving standing.see bronson swensen,cir.a plaintiff must prove it has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.id.
in order to have standing to challenge a settlement,parties must demonstrate that they have been prejudiced by the settlement.in re integra realty,in re integra i,cir.plain legal prejudice sufficient to confer standing upon a litigant in a class action has been found to include any interference with a party contract rights or a party ability to seek contribution or indemnification.id.quoting agretti anr freight,cir internal brackets omitted.a party also suffers plain legal prejudice if the settlement strips the party of a legal claim or cause of action,such as a cross claim or the right to present relevant evidence at trial.id.at.
qwest argues that nacchio and woodruff do not have standing to challenge the contractual provisions,the complete bar,or the reform act bar.see aplee.br.at.first,it argues that the contractual provisions simply reflect an agreement in which plaintiffs will not collect money from nacchio and woodruff for which qwest and the other released persons are ultimately liable,and that nacchio and woodruff are not deprived of any claims or legal rights.id.at.thus,nacchio and woodruff can not show they have suffered an injury in fact.id.at.similarly,nacchio and woodruff can not show an injury in fact with respect to independent claims claims related to the same factual situation as the settlement but not based upon liability to plaintiffs and claims by who were not before the court that are barred by the complete bar and the reform act bar.id.at.nacchio and woodruff,qwest argues,have not identified any particular independent claims or,the claims of that would be barred,or how they have standing to represent any interests.id.qwest suggests that any independent claims could be brought once they actually develop.id.at.
we disagree.as to the complete bar and the reform act bar,clearly,nacchio and woodruff have standing to challenge these provisions both bar orders strip nacchio and woodruff of their contribution and indemnification rights,in addition to certain independent claims.further,in this case,the contractual provisions clearly impact nacchio and woodruff contribution and indemnification rights by requiring them to release their claims against qwest and then lose the benefit of any possible indemnification in a settlement with plaintiffs.as protection for qwest,plaintiffs,in addition to obtaining a release from nacchio and woodruff,must lower any agreed settlement amount by the indemnity amount nacchio and woodruff could receive from qwest,making it impossible for nacchio and woodruff to receive any indemnification from a settlement with plaintiffs.such an arrangement,in addition to the bar orders that eliminate certain independent claims and claims against,essentially strip,and,in any event,palpably interfere with,nacchio and woodruff preexisting rights and potential legal claims.they have therefore suffered the requisite plain legal prejudice sufficient to confer standing with respect to both the contractual provisions and the bar orders.see see also tbg,bendis,cir holding that the court should not purport to bar claims it has no power to bar,even if it thinks that there really are no such claims.
the dissent argues that nacchio and woodruff do not have standing to challenge the contractual provisions because the contractual provisions represent a private contractual agreement between plaintiffs and qwest that does not divest nacchio and woodruff of any preexisting rights or legal claims.as noted,the contractual provisions interfere with nacchio and woodruff indemnification claims against qwest.our precedent in this regard,upon which the dissent relies,clearly held that plain legal prejudice has been found to include any interference with a party contract rights or a party ability to seek contribution or indemnification.in re integra i,at quoting agretti,at emphasis added.in in re integra i,the parties lacked standing on a claim that immediate payment of settlement amounts would make it more difficult for the parties to defend their cases.in contrast,the contractual provisions here interfere with nacchio and woodruff ability to seek indemnification and therefore come within the terms of our precedent 
ii.the district court analysis 
the district court approval of a class action settlement is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.shoels klebold,cir.w henever a district judge is required to make a discretionary ruling that is subject to appellate review,we have to satisfy ourselves,before we can conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion,that he exercised his discretion,that is,that he considered the factors relevant to that exercise.united states cunningham,cir.nacchio and woodruff argue that,because the district court approved the challenged provisions merely on the basis of the reasons stated,arguments advanced,and authorities cited by qwest in it reply,without any independent reasoning or analysis,the case must be remanded for an explanation with more particularity.aplt.br.at.for a slightly different reason,we agree.
we recognize that findings of fact and conclusions of law supplied by a party and adopted verbatim by a district court will not automatically render a decision reversible and are held to the normal appellate standards.see anderson city of bessemer city,d.this case,however,is different.the district court in anderson provided a clear listing of its findings of fact and conclusions of law for appellate review.the district court here,after summarizing nacchio and woodruff contentions and explaining the challenged provisions,simply overrule d nacchio and woodruff objections,noting only that the provisions were either legally required,or were legally appropriate in the case b ased on the reasons stated,arguments advanced,and authorities cited by qwest in its reply.moreover,the district court order did not address a supplemental brief filed by nacchio and woodruff apparently filed without objection responding to that reply.aplt.reply br.at.
this is insufficient.when it comes to page after page of complex legal argument,we need to know what path the district court followed.qwest reply contains pages of text and eight exhibits spanning one hundred pages.at.the reply is argument to the district court and was not intended to represent any findings or conclusions for an appellate court to review.we prefer to assess the justification for a bar order in the first instance on the basis of concrete facts found by the district court,and with the assistance of the district court full consideration and discussion of all of the relevant facts of the instant case and a full discussion of the relevant persuasive authorities and the underlying reasons and policies justifying whatever order the district court ultimately approves.aal high yield bond fund deloitte touche llp,cir.on remand,the district court should illuminate its overruling of nacchio and woodruff objections.
the dissent relies upon in re integra realty res.integra ii,cir to suggest that we should decide the case on the current record.just as we are unwilling to exercise the discretion of the district court,we are unwilling to guess at the path the district court followed in resolving serious legal issues,as opposed to factual matters.we need something to show how,and on what basis,the court analyzed nacchio and woodruff objections,in a form other than qwest argument.a remand of this case is the only way to ensure that we get it.
the district court here,in addition to addressing any matters it might find appropriate,should determine whether the contribution bar order mandated by the pslra is exclusive.deloitte,at.if the district court determines that the pslra bar order is not exclusive,then it should address the persuasive authorities,reasons,and policies for and against the imposition of a broader bar order that would bar claims arising from liability to plaintiffs other than the instant plaintiffs or would bar truly independent claims.id.the district court should address any particular fact or circumstance relevant to its resolution and state why it is relevant,keeping in mind that the court should not purport to bar claims it has no power to bar,even if it thinks that there really are no such claims.bendis,at.finally,after engaging in this analysis,the district court should determine whether the settlement is fair,reasonable,and adequate under.e.see deloitte,at.
because the majority errs in its determination that joseph nacchio and robert woodruff defendants have standing to contest the two contractual provisions,and in its decision to remand to the district court for a more detailed analysis of defendants objections,i respectfully dissent.
i agree with the majority that defendants have standing to contest the complete bar order and the reform act bar order.i disagree,however,that they have standing to contest the two contractual provisions.
the contractual provisions protect the settling defendants and other released persons in the event that the bar orders fail to do so.the first of the contractual provisions is an indemnification clause.it provides,in essence,that if plaintiffs obtain a settlement or judgment against defendants,and defendants successfully recover some of that liability from any of the released persons,then plaintiffs will subtract that amount from the settlement or judgment against defendants similarly,the second of the contractual provisions contains an agreement by plaintiffs not to settle any claim or judgment against defendants without obtaining a release of any claims defendants may have against the released persons 
defendants do not have standing to challenge these provisions.to have standing under article iii,defendants must demonstrate standing for each claim that they seek to press.daimlerchrysler cuno,d.in a closely analogous situation,we recently explained 
defendants generally have no standing to complain about a settlement,since they are not members of the settling class 
courts have recognized a limited exception to this rule where nonsettling parties can demonstrate they are prejudiced by a settlement.however,it is not sufficient for the defendants to show merely the loss of some practical or strategic advantage in litigating their case.prejudice in this context means plain legal prejudice,as when the settlement strips the party of a legal claim or cause of action.
in re integra realty,in re integra i,cir citations,alterations,and some internal quotation marks omitted.
contrary to the majority misreading of the contractual provisions,they do not essentially strip or palpably interfere with defendants preexisting rights and potential legal claims.majority op.at.rather,the contractual provisions simply provide for a private contractual agreement between plaintiffs and the released persons,whereby plaintiffs agree not to negotiate a settlement with defendants that prejudices the released to indemnify the released persons if they do.even if the practical effect of the contractual provisions is to decrease plaintiffs incentive to settle with the defendants,this show s merely the loss of some practical or strategic advantage in litigating their case,rather than any plain legal prejudice.in re integra i,at.
by paraphrasing the terms of the second contractual provision as mandat ing that plaintiffs must obtain a release,majority op.at,the majority omits the simple fact that defendants remain in control of whether they will,or will not,enter into a settlement with plaintiffs in the first place.defendants have choices.unless and until defendants agree to a settlement with plaintiffs,the question of a release does not arise.as for the first contractual provision,which the majority describes as mandat ing that plaintiffs must reduce the settlement amount by any amount defendants might still receive as an indemnity from qwest,majority op.at,this provision merely guarantees that plaintiffs will not indirectly recover additional amounts from the released persons,over and above the million that the released persons have already agreed to pay under the settlement.this provision ensures that,if plaintiffs recover x from defendants,and defendants later recover that amount x from the released persons via,for instance,an action for indemnification,then plaintiffs will reduce their recovery against defendants to nothing.this agreement is solely between plaintiffs and the released persons.it guarantees the released persons that their total liability will be more,no provides them with the peace of mind that settling parties both expect and require.defendants are not prejudiced by either contractual provision.
the majority standing analysis,moreover,is infinitely,and its perfunctory attempt to reconcile its holding with in re integra i is unpersuasive.majority op.at.the majority relies upon an isolated statement from in re integra i that p lain legal prejudice has been found to include any interference with a party contract rights or a party ability to seek contribution or indemnification.in re integra i,at quoting agretti anr freight,cir.however,the seventh circuit decision in which the language was lifted exactly why defendants do not have standing to contest the contractual provisions in this case.in agretti,at,two and local union previously agreed upon a labor contract,and a majority of the members of local had ratified the contract.several members of local,though,brought a class action against anr and local,arguing,among other things,that the ratification process was improper.id.at.eventually,the plaintiff class reached a settlement with local,which required local to declare the ratification vote and anr implementation of the profit sharing plan void and required local to assist the plaintiffs and cooperate with them for the rest of the litigation against anr.id.at.the defendant,anr,objected to the settlement,arguing that it suffer ed plain legal prejudice because the settlement invalidate d its contracts with local and violate d its due process rights,and that its contract rights were invalidated by the settlement because the settlement require d a repudiation of the contract between local and anr.id.at.the seventh circuit flatly rejected this argument 
we do not believe that anr rights are legally prejudiced by this provision or any other one in the settlement.local is not repudiating the contract,the settlement simply requires it to make some unilateral declarations.anr still has all of its rights under the contract and may protect those rights through any contractual provisions or legal action.nor is anr precluded in any manner from enforcing its rights under the contract with local.while local is required under the settlement to declare the ratification vote and implementation of the profit sharing plan void,anr may continue to assert its position that the vote and profit sharing plan are valid and enforceable.
like anr,defendants here are not legally prejudiced by the contractual provisions.id.at.the contractual provisions simply require some unilateral declarations by parties other than defendants.id.at.defendants still ha ve all of their rights under the ir indemnification contract s and may protect those rights through any contractual provisions or legal action.id.at.nor are defendants precluded in any manner from enforcing their rights under the ir contract s with qwest.id.even with the contractual provisions in force,defendants may continue to assert their position that their indemnification rights are valid and enforceable.id.thus,under the seventh circuit decision in agretti,which we relied upon verbatim in in re integra i,at,the majority standing analysis fails,and defendants lack standing to challenge the contractual provisions here see also in re sch.asbestos,cir holding that defendants lacked standing to challenge a similar provision.
in their briefs,defendants appear to recognize that their standing argument is weak as to the contractual provisions,and they assert a scattershot of alleged injuries resulting from the contractual provisions.none of the alleged injuries,however,is sufficient to confer standing.for instance,defendants contend,in passing,that the provisions were a breach of qwest bylaws,contracts with defendants and obligations of good faith and fair dealing,as well as a tortious interference with their indemnification rights.defendants reply br.at.defendants,though,provide no legal authority for such claims and do not explain how the contractual provisions rise to such a level.see am.airlines christensen,cir it is insufficient merely to state in one brief that one is appealing an adverse ruling below without advancing reasoned argument as to the grounds for the appeal.
the majority also errs in vacating the district court order and remanding for more detailed analysis by the district court.
the district court consideration and analysis,while not perfect,were more than adequate in this case.in a recent case,we addressed an almost identical situation as the one we face here,where objectors argue d that the district court did not adequately support its approval of the settlement by explaining the reasons for its approval and for its rejection of the objections that were raised.in re integra realty,in re integra ii,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.we explained 
to be sure,a reviewing court must have some basis for distinguishing between conclusions arrived at after a comprehensive consideration of all relevant factors,and mere boilerplate approval phrased in appropriate language but unsupported by evaluation of the facts or analysis of the law.newman stein,cir quoting protective comm.for indep.stockholders of tmt trailer ferry,anderson,d.however,while more extensive explanation by the district court may have been helpful to our review,we will not overturn the district court decision on the basis of a merely formal deficiency as long as the decision finds support in the record.protective,at.
id.alteration in original.because the district court in that case considered all prior proceedings in the case and all objections and submissions that were made in connection with the proposed settlement,reviewed materials that included all written objections to the settlement,heard objections at the settlement fairness hearing,and was aware of all the issues that appellants now argue should have be
