jagan reddy reddy,the defendant below,appeals from an order of the court of chancery granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs below,mbks company limited,a british virgin islands corporation bvi,and its subsidiaries,mbks and mbks ii,both delaware corporations the mbks companies the legal issue presented on this appeal is whether the court of chancery correctly determined that certain actions by reddy constituted a cancellation of shares of the mbks companies.the court of chancery held that they did,and that because the charters of those companies had not been amended to authorize that alteration of their capital structure,reddy actions were legally ineffective.as a consequence,the court of chancery determined that bvi remained the owner of both mbks companies.we hold that the court of chancery properly granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs,and affirm.
in late,bvi formed two delaware subsidiary corporations,the mbks companies,as vehicles to acquire two apartment complexes in colorado.at that time,bvi owned ten shares in each mbks company and was the record owner of both.in turn,the record stockholder of bvi was sultan khalid bin mahfouz bin mahfouz.reddy was a personal employee of bin mahfouz cousin,sami baarma baarma 
at the core of this dispute are certain oral agreements that reddy and baarma made before baarma died on march.the court of chancery assumed and no one here disputes that those oral agreements were,in fact,made.reddy and baarma conducted their business substantially on the basis of oral agreements and mutual trust,as evidenced by a nearly complete lack of formal documentation of various transactions involving the mbks companies.
a.the share purchase agreement as later modified 
in,reddy and baarma agreed that,in exchange for making a capital contribution,reddy would receive an equity interest in both mbks companies.reddy contribution was intended to finance the acquisition of a third apartment building in colorado.the record contains two sets of resolutions of the mbks companies that reflect this share purchase agreement.the original by baarma and reddy but the sale to reddy of shares of each mbks company at a price of per share.a second set of resolutions,produced by reddy,consisted of copies of the original resolutions that were dated may,and contained two modifications that reddy had handwritten and initialed.specifically,the number of shares of each mbks company to be issued to reddy was increased from to shares,and the per share consideration was decreased from to per share.although baarma did not sign or initial those changes,reddy asserts that baarma consented to the modifications,but provides no explanation for why those changes were made.in any event,under both the original and the modified resolutions,the total consideration reddy would pay for his stock in each mbks company was.the only substantive difference between the two sets of resolutions is the increase in the number of shares reddy would receive in exchange for that total consideration.
those resolutions,as drafted,were not implemented.that is,reddy did not pay any cash consideration to the mbks companies for the shares because he claims at some point in,it became apparent that additional capital infusions were not needed.as a result reddy further claims,he and baarma orally modified the previously modified resolutions,with the result that reddy would receive shares in each mbks company,but would pay the cash consideration not to the mbks companies,but instead to certain persons to be named by baarma.those persons would include baarma mistresses and household staff.according to reddy,the payments would be made on baarma death and were structured in this manner in order to circumvent the estate administration process.
baarma died in march.but,reddy paid no monies to baarma designees,despite his earlier agreement to do so.the reason,reddy claims,is that it was impossible to make payments to baarma designees,so instead he made the payments to the mbks companies,in.although reddy made payments totaling to the mbks companies,he did that only after this lawsuit had been brought against him in the court of chancery by bvi and the mbks companies.
b.the distribution agreement 
in order for this narrative to be complete,another agreement,also entered into in,is critical.reddy claims that,in addition to the share purchase agreement described above,he and baarma entered into a separate oral agreement the distribution agreement.this separate agreement was that if a united states citizen ever became a record shareholder of bvi,then bvi would distribute proportionately all its shares in the two mbks companies to its bvi stockholders.reddy claims that this distribution agreement was entered into for tax reasons.the distribution agreement was never reduced to writing and it was never disclosed to anyone else,including bin mahfouz,who was one of bvi two directors.not until october did reddy inform bin mahfouz that this agreement existed.the significance of the timing of that nondisclosure will soon appear.
according to reddy,the distribution agreement remained dormant until it sprang to life in,when reddy first became a bvi record shareholder after baarma death in march,reddy began negotiating with bin mahfouz who knew nothing of the distribution agreement,seeking bin mahfouz formal recognition of reddy stock ownership interest in bvi.reddy claimed equity interest in bvi was premised on certain investments he made in in connection with bvi initial purchase through the mbks companies of the colorado properties.the result of these negotiations was reduced to written resolutions signed by reddy and bin mahfouz who were bvi only directors on april.those resolutions recognized reddy as the owner of a interest in bvi,retroactive to october.reddy ownership in bvi is not contested in this litigation.what is contested is reddy claim that he also owns a stock interest in the mbks companies,by virtue of the share purchase agreement as modified,and the distribution agreement.
c.the august resolutions implementing the share purchase and the distribution agreements 
on august,reddy,acting as the sole director of the mbks companies,unilaterally adopted resolutions that he claims implemented his agreements with baarma.those august contain various whereas clauses that purport to explain reddy actions and to state his version of the undocumented agreements with that 
during fourth quarter and first quarter it was further agreed between baarma and reddy that,under certain circumstances,reddy would be issued stock amounting to of the transaction.with the unexpected and premature death of baarma on march,which was a special circumstance,a april,resolution of the board of directors of bvi gave reddy a ownership in the company as of october.
pursuant to an agreement between mbks and bvi that required the shares of bvi sic to be held by bvi shareholders if a citizen was a shareholder of bvi,reddy has now decided,for tax reasons,to own the mbks shares directly and not via bvi.
about may,the directors of mbks approved the purchase by reddy of shares of mbks.
resolved that reddy be granted shares of mbks,diluting the ownership of bvi.
resolved that the shares held by bvi in mbks be reissued in the names of the shareholders of bvi.therefore,shares will be held in the name of bin mahfouz and reddy will hold shares 
purporting to implement the first resolution which is claimed to reflect the share purchase agreement as modified,reddy caused the mbks companies to issue,to himself,certificates for additional shares of each mbks company.purporting to implement the second resolution which is claimed to reflect the distribution agreement,reddy wrote the word cancelled across the two certificates evidencing bvi ownership interest in each mbks company.he then caused each mbks company to issue new certificates to bin mahfouz for shares and to himself for shares.based upon those actions,reddy claims that bvi no longer has any interest in the mbks companies,and that bin mahfouz has a stock ownership interest,and that he reddy has a ownership interest,in the mbks companies.
reddy did not immediat
