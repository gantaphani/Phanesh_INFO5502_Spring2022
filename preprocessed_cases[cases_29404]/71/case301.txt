plaintiffs claims against bas allege that,in its role as the prime broker for the funds,bas aided and abetted the frauds and breaches of fiduciary duty committed by lauer and lancer management.the district court dismissed the claims,ruling that plaintiffs failed to satisfy their burden of pleading proximate causation for their losses.we disagree.the complaint includes allegations that bas knowingly and substantially assisted lauer and lancer management in deceiving plaintiffs as to the net asset values of the funds by falsifying the values of the funds holdings on position reports,which bas knew would be relied upon by the funds auditor and administrators in calculating and verifying the funds net asset values navs.it alleges further that the plaintiffs reasonably relied upon the false representations regarding the funds navs net asset values in deciding to invest in remain invested in the funds,and that the falsely inflated net asset values were used to justify the payment of fees to lauer,lancer management,and others,which drained the assets of the funds.in our view,the complaint sufficiently pleaded that bas actions proximately caused the plaintiffs losses.
background 
the allegations of the second amended complaint the complaint,which in the adjudication of a motion to dismiss under rule b must be accepted as true,drawing all inferences from the pleaded facts in plaintiffs favor,wojchowski daines,cir,asserted the following facts 
the allegations of the complaint 
lauer,lancer management,and the funds 
lauer was the founder,manager and sole shareholder of lancer management,which was the funds investment manager.lauer and lancer management were responsible for all investment decisions for the funds.lancer management managed the funds in exchange for fees,which were based on the funds navs.lauer and lancer management solicited investors in the funds through personal contacts,marketers or finders,and letters and other mailings,marketing materials,newsletters and private placement memoranda ppms.
the ppms represented that the majority of the funds assets would be invested in common stocks traded on the new york stock exchange,the american stock exchange or in the market.however,lauer and lancer management caused the funds to pursue an increasingly risky strategy,investing the funds assets in restricted and thus not freely marketable shares,warrants,and investments of a small number of and companies many of which were not publicly traded at all.the majority of the securities in which the funds invested were not listed on any exchange and were quoted,if at all,on the bulletin board pink sheets.
the fraud and breaches of fiduciary duty of lauer and lancer management 
the ppms provided that the navs of the funds would be determined based on the market values of the securities held by the funds.specifically,the ppms provided that listed or quoted securities were to be valued at their last sales price on the date of determination.the ppms also provided that listed or quoted securities not sold on the date of determination as well as unlisted securities were to be valued at the mean between the bid and asked prices of the most recent date on which such prices were quoted,and if no quotes had been in the past business days,then at a valuation assigned by the board of directors.the ppms also contained a caveat that,in the event the directors determined that the listed valuation method did not represent its market value,the directors would value the securities.
as early as march,the funds began losing money on a massive scale.to hide the funds losses and show increasing navs,lauer and lancer management embarked on a scheme to manipulate and inflate their valuation of the securities held by the funds to the extent of hundreds of millions of dollars lauer and lancer management purchased for the funds substantial and sometimes controlling stakes in companies whose shares were on the open market.the funds purchases were made in private transactions they did not involve common stock,but rather securities not traded on the open market.prior to the end of the funds reporting periods,lauer and lancer management would purchase small amounts of the unrestricted,stock of these companies in such a manner as to drive up the market price of those shares.they would then improperly assign these artificially inflated values to the funds restricted holdings,thereby generating the appearance of large paper profits,and triggering payment of larger fees to lauer and lancer management.
these false inflated valuations were used in calculating the funds navs,and the false navs were disseminated to investors each month and used to prepare the funds audited financial statements.lancer offshore annual reports for,and also included fraudulent nav figures.the fraudulent nav statements and audit reports were intended to and did induce plaintiffs to invest,and remain invested,in the funds and to artificially and improperly inflate the fund management,incentive,and administrative fees,thereby draining the funds remaining assets.
lauer and lancer management owed fiduciary duties to plaintiffs as a result of lancer management role as the funds investment manager.as a result,the scheme in which lauer and lancer management misrepresented the nature and value of the securities in the funds portfolios constituted a breach of their fiduciary duty in addition to fraud.
alleged role of bas 
as the funds prime broker,bas cleared and settled trades,provided portfolio management services,and served as the central custodian for some of the securities held by the funds.bas received a commission on each of the trades it cleared and settled.because lancer management executed a high volume of trades through bas and therefore generated substantial commissions for the bank,bas provided lauer with substantial goods and services,such as funding construction of,paying rent on,and providing the infrastructure for lancer management park avenue office space.
each month,bas prepared monthly account statements account statements,which purported to reflect the value of the securities held in its custody on behalf of the funds.in order to collect the valuation information needed to generate account information,bas received an electronic data feed from one or more data providers who,in turn,obtained market prices from various securities exchanges and market makers.
bas also permitted lauer and lancer management to access reports from its computer system through a website called www.primebroker.com.upon request from lauer and lancer management,bas periodically posted reports generated by bas computer system on its website.using logins and passwords provided by bas,lauer and lancer management were able to access the bas website on a basis and view,download and print various reports posted by bas,including position reports,which purported to show the funds holdings and the values of those holdings.the position reports were the only documents in existence that listed and depicted the values of both the fund positions in bas custody and those held away from bas.
the position reports contained bas name at the top of each page.when downloaded and printed,the position reports contained no disclaimer or other marking to suggest that they were anything other than official documents prepared by bas and bearing its imprimatur.bas also gave the funds service providers access to the bas website so that they could view,download,and print position reports for the funds.
