the interlocutory appeal in this,case asks us to decide whether the amended statute of limitations in the public company accounting reform and investor protection act of,the act soa,b,revives actions that were before the effective date of the soa.following our determination that specific facts relating to inquiry notice were necessary for our decision,we returned this case to the district judge on limited remand.tello dean witter reynolds,cir.after reviewing the facts concerning inquiry notice produced on limited remand,we conclude that this case was by both the former statute of limitations and the soa statute of limitations,when it was filed.accordingly,we reverse denial of defendants motion to dismiss and remand for dismissal.
background 
factual and procedural history 
this,case concerns alleged conduct by dean witter reynolds,currently known as morgan stanley dw,and its former brokers mark rodgers and paul grande collectively,dean witter regarding,stock for internet telephone service from january,until august,on october,the securities and exchange commission sec issued an order instituting public administrative and proceedings pursuant to sections b and of the securities exchange act of,making findings and imposing remedial sanctions sec order on dean witter,rodgers,and grande.sec securities exchange act of release attached to complaint.the complaint was filed on november,by then class representative,paul roberts,who subsequently was replaced as class representative by mark tello.tello,at.
dean witter moved to dismiss the complaint and argued that the soa statute of limitations,which is two years from the date of discovery or five years from the date of the securities fraud,that became effective on july,does not control this case.b.instead,dean witter contended that the former statute of limitations governed,which required bringing an action within one year after discovery of the facts constituting the securities fraud or three years after the violation.e.although the original district judge determined that the soa limitations period revives formerly claims and denied dean witter motion to dismiss,he nonetheless permitted dean witter to seek appellate determination of this question.
on interlocutory appeal,we determined that our circuit law on inquiry notice required that we know whether the class had sufficient inquiry notice of the alleged securities fraud to have filed the complaint before the effective date of the soa.at the preliminary,stage of the case,these facts had not been developed.accordingly,on limited remand,we asked the reassigned district judge to provide the answers to two questions what established inquiry notice to the plaintiff class,and when did that occur and when did the plaintiff class have sufficient information to file suit tello,at.
proceedings on limited remand 
the district judge conducted a status conference and requested that the parties provide him with a joint stipulation of the time that they would need for the limited discovery required to answer our questions.the parties stipulated that they would need ninety days to conduct limited discovery necessary to answer our questions and that this limited discovery would consist of an exchange of document requests and tello deposition.thereafter,the district judge entered an order scheduling limited discovery and briefs on the issues to be addressed on limited remand to be followed by an evidentiary hearing and oral argument.
in the brief for the class with accompanying exhibits on remand,tello position is that there was no inquiry notice of dean witter scheme regarding stock until it was exposed and delineated in the sec order on october.he asserts that the class complaint was filed promptly within six weeks after the sec order issued.in contrast,dean witter view,supported by its brief and exhibits,is that the precipitous drop in stock,combined with numerous articles in nationally and regionally distributed publications,discussing the abrupt decline in the price of stock,put the putative class on inquiry notice of the allegations in the complaint no later than august,the date that the last such nationally significant article was published.consequently,the class was on notice well before the new soa statute of limitations became effective on july,the former statute of limitations controls,and this case was under the prior,repose statute.as we explain hereinafter,neither side is correct in stating the cause of inquiry notice from which to calculate the time required to file the complaint.
the evidentiary hearing purportedly sought to resolve the two questions that we had posed to the district judge on limited remand.accepting the time period for the alleged securities fraud conduct by dean witter as stated in the complaint,january,through august,the parties agree that the alleged fraud ended on august.dean witter presented evidence that three events established inquiry notice for the plaintiff class.first was the percent drop in stock that occurred from august,to september,during which time ceo was issuing public statements saying nothing ha d changed about the company.second supp.at.tello purchased shares of stock on july,at per share,and he purchased shares of stock on july,at the same price.tello dep.at.as of july,he had invested over in stock,a substantial investment that tello testified caused him to check the price regularly.id.at.
second was the washington post article,a doonesbury imitation that no laughing matter,which was published on september.tello testified that t his is the only article that i ever read about.id.at.in conjunction with the dramatic drop in the price of stock,he asserted that this washington post article made me think that the stock price took a nose dive.i read this,and in my opinion,the whole world had read it and were running to sell their.id.at.recognizing that the signs of the collapse of stock were on the internet from numerous postings and articles following the drastic drop in stock value,the washington post article explains that,while revenue rose percent to,expenses rose percent to.only in cyberspace and satiric cartoons did anyone argue that a company could be worth times its annual revenue.jerry knight,a doonesbury imitation that no laughing matter,the washington post.the company never made a profit.the price of stock plummeted from a high of a share to a share,which caused percent of the investment of shareholders to evaporate and made a repetitive source of commentary on internet investment bulletin boards.such commentary,noted in the washington post article,included which had warned that,with the stock value down to,stock might tank when those freshly registered shares were unloaded.id.since stock was sold privately and not registered with the securities and exchange commission,it could not be traded and did not dilute the holdings of current investors.id.
but on disclosed in filings available on the internet that it had registered those shares and two other batches,dumping an additional million shares on the market.
in fact,according to sources familiar with trading in the stock report,investors who held the newly issued stock already had cashed in their investment before the shares were even registered,when the stock was still trading in the high teens.
selling unregistered stock is illegal,but what some investors are believed to have done was to get out in advance by is,borrowing stock from someone else and then selling it.usually,cover their positions and repay the stock loans by purchasing the stock later at a lower price.but in this case,they simply used the newly registered shares to repay the stock loans.
sale of the new shares was the third strike for stockholders,who already had been whacked by the overall stock market decline and the severe tech stock correction.
id.emphasis added.tello admitted that it would not be unreasonable for investors with considerable shares of stock to ascertain the meaning of a short squeeze through various articles and internet postings referencing this term id.at.while he did not consult any internet articles or postings,tello testified that he did not think it would be unreasonable after reading the washington post article for interested investors to locate articles on the internet regarding.id.at.
the washington post article on stock was referred to tello by his stepfather,paul roberts,whom tello succeeded as class representative and who told tello you should read that article.you need to read that article.id.at.after reading the article,tello testified as to his reaction it was not good about the company.it talked about how the company valuation was way overhauled and how they were making any money.it just was a very good article.id.
importantly,tello testified that the washington post article alerted him,as well as everybody else,of the catastrophic problems with stock and dean witter involvement 
is it also your understanding of the complaint that one of the ways in which dean witter and its employees allegedly manipulated the stock price of was by creating and promoting a plan to withhold from the short sellers a certain amount of stock to affect a short squeeze is that your understanding of the complaint 
and is it your understanding that the short squeeze somehow manipulated the price of the stock 
and do you have any evidence to believe that there was a short squeeze put in place with respect to 
that what the sec order detailed.
have you seen anything else at any time that referenced a short squeeze in connection with 
no.i read the washington post article in september of.and that was the only article that i read about the company until i then was presented with the case and the sec order in.and it was my understanding that it was due to that one washington post article that the whole stock just plummeted.
q.what did you base that understanding on is that something you came to on your own conclusion or something that someone told you 
no,something that i came to on my own,you know,justification.my stepfather told me about the article,i read it,and it just seemed like everybody else had read it and had sold their shares because the article scared them so much.and the industry was just going gangbusters,and it was,i guess,right around that time that the bubble started bursting.
would a june,petersburg times article concerning a similar experience with stock to that of tello have caused you to do any further to look into why fell as much as it did while you owned it 
no.because i had already formed my opinion that it was because of the washington post news article.
tello dep.at,emphasis added.waiting for the inevitable bounce,id.at,however,tello did not sell his stock until april for less than a share,id.at.
the third source of inquiry notice proffered by dean witter is the article,borrower,beware,published in fortune magazine on august.at the evidentiary hearing,counsel for dean witter explained that this article was important because it specifically discusses dean witter and mark rodgers as well as the allegations of unauthorized trading in stock,breach of fiduciary duty,and dean witter settlement of the claim for dean witter counsel specified the significance of the fortune article in this class action and as the third factor constituting inquiry notice 
why that reference to unauthorized trading is important is because,as alleged in the lawsuit here,unauthorized trading does just hurt the person in whose account it supposedly took place.as the plaintiff s allege here,unauthorized trading,especially in a thinly traded stock like,can be a tool that is used to create demand for a stock,and manipulate the price of the stock.
so it is our position that these three events taken together,the dramatic decline in price of stock,the washington post article,and the fortune article,that is what established inquiry notice.that is what gave a reasonably objective investor enough notice to at least begin investigating the possibility that his rights ha d been infringed.
second supp.at emphasis added.
significantly,tello knew edward ratkovich,a longtime friend of tello stepfather,roberts,the original plaintiff and class representative in this case.ratkovich was the second largest stockholder of stock,and he asked tello to replace his stepfather as the class representative in march.the same counsel who represents tello in this case represented ratkovich in a complaint filed in may against dean witter and mark rodgers,the details of which are discussed in a may,article in the petersburg times 
ratkovich and others,who pursued arbitration proceedings,had the same allegations of securities fraud against dean witter that tello makes for the class in this case.these legal proceedings against dean witter plus the various articles not only in national publications,like the washington post and fortune,but also in regional florida newspapers,led dean witter counsel to argue at the evidentiary hearing 
w hether tello chose to read all of these sources or not,i submit,is immaterial.once you are on a reasonable duty of inquiry,you are charged with knowledge of these.if you do look at them,they are going to be imputed to you.
the reasonable investigation on that date also would have led an investor to no fewer than seven articles referencing the price decline,and no fewer than five articles referencing the short squeeze and misstatements designed to discourage people from selling.all of that is part of the complaint.
w e believe the answer to the eleventh circuit second question should be that the putative class upon a reasonably diligent investigation could have had access to sufficient information to file a suit no later than august.
second supp.at emphasis added.in contrast,tello counsel maintained that the sec order was the operative date of inquiry notice,the defining moment in history when a reasonable investor should have been on both inquiry notice,and had facts sufficient to bring a claim.id.at.
following the evidentiary hearing,the district judge issued a order,a copy of which is attached as the appendix to this opinion.the judge states that,in compliance with his discovery order on our limited remand,
the parties submitted memoranda accompanied by exhibits comprising hundreds of pages of deposition,newspaper and magazine stories,business journal articles,online postings,newspaper and magazine circulation data,annual corporate reports,and pertinent stock of which the parties supplemented at the evidentiary hearing by two hours of vigorous oral argument.neither party elected to present testimony at the hearing.
first supp.at.
with the substantial evidence produced on limited remand,the district judge failed to delineate in his order any process that he used to analyze when inquiry notice occurred for the class and when there was sufficient information to file the complaint,the two questions that we remanded the case for him to answer.instead,he conclusively stated 
after affording the parties a full hearing on the inquiry notice question,the district court finds no such moment when the plaintiff class was on inquiry notice of the alleged securities fraud by dean witter relative to stock.unsurprisingly,the plaintiffs theory places inquiry notice on october,after the effective date of doc.equally unsurprisingly,the defendants theory places inquiry notice on or before august,doc.of course,the statute of repose barred the plaintiffs action on august,irrespective of inquiry notice.the parties irreconcilable versions of the pertinent history present genuine issues of material fact resolvable only by a jury.
id.at footnote omitted emphasis added.then,irrespective of inquiry notice,the judge proceeded to analyze the legal question before us on interlocutory appeal concerning whether the soa revives cases.id.at.therefore,we must decide if the testimony and evidence produced by the parties on limited remand in the district court resolve the issues that we needed answered before deciding the question presented to us on interlocutory appeal,which involves determining which statute of limitations governs in this case.
ii.discussion 
consideration of facts before the district court 
when this court remands a case to a district court with specific factual questions to resolve,we expect the district judge to answer those questions.because of our circuit law on inquiry notice,which includes factual determinations,we are unable to answer the interlocutory question on appeal until we know which statute of limitations controls in this case.the former statute of limitations for actions was within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation and within three years after such violation.e lampf,pleva,lipkind,prupis petigrow gilbertson,d.the remedial soa statute of limitations is years after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation or years after such violation.b.to comply with our circuit requirements,we asked the district judge on limited remand to make the factual determinations necessary for our legal decision on interlocutory appeal and to tell us what established inquiry notice for the plaintiff class,and when did it occur and when did the class have sufficient information to file the complaint 
although the parties produced the documentation necessary to answer these questions,including the revealing deposition of tello,the district judge has given us no indication that he reviewed and analyzed the considerable documents produced on limited remand.instead,he first characterizes our limited remand on interlocutory appeal from a motion to dismiss as an unusual event.first supp.at.second,the judge simply recited the dates that the parties considered to be operative for inquiry notice for the class,october,the date of issuance of the sec order for dean witter,august,the date of publication of the fortune article,describing specifically dean witter securities fraud.the judge did not address whatsoever the documents that the parties presented to substantiate those two dates.consequently,the judge announced that he could not determine inquiry notice,apparently based only on the evidentiary hearing.third,seemingly ignoring the issue that we sent to him for resolution,the district judge proceeded to address the issue before us on interlocutory appeal.the comments of the district judge and his failure to provide the answers to factual questions that we needed to resolve the threshold issue of inquiry notice before we can make the legal determination were unhelpful and judicially inefficient by declining to follow our specific instructions on limited remand.
many times,and in many contexts,this court has admonished district courts that their orders should contain sufficient explanations of their rulings so as to provide this court with an opportunity to engage in meaningful appellate review.danley allen,cir per curiam including cases cited in this interlocutory appeal from a motion to dismiss and remand for factfinding and legal analysis to substantiate the ruling.because the documents produced by the parties clearly resolve the issues that we wanted resolved by the district judge and because these documents were before the district judge in the first instance pursuant to his order,albeit with no apparent review,we have considered them and find the answers to our questions on limited remand to be obvious from the perspective of judicial efficiency,and because the answers to our questions are abundantly evident from the testimony and documents produced by the parties on limited remand,we now use them to resolve the issues so that we can proceed to decide the issue that has been presented to us on interlocutory appeal 
inquiry notice 
in our previous opinion,we discussed inquiry notice in our circuit in detail,which is significant for determining when knowledge of a potential securities fraud occurred,and the determination of how much time would be needed to file a complaint.tello,at.while we know that the complaint in this case was filed on november,which ostensibly would place it under the soa statute of limitations,we did not know from the record at the stage whether the plaintiff class had sufficient inquiry notice and information to have filed the complaint sooner and whether such an earlier date would have placed the class under the former statute of limitations.this was the purpose for our limited remand.
inquiry notice in our circuit occurs when there is factual evidence of the possibility of securities fraud that would cause a reasonable person to investigate whether his or her legal rights had been infringed.id.at.actual proof of securities fraud is not required for inquiry notice.id.s torm warnings are circumstances creating a duty of inquiry,such that an investor who acquires knowledge of storm warnings and does not investigate whether a securities fraud had occurred will have the available knowledge imputed to him or her.id.once inquiry notice occurs,a prospective plaintiff enters a period of reasonable diligence,which is the time necessary,exercising ordinary investigation,to ascertain sufficient facts to file a complaint.id.remedial securities laws for combating fraud,such as the soa,are enacted with the recognition that many securities frauds are inherently complex and,allowing time to develop the facts,is judicially efficient.id.at.
we concluded our analysis by explaining that the task for the district judge on remand will be to determine the point in time when the plaintiff class had sufficient information of the alleged fraudulent securities conduct by dean witter to file this class action.id.at.we stated the two questions that we wanted answered on limited remand what established inquiry notice to the plaintiff class,and when did that occur and when did the plaintiff class have sufficient information to file suit id.at.because the district judge answered neither question,we proceed to answer each based on the testimony and documentation produced on limited remand by the parties to the district judge 
establishment of inquiry notice 
dean witter asserts that three events collectively establish inquiry notice the percent drop in stock that occurred from august,to september,the washington post article,and the fortune magazine article.since the last of the publications,the fortune article,was published on august,that is the date by which dean witter contends that inquiry notice was established for the purpose of assessing the running of the statute of limitations.we address each of these occurrences as to establishing inquiry notice in our circuit.
first,we have rejected a sharp decline in stock value as indicating securities fraud,which would constitute inquiry notice.la grasta first union,cir.there may be numerous reasons,other than fraud,for a stock to decline even steeply in price.id.at.such reasons include a depressed real estate market caused either by tight money or recession,stock volatility,poor management,or general market conditions id.at quoting summer land leisure,cir.unit b.significantly,this was a period of time when the dot com technology companies were highly volatile.the plunging price of stock,however,did not cause tello to sell his stock.instead,he delayed seven months,until april,wa iting for the inevitable bounce.tello dep.at.accordingly,inquiry notice was not caused by the drastic decline in value of stock.
in contrast,tello read the washington post article within a week of its publication on september,on the advice of roberts,who also owned stock.regarding his reaction to the article,tello testified 
in my mind,the stock price plummeted because the writer of the washington post article let the cat out of the bag,and people rushed to sell their stock.
this is the only article that i ever read about.this is it.
t his is the one that made me think that the stock price took a nose dive.i read this,and in my opinion,the whole world had read it and were running to sell their.
tello dep.at,emphasis added.the article notes that became a favorite on internet investment bulletin boards.yahoo alone lists some postings about stock,most of them apparently from amateur investors taken with the company technology and lure of free calls.jerry knight,a doonesbury imitation that no laughing matter,washington post.while tello did not consult the internet bulletin boards referenced in the washington post article,he admitted that it would not be unreasonable for an interested reader to review the internet bulletin boards after reading the article.
inquiry notice for determining compliance is gauged by the knowledge of the alleged securities fraud by the class representative.franze equitable assurance,cir.inquiry notice occurs when the representative learns facts that would lead a reasonable person to begin investigating the possibility that his legal rights had been infringed the possibility of fraud is all that is required for inquiry notice,not full exposition of the scam itself.id.quoting theoharous fong,cir.tello testified that he learned of the apparent securities fraud by dean witter relating to stock from the washington post article that roberts,the preceding class representative and investor,told him to read.allowing for time to read the article,which,according to tello,was not the day of publication,but approximately a week later,inquiry notice was established at least by the end of september.
the washington post article describes the short squeeze utilized by dean witter as to stock.as he testified,tello reaction to the article was that it was enough to scare investors into selling their stock.additionally,the article references internet sites,such as,where a concerned investor could have acquired a substantial amount of information,as well as the availability of internet searches that would have located numerous articles about dean witter short squeeze conduct as to stock in september.such searches also would have revealed various arbitrations concerning.with the advent of the information superhighway,information regarding securities is easily accessed and a reasonable investor is presumed to have information available in the public domain and will be imputed with constructive knowledge of this information.whirlpool fin.gn holdings,cir.
while determination of inquiry notice is done on a basis using our caselaw guidance,it is clear that the washington post article was inquiry notice in this case for tello,as he asserts repeatedly in his deposition.it is inconsistent with the law of our circuit and tello testimony for him to argue that inquiry notice did not occur until the october,sec order,which was actual knowledge.full revelation of a securities fraud is not required for inquiry notice,only notice of the possibility of fraud,which signals the need for the class representative to commence sufficient investigation to file a complaint.therefore,inquiry notice is distinguished from actual knowledge or knowledge following full discovery.after reading the washington post article in september,roberts,the original class representative,and tello had ample information to constitute inquiry notice to have commenced the research necessary to file a complaint within a year of that inquiry notice under the former statute of limitations the testimony and evidence produced during limited remand shows that an abundance of information about dean witter conduct regarding stock was available with a simple internet search 
importantly,however,tello deposition,shows that the washington post article was sufficient inquiry notice for both roberts and tello.inquiry notice in our circuit as to securities fraud occurs when a potential plaintiff discovers facts evidencing securities fraud.tello,at citing theoharous,at.it is irrelevant that tello replaced roberts as the class representative in april or that rodgers was not tello broker,because he is held to the knowledge that he and roberts had in september from the washington post article,the only article that tello testified that he read about the rapid fall of stock,after roberts referred it to him additionally,because they were aware from the washington post article that specified the short squeeze that dean witter had used with stock,knowledge of the other readily available articles concerning stock was imputed to roberts and tello.therefore,inquiry notice was established by the end of september following publication of the washington post article,which is the answer to the first question that we asked the district judge to determine on limited remand 
timeliness of filing suit 
after requesting the district judge to establish the cause of inquiry notice and when it occurred,we next asked him to determine when the plaintiff class would have acquired sufficient information to file suit.tello,at.dean witter has produced a plethora of articles about the plummet in the price of stock that were available from through to interested investors.the washington post article notes that postings regarding the sharp drop in stock value could have been located through the internet on yahoo alone.significantly,tello testified that he and roberts knew from the washington post article that dean witter short squeeze as to stock was the reason for the drastic drop in its value.the washington post article also referenced other articles,such as the internet article on,which discussed the securities fraud in more detail.prior to,there w ere lawsuits,arbitrations,filed against dean witter and rodgers alleging fraud,unauthorized trading,and violations of the securities laws.second supp.at.these actions regarding stock were proceeding in and.yet,roberts waited until november,before filing this case.
to state a claim for relief under federal notice pleading,a complaint need contain only a short and plain statement of the basis for relief.a.fraud must be pled with particularity.b see also private securities litigation reform act of,b.the application of rule b,however,must not abrogate the concept of notice pleading.ziemba cascade int l,cir.quoting durham business mgmt,cir.see brooks blue cross blue shield of florida,cir.per curiam recognizing that rule b must be read in conjunction with rule a citations omitted.
rule b is satisfied if the complaint sets forth precisely what statements were made in what documents or oral representations or what omissions were made,and the time and place of each such statement and the person responsible for making or,in the case of omissions,not making same,and the content of such statements and the manner in which they misled the plaintiff,and what the defendants obtained as a consequence of the fraud.
ziemba,at quoting brooks,at.while a llegations of date,time or place satisfy the rule b requirement that the circumstances of the alleged fraud must be pleaded with particularity,we have acknowledged that alternative means are also available to satisfy the rule in substantiating fraud allegations.durham,at.
roberts,whose knowledge inures to tello,who replaced him as class representative,could have acquired sufficient information to have met the requirements of rule a and rule b to have filed the complaint within a year,assessed from inquiry notice in september,after the washington post article was published.other similar actions regarding dean witter conduct with respect to stock had been based on sufficient information to proceed before,and ratkovich case concerning his stock was filed on may,by the same counsel representing tello in this case moreover,roberts and tello,because of their friendship with ratkovich,the second largest shareholder of stock,had specific knowledge through him and his similar lawsuit regarding dean witter short squeeze as to stock.
the former statute of limitations for federal securities actions provided that a case must be brought within one year after discovery of the facts constituting the violation and within three years of the violation.e.the undisputed time period for the securities fraud at issue in this case was from january,until august.following the washington post article about stock in september,roberts had adequate time within a year,or by september,to have filed the complaint on behalf of the plaintiff class.with all of the information that was available as to stock,which was imputed to him,whether he read it or not,roberts had sufficient knowledge of dean witter alleged securities fraud to meet the requirements of rule a and rule b.
with regard to time needed to file this case,we asked the district judge specifically,without the sec order,could plaintiffs have been alerted to dean witter fraudulent conduct concerning stock independently to enable them to file suit before issuance of the sec order evidencing securities fraud by dean witter regarding plaintiffs investments tello,at.had the judge reviewed tello deposition,and thereby known that the washington post article provided inquiry notice,the answer would have been yes,as we have explained based on the evidence produced on limited remand.similarly,review of the evidence produced on limited remand,particularly tello deposition,would have shown that the complaint could have been filed within the former period,after inquiry notice had been established by the end of september.
determination 
on interlocutory appeal,we essentially were asked to decide whether the former statute of limitations,with a scheme,or the soa statute of limitations,with a scheme,governs this case.dean witter had the burden of proving the affirmative defense of a bar.tello,at.this case was not filed until november,which generally would make the soa statute of limitations applicable,since it applies to cases filed after its effective date of july.nevertheless,the parties do not dispute that the short squeeze,securities fraud at issue in this case ended on august.the washington post article that provided inquiry notice was published in september,and it is clear from tello deposition that this article constituted inquiry notice for roberts and tello as the successive class representatives the sec order is not the result of a judicial proceeding,and,while it would have provided supplementary evidence during discovery had the case been filed timely under the former statute of limitations,there was abundant information to have filed the class action and to have conducted full discovery without it.
both the former statute of limitations and the soa statute of limitations have an provision one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation,e,and years after discovery of the facts constituting the violation,b.dean witter alleged securities fraud concerning stock undisputedly ended in august.since the washington post article that established inquiry notice to roberts and tello was published in september,this class action could have been filed under federal notice pleading within one year,or by september,which also was within three years after such violation.e.consequently,it was untimely when it was filed on november,under the former statute of limitations.although the soa statute of limitations extends the time period within which the complaint could have been filed under inquiry notice by one year,or until september,the complaint also was untimely under analysis when it was filed on november.because of the september inquiry notice established by the washington post article,revealed by tello deposition,he can not rely on the soa repose period of five years from the violation,since the statute provides that the earlier of the two time periods controls.b.
after reviewing the remedial nature of modified,extended statutes of limitations in our first opinion,we recognized f rom analogous supreme court and circuit precedent that the temporal reach of b inherently includes securities fraud that occurred prior to the date of enactment.tello,at.nonetheless,we concluded that b is applicable to the alleged fraudulent securities conduct in this case,provided inquiry notice was not sufficiently established to enable the plaintiff class to file this class action prior to the issuance of the sec order.id.at emphasis added.as the testimony and evidence produced on limited remand revealed,inquiry notice was established in september by the washington post article.because tello and the class are under both the former statute of limitations and the soa statute of limitations,the question of whether the soa statute of limitations revives actions that were under the former statute of limitations is not presented in this case,as our analysis has shown.therefore,as we have explained,this,case was by both the former and soa statutes of limitation,even though it was filed following the effective date of the soa 
iii.conclusion 
this case came to us on interlocutory appeal from denial of dean witter motion to dismiss to decide whether the soa statute of limitations revived cases that were by the former statute of limitations.following limited remand,analysis has revealed that this,case was by both the former statute of limitations and the soa statute of limitations,when it was filed.consequently,the question posed to us on interlocutory appeal is not presented on the facts of this case.on remand,the district judge will dismiss this case as untimely filed.therefore,the denial of dean witter motion to dismiss is reversed,and this case is remanded to the district judge to enter an order of dismissal.

discussion 
this remand to the district court results in an unusual event a proceeding to determine a fact that the circuit court finds dispositive of a motion to dismiss under rule b,federal rules of civil procedure the disposition of which,to say the least,normally involves no judicial fact finding.because the circuit court acknowledges that resolving a disputed issue of inquiry notice is within the exclusive province of a and because the plaintiffs in this case have demanded and perfected their right to a jury trial the district court interprets the circuit court mandate to require a determination whether,without improperly invading the province of the jury that is,without resolving a genuine issue of material fact,the district court can identify the moment at which the plaintiffs were on inquiry notice of the alleged,actionable fraud.after affording the parties a full hearing on the inquiry notice question,the district court finds no such moment unsurprisingly,the plaintiffs theory places inquiry notice on october,after the effective date of doc.equally unsurprisingly,the defendants theory places inquiry notice on or before august,doc.of course,the statute of repose barred the plaintiffs action on august,irrespective of inquiry notice.the parties irreconcilable versions of the pertinent history present genuine issues of material fact resolvable only by a jury.
