thomas dreiling,a former infospace,infospace shareholder,filed a derivative shareholder action against america online,aol,seeking disgorgement of aol profits derived from the sale of its infospace stock.dreiling based his theory of liability on allegations that naveen jain,infospace ceo,formed a beneficial stock ownership group in his personal capacity with aol,through two aol executives in their official capacities.dreiling argues that aol and jain operated collectively to acquire,hold,and sell infospace securities,making them beneficial owners of each other stock.dreiling argues that aol was therefore an infospace insider and its profits may be disgorged under section b of the securities exchange act of the exchange act,b.dreiling asks us to accept this novel theory of liability,reverse the district court,and thereby expand section b beyond its boundaries.we decline to do so,and hold that the relationship between aol and infospace did not create a beneficial stock ownership situation such that aol was an infospace insider.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to aol.
background 
infospace an online telephone directory contacted aol an internet service provider in late or early in an effort to harness aol vast subscriber base to drive more traffic to infospace.in august,aol and infospace reached an agreement the agreement to promote and distribute an interactive web site on aol called the aol white pages.the agreement was scheduled to run for three years,with a extension option.
aol employees negotiated the agreement on aol behalf.aol also consulted its outside auditor,ernst young,concerning accounting issues that arose during the negotiations.infospace ceo naveen jain and general counsel ellen alben represented infospace in the negotiations.infospace also consulted outside counsel and its outside auditor,deloitte touche,throughout the negotiations.
aol and infospace entered the agreement to combine aol membership with infospace directory assistance and resource library to jointly operate the aol white pages.aol would promote and distribute the aol white pages website to its members.in return,infospace would produce and manage the aol white pages on an ongoing basis.essentially,infospace created a product and aol attempted to sell that product to its members.infospace agreed to compensate aol in three ways by granting aol conditional warrants to purchase up to of infospace stock,making quarterly cash payments to aol,and sharing advertising revenue generated by the aol whitepages.
this compensation scheme employed the same kinds of incentives between product creator and seller as would a typical commission scheme.under the agreement,conditional warrants would vest quarterly with aol,but only if the aol white pages processed million searches the target number in that quarter.if aol failed to sell enough searches to reach the target number in any given quarter,the warrants would not vest and aol would forfeit them.the agreement also provided that infospace would make cash payments to aol each quarter the aol white pages achieved the target number.if aol did not sell enough searches to reach the target number,aol was required to refund to infospace the entire amount of the quarterly payment for such quarter paid in advance by infospace to aol,and aol would forever forfeit that quarter payment.the potential quarterly cash payments totaled million in year one,million in year two,million in year three,and million in year four.the parties also shared in advertising revenue generated by the aol whitepages in such a manner that aol had a strong incentive to drive as many members there as possible,so as to increase the website desirability to potential advertising partners.
the agreement further provided that aol would pay infospace a million penalty if aol failed to generate a total of four hundred million searches over the life of the agreement.further,if aol terminated the agreement prematurely,aol was required to pay infospace an additional and forfeit all cash payments.aol and infospace added this penalty provision late in the negotiations process,after jain learned from his accounting team that infospace could only expense the warrants at the infospace stock value before infospace initial public securities offering ipo if infospace received a performance commitment from aol.the necessity of obtaining a performance commitment from aol derived from deloitte touche advice regarding guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb.fasb standards,also known as generally accepted accounting principles gaap,are recognized as authoritative by the securities and exchange commission sec.see,united states ebbers,cir citing ganino citizens utilities,cir the sec treats the fasb standards as authoritative.
under the fasb standards in effect in,all transactions in which a provides goods or services in consideration for issuance of equity instruments shall be accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued,whichever is more reliably measurable.accounting for stock based compensation,statement of fin.accounting standards,fin.accounting standards bd hereinafter sfas.in order to accurately determine the fair value of the equity instruments issued in this case,the warrants,infospace could use either the date at which a commitment for performance by aol to earn the equity instruments is reached,or the date at which aol performance is complete meaning each day aol warrants vested.see accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring,or in conjunction with selling,goods or services,fasb emerging issues task force issue,at fin.accounting standards bd.a performance commitment is a commitment under which performance by aol to earn the equity instruments is probable because of sufficiently large disincentives for nonperformance.id.at.forfeiture of the warrants is not considered a sufficiently large disincentive when it is the sole remedy in the event of the aol nonperformance.id.deloitte touche therefore recommended that,in order to expense the warrants at the stock valuation,the agreement should include a nonperformance disincentive of a penalty calculated at approximately of the agreement value million.by agreeing to this provision,aol would have committed to performing for sfas purposes,and the warrants could be valued and expensed.
expensing was a critical deal component for infospace,because the stock was valued at per share.if required to value the warrants as aol completed each quarterly performance,infospace would have incurred nearly million in warrant expenses from.by valuing the warrants as of august,and expensing the charge over the life of the agreement,infospace only reported million in warrant expenses over that period.infospace therefore considered warrant expensing a dealbreaker,because this method of valuation would cost infospace more than the anticipated revenue from the aol deal.jain communicated deloitte touche performance commitment proposal to his negotiation partners at aol,who immediately rejected the idea of a penalty provision.at the time,the draft agreement contemplated a million payment per year from infospace to aol.jain proposed changing that payment structure to a structure much like the one aol and infospace settled upon in order to mitigate the effect of the penalty on aol.aol agreed to the proposal.
the agreement took effect on august.in late,jain and aol agreed in principle to suspend infospace obligations under the agreement.in early,jain learned that infospace would likely not meet analyst expectations for its second quarter earnings.in order to bulk up infospace balance sheet,jain sought to formalize the agreement to terminate infospace obligations to share revenue with aol,and recognize the transaction during the second quarter.accordingly,infospace prepared an amendment to the agreement amendment,which acknowledge d their agreement that infospace is not obligated to share revenue with aol until after the end of the third quarter.representatives from both companies signed amendment,but it was not dated.as a result of this amendment,jain informed his colleagues at infospace that he had secured over million in accrued expenses for aol that we should be able to use in.aol reasons for agreeing to amendment are unclear when asked about its purpose at trial,aol signatory to amendment,eric keller,invoked the fifth amendment and refused to answer.
jain sold more than three million infospace shares in.aol warrants began vesting quarterly under the agreement in february,and aol did not make any infospace stock transactions in.jain sold over million shares of infospace stock on january.jain sold another million shares of infospace between may,and june.
two aol executives,lennert leader and ronald peele,determined aol investment strategy with regard to infospace stock.neither leader nor peele knew of any agreement made by aol to buy or sell stock in concert with jain both testified that they based aol investment decisions on market and financial considerations.aol executed its first infospace stock transaction on february,when it entered into a cashless collar transaction with goldman sachs.aol and goldman sachs entered into three more cashless collar transactions one on february,and two on may.upon peele approval,aol exercised tranches of its infospace warrants on march.aol sold shares of infospace stock on march.peele approved an exercise of tranche of aol infospace warrants on september.aol did not sell any additional infospace stock in.
after infospace stock price plummeted,disgruntled shareholders sued jain and infospace for securities fraud,in an attempt to recover their losses.see,in re infospace,d.
dreiling filed many actions against various parties associated with infospace,dreiling jain,et,case no.dreiling jain,et,case king county washington superior court dreiling american express company,no.on august,dreiling sued aol for recovery of profits under section b of the exchange act.dreiling complaint against aol alleges that aol and jain sought i to secretly influence the corporate affairs of infospace by creating artificial revenues and earnings ii to hold their shares during the creation of artificial revenues and earnings and iii to then sell their shares to unsuspecting investors at prices artificially inflated as a result of their concerted efforts.
the district court granted aol motion for summary judgment.for purposes of the motion,the district court assumed that aol assisted jain in accounting manipulation designed to inflate infospace earnings,but held that dreiling had not adduced any evidence to suggest that aol was subject to profits rules.accordingly,the court concluded that it must grant aol motion for summary judgment.we review the district court decision de novo,assessing whether,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,there are genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law.see,universal health,thompson,cir.
ii.discussion 
congress enacted section b as part of the exchange act to prevent corporate insiders from exploiting their access to information not generally available to others.dreiling am.exp,cir quoting kern county land occidental petroleum,d.section b prescribes that insiders must disgorge profits that derive from sales 
for the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by such beneficial owner,director,or officer by reason of his relationship to the issuer,any profit realized by him from any purchase and sale of any equity security of such issuer within any period of less than six months shall be recoverable by the issuer,irrespective of any intention on the part of such beneficial owner,director,or officer in entering into such transaction of holding the security.
congress decided upon disgorgement as a deterrence measure because it recognized that short swing speculation by stockholders with advance,inside information would threaten the goal of the securities exchange act to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets,dreiling,at quoting kern county,at.section b therefore addresses a class of transactions in which the possibility of abuse was believed to be intolerably great,dreiling,at quoting kern county,at.internal quotation marks omitted,by impos ing a strict prophylactic rule with respect to insider,trading,dreiling,at quoting,provident sec,d.
section b identifies three classes of insiders whose profits on trades are subject to disgorgement directors,officers,and beneficial owners of more than of any class of any equity security registered under securities law.dreiling,at a.section b is blunt and unforgiving.see id.citing citadel holding roven,cir section b is a relatively arbitrary,flat rule.it imposes strict liability on insiders,regardless of motive,and disgorges profits from all tradeseven those not actually based on inside information.dreiling,at kern,at.noting that section b requires disgorgement of profits without proof of actual abuse of insider information,and without proof of intent to profit on the basis of such information.the supreme court has therefore narrowly construed section b reach.see,gollust mendell,d expressing the supreme court reluctan ce to exceed a literal,mechanical application.
aol was neither an infospace director nor officer.it therefore may only be required to disgorge its trading profits if it is an insider by virtue of being a beneficial owner of more than of infospace shares.
the exchange act does not define what makes a person a beneficial owner as the term is used in section b.accordingly,the courts developed a body of law to determine whether a person making trades is an insider for section b purposes.see morales quintel entm t,cir citing mayer chesapeake ins,cir reviewing cases.in,however,the sec substantially altered this body of case law by promulgating rule.see ownership reports and trading by officers,directors and principal security holders,exchange act release,public utility holding company act release,investment company act release.rule established that,for purposes of determining insider status as a securities holder,the term beneficial owner shall mean any person who is deemed a beneficial owner pursuant to section d of the exchange act and the rules thereunder.morales,at citing a.
congress enacted section d as part of the williams act of,passed in response to hostile corporate takeovers in the.see id.at act of july,stat.section d was designed to alert the marketplace to every large,rapid aggregation or accumulation of securities,regardless of technique employed,which might represent a potential shift in corporate control.morales,at citing gaf milstein,cir sec savoy.to that end,section d encompasses not only the isolated shareholder who accumulates shares of a corporation common stock,but also a group of shareholders who undertake the same activity as part of a collective effort.morales,at.subsection d states further that w hen two or more persons act as a group for the purpose of acquiring,holding,or disposing of securities of an issuer,such group shall be deemed a person for the purposes of this subsection.d.congress appears to have enacted these rules to prevent insiders from attempting to evade the disclosure requirement by pooling their interests 
this provision would prevent a group of persons who seek to pool their voting or other interests in the securities of an issuer from evading the provisions of the statute because no one individual owns more than percent of a class of securities at the time they agreed to act in concert this provision is designed to obtain full disclosure of the identity of any person or group obtaining the benefits of ownership by reason of any contract,understanding,relationship,agreement or other arrangement.

the sec promulgated rule to implement and clarify section d.rule defines beneficial ownership by a group as follows 
when two or more persons agree to act together for the purpose of acquiring,holding,voting or disposing of equity securities of an issuer,the group formed thereby shall be deemed to have acquired beneficial owner
