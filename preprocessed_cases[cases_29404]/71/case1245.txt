in,nyse arca,one of the largest securities exchanges in the united states,proposed to begin charging a fee to investors for access to its proprietary product,arcabook.arcabook lists pending orders placed on nyse,bids to buy at prices lower than,and offers to sell at prices higher than,the prevailing market price.the securities and exchange commission sec or commission approved nyse arca proposal,finding the proposed fees for arcabook were fair and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory.petitioners netcoalition,a public policy corporation representing approximately internet companies including google and,and the securities industry and financial markets association sifma,a trade association representing more than securities firms and banks,challenge the sec order,arguing that it violates the securities exchange act of,et exchange act,and the administrative procedure act,et apa.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the sec did not adequately explain the basis of its approval nor,on this record,support its conclusion with substantial evidence and,accordingly,we remand to the sec.
background 
the exchange act provides the framework by which the sec regulates the transactions and the classes of participants in the major securities markets in the united states.see bradford clearing sec.nyse arca is registered with the sec as a national securities exchange,see,and as such is a securities industry organization,or sro,see id.a defining organization.although,nyse arca remains subject to comprehensive sec oversight and control.see karsner lothian,citing b.for example,an exchange is required to file its governing rules with the sec and comply with them.see a b.an exchange rules must,among other things,provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues,fees,and other charges among its members and issuers and other persons using its facilities,id.b promote just and equitable principles of trade and not permit unfair discrimination between customers,issuers,brokers,or dealers,id.b and not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the exchange act,id.b.as an sro,an exchange must also file any proposed rule change including a fee change with the sec for approval.see id.b.the sec notices a rule change proposal for public comment and either approves it if it is consistent with the requirements of the exchange act or disapproves it.see id.the sec has delegated the initial consideration of a rule change to its division of trading and markets which until was known as the division of market regulation.see a.
in,the congress expanded the authority of the sec through a major overhaul of the exchange act.see bradford,at.among other things,the amendment directed the sec to facilitate the establishment of a national market system for securities,or nms,to link securities markets in order to distribute market data economically and equally and to promote fair competition among all market participants.id.at citing see regulation nms,release.june.the congress specified five factors to guide the sec in establishing the nms the commission is to assure efficiency,fair competition,availability of market data,practicability of order execution in the best market and the opportunity for an investor order to be executed directly,that is,without the participation of a dealer.a c.under sec oversight during the next three decades,the nms grew to encompass the securities of over companies with a collective market capitalization of more than trillion.today nms stocks are traded simultaneously on one or more of the nine national exchanges that participate in the system,including the new york stock exchange,the nasdaq stock market nasdaq and nyse arca,as well as at trading sites like alternative trading systems electronic communication networks ecns,including the bats exchange bats ecn and securities dealers.
because nms stocks are traded so many places at once,one of the important innovations of the nms system is to make available to investors a stream of core market data consolidated from all of the exchanges.regulation nms.at consolidated data stream form s the heart of the national market system quoting,at,as reprinted in,conference report.core data for each nms security consists of three things last sale reports,which include the price at which the latest sale of the security occurred,the size of the sale and the exchange where it took place the current highest bid and lowest offer for the security,along with the number of shares available at those prices,at each exchange and the national best bid and offer,or nbbo,which are the highest bid and lowest offer currently available in the country and the exchange s where those prices are available.
to ensure that an investor can obtain core data for each nms security,the sec requires each exchange,including nyse arca,to report last sales,the price and size of the most recent trade on nyse arca and the current best bid and offer to one of several central data processors for consolidation.see.each central data processor then disseminates the consolidated information,including the nbbo,to and data vendors.see id.a b.the sec must approve the fees charged for core data,see b,and a is required to purchase the consolidated core data and make it available to an investor seeking to place a trade see id.c.in this way,today core market data system 
provides investors in the equity markets with access to the best quotations and most recent trades in the thousands of nms stocks throughout the trading day.for each stock,quotations and trades are continuously collected from many different trading centers and then disseminated to the public in a consolidated stream of data.as a result,investors of all types have access to a reliable source of information for the best prices in nms stocks.
regulation nms.at.
all other market data is data this case involves data referred to as data.data consists of outstanding limit to buy stock at prices lower than,or to sell stocks at prices higher than,the best prices on each exchange because data is data,the sec does not require that it be included in the consolidated data stream or made available to an investor at the time of trade execution 
data matters because of a concept called depth,which refers to the number of shares of a security available to trade at any given price point.if a trader wants to buy a certain number of shares that exceeds the depth volume of shares available at the best price,data will tell him the number of shares available at prices inferior to the best price in this way,data allows a trader to gain background information about the liquidity of a security on a particular exchange,the degree to which his total sale or purchase price will differ from what he would receive if the entire trade were made at the prevailing best prices.for instance,even a very large buy order for a security with high liquidity on a certain exchange will trade at or close to the best price while a similarly large order for a security with lower liquidity on that exchange will cost more in toto due to the fewer number of shares available at or near the best price.
a simplified example may help illustrate the concept of liquidity and the utility of data.assume an investor wants to make an offer to sell shares of company xyz.the best bid price reflected in the core data at nyse arca for xyz is shares at.the investor knows he can sell up to shares at but he does not know at what price his remaining shares will sell until after his order is placed.this is where data comes in.assume further that nyse arca data tells the investor that,apart from the best bid price from the core data,an additional shares of xyz are available at the next price level of and yet another shares at.before he places his order,then,he knows that his sale will fetch the sum of shares sold in three blocks at,or each.lower,fewer shares of xyz available at or near result in a lower total sale price.it is in this sense that data is useful primarily as background information on liquidity outside the best prices.see order setting aside action by delegated authority and approving proposed rule change relating to nyse arca data,release,order 
in may nyse arca filed a proposed rule change with the sec pursuant to sec rule.nyse arca proposed to charge a fee for its data which data it had formerly made available at no cost in particular,arcabook,a compilation of all limit orders resident in the nyse arca limit order book.nyse arca application at.it proposed to charge a a monthly fee for access to the arcabook data feed.it also proposed to charge an additional user fee of up to for a professional subscriber and up to for a subscriber per device displaying the arcabook data finally,it proposed to cap the monthly fee charged to a at for with an escalation provision for future years.
as noted earlier,nyse arca is required to show that a rule change is consistent with the exchange it provides for,among other things,an equitable allocation of reasonable fees among users and does not unnecessarily burden competition.see.b.nyse arca is also an exclusive processor of securities information under the exchange act because it distributes on its own behalf information regarding its quotations and transactions.see order.at a b defining exclusive processor.this means that its distribution of market data also has to be done on fair and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory terms.id.c c d see a same.
nyse arca sought to establish that its arcabook fees conform to exchange act and regulatory requirements in two ways.first,it believe d that the proposed market data fees would reflect an equitable allocation of its overall costs to users of its facilities.see nyse arca application at.second,it suggested that its fees are fair and reasonable because they compare favorably to fees that other markets charge for similar products.id.at.on the latter point,nyse arca noted that at that time the nyse charged professional subscribers for monthly access to its product,openbook,while nasdaq charged up to for combined monthly access to its two products,totalview and openview which provide data related to nyse and american stock securities,respectively.see id.
the sec published the proposal for public comment in the federal register on june.the sec,through delegated authority at that time,its division of market regulation,approved the proposal on october.netcoalition petitioned the sec for review of that order one month later.the sec granted review on december,and invited parties or persons to file statements supporting or opposing the october order.after receiving comments,the sec published a notice of a proposed draft order on june,after which it received sixteen additional comments.
although the sec set aside the october order it approved the proposal in its own order dated december,and published in the federal register seven days later.see order.briefly,the order evaluates the nyse arca proposal under a approach.that approach has two parts.the sec first asks whether the exchange was subject to significant competitive forces in setting the terms of its proposal for data,including the level of any fees.order.at.if so,the sec approves the proposal unless it determines that there is a substantial countervailing basis to find that the terms violate the exchange act or sec rules.id.if not,the exchange must provide a substantial basis,other than competitive forces,in its proposed rule change demonstrating that the terms of the proposal are equitable,fair,reasonable,and not unreasonably discriminatory.id.the sec approved nyse arca fees for arcabook data on the grounds that nyse arca is subject to a t least two broad types of significant competitive forces,id.at,and there is no countervailing basis under the exchange act to disapprove the proposal,see id.at.petitioners netcoalition and sifma both timely petitioned for review on january,and we subsequently consolidated the petitions for review.see order granting resp t mot.to consolidate,d.nyse arca and nasdaq intervened in support of the sec.

the petitioners challenge the order on three grounds first,the sec violated the exchange act by failing to engage in ratemaking second,the sec arbitrarily rejected its earlier approach to determine whether market data fees are fair and reasonable and third,the sec conclusion that nyse arca was subject to significant competitive forces that constrained its ability to set fees for market data is not supported by substantial evidence.
sec approach does not contravene exchange act 
the petitioners assert,first,that the sec approach to evaluating the fairness and reasonableness of nyse arca arcabook fees conflicts with the exchange act.as noted earlier,the congress has expressly delegated to the commission the power to determine,after notice and comment,whether a proposed rule change is consistent with the exchange act.b see supra at.accordingly,we review the agency interpretation of the exchange act under the familiar analysis set forth in chevron,natural res.def.council.see fin.planning ass sec,united states mead,chevron deference appropriate when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.
chevron step one applies if the congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue because that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,we proceed to step two,at which step we accept the agency interpretation of the statute as long as it is reasonable.id.at.we bear in mind that i t is irrelevant that this court might have reached a than the sec.am.equity inv.life ins.sec,wl,at.july,citing cable telecomm.ass brand x internet.in considering the permissibility of an agency construction of a statute,we determine not only whether the agency interpretation is reasonable but also whether the agency has acted within its authority under the statute.see goldstein sec,as always,the words of the statute should be read in context,the statute place in the overall statutory scheme should be considered,and the problem congress sought to solve should be taken into account to determine whether congress has foreclosed the agency interpretation.quoting pdk labs.dea,see also am.bar ass ftc,rejecting agency suggestion that chevron step two is implicated any time a statute does not expressly negate the existence of a claimed administrative power.finally,a statute general declaration of policy does not protect agency action that is otherwise inconsistent with the congressional delegation of authority for a gencies are bound,not only by the ultimate purposes congress has selected,but by the means it has deemed appropriate,and prescribed,for the pursuit of those purposes.river indian tribes indian gaming comm n,quoting mci telecomms.v.at t.
under the exchange act,the sec has a duty to ensure that nyse arca proposed fees for market data are,among other things,fair and reasonable.c c fees must be fair and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory see a same f b exchange must also provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues,fees,and other charges among persons using its facilities.the petitioners believe that the sec approach is prohibited under the exchange act because the congress intended fair and reasonable to be determined using a approach.the sec counters that,because it has flexibility in evaluating market data fees,its approach is fully consistent with the exchange act.
we agree with the sec.none of the statutory language answers the precise question whether the sec is required to evaluate data fees under a approach chevron,at.because the congress delegated authority to the commission to determine whether an sro rule change is consistent with the exchange act and because the statute is silent as to whether a approach is consistent with the same,under chevron step two we uphold the sec action if it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at see,dep t of,chevron deference comes into play only as a consequence of statutory ambiguity,and then only if the reviewing court finds an implicit delegation of authority to the agency michigan epa,mere ambiguity in a statute is not evidence of congressional delegation of authority.
the petitioners rely on portions of the legislative history suggesting the commission was supposed to assume a special oversight and regulatory role over exclusive processors by treating them as public utilities,a role inconsistent with allowing market forces to determine market data prices,at,as reprinted in,senate report see id.at,at any exclusive processor is,in effect,a public utility,and thus it must function in a manner which is absolutely neutral conference report at,at w here a organization or organizations utilize an exclusive processor,that processor takes on certain of the characteristics of a public utility and should be regulated accordingly.these statements,however,refer to an exclusive central processor for the composite,consolidated core data tape or any other element of the national market system,not to an exchange acting as the processor of its proprietary data.senate report at,at emphases added see also conference report at,at.in fact,the legislative history indicates that the congress intended that the market system evolve through the interplay of competitive forces as unnecessary regulatory restrictions are removed and that the sec wield its regulatory power in those situations where competition may not be sufficient,such as in the creation of a consolidated transactional reporting system.conference report at,at see senate report at,u.at i n situations in which natural competitive forces can not,for whatever reason,be relied upon,the sec must assume a special oversight and regulatory role.this reading is consistent with the notion that the congress did not intend to take away the sec authority to rely,at least in some circumstances,on the market.see id.a fundamental premise of the bill is that the initiative for the development of the facilities of a national market system must come from private interests and will depend upon the vigor of competition within the securities industry as broadly defined.
moreover,while competition is only one of five objectives included in the amendment,a c,the sec approach does not impermissibly elevate competition above the other objectives.in its order,the sec responded to the congressional desire that it rely on competition,whenever possible,in meeting its regulatory responsibilities for overseeing the sros and the national market system.at see id.at congress intended that competitive forces should dictate the services and practices that constitute the national market system for trading equity securities.accordingly,the sec took a more traditional regulatory approach,id.at,to core data where competition may not be sufficient,conference report at,u.at and a approach,with a greater reliance on competition,to data,see order.at sec prefers consolidation for core data but deconsolidation for data to allow greater flexibility for market forces to determine data products and fees.we conclude the sec a approach to evaluating whether nyse arca data fees are fair and reasonable is a permissible one 
sec did not arbitrarily reject prior approach to calculating market data fees 
the petitioners next contend that,in approving nyse arca proposed fees,the sec arbitrarily rejected its prior approach.under apa review,an agency may not depart from a prior policy sub silentio or simply disregard rules that are still on the books.fcc fox television stations.an agency acts arbitrarily by fail ing adequately to justify departing from its own prior interpretation of a statute.goldstein sec.
the petitioners cite two examples of the approach from which the sec allegedly departed without explanation but neither of which is distinguished in the the petitioners characterization.they first cite several statements contained in a sec market information concept release proposing changes to,among other things,the sec of market data fees.see regulation of market information fees and revenues,release.the concept release noted that the fees charged by a monopolistic provider of a service such as the exclusive processors of market information need to be tied to some type of standard in order to preclude excessive profits if fees are too high or underfunding or subsidization if fees are too low and therefore the total amount of market information revenues should remain reasonably related to the cost of market information.id.at.but this statement and the concept release in general addressed market data fees charged by a central exclusive processor of consolidated core data.see.at discussing dissemination of consolidated market information pursuant to plans that govern all aspects of the arrangements for disseminating market information,including fees that can be charged emphasis in original.the sec did not intend by this statement to require that fees for an exchange proprietary data must also be.while costs are o ne standard commonly used to evaluate the fairness and reasonableness of fees,particularly those of a monopolistic provider of a service,the congress did not require the commission to undertake a strictly or ratemaking approach to its review of market information fees in every case.at see id.such an inflexible standard,although unavoidable in some contexts,can entail severe practical difficulties.footnote omitted.instead,as the sec recognized,the congress gave it flexibility in evaluating fair and reasonable market data fees id.
the petitioners second example is no more persuasive.in,the sec stated that an exclusive processor fees should be based strictly on the expenses it incurs in providing the information to vendors.order announcing commission findings,modifying interim relief,and instituting proceedings,release,instinet order.the issue arose when the sec rejected a proposed fee to access market information because the sro that proposed the fee was not only charging market data vendors like instinet but was also directly competing with the vendors by providing enhanced information products to its own direct subscribers.concept release.at.the sec emphasized that the approach was used due to the particular facts of the present case.instinet order.at see order.citing concept release.at the commission repeatedly emphasized that the scope of its decision was limited to the particular competitive situation presented in the proceedings.nor is the sec interpretation of the instinet order a novel one,given that it had already distinguished the order on its peculiar competitive context in the market information concept release.at.
in any event,more recent examples illustrate that the sec approach is not an unexplained shift from its earlier pronouncements.in,the sec advisory committee on market information made clear that the extent and manner of dissemination of deeper market information can be determined by market,by the business decisions of individual market than by regulation.report of the advisory committee on market information a blueprint for responsible change,h ttp,last visited july,advisory committee report.likewise,the sec itself intended in regulation nms that market forces,rather than regulatory requirements play a role in determining the market data other than the nbbo to be made available to investors and at what cost.at.in fact,in the sec approved nasdaq proposed fees for its own product without analyzing costs.see order approving proposed rule change,release,wl.we conclude that the sec approach does not arbitrarily depart from prior practice.
sec failed to show that nyse arca is subject to significant competitive forces in pricing arcabook 
although we uphold the sec approach against the petitioners challenges,we do not mean to say that a cost analysis is irrelevant.on the contrary,in a competitive market,the price of a product is supposed to approach its marginal cost,the seller cost of producing one additional unit.see tejas power,at in a competitive market,where neither buyer nor seller has significant market power,it is rational to infer that price is close to marginal cost,such that the seller makes only a normal return on its investment.supracompetitive pricing may be evidence of monopoly,or market,power.see united states microsoft,where evidence indicates that a firm has in fact profitably raised prices substantially above the competitive level,the existence of monopoly power is clear.thus,the costs of collecting and distributing market data can indicate whether an exchange is taking excessive profits or subsidizing its service with another source of revenue,as the sec has recognized.concept release.at standard preclude s excessive profits if fees are too high or underfunding or subsidization if fees are too low mci telecomms.fcc.cir a basic principle used to ensure that rates are just and reasonable is that rates are determined on the basis of cost.footnote omitted.even nyse arca proposal acknowledges that costs are relevant in assessing the reasonableness of its fees.see nyse arca application at nyse arca believes that the proposed market data fees would reflect an equitable allocation of its overall costs to users of its facilities.see also comment letter of mary yeager,corporate secretary,nyse arca,at,in setting fee levels nyse arca considered the contribution that revenues accruing from arca book fees would make toward meeting the overall costs of nyse arca operations and noted market data revenues compare favorably to the markets cost of producing the data.
moreover,the risk that nyse arca could exercise market power appears to be elevated in the pricing of its proprietary data.there is no dispute that nyse arca is the exclusive provider of this data.while many exchanges sell google stock,only nyse arca offers access to the google limit orders included in its product,arcabook.as of june,nyse arca was one of the largest exchanges in the nation in terms of shares traded.see order.at tbl.arca had share of volume in equities among national exchanges.although the sec is correct that m any businesses are the exclusive sources of their own products without also having market power,id.at,as recently as the sec was concerned that an sro with a significant share of trading in nms stocks could exercise market power in setting fees for its data,including data beyond the nbbo.regulation nms.at.the order thus recognized that if an exchange could,in fact,exert monopoly power over its pricing of data,it obviously would be inappropriate for the commission to rely on competitive forces as a basis for approving an exchange proposal.at.
the sec concluded,however,that nyse arca could not exercise market pricing power as to arcabook.but the commission did not require nyse arca to substantiate its market data at the time of nyse arca fee application,not before the sec published the draft proposal and not before the order issued.instead,the commission noted more than once the difficulty of cost calculation in determining whether a fee is fair and reasonable,often by referring to earlier orders.see,order.approach entails whole host of difficulties in calculating the direct costs and common costs of market endeavor that the commission discussed at length in and will not repeat here id.regulatory approach would be extraordinarily intrusive on competitive forces,as well as quite costly and difficult to apply in practice.at one point the sec seemed to suggest that it might allow nyse arca fees to be set by competition simply because of the difficulty of.see id.faced with the pragmatic challenge of determining whether market data fees are fair and reasonable,sec strongly believes that the current level of competition in the equity markets provides a much more useful basis to make this determination than a regulatory attempt to measure market data costs.
the petitioners maintain that the sec failure to consider nyse arca costs make its determination that nyse arca is subject to significant competitive forces arbitrary and capricious because is in fact not difficult.the apa establishes a scheme of reasoned decisionmaking.not only must an agency decreed result be within the scope of its lawful authority,but the process by which it reaches that result must be logical and rational.allentown mack sales service,nlrb,u,quoting state farm,at see also united techs.dep t of,agency failed to provide reasoned basis for conclusion because a naked conclusion is not enough.while we have long held that agency determinations based upon highly complex and technical matters are entitled to great deference,domestic,sec,internal quotation omitted,we do not defer to the agency conclusory or unsupported suppositions.mcdonnell douglas dep t of the air force.in addition,an agency may not shirk a statutory responsibility simply because it may be difficult.see chamber of commerce of sec,difficulty in formulating cost estimate does not relieve sec of statutory obligation to determine as best it can the economic implications of the rule it has proposed because even in face of uncertainty,agency must exercise its expertise to make tough choices and to hazard a guess as to which is correct,even if the estimate will be imprecise internal quotation and citation omitted.
but the sec did not approve nyse arca proposed fees based primarily on difficulties in calculating the direct costs and common costs of market data.order.at.it did so instead based on its determination that consideration of costs was unnecessary because of an alternative indicator of competitiveness nyse arca is subject,the sec said,to a t least two broad types of significant competitive forces in pricing,its compelling need to attract order flow from market participants and the availability to market participants of alternatives to purchasing the arcabook data.id.at.that determination fails the apa reasoned decisionmaking standard for another reason advanced by the petitioners,as we now explain.
order flow competition 
we begin with the points on which the sec and the petitioners agree.no one disputes that competition for order flow is fierce.order.at attracting order flow is the core competitive concern of any equity is the without which,not of an exchange competitive success.as the sec explained,i n the national market system,buyers and sellers of securities,and the that act as their agents,have a wide range of choices of where to route orders for execution no exchange can afford to take its market share percentages for granted because no exchange possesses a monopoly,regulatory or otherwise,in the execution of order flow from broker dealers and therefore nyse arca must compete vigorously for order flow to maintain its share of trading volume.id.at.the parties also agree that there is a connection between order flow and market data,that a n exchange ability to attract order flow determines whether it has market data to distribute.id.at.
the dispute centers on whether the connection works both ways not only that increased order flow makes market data more valuable but that more modestly priced market data drives increased order flow.the sec concluded that it does an exchange distribution of market data significantly affects its ability to attract order flow.id.the wide distribution of order data to many market participants is an important factor in attracting orders.id.at wide dissemination of market data is important tool to attract order flow.the sec contends that order flow competition constrains nyse arca pricing of its data for two reasons.first,the wide dissemination of arcabook will attract interest in the prices listed therein of those traders who wish to buy or sell more shares than the number of shares shown in the core data.see id.at the extent to which a displayed limit order attracts interest will depend greatly on the wide distribution of the displayed order to many market participants.second,because many traders who buy data from nyse arca also select on which exchanges to particular,the large firms that control the handling of a large volume of customer and proprietary order flow nyse arca can risk its order flow share by overpricing market data.id.given the portability of order flow from one trading venue to another,any exchange that sought to charge unreasonably high data fees would risk alienating many of the same customers on whose orders it depends for competitive survival.for these reasons,the sec concluded,nyse arca proposal can not reasonably be interpreted as that of a monopolist able to take advantage of its market power over a small group of professionals who value the data highly,but rather that of an exchange facing significant competitive pressures in attempting to sell its data to a large number of professionals.id.at.
the conclusion is not objectionable in theory.the problem is that is it at odds with the sec repeated statements throughout the order and in its briefs that data is simply not very important to most traders,even professionals.see.at rejecting the notion that an exchange data is so critically important that the exchange is not significantly constrained by competitive forces in pricing that data.this data,it appears,is useful primarily as background information on liquidity outside the best prices because more than of the time,traders do not access the liquidity displayed in an exchange order data,even for large orders.id.at of nyse arca may executed share volume of marketable orders were at prices equal to or better than the nbbo for orders ranging from shares to.according to the commission,data is most accurately characterized as useful,but not essential,for professional traders.see resp t br.the availability of core data makes resort to unnecessary for most investors id.at the limited appeal of data is reflected by the fact that of the professional users who purchase core data in stocks,only professional users purchase nasdaq data product.see also intervenors br.use of data is uncommon even among professional investors.but if the sec is correct that data is unnecessary and of limited appeal to most investors,it is not clear why wide distribution of the data to many market participants is critical in attracting order flow.order.at.if anything,the sec order seems to suggest that the tail is wagging the order flow without a consistent explanation of how or why this is so.
this is not to say that wide dissemination of market data can not increase order flow but rather that it is not necessarily so more problematic is the lack of support in the record for the sec conclusion that order flow competition constrains market data prices.granted,the record includes statements from nyse arca and other exchanges to support the conclusion,order.at nyse arca,in setting the fee,acknowledged that it needed to balance its desire for market data revenues with the potential damage that a high fee would do to its ability to attract order flow.the views of the regulated entities,however,provide little support to establish that significant competitive forces affect their pricing decisions.nor does the remaining evidence provide substantial support.for example,the sec quoted the advisory committee report statement that a market inability to widely disseminate its prices undoubtedly will adversely impact its ability to attract limit orders and,ultimately,all order flow.id.at quoting advisory committee report.but this was a conclusion,not evidence.moreover,it was made in the context of whether basic market information should continue to be required to be provided in a consolidated format to market participants,see advisory committee report supporting the unremarkable proposition that failure to disseminate core data could adversely affect order flow 
the sec also cited two anecdotes to support its determination that competition for order flow constrains market data fees.the sec first described how island ecn ceased displaying its order book to the public in three very active funds in order to avoid certain regulatory promptly lost fifty per cent of its substantial market share in the three funds.order.at.the sec also cited the fact that bats ecn and international stock exchange ise provided their data to customers free of charge,ostensibly as a way to generate order flow.together,these examples show that market data is apparently important enough to at least some traders that it must be made available they say nothing about whether an exchange like nyse arca is constrained to price its data competitively 
alternatives to data 
the sec also asserts that an exchange must consider the extent to which institutional and other sophisticated traders would choose one or more alternatives instead of purchasing the exchange data.order.at.according to the sec,given the other sources and potential sources of market data available to sophisticated,core data,data from other exchanges,pinging orders and the threat of independent distribution of data by data vendors or securities firms acting in arca must price arcabook reasonably or it will lose these subscribers.id.at see id.at.
but the existence of a substitute does not necessarily preclude market power.see phillip areeda,herbert hovenkamp john solow,antitrust law a ed.areeda see also.pub.serv.united states.cir t he mere existence of some alternative does not in itself constrain the railroads from charging rates far in excess of the just and reasonable rates that congress thought the existence of competitive pressures would ensure.rather,whether a market is competitive notwithstanding potential alternatives depends on factors such as the number of buyers who consider other products interchangeable and at what prices.see areeda.we evaluate market competitiveness in antitrust cases,for example,by asking whether there exists a reasonably interchangeable substitute in the same market,which depends not only on the ease and speed with which customers can substitute it and the desirability of doing so,but also on the cost of substitution,which depends most sensitively on the price of the products.ftc whole foods,en banc citing united states microsoft,per curiam see id.at describing small but significant increase in price,or ssnip,technique developed by the department of justice and federal trade commission to analyze reasonable substitutability.the inquiry into whether a market for a product is competitive,therefore,focuses on the customer and,in particular,his price economic terms,the product elasticity of demand.areeda elasticity here refers to the rate at which customers will turn away from the firm product in response to a price increase or toward it in response to a price decrease.see order.at the availability of such alternatives increases the elasticity of demand for an exchange data.
the sec analysis of alternatives does not reveal the number of potential users of the data or how they might react to a change in price.we do not know,for example,how many traders accessed nyse arca data during the period it was offered without thus how many traders might be interested in paying for arcabook.see arg.tr.sec w e do have numbers.nor do we know whether the traders who want data would decline to purchase it if met with a supracompetitive price.the order does provide some idea of how many traders buy data albeit on a different exchange of professional traders who subscribed to nasdaq core data product as of april,only less than purchased its product see order.at t hat of the professional users of core data choose not to purchase the order data of a major exchange strongly suggests that no exchange has monopoly pricing power for its order data.but the fact that there are few
