livid holdings,livid appeals the district court dismissal with prejudice of its complaint against the corporate successors to schroders,collectively referred to as schroders or defendants under federal rule of civil procedure b.livid complaint alleges that defendants violated b of the securities exchange act of act,b,and rule,promulgated thereunder the washington securities act wsa.and washington tort law.we hold that the district court erred in dismissing livid complaint.
facts and proceedings below 
livid claims arise out of its december purchase of million worth of shares in purely cotton,pci stock.in january,schroders helped pci arrange a private placement of million worth of its stock.for this purpose,schroders created a confidential offering memorandum the memorandum,which outlined pci operations,business plan,and financial position.after the distribution of the memorandum to potential investors,livid alleges that uae,a company,agreed to purchase over of the offering.the individual defendants,who were directors officers of schroders,agreed to purchase the remaining stock.livid alleges that there was never a contractual document requiring uae to pay more than million of the million purchase price.in addition,livid also alleges that the defendants purchase of pci stock was dependent on the occurrence of future events and that the defendants knew that uae was not contractually bound to purchase its share of the pci stock.
in september,pci asked schroders for additional copies of the memorandum in order to solicit additional investors.livid alleges that before providing pci with these extra copies,defendant van der vord,the managing director at schroders in charge of the offering,and his team amended the memorandum by attaching the following notice 
this memorandum was written in january and represents the original offering memorandum distributed to potential investors in the company million private equity fund raising.subsequent to the writing and distribution of this document the company may have undergone various changes including but not limited to management changes,ownership changes and business strategy changes.this document has not been updated or amended to reflect any events that have occurred since january.as such,it does not reflect the fact that the million private equity fund raising has been completed.
emphasis added.
livid claims against defendants arise out of the last sentence of this notice.this sentence,livid contends,implies that the proceeds of the initial million sale had been received by pci,but that the memorandum had not yet been updated to reflect this additional capital.at the time this notice was written,however,uae and the defendants had actually paid less than million to pci.livid alleges that additional payments on uae balance were conditional on uae approval of a pci business plan and a new chief executive that uae was not actually bound to pay for the pci stock.from the pleadings,it is not clear whether the defendants bought preferred shares of pci stock,as uae did,or whether they bought common shares of the stock.even assuming arguendo that the defendants bought common shares,this difference is of no import.livid alleges that each of the defendants bought stock on the same conditional terms as uae,and therefore knew that the sale was incomplete when the notice was attached to the memorandum for the express purpose of attracting additional investors.in addition,livid alleges that defendants had a motive to deceive potential investors because pci had not yet paid schroders for the services it provided in connection with the first campaign.in essence,livid contends that defendants had a motive to try to bring additional capital into increase the likelihood that it would be paid for past services rendered.
the district court dismissed each of livid claims with prejudice.with respect to the federal claim,the district court found that livid failed to plead adequately that the notice statement was a material misrepresentation,upon which it reasonably relied in purchasing pci stock.in addition,the district court found that livid complaint did not satisfy the heightened pleading standards for scienter under the private securities litigation reform act pslra.the district court dismissed livid state securities claim because it found the alleged misrepresentation immaterial,and that defendants were not sellers of securities within the meaning of the wsa.because the district court found that livid reliance on the representations in the notice was unreasonable,the court also dismissed the state tort claims.finally,the district court refused to grant livid leave to amend its complaint,concluding that any such attempt would be futile.

claims brought under rule must meet the particularity requirement of federal rule of civil procedure b,which requires that i n all averments of fraud or mistake,the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.b.the pslra raised the pleading standards for rule claims by requiring that plaintiffs plead scienter by stat ing with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b.
material misrepresentations or omissions 
for the purposes of a claim,a misrepresentation or omission is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would have acted differently if the misrepresentation had not been made or the truth had been disclosed.basic levinson,d.we conclude that livid has sufficiently pled materiality by raising a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would not have purchased million worth of pci stock after learning that the company had million less in cash than it was led to believe.if this misrepresentation had not been made,livid would likely have believed that pci financial status was closer to the negative net worth of reported in the memorandum,rather than million predicted to result from the stock offering this misrepresentation radically altered the picture of pci overall economic health and viability presented to livid by the memorandum and its accompanying notice.thus,livid successfully pled the materiality of defendants misrepresentation regarding pci capital.
the district court,however,found that the notice defendants attached to the memorandum contained cautionary language rendering any statement made in the n otice legally immaterial.in making this finding,the district court relied on the bespeaks caution doctrine,which provides a mechanism by which a court can rule as a matter of law that defendants representations contained enough cautionary language or risk disclosure to protect the defendant against claims of securities fraud.in re stac elecs.sec,cir quoting fecht v.the price,cir.we have applied the bespeaks caution doctrine in situations where optimistic projections coupled with cautionary language affect the reasonableness of reliance on and the materiality of those projections.in re worlds of wonder sec,cir.
dismissal on the pleadings under the bespeaks caution doctrine,however,requires a stringent showing there must be sufficient cautionary language or risk disclosure such that reasonable minds could not disagree that the challenged statements were not misleading.in re stac,at quoting fecht,at.we can not agree that the only reasonable interpretation of the contested sentence is that it warned potential investors that pci may not have received all of the capital from the million stock sale.instead,the most obvious interpretation of this sentence is that this cash had already been received,but that this fact and the resulting cash increase was not yet updated in the memorandum.
in finding the statement immaterial,the district court also extended the bespeaks caution doctrine to statements of fact,despite the lack of approval from this circuit for such application of the doctrine as well as the explicit rejection of such an extension by two other circuits.see shaw digital equip,cir holding that the bespeaks caution doctrine does not apply to representations of present facts that were false when made harden raffensperger,hughes,cir similarly holding that the doctrine does not apply to misrepresentations of hard facts,but only to subjective or soft information.to date,this circuit has only applied the doctrine to statements,such as estimates of future performance or economic projections.see gray first winthrop,cir acknowledging that the bespeaks caution rule is not applicable to misrepresentations of historical facts,but refusing to find that a district court clearly erred when considering the doctrine when the contested historical facts formed the basis of projections about future profitability see also pslra c,c expressly codifying the bespeaks caution doctrine for statements.we now expressly adopt the logic of the first and seventh circuits and hold that extension of the bespeaks caution doctrine to statements of historical fact is inappropriate.see also worlds of wonder,at a n overbroad application of the bespeaks caution doctrine would encourage management to conceal deliberate misrepresentations beneath the mantle of broad cautionary language.quoting in re worlds of wonder sec.accordingly,we hold that the district court erred in concluding that the contested statement was immaterial.
this circuit has interpreted the pslra heightened pleading standard as requiring plaintiff to plead,in great detail,facts that constitute strong circumstantial evidence of deliberately reckless or conscious misconduct.in re silicon graphics.sec,cir.t o show a strong inference of deliberate recklessness,plaintiffs must state facts that come closer to demonstrating intent,as opposed to mere motive and opportunity to commit fraud.id.when determining whether plaintiffs have sufficiently plead scienter,we must consider whether the total of plaintiffs allegations,even though individually lacking,are sufficient to create a strong inference that defendants acted with deliberate or conscious recklessness.joint council,at citation omitted.in making this assessment,we consider all reasonable inferences,whether or not favorable to the plaintiff.gompper visx,cir.
livid alleges that the defendants,who purchased pci stock on the same terms as uae,were fully aware that the initial stock sale had not been completed.nonetheless,defendants wrote and attached the notice statement,which at best omitted crucial information about the prior sale terms and status,and at worst was an intentional attempt to trick potential investors into believing that the sale had been completed and the cash had been received by pci but was simply not incorporated into the previously written memorandum.the district court,however,believed that the defendants lacked the requisite mental state because if they had intended to mislead investors,they would have made the misrepresentation more explicit.we disagree.there are few ways to make the misrepresentation more explicit as it states as fact that the initial stock offering has been completed,but that the attached memorandum had not been updated to reflect this alleged fact.if defendants intention was to warn potential investors that the memorandum was not current and to make no statement on whether or not the sale was successfully concluded,the defendants could have conveyed this warning in a much clearer way.for example,had the sentence read the document does not reflect any capital that may have been generated by the private equity,it would not imply that the million effort had been successfully completed and that pci had received these funds,but the memorandum did not yet reflect this fact.
because livid alleges that the defendants knew the contested statement most obvious interpretation was false when made,livid has met the heightened pleading standard for s
