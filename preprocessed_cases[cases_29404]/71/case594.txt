the reverend david partington,sued defendants,including the charterhouse group,charterhouse,and appellees for selling unregistered securities in violation of section of the securities act of,codified at.partington sued individually and for the benefit of the reverend david partington rabbi trust the partington trust,and also sought to represent a class of similarly situated individuals.after almost two years of litigation,the district court granted summary judgment against partington because he lacked standing under section,and also denied class certification.appellants,who include other ministers,lay persons,and churches,moved for permissive intervention,filing in several groups both before and after the dismissal of partington claims.the district court denied appellants motions,concluding that the statute of limitations had run on their claims.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the judgment of the district court in all respects.
partington,a presbyterian minister,wished to save for his retirement.consequently,he entered into a deferred compensation plan with his church,shallowford presbyterian church shallowford,pursuant to which,as a general matter,shallowford agreed to fund a rabbi for partington by diverting a portion of his salary into the trust,and to direct the trust to pay benefits to partington or his beneficiaries upon his retirement or death.shallowford,in turn,entered into a grantor trust agreement the partington trust with charterhouse,which provided trustee services for rabbi trusts.in this agreement,charterhouse agreed to act as trustee over the funds that shallowford contributed to the trust,in order to provide shallowford with a source of funds to assist it in the meeting of its liabilities to partington.
partington claims that,in,one ray levy approached charterhouse and induced it to purchase viatical insurance as investments for the trusts charterhouse administered,promising returns.clients of charterhouse apparently invested more than one million dollars in these viatical contracts it invested more than in funds from the partington trust.the viatical contracts were purchased from financial federated title trust finfed using a broker controlled by levy.in late,partington received notice that the entire investment from his trust in the viatical contracts was lost.all in all,of the million dollars nationwide that was given to finfed for the purpose of purchasing viaticals,only about six million dollars was actually so used.
allegedly,levy also persuaded charterhouse to advise its clients to purchase senior notes from defendant capital funding,a company levy controlled,which notes purported to fund capital loans to companies.partington claims that charterhouse used over in funds from the partington trust to purchase such a note from capital,and that charterhouse defendants persuaded numerous other ministers to invest in these notes.he asserts that members of his proposed class purchased over seven million dollars of these notes.capital is now in bankruptcy,and has refused partington requests for payment on the note.partington claims the investments made for the benefit of the partington trust all were made after consultation with and direction from him,without any input from his church.
subsequently,partington moved his ministry to westminster presbyterian church westminster.shallowford assigned its rights in the trust to westminster as part of that agreement,westminster,unsurprisingly,replaced charterhouse with centura bank as trustee.
on february,partington filed suit against and appellees,which included charterhouse,capital,and other entities,as well as several individuals partington labels charterhouse agents.after an extensive procedural history,the district court finally granted summary judgment against partington on february,renewing,on its own motion,motions to dismiss,and reinterpreting them as motions for summary judgment.the court concluded that partington was not the legal beneficiary of the partington trust,and thus could not be considered the person purchasing the alleged securities,as is required to maintain his federal securities claim.the court also denied class certification,primarily because partington failure to state a claim meant he could not adequately represent anyone who did.given its conclusion as to the only federal claim in the case,the court dismissed partington state law claims for lack of jurisdiction.partington moved for reconsideration of this order on march,but that motion was denied.
additional parties moved for permissive intervention on four different occasions over the course of the litigation,in each case seeking to intervene individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated.two groups of persons sought intervention prior to dismissal of the case,but the court did not act on their motions before dismissal.after the case was dismissed and reconsideration denied,two other groups of persons and churches filed motions for permissive intervention.the district court held a hearing and,on may,denied all motions for intervention.the court reasoned that appellants claims were not entitled to equitable tolling because appellants were not within the class partington was seeking to have certified over the course of the litigation,and thus the statute of limitations had run on all of appellants claims.along with appellants,partington appeals from the district court orders granting summary judgment and denying class certification,denying reconsideration,and denying the motions for intervention.
partington first claims that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against him on the basis that he lacked standing to sue for the alleged sales of unregistered securities.reviewing this determination de novo and construing the evidence in the light most favorable to partington,see anderson liberty lobby,d,we conclude that the district court decision was correct.accordingly,we hold that partington lacks standing under section,both in his individual capacity and for the benefit of the partington trust,to recover against appellees.
section provides,in relevant part,that a ny person who offers or sells a security in violation of section of this title shall be liable to the person purchasing such security from him emphasis added.as did the district court,we will assume,without deciding,that the notes and viaticals were securities for the purpose of section.appellees do not contest that these securities were sold without the registration required by section.nevertheless,under the plain language of section,partington can not recover unless he is a person purchasing such securit ies as defined in this provision.
there is no allegation that partington himself actually purchased these securities.to the contrary,charterhouse,as trustee,purchased the viatical contracts and the note for the benefit of the partington trust.instead,partington theory below was that he was the beneficiary of the partington trust,and since funds from that trust were used to purchase the securities for the benefit of that trust,he should be considered a person purchasing those securities.the district court,however,concluded that,even assuming that an equitable beneficiary can be a purchaser for the purpose of section,partington was not the trust beneficiary in a legal sense,conclusion partington deems hypertechnical.opening br.of appellant at.
we recognize that other courts have,with respect to section b of the securities exchange act of and rule,accorded a flexible construction to the determination of who is a purchaser or seller to avoid taking a technical,unrealistic view of what happened in a case.grubb federal deposit ins,cir see also norris wirtz,cir holding that beneficiary of trust from which executors sold securities had standing under section b and rule we need not decide,however,whether trust beneficiaries can be person s purchasing under section,because the district court correctly concluded that,even if this were true,partington was not a beneficiary of the partington trust.
in reaching this conclusion,we look to the terms of the original trust agreement,which is the version in place at the time of the relevant purchases.the trust agreement is by and between shallowford and charterhouse alone,and its stated purpose is to provide shallowford with a source of funds to assist it in meeting its obligations to partington.and most importantly,the trust agreement explicitly disavows any beneficial interest in the trust by partington.the trust agreement specifies that plan participants,partington and their beneficiaries shall have no preferred claim on,or any beneficial ownership interest in,any assets of the trust.d emphasis added if that were not clear enough,the agreement goes on to define the rights partington retains under both the trust agreement and the deferred compensation plan as follows any rights created under the plan s and this trust agreement shall be mere unsecured contractual rights of plan participants,partington against the congregation,shallowford.id.emphasis added.that the trust proceeds were to be paid directly to partington rather than to shallowford appears to be,in light of the above,no more than a matter of expediency,and does not enlarge partington rights beyond these limitations.
partington dismisses these trust provisions as mere legal disclaimers,opening br.of appellant at,without appreciating that they disclaim his status as a beneficiary of this trust.that said,it is unsurprising that partington has apparently retreated from the position he took below,contending at oral argument,for example,that while westminster as successor to shallowford was the de jure beneficiary of the partington trust,he was the trust de facto beneficiary,and thus he should still be considered a person purchasing.to justify this label,he contends that it was his funds that were used to purchase the investments,it was he who made the decisions to invest in the viaticals and note,and it is he alone that feels the loss of assets in the partington trust.
even when viewed through this lens,however,partington is not a person purchasing.we first note that at the time of the purchases,the money used to make these investments was not partington,but instead belonged to the trust and was subject in its entirety to the claims of shallowford creditors.but to the extent the factors partington mentions are relevant at all to whether he is a person purchasing,the dominant one must be the assertion that he made the relevant investment decisions.
we conclude that partington did not,however,actually make these decisions because he had no control over trust investments.the trust agreement specifies,under the heading investment authority,that a ll rights associated with assets of the trust shall be exercised by trustee or the person designated by trustee,and shall in no event be exercisable by or rest with plan participants.partington lack of legal authority in this regard is important because,whether we label him a de facto beneficiary his terms or simply a plan participant the trust agreement terms,partington still must be a person purchasing under section in order to prevail.although the lack of investment authority may not be dispositive in the determination of who is a person purchasing,we must conclude that partington,a person who did not actually make the relevant purchases,who did not own the funds used for the purchases,who was not a beneficiary of the trust for which the purchases were made,and who lacked any authority to control the purchasing decisions,is not a person purchasing under section.that in this case charterhouse chose,in the exercise of its investment authority,to consult partington on these decisions and follow his direction,does not alter our conclusion.rather,and as the district court concluded,the actual person purchasing for the transactions from which partington alleges injury is likely centura bank as successor trustee to charterhouse or westminster as successor beneficiary to shallowford.
as might be expected,the cases cited by partington lend no support to his position,and at least one case militates directly against it.for example,partington relies on the seventh circuit decision in norris,a section b and rule case which involved a plaintiff who was beneficiary of a testamentary residuary trust to be funded by the assets remaining after the closing of her father estate.at.allegedly,the trustees had fraudulently induced the plaintiff to authorize a particular securities transaction involving the sale of estate assets to companies controlled by the trustees.id.in holding that the plaintiff stated a cause of action under section b and rule,the court reasoned that b ecause we believe plaintiff approval was required under the will,plaintiff fits within the contours of the birnbaum rule requiring a plaintiff bringing an action for securities fraud under those provisions to be an actual purchaser or seller.id.at.emphasis added.thus,norris turned on the very investment authority that partington lacks,and suggests only why partington is not,in his individual capacity,a person purchasing.
partington has also failed to establish that he has standing to sue for the benefit of the partington trust.the case cited by partington that is most favorable to him on this issue appears to be brink dalesio,cir,which stated the general rule that a beneficiary or one suing on his behalf can maintain a suit against the trustee to enforce the trust or to enjoin or obtain redress for a breach of trust.id.at.even if a section claim under these circumstances can be construed as one to enforce the trust or respecting a breach thereof,brink would suggest that this claim would lie,if at all,with westminster,the equitable beneficiary,or one suing on westminster behalf.partington has not demonstrated that he has standing to assert such a claim absent the court acceptance of westminster ratification of his action.see infra at.
we turn next to appellants argument that the district court erred in denying their motions for permissive intervention because the court concluded that appellants were not members of the class partington sought to certify,and thus their claims were not entitled to equitable tolling.this assertion of error requires us to decide whether,and to what extent,evidence outside of the complaint can be used to construe a definition of a plaintiff asserted class that is more narrow than what the complaint alone would dictate for the purposes of determining a party entitlement to tolling.we conclude that consideration of such evidence is proper,and that under the facts here,the district court did not err in adopting a more narrow definition of partington asserted class and,accordingly,denying the motions for intervention.
in concluding that appellants were not members of the class partington sought to certify,the court first examined partington complaint,which defined a class consist ing of persons on behalf of whom charterhouse its agents purchased viatical settlements notes,emphasis added.the court reasoned that the on behalf of whom language suggested that the class was to consist of trust beneficiaries,not direct purchasers.while conceding the uncertainty of this determination,the court explained that its decision was clarified by the fact that the plaintiff attorneys represented to the court that the plaintiff sought to represent a class of members of the clergy on behalf of whom charterhouse created administered a rabbi trust.id.quoting plaintiff memorandum in support of motion for class certification.thus,the court concluded,at least as of june of the month that motion was filed,the asserted class consisted of preachers whom the plaintiff mistakenly thought were the legal beneficiaries of the rabbi trusts their churches had established.id.emphasis added.
the court then added that the parties proceed for two years on the assumption that this was an action in which preachers having a relationship to a rabbi trust were the plaintiffs,not churches and other plaintiffs as well.in light of these facts,the court concluded that appellants were not members of the asserted class,and thus their claims were not entitled to equitable tolling.given that the statute of limitations for appellants federal securities claims was one year,the court concluded that those claims,even if once viable,were now.while expressing genuine sympathy for the ministers involved,the court denied permissive intervention.
typically,a decision to deny permissive intervention under rule b lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.hill western,cir.but the denial of permissive intervention because a party claim was not entitled to equitable tolling,and thus was barred by the statute of limitations,is not necessarily the exercise of discretion.see american pipe const.utah,d holding that a district court decision that attempted intervenors claims were not entitled to tolling,and thus were absolutely barred by the statute of limitations,was a conclusion of law.instead,to the extent a challenge to the denial of tolling is not to the existence of certain facts,but instead rests on whether those facts demonstrate a failure to bring a timely claim,resolution of this challenge turns on questions of law which are reviewed de novo.franks ross,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.accordingly,even in the context of motions for permissive intervention,w e have plenary review of the district court choice and interpretation of applicable tolling principles and its conclusion that the facts did not give rise to a tolling of the statute of limitations.nelson county of allegheny,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,as to all circumstances other than where the relevant facts are undisputed and the district court denied equitable tolling as a matter of law,we review the denial of tolling below for abuse of discretion.rouse lee,cir en banc stating that abuse of discretion is our standard of review for tolling decisions i n the context.
in american pipe,the supreme court held that,at least in certain circumstances,the commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action.at.emphasis added.thus,even though a plaintiff desired class has been denied certification,parties who were putative members of that class may file timely motions for intervention after that denial and be eligible to have the statute of limitations tolled on their claims for the period between the initiation of the original suit and the denial of class certification.see crown,cork seal,parker,d.although american pipe holding was limited to the denial of class certification for failure to show the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,at,the crown,cork seal court appears to have untethered this tolling rule from any necessary connection to the reasons for denying certification.see at applying american pipe tolling rule without qualification as to the grounds for denial of class certification.and of particular relevance here,we have held that persons who were members of the named plaintiff asserted class as to a certain type of claim were entitled to tolling on claims of that type even when the named plaintiff himself was not such a member.see lilly supermarket,cir.we therefore see no reason in this case to say that partington lack of a viable federal claim prevents those appellants who are members of his asserted class,and who might have viable individual claims,from obtaining the benefit of tolling.but those appellants first must have been members of the class partington sought to have certified.see in re syntex.securities litigation,cir denying equitable tolling to the claims of plaintiffs who were not asserted class members,but instead wanted to expand the class in order to become class members.
accordingly,the first question we must decide is whether the district court correctly construed partington asserted class to include only ministers on behalf of whom charterhouse created administered rabbi trusts.as to this point,appellants argue that the district court incorrectly defined the class more narrowly than the complaint requires,implicitly assigning error to the district court use of the narrow class definition asserted by partington when moving for class certification.of course,we need not examine whether the district court abused its discretion as to its factual conclusions about the arguments made and positions taken by partington after filing his complaint until we decide whether we can look beyond the complaint at all.
admittedly,we usually look to the complaint to determine the scope of a plaintiff asserted class for tolling purposes.see,davis bethlehem steel,cir it is,of course,in the lane complaint where we search for notice to bethlehem and the unions sufficient to invoke american pipe tolling.as for the complaint here,its class definition,which included persons on behalf of whom charterhouse its agents purchased the contracts or notes,would encompass those attempted intervenors who were rabbi trust beneficiaries,churches like westminster who funded the trusts,and arguably those who were direct purchasers,ministers who purchased securities outside of the rabbi trust context with the assistance or advice of charterhouse or its agents,depending perhaps on how the transactions were carried out.liberally construed,it might also include those who were rabbi trust plan participants like partington,and thus,at best,de facto beneficiaries of any purchases by charterhouse.so were we to rely on the complaint alone,we would likely conclude that the district court was at least partially in error in defining partington asserted class.
we are not,however,confined to examine only the complaint in determining the scope of the class partington sought to certify.the scope of a plaintiff asserted class for tolling purposes is that class for which there was fair notice as to both the substantive claims and the number and generic identities of the potential plaintiffs that might participate in the judgment if the plaintiff desired class was,in fact,certified.davis,at.in performing this analysis,we can consider evidence outside of the complaint that demonstrates the extent of the class the plaintiff represented to the district court that he desired to have when the complaint itself is unclear.see mccarthy kleindienst,in determining for tolling purposes whether the function of the statute of limitations has been served,it may be necessary to go beyond the facts of the complaint.
indeed,the tenth circuit has held that where plaintiffs move for class certification by unambiguously asserting a class definition more narrow than that required by their complaint,their asserted class for tolling purposes is that more narrow definition.see sawtell du pont de nemours and,cir.in sawtell,plaintiffs in minnesota filed three separate class actions involving product liability claims against du pont.although the original complaints did not limit the class to consumers from any particular state,when the minnesota plaintiffs moved for class certification a month later,they asked for a class of those who received the interpositional implant in minnesota at that point,the narrowness of the class definitions was clear.id.at emphasis added.the court reasoned that sawtell,who both resided and had her implants installed in new mexico,was outside of the class the minnesota plaintiffs sought to certify,and thus would not have been a party to the minnesota suits had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action.id.
we believe that the sawtell court employed the correct rule,and conclude that when a plaintiff moves for class certification by asserting an unambiguous definition of his desired class that is more narrow than is arguably dictated by his complaint,his asserted class for tolling purposes may be limited to that more narrow definition.it then follows that for parties outside that asserted class,tolling will be unavailable at least until such time as the plaintiff repudiates that definition of the class he seeks to have certified in a manner that provides adequate notice that his class definition has changed.
applying this rule to the instant case,if the district court did not abuse its discretion as to its conclusions about the arguments partington made during his motion fo
