background 
james tagliaferri founded taurus advisory group in as a boutique investment advisory firm located in stamford,connecticut.in late,he relocated the firm to the virgin islands and renamed it tag virgin islands,also called tag vi.at this time,tagliaferri personally had primary investment authority over the vast majority of the managed assets of the firm,which totaled around million among client accounts.
starting in,tagliaferri began engaging in three categories of conduct that formed the bases of his convictions first,in what the government terms the kickback conduct,tagliaferri began investing his clients assets with a long island company,international equine acquisition holdings ieah,that owned and managed racehorses.in return for these investments,ieah paid tagliaferri more than million in fees,often calculated as a percentage of the client funds invested in ieah securities.tagliaferri did not disclose the existence of these payments to his clients a nondisclosure both contrary to tag vi compliance policy and contradictory to a regulatory disclosure statement filed with the securities and exchange commission sec,in which tagliaferri denied receiving any economic benefit from in connection with client advice.later,tagliaferri attempted to recharacterize these transactions he sent letters to his clients disclosing the fees but describing them as consulting fees for advice rendered to ieah,sent invoices to ieah listing financial or consulting services,and asked an ieah employee to alter ieah records to indicate the fees were consulting expenses instead of investment banking fees.tagliaferri also engaged in similar fee arrangements with two brothers,jason and jared galanis,in which he received referral fees not disclosed to his clients for investments in companies affiliated with the brothers and then issued invoices describing the payments as advising fees.
second,in what the government terms the conduct,tagliaferri purchased securities from one client account with another client assets,sometimes generating fees for himself as described above.tagliaferri would sometimes sell a client poorly performing investments to another client,without disclosing to either client that they were engaged in a also a violation of tag vi compliance policy.in one instance,tagliaferri told a client that an overdue note was in escrow and then arranged a series of transactions to generate the funds to repay the note obligation.
third,in what the government terms the fake note conduct,tagliaferri invested over million in a company called national digital medical archive nmda.despite its initial characterization as an equity investment,tagliaferri described it as a loan when clients inquired,later attempting to get nmda to agree the investment had been a loan.he then created a number of fictitious,which he deposited into the client accounts,notwithstanding that there was no loan agreement or master note promising repayment of the investment.he repeatedly mischaracterized the investments to his clients and,eventually,engaged in as described above to pay off clients who demanded payment on the fictitious.
the government arrested and indicted tagliaferri in february and,in a superseding indictment the following year,charged him with investment adviser fraud,securities fraud,wire fraud,and multiple violations of the travel act.at trial,the defense case primarily rested on tagliaferri testimony about how he made his investment decisions and his characterizations of the fees received.he acknowledged that the fees posed a conflict of interest and should have been disclosed to his clients but argued that each investment made was based on his good faith belief that it was in the clients best interests.while also admitting that the fictitious were improper,he maintained that he had always believed that he would be able to work things out so that his clients would not be harmed.appellant br.
at the charging conference,defense counsel argued to the district court that section of the act required proof not only of intent to deceive but also of intent to harm.the government disagreed,arguing that scienter in the context of securities fraud under section b of the securities exchange act of the act requires only an intent to deceive,not to harm,and the act is so analogous as to employ the same standard.the district court accepted the government arguments and made the following charge with respect to intent to defraud under the act 
t he government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant devised or participated in the alleged device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,or engaged in the allegedly fraudulent transaction,practice,or course of business,knowingly,willfully,and with the specific intent to defraud.
knowingly means to act voluntarily and deliberately,rather than mistakenly or inadvertently.
willfully means to act knowingly and purposely,with an intent to do something the law forbids,that is to say,with bad purpose either to disobey or to disregard the law.the defendant need not have known that he was breaking any particular law or any particular statute.a defendant need only have been aware of the generally unlawful nature of his act.intent to defraud in the context of the securities laws means to act knowingly and with the intent to deceive.
g ood faith,as i will define that term,on the part of a defendant is a complete defense to a charge of investment adviser fraud.
in considering whether or not a defendant acted in good faith,however,you are instructed that a belief by the defendant,if such belief existed,that ultimately everything would work out so that no investors would lose any money or that particular investments would ultimately be financially advantageous for clients does not necessarily constitute good faith.no amount of honest belief on the part of a defendant that the scheme will ultimately make a profit for the investors will excuse fraudulent actions or false representations by him.
during deliberations,the jury requested clarification on what the phrase with the specific intent to defraud meant in the context of investment adviser and securities fraud.the judge responded by directing their attention to the language of the jury charge that,in the context of investment adviser fraud,specific intent to defraud means to act knowingly and with intent to deceive.
ultimately,the jury convicted tagliaferri on twelve of the fourteen counts,including the count charging investment adviser fraud.under the applicable sentencing guidelines,tagliaferri faced a recommended sentence of to months incarceration the district court entered a judgment sentencing him to months.
